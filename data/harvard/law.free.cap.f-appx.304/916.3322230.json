Kevin Castel, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b943-8\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Richard Vallee appeals from his conviction, following a jury trial, of using an explosive to destroy a vehicle used in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i), and murdering Lee Carter to prevent communication of information to a federal law enforcement officer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(a)(1)(C). On April 14, 2008, 2008 WL 1744561, the district court sentenced Vallee to life imprisonment on each count. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">1. <em>The Canadian prosecutor\u2019s testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">Vallee challenges as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial the admission of testimony by a Canadian prosecutor that she told Vallee\u2019s trial counsel that Carter was the sole witness against Vallee in a Canadian drug prosecution. The testimony was offered to prove Vallee\u2019s motive to murder Carter. We review a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under a deferential abuse of discretion standard, reversing only when we conclude that the challenged evidentiary rulings were arbitrary and irrational. <em>See United States v. Quinones, </em>511 F.3d 289, 307-08 (2d Cir.2007). We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">First, the testimony at issue was not hearsay because it was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather as evidence of Vallee\u2019s state of mind. Fed.R.Evid. 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">Second, the evidence was relevant because it had a tendency to make the existence of a fact \u2014 whether Vallee knew that Carter was an important witness against him \u2014 \u201cmore probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. We have explained that \u201cevidence regarding the knowledge of individuals other than the defendant should be admitted only if there is some other evidence in the record\u2014 concerning, for example, ... the relationship of the parties \u2014 from which to conclude that the defendant would have the same knowledge.\u201d <em>United States v. Kaplan, </em>490 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir.2007). Here, there was evidence of a relationship which would permit the jury to infer the transmittal of the information: the attorney-client relationship of Vallee and his trial counsel. Moreover, Vallee admitted to Canadian law enforcement officials: \u201cyou know what happened to Carter, I blew him up; he didn\u2019t come to testify; and the other two won\u2019t come to testify either.\u201d Vallee\u2019s admission to killing Carter is evidence that would permit the jury to infer that Vallee knew Carter was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>important witness against him, and that he acquired such knowledge from his counsel. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 104(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Finally, the district court also did not abuse its discretion in declining to exclude this testimony on the ground that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Fed.R.Evid. 403. Unfair prejudice \u201cdoes not mean the damage to the opponent\u2019s case that results from the legitimate probative force of the evidence; rather, it refers to the unfair advantage that results from the capacity of the evidence to persuade by illegitimate means.\u201d 22 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 5215 at 274-75 (1978). Although the Canadian prosecutor\u2019s testimony was damaging to Vallee\u2019s defense insofar as it suggested a motive for the alleged crimes, its probative value depended upon a reasonable inference regarding attorney-client communications, instead of upon an \u201cillegitimate emotional appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">2. <em>Carter\u2019s out-of-court statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Vallee argues that the admission of Carter\u2019s identification of him, as well as the admission of Carter\u2019s notes of a meeting with Vallee in Quebec, violated Vallee\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S. Const. amend. VI. The evidence was admitted under the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rule and Confrontation Clause upon a finding that the prosecution had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Vallee intentionally killed Carter to prevent him from testifying in the Canadian prosecution. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(6). In <em>Giles v. California, - </em>U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008), the Supreme Court held that the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrine applies \u201conly when the defendant engaged in conduct <em>designed </em>to prevent the witness from testifying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2683 (emphasis in original). This Circuit\u2019s precedent at the time of trial was not to the contrary. <em>See United States v. Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d 635, 653-54 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Vallee argues that after <em>Giles, </em>the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrine ought to apply only in the proceeding from which it was the defendant\u2019s purpose to procure the witness\u2019s absence. Vallee urges this Court to overrule our cases which hold that \u201c[a] defendant who wrongfully and intentionally renders a declarant unavailable as a witness in any proceeding forfeits the right to exclude ... the declarant\u2019s statements at that proceeding <em>and any subsequent proceeding. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>485 F.3d 666, 672 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). <em>Giles </em>does not cast doubt on this controlling precedent and therefore we decline to overrule it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Consub </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number><em>Delaware LLC v. Schahin Engenharia Limitada, </em>543 F.3d 104, 109 (2d Cir.2008). Thus, because the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Vallee intended to, and did, procure Carter\u2019s absence as a witness in the Canadian prosecution, the court did not err in admitting Carter\u2019s out-of-court statements against Vallee in his subsequent prosecution for the murder of Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">3. <em>The Canadian law enforcement officials\u2019 testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">At trial, Agent Trudel testified that Val-lee admitted to killing Carter during an interrogation by Agents Trudel and Morin in Canada:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-7\">I began by introducing myself, and Mr. Morin did the same thing.... I informed [Vallee] that he was under arrest for the murder of Lee Carter; that he had the right to be silent; that he could contact a lawyer. He replied that he had just spoken to a lawyer. I then mentioned to him that there were two individuals who were talking against him with regards to several murders and murder conspiracies, one of them being the murder of Lee Carter.... And he answered me, you know what happened to Carter, I blew him up; he didn\u2019t come to testify; and the other two won\u2019t come to testify either.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">We find no abuse of discretion in admitting this testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">First, Vallee concedes that his admission, \u201cyou know what happened to Carter, I blew him up; he didn\u2019t come to testify,\u201d was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Second, Vallee\u2019s statement, \u201cthe other two won\u2019t come to testify either,\u201d was properly admitted as proof of the charged crime. Vallee\u2019s use of the word \u201ceither\u201d clearly referred to Carter. Thus, his statement that \u201cthe other two won\u2019t come to testify either\u201d was not admitted to prove that Vallee had a propensity for killing or threatening potential witnesses. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(a). Rather, the statement \u201cconstituted important proof of the charged crime[ ]\u201d and was admissible without regard to Rule 404 because it was \u201cpart of the very act charged, or, at least, proof of that act.\u201d <em>Quinones, </em>511 F.3d at 309 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">Finally, Agent Trudel\u2019s statement that \u201cthere were two individuals who were talking against him with regards to several murders and murder conspiracies\u201d was properly admitted for the purpose of providing the context necessary to understand Vallee\u2019s statements. Vallee\u2019s statement that \u201cthe other two won\u2019t come to testify either\u201d would have been unintelligible without also admitting Trudel\u2019s statement, which provided the context necessary to understand to whom \u201cthe other two\u201d referred. <em>See United States v. Sorrentino, </em>72 F.3d 294, 298 (2d Cir.1995). Furthermore, Vallee\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that Vallee\u2019s alleged admission (\u201cI blew him up\u201d) was not credible and should not be believed. Given this argument, it was particularly important to provide the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>with the entire context of the conversation, which revealed that Vallee was boasting about having killed Carter. Thus, because this statement was offered, not as proof of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts,\u201d but rather as part of the proof of Vallee\u2019s admission to the crime for which he was charged, Rule 404(b) was not implicated. Given the substantial probative value of Vallee\u2019s admission, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in declining to exclude the testimony under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Vallee argues that the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, required the exclusion of Agents Trudel\u2019s and Morin\u2019s testimony because \u201cquick notes\u201d taken by Morin during their interrogation of Vallee were discarded after Morin used those notes to compile an official report of the interrogation. Trudel and Morin were Canadian agents who questioned Vallee in Canada, and \u2014 as noted by the district court \u2014 \u201c[tjhere is no evidence that American officials controlled, directed, participated in or were, in any way, involved with the Canadian authorities in the ... questioning.\u201d Nor was there evidence that American officials asked Canadian officials to arrest Vallee. \u201cThe Government is not under an obligation to produce prior statements of foreign law enforcement officials that it does not possess.\u201d <em>United States v. Yousef, </em>327 F.3d 56, 129 (2d Cir.2003). But \u201c \u2018even in the course of a joint investigation undertaken by United States and foreign law enforcement officials the most the Jencks Act requires of United States officials is a good-faith effort to obtain the statements of prosecution witnesses in the possession of the foreign government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Paternina-Vergara, </em>749 F.2d 993, 998 (2d Cir.1984)). There is no basis for concluding that the government failed to make the requisite good-faith effort in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, this claim is rejected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">We have reviewed Vallee\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. We assume, without deciding, that these statements were \u2018\u2018testimonial\u201d and not admissible for any non-hearsay purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b944-8\">. The Confrontation Clause \"is most naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). It is unclear whether, at this country's founding, the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception applied to testimony initially collected for one proceeding but subsequently introduced at a second proceeding involving the same defendant but a different offense. <em>Compare Reynolds v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 158-59, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878) (holding, under \"long-established\u201d principles dating back to English common law, that \"if a witness is kept away by the adverse party, his testimony, taken on a former trial between the same parties upon the same issues, may be given in evidence\u201d), <em>with </em>John Pitt Taylor, A <em>Treatise on the Law of Evidence as Administered in England and Ireland </em>330 (9th ed. 1897) (\"if a witness be <em>kept out of the way </em>by the adversary, his former statements on oath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>will be admissible\u201d). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court\u2019s invitation in <em>Giles </em>to the state court to explore defendant\u2019s intent on remand, <em>Giles, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2693, suggests that the exception applies to statements introduced at the declarant\u2019s murder trial, provided, at least, that the defendant intended to prevent the witness from testifying at an earlier proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b945-14\">. Agent Trudel repeated his testimony about \u201ctwo separate murder cases\u201d and Agent Morin likewise testified that \"Mr. Trudel told Mr. Vallee that there were two people who were willing to testify for the conspiracies to murder and murders that Mr. Vallee would have committed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b945-15\">. Accordingly, we need not decide whether Vallee properly objected at trial and preserved this issue for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b946-5\">. Even if the agents had been American, it is unlikely that they would have been required to preserve handwritten notes that were incorporated into a formal report on the same day that the interview took place. <em>See United States v. Elusma, </em>849 F.2d 76, 79 (2d Cir. 1988); <em>see also United States v. Barlin, </em>686 F.2d 81, 92 (2d Cir.1982) (*\u2018[A]ppellants do not question that the notes were made part of the agent\u2019s formal report. That being the case, the notes need not have been preserved and their destruction violated no Jencks Act right.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b946-18\">. Vallee\u2019s argument that the admission of the agents\u2019 testimony, as well as that of the Canadian prosecutor, violated his due process rights is also without merit because the use of properly obtained and relevant statements that were more probative than prejudicial did not \"violate!] those fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions, and which define the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d <em>Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 353, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
