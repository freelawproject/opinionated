The court has determined that the issues presented no need for oral argument. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-27\">Appellant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud. On appeal, he argues the district court erred in sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant concedes \u201cthe sentencing court properly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>sidered the factor of sentencing disparity during Appellant\u2019s sentence,\u201d but argues \u201chis sentence was nonetheless unreasonable because the sentencing court abused its discretion in determining that [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a)(6) supported a sentence of 46 months imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">On appeal, \u201ca sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>516 F.3d 1047, 1050 (D.C.Cir.2008) (internal quotations omitted). Because we find no abuse of discretion even if we consider the co-conspirators sentenced after Appellant, we do not decide whether review for plain error would apply in this case. Section 3553(a)(6) requires a sentencing court to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Here, only one of Appellant\u2019s cited co-conspirators had the same criminal history category (Category II) as Appellant, and that co-conspirator did not participate in the same number of fraudulent transactions as Appellant, did not plead guilty to the same crime, nor did she receive comparable remuneration. Each of the other cited co-conspirators had a lower criminal history category. None of the cited co-conspirators contributed as much to the conspiracy\u2019s success, making Appellant\u2019s conduct particularly blameworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">In any event, \u00a7 3553(a)(6) is only one factor that a sentencing court considers. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 32 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that even if \u00a7 3553(a)(6) was applicable, \u201cthe requirement that a sentencing judge consider an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor is <em>not </em>synonymous with a requirement that the factor be given determinative or dispositive weight in the particular case, inasmuch as it is only one of several factors that must be weighed and balanced by the sentencing judge\u201d). Here, the district court expressed concern about \u201cprotecting the] community from Mr. Colwell in the future\u201d and noted Appellant failed to \u201cunderstand[] or acknowledge[ ]\u201d the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d The district court was required to balance <em>all </em>the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Thus, even assuming \u00a7 3553(a)(6) might have counseled in favor of a lesser sentence, other factors, such as the need \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), and the need to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), all supported a harsher sentence. We cannot say the court\u2019s balancing of these factors was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Appellant also argues the district court erred by withholding access to the co-conspirators\u2019 pre-sentence reports. However, there is a \u201cgeneral presumption that courts will not grant third parties access to the presentence reports of other individuals,\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>13 F.3d 860, 867 (5th Cir.1994), which presumption can be rebutted only by \u201ca compelling demonstration that disclosure of the report is required to meet the ends of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Charmer Indus., Inc., </em>711 F.2d 1164, 1175 (2d Cir. 1983). The sentencing transcripts and pre-sentencing memoranda gave Appellant access to the criminal history categories and offense levels of his co-conspirators. He also knew from the sentencing transcripts what information the district court deemed important. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (\u201c[T]he court, at the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>sons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d). The district court did not abuse its discretion by finding such materials to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">It is ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED. The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
