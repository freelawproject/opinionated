For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-26\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not repeat the procedural or factual history except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-27\">Eynon argues that it is entitled to the disputed escrow funds pursuant to its contract for sales commissions with the debt- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>or, Brockway Pressed Metals, Inc. According to Eynon, the disputed funds are impressed with either an express or constructive trust for that portion of Brock-way\u2019s receivables equal to the commissions Eynon earned on products that it sold and delivered to certain of Brock-way\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In a Memorandum Opinion dated March 30, 2007, Hon. Thomas P. Agresti, explained why Eynon had not established the existence of a trust. In affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying relief, the district court agreed that Eynon \u201cfailed to demonstrate two of the four required elements [of a trust] \u2014 intent to create a trust and the existence of an identifiable res.\u201d App. 6. The district court concluded that \u201cthe series of commission agreements between the parties do not constitute \u2018trust\u2019 documents.\u201d App. 7. The court rejected Eynon\u2019s reliance on <em>Williams v. Finlaw, Mueller &amp; Co., </em>292 Pa. 244, 141 A. 47 (1928), concluding, counsel was \u201cskating close to the bounds of their duty of candor ...,\u201d by misstating the holding of <em>Williams ...\u201d. </em>The bankruptcy court believed that <em>Williams </em>counseled against finding a trust had been created, and the district court concluded that \u201c[t]he Bankruptcy Court\u2019s analysis of <em>Williams, </em>was correct.\u201d App. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The district court also correctly affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s rejection of the theory of a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d because \u201cno unjust enrichment had occurred.\u201d <em>Id., </em>(citing <em>Yohe v. Yohe, </em>466 Pa. 405, 353 A.2d 417, 420-21 (1976)). Thus, establishing a trust over the disputed funds \u201cwould have the effect of giving Eynon preferential treatment in the bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d App. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We can add little to the thorough and thoughtful discussion of the bankruptcy court, or the district court\u2019s explanation of why the bankruptcy court properly rejected Eynon\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Accordingly, we will affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by the bankruptcy court and the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
