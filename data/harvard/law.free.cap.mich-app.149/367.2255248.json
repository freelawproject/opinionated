On December 4, 1981, the Cook County (Illinois) Circuit Court issued an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency against Security, vesting control of Security, its property, business and affairs, with the Director of the Illinois Insurance Department. Security appealed from the entry of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Defendant was served with the summons and complaint on December 10, 1981. Default was entered on January 28, 1982, two days after plaintiff received notice of the order of liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On December 13, 1982, the order of liquidation was affirmed by the Illinois Appellate Court. In February, 1983, the Illinois Insurance Department entered into an agreement with the MPCG which provided that if and when the order of liquidation became final, MPCG would pay all covered claims of Security policyholders pursuant to Michigan law. The order of liquidation was affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court on May 30, 1983. The Supreme Court\u2019s mandate was issued on June 21, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">On October 11, 1983, the trial court entered a judgment of default against defendant in the amount of $75,000, plus costs and interest. A writ of garnishment was issued on November 16, 1983, and served upon the MPCG. On December 20, 1983, defendant filed a motion to set aside the default judgment pursuant to GCR 1963, 520.4 and 528.3(4) and (6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>finding no extraordinary circumstances justifying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">GCR 1963, 520.4, now MCR 2.603(D), provides that a proceeding to set aside a default judgment shall be granted only if good cause is shown and an affidavit of facts showing a meritorious defense is filed. Since defendant failed to file an affidavit setting forth a meritorious defense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside the default judgment pursuant to rule 520.4. <em>Yenglin v Mazur, </em>121 Mich App 218; 328 NW2d 624 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">GCR 1963, 528.3, now MCR 2.612(C), allows relief from judgment under certain specific circumstances. In this case, defendant claims that he is entitled to relief from judgment under subsections (4) and (6), which allow relief where a judgment is void or relief is otherwise justified. Defendant claims that the default judgment is void because it was entered in violation of \u00a7 7945 of the Michigan Property and Casualty Guaranty Association Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\"All proceedings in any court of law of this state to which the insolvent insurer is a party, or in which the insurer is obligated to defend or has assumed the defense of a party, shall be stayed for 6 months after the date a receiver is appointed, and for any additional time as determined by the court which has jurisdiction over those proceedings, to permit proper defense of all pending causes of action.\u201d MCL 500.7945; MSA 24.17945.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Section 7945 applies only to an insolvent insurer, defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\"[A]n insurer: (i) for which a domiciliary receiver has been appointed by a final order in this state or in a reciprocal state * * * for the liquidation of the insurer; and (ii) which has been a member insurer. The date on which the order becomes final shall be the date on which the receiver is appointed for purposes of this chapter.\u201d MCL 500.7921(a); MSA 24.17921(a).[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">According to this statutory scheme, the six-month stay provision of \u00a7 7945 begins to run on the day upon which an order of liquidation becomes final. Plaintiff argues that the order of liquidation became final on December 4, 1981, the date it was issued. Under this analysis, the stay expired on June 4, 1982, and the default judgment entered 16 months later is valid. Defendant argues that the order did not become final until June 21, 1983. Under this analysis, the default judgment is void because it was entered during the six months following entry of the order. Thus, the determination of when the six-month stay provision was triggered depends upon a determination of when the order of liquidation appointing the receiver became final. We agree with defendant that, for purposes of the act, the order became final on June 21, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In interpreting the Property and Casualty Guaranty Association Act, we employ established principles of statutory construction governing insurance laws.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\"Since the insurance business is one affected with a public interest, laws applicable to insurance are to be liberally construed in favor of the policyholders, creditors and the general public. Statutes relative to insurance will be construed in the most beneficial way which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>their language will permit to prevent absurdity, hardship or injustice, to favor public convenience and to oppose all prejudice to public interests. The statute is to be given a reasonable construction looking to its purpose and the object it seeks to accomplish.\u201d <em>Allen v Michigan Property &amp; Casualty Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>129 Mich App 271, 274; 341 NW2d 500 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The Property and Casualty Guaranty Association Act was designed to protect insureds and persons with claims against insureds from potentially catastrophic loss in the event the insurer becomes insolvent. <em>Id. </em>\"Such persons have a right to rely on the existence of an insurance policy and are not likely to be in a position to evaluate the financial stability of the insurance company and have no control over the time at which their claims against the company may arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By creating the MPCG, the Legislature provided a means of paying and discharging obligations of insolvent insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Although the act was designed primarily to protect insureds and persons with claims against insureds, the act also protects the MPCG by affording it the same rights that the insolvent insurer would have had if not in receivership, including the right to appear, defend and appeal a claim. MCL 500.7931(2); MSA 24.17931(2). We believe that the purpose of \u00a7 7945 is to provide the MPCG, not the insurer, with sufficient time to prepare a proper defense. We do not believe that the MPCG can assume an insurer\u2019s rights until appellate review of a finding of insolvency and order of liquidation is exhausted. We recognize that finality of an order is generally equated with its applicability. However, for purposes of \u00a77945, we believe that an order of liquidation appointing a receiver does not become final until all possible appeals have been exhausted. An order of liquidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>which is not appealed is final as of the day it was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In the instant case, the Illinois order of liquidation appointing a receiver to take possession and control of Security did not become final until June 21, 1983, the date on which the Illinois Supreme Court issued its mandate denying Security\u2019s leave to appeal. On that date, the MPCG became responsible for Security\u2019s obligations and became entitled to a six-month stay of proceedings. The judgment of default was entered within the six-month period in violation of \u00a7 7945. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to set aside the judgment. GCR 1963, 528.3(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We do not, however, set aside the entry of default. Default was entered 17 months before Security became an insolvent insurer by final order of the Illinois courts. Security had notice of plaintiffs claim and was not denied the opportunity to properly defend. The remand of this case to the trial court does not necessarily entitle defendant to a trial on the merits. We merely set aside the judgment because it was not properly entered. Plaintiff is not precluded from again seeking default judgment since the six-month stay has expired and defendant did not seek an extension of the stay pursuant to \u00a7 7945.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Default judgment is set aside.
