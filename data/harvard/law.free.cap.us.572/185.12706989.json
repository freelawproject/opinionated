Citizens can exercise that right in a variety of ways: They can run for office themselves, vote, urge others to vote for a particular candidate, volunteer to work on a campaign, and contribute to a candidate's campaign. This case is about the last of those options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The right to participate in democracy through political contributions is protected by the First Amendment, but that right is not absolute. Our cases have held that Congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckley v.

At the same time, we have made clear that Congress may not regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of money in politics, or to restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative influence of others. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v.

Money in politics may at times seem repugnant to some, but so too does much of what the First Amendment vigorously protects. If the First Amendment protects flag burning, funeral protests, and Nazi parades-despite the profound offense such spectacles cause-it surely protects political campaign speech despite popular opposition.

The first, called base limits, restricts how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or committee. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(1). The second, called aggregate limits, restricts how much money a donor may contribute in total to all candidates or committees. \u00a7 441a(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This case does not involve any challenge to the base limits, which we have previously upheld as serving the permissible\n   objective of combatting corruption. The Government contends that the aggregate limits also serve that objective, by preventing circumvention of the base limits. We conclude, however, that the aggregate limits do little, if anything, to address that concern, while seriously restricting participation in the democratic process. The aggregate limits are therefore invalid under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the 2013-2014 election cycle, the base limits in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), permit an individual to contribute up to $2,600 per election to a candidate ($5,200 total for the primary and general elections); $32,400 per year to a national party committee;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   $10,000 per year to a state or local party committee; and $5,000 per year to a political action committee, or \"PAC.\" 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(1) ; 78 Fed.Reg. 8532 (2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A national committee, state or local party committee, or multicandidate PAC may in turn contribute up to $5,000 per election to a candidate. \u00a7 441a(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The base limits apply with equal force to contributions that are \"in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit\" to a candidate. \u00a7 441a(a)(8). If, for example, a donor gives money to a party committee but directs the party committee to pass the contribution along to a particular candidate, then the transaction is treated as a contribution from the original donor to the specified candidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the 2013-2014 election cycle, the aggregate limits in BCRA permit an individual to contribute a total of $48,600 to federal candidates and a total of $74,600 to other political committees. Of that $74,600, only $48,600 may be contributed to state or local party committees and PACs, as opposed to national party committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00a7 441a(a)(3) ; 78 Fed.Reg. 8532. All told, an individual may contribute up to $123,200 to candidate and noncandidate committees during each two-year election cycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The base limits thus restrict how much money a donor may contribute to any particular candidate or committee; the aggregate limits have the effect of restricting how many candidates or committees the donor may support, to the extent permitted by the base limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the 2011-2012 election cycle, appellant Shaun McCutcheon contributed a total of $33,088 to 16 different federal candidates, in compliance with the base limits applicable to each. He alleges that he wished to contribute $1,776 to each of 12 additional candidates but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate limit on contributions to candidates. McCutcheon also contributed a total of $27,328 to several noncandidate political committees, in compliance with the base limits applicable to each. He alleges that he wished to contribute to various other political committees, including $25,000 to each of the three Republican national party committees, but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate\n   limit on contributions to political committees. McCutcheon further alleges that he plans to make similar contributions in the future. In the 2013-2014 election cycle, he again wishes to contribute at least $60,000 to various candidates and $75,000 to non-candidate political committees. Brief for Appellant McCutcheon 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellant Republican National Committee is a national political party committee charged with the general management of the Republican Party. The RNC wishes to receive the contributions that McCutcheon and similarly situated individuals would like to make-contributions otherwise permissible under the base limits for national party committees but foreclosed by the aggregate limit on contributions to political committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In June 2012, McCutcheon and the RNC filed a complaint before a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. See BCRA \u00a7 403(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20113\">\n    116 Stat. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -114. McCutcheon and the RNC asserted that the aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and to noncandidate political committees were unconstitutional under the First Amendment. They moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the challenged provisions, and the Government moved to dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The three-judge District Court denied appellants' motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the Government's motion to dismiss. Assuming that the base limits appropriately served the Government's anticorruption interest, the District Court concluded that the aggregate limits survived First Amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278832\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/133/#p140\">\n    893 F.Supp.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In particular, the District Court imagined a hypothetical scenario that might occur in a world without aggregate limits.

The challengers argued that the base limit was fatally overbroad because most large donors do not seek improper influence over legislators' actions.

Rather, the donor may contribute only $5,000 to the committee, which hardly raises the specter of abuse that concerned the Court in\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    . Limits on contributions to political committees consequently create an additional hurdle for a donor who seeks both to channel a large amount of money to a particular candidate and to ensure that he gets the credit for doing so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The 1976 Amendments also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees. See\n    2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(5) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.5\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 100.5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(4). The Government acknowledges that this antiproliferation rule \"forecloses what would otherwise be a particularly easy and effective means of circumventing the limits on contributions to any particular political committee.\" Brief for Appellee 46. In effect, the rule eliminates a donor's ability to create and use his own political committees to direct funds in excess of the individual base limits.

Although the earmarking provision, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(8), was in place when\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    was decided, the FEC has since added regulations that define earmarking broadly. For example, the regulations construe earmarking to include any designation, \"whether direct or indirect, express or implied, oral or\n    written.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.6\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1). The regulations specify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate may not also contribute to a single-candidate committee for that candidate. \u00a7 110.1(h)(1). Nor may an individual who has contributed to a candidate also contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate, if the individual knows that \"a substantial portion [of his contribution] will be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,\" that candidate. \u00a7 110.1(h)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In addition to accounting for statutory and regulatory changes in the campaign finance arena, appellants' challenge raises distinct legal arguments that\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    did not consider. For example, presumably because of its cursory treatment of the $25,000 aggregate limit,\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    did not separately address an overbreadth challenge with respect to that provision. The Court rejected such a challenge to the\n    <em>\n     base\n    </em>\n    limits because of the difficulty of isolating suspect contributions. The propriety of large contributions to individual candidates turned on the subjective intent of donors, and the Court concluded that there was no way to tell which donors sought improper influence over legislators' actions.

An aggregate limit on\n    <em>\n     how many\n    </em>\n    candidates and committees an individual may support through contributions is not a \"modest restraint\" at all. The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    To put it in the simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits Congress views as adequate to protect against corruption. The individual may give up to $5,200 each to nine candidates, but the aggregate limits constitute an outright ban on further contributions to any other candidate (beyond the additional $1,800 that may be spent before reaching the $48,600 aggregate limit). At that point, the limits deny the individual all ability to exercise his expressive and associational rights by contributing to someone who will advocate for his policy preferences. A donor must limit the number of candidates he supports, and may have to choose which of several policy concerns he will advance-clear First\n    Amendment harms that the dissent never acknowledges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    It is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people. To require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special\n    burden on broader participation in the democratic process. And as we have recently admonished, the Government may not penalize an individual for \"robustly exercis[ing]\" his First Amendment rights.\n    <em>\n     Davis v.

When an individual contributes\n    to a candidate, a party committee, or a PAC, the individual must by law cede control over the funds. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(8) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.6\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Government admits that if the funds are subsequently re-routed to a particular candidate, such action occurs at the initial recipient's discretion-not the donor's. See Brief for Appellee 37. As a consequence, the chain of attribution grows longer, and any credit must be shared among the various actors along the way. For those reasons, the risk of\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    corruption is generally applicable only to \"the narrow category of money gifts that are directed, in some manner, to a candidate or officeholder.\"\n    <em>\n     McConnell,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p297\">\n     540 U.S., at 310\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p297\">\n     124 S.Ct. 619\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    nonetheless focused on the possibility that \"unearmarked contributions\" could eventually find their way to a candidate's coffers.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n     424 U.S., at 38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     96 S.Ct. 612\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

But each is sufficiently implausible that the Government has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the aggregate limits further its anticircumvention interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The primary example of circumvention, in one form or another, envisions an individual donor who contributes the maximum amount under the base limits to a particular candidate, say, Representative Smith. Then the donor also channels \"massive amounts of money\" to Smith through a series of contributions to PACs that have stated their intention to support Smith. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Brief for Appellee 35-37; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Various earmarking and antiproliferation rules disarm this example. Importantly, the donor may not contribute to the most obvious PACs: those that support only Smith. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(1) ; see also \u00a7 102.14(a).

When he does so, however, he discovers that his contribution will be significantly diluted by all the contributions from others to the same PACs. After all, the donor cannot give more than $5,000 to a PAC and so cannot dominate the PAC's total receipts, as he could when\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    was decided. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(1)(C). He cannot retain control over his contribution,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(3), direct his money \"in any way\" to Smith, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(8), or even\n    <em>\n     imply\n    </em>\n    that he would like his money to be recontributed to Smith,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.6\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1). His salience as a Smith supporter has been diminished, and with it the potential for corruption.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    It is not clear how many candidates a PAC must support before our dedicated donor can avoid being tagged with the impermissible knowledge that \"a substantial portion\" of his contribution will go to Smith. But imagine that the donor is one of ten equal donors to a PAC that gives the highest possible contribution to Smith.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    The PAC may give no more than $2,600 per election to Smith. Of that sum, just $260 will be attributable to the donor intent on circumventing the base limits. Thus far he has hardly succeeded in funneling \"massive amounts of money\" to Smith.\n    <em>\n     Buckley, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 38,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     96 S.Ct. 612\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    But what if this donor does the same thing via, say, 100 different PACs? His $260 contribution will balloon to $26,000, ten times what he may contribute directly to Smith in any given election.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    This 100-PAC scenario is highly implausible. In the first instance, it is not true that the individual donor will necessarily have access to a sufficient number of PACs to effectuate such a scheme. There are many PACs, but they are not limitless. For the 2012 election cycle, the FEC reported about 2,700 nonconnected PACs (excluding PACs that finance independent expenditures only). And not every PAC that supports Smith will work in this scheme: For our donor's pro rata share of a PAC's contribution to Smith to remain meaningful, the PAC must be funded by only a small handful of donors. The antiproliferation rules, which were not in effect\n    when\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    was decided, prohibit our donor from creating 100 pro-Smith PACs of his own, or collaborating with the nine other donors to do so. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(5) (\"all contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled by ... any other person, or by any group of such persons, shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Moreover, if 100 PACs were to contribute to Smith and few other candidates, and if specific individuals like our ardent Smith supporter were to contribute to each, the FEC could weigh those \"circumstantial factors\" to determine whether to deem the PACs affiliated.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.5\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 100.5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(4)(ii). The FEC's analysis could take account of a \"common or overlapping membership\" and \"similar patterns of contributions or contributors,\" among other considerations. \u00a7\u00a7 100.5(g)(4)(ii)(D), (J). The FEC has in the past initiated enforcement proceedings against contributors with such suspicious patterns of PAC donations. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Conciliation Agreement,\n    <em>\n     In re Riley,\n    </em>\n    Matters Under Review 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (FEC, Dec. 19, 2001).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    On a more basic level, it is hard to believe that a rational actor would engage in such machinations. In the example described, a dedicated donor spent $500,000-donating the full $5,000 to 100 different PACs-to add just $26,000 to\n    Smith's campaign coffers. That same donor, meanwhile, could have spent unlimited funds on independent expenditures on behalf of Smith.

As the District Court crafted the example, a donor gives a $500,000 check to a joint fundraising committee composed of a candidate, a national party committee, and \"most of the party's state party committees\" (actually, 47 of the 50).\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278832\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/133/#p140\">\n     893 F.Supp.2d, at 140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The committees divide up the money so that each one receives the maximum contribution permissible under the base limits, but then each transfers its allocated portion to the same single\n    committee. That committee uses the money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate. If that scenario\n    \"seem[s] unlikely,\" the District Court thought so, too.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278832\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/133/#p140\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But because the District Court could \"imagine\" that chain of events, it held that the example substantiated the Government's circumvention concerns.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278832\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/133/#p140\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    One problem, however, is that the District Court's speculation relies on illegal earmarking. Lest there be any confusion, a joint fundraising committee is simply a mechanism for individual committees to raise funds collectively, not to circumvent base limits or earmarking rules. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102.17\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 102.17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(5). Under no circumstances may a contribution to a joint fundraising committee result in an allocation that exceeds the contribution limits applicable to its constituent parts; the committee is in fact required to return any excess funds to the contributor. See \u00a7 102.17(c)(6)(i).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The District Court assumed compliance with the specific allocation rules governing joint fundraising committees, but it expressly based its example on the premise that the donor would telegraph his desire to support one candidate and that \"many separate entities would willingly serve as conduits for a single contributor's interests.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278832\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/133/#p140\">\n     893 F.Supp.2d, at 140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Regardless whether so many distinct entities would cooperate as a practical matter, the earmarking provision prohibits an individual from directing funds \"through an intermediary or conduit\" to a particular candidate. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(8). Even the \"implicit[ ]\" agreement imagined by the District Court,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278832\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/133/#p140\">\n     893 F.Supp.2d, at 140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , would trigger the earmarking provision. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.6\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1). So this circumvention scenario could not succeed without assuming that nearly 50 separate party committees would engage in a transparent violation of the earmarking rules (and that they would not be caught if they did).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Moreover, the District Court failed to acknowledge that its $500,000 example cannot apply to most candidates. It crafted the example around a presidential candidate, for\n    whom donations in the thousands of dollars may not seem remarkable-especially in comparison to the nearly $1.4 billion spent by the 2012 presidential candidates. The same example cannot, however, be extrapolated to most House and Senate candidates. Like contributions, coordinated expenditures are limited by statute, with different limits based on the State and the office. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(d)(3). The 2013 coordinated expenditure limit for most House races is $46,600, well below the $500,000 in coordinated expenditures envisioned by the District Court. The limit for Senate races varies significantly based on state population. See 78 Fed.Reg. 8531 (2013). A scheme of the magnitude imagined by the District Court would be possible even in theory for\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    House candidates and the Senate candidates from just the 12 most populous States.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.6\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Further, to the extent that the law does not foreclose the scenario described by the District Court, experience and common sense do. The Government provides no reason to believe that many state parties would willingly participate in a scheme to funnel money to another State's candidates. A review of FEC data of Republican and Democratic state party committees for the 2012 election cycle reveals just 12 total instances in which a state party committee contributed to a House or Senate candidate in another State. No surprise there. The Iowa Democratic Party, for example, has little reason to transfer money to the California Democratic Party, especially when the Iowa Democratic Party would be barred for the remainder of the election cycle from receiving another contribution for its own activities from the particular donor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    These scenarios, along with others that have been suggested, are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or divorced from reality. The three examples posed by the dissent are no exception. The dissent does not explain how the large sums it postulates can be legally rerouted to a particular candidate, why most state committees would\n    participate in a plan to redirect their donations to a candidate in another State, or how a donor or group of donors can avoid regulations prohibiting contributions to a committee \"with the knowledge that a substantial portion\" of the contribution will support a candidate to whom the donor has already contributed,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The dissent argues that such knowledge may be difficult to prove, pointing to eight FEC cases that did not proceed because of insufficient evidence of a donor's incriminating knowledge. See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1477 - 1478. It might be that such guilty knowledge could not be shown because the donors were not guilty-a possibility that the dissent does not entertain. In any event, the donors described in those eight cases were typically alleged to have exceeded the base limits by $5,000 or less. The FEC's failure to find the requisite knowledge in those cases hardly means that the agency will be equally powerless to prevent a scheme in which a donor routes\n    <em>\n     millions of dollars\n    </em>\n    in excess of the base limits to a particular candidate, as in the dissent's \"Example Two.\" And if an FEC official cannot establish knowledge of circumvention (or establish affiliation) when the same ten donors contribute $10,000 each to 200 newly created PACs, and each PAC writes a $10,000 check to the same ten candidates-the dissent's \"Example Three\"-then that official has not a heart but a head of stone. See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1474 - 1475, 1477 - 1478.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The dissent concludes by citing three briefs for the proposition that, even with the aggregate limits in place, individuals \"have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates\" in excess of the base limits.\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1478. But the cited sources do not provide any real-world examples of circumvention of the base limits along the lines of the various hypotheticals. The dearth of FEC prosecutions, according to the dissent, proves only that people are getting away with it. And the violations that surely must be out there elude detection \"because in the real world, the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    than the hypothetical examples.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This sort of speculation, however, cannot justify the substantial intrusion on First Amendment rights at issue in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    upheld aggregate limits only on the ground that they prevented channeling money to candidates beyond the base limits.

In particular, each national political party's spending ran in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), however, spent less than $1 million each on direct candidate contributions and less than $10 million each on coordinated expenditures. Brief for NRSC et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    23, 25 (NRSC Brief). Including both coordinated expenditures and direct candidate contributions, the NRSC and DSCC spent just 7% of their total funds on contributions to candidates and the NRCC and DCCC spent just 3%.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Likewise, as explained previously, state parties rarely contribute to candidates in other States. In the 2012 election cycle, the Republican and Democratic state party committees in all 50 States (and the District of Columbia) contributed a paltry $17,750 to House and Senate candidates in other States.

Authorized candidate committees may support other candidates up to a $2,000 base limit.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20432\">\n     2 U.S.C. \u00a7 432\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(3)(B).

The most that any one individual candidate received from all other candidates was around $100,000. Brief for Appellee 39. The fact is that candidates who receive campaign contributions spend most of the money on themselves, rather than passing along donations to other\n    candidates.

The Government has not given us any reason to believe that parties or candidates would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted. Absent such a showing, we cannot conclude that the sweeping aggregate limits are appropriately tailored to guard against any contributions that might implicate the Government's anticircumvention interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    A final point: It is worth keeping in mind that the\n    <em>\n     base limits\n    </em>\n    themselves are a prophylactic measure.

There are currently no such limits on transfers among party committees and from candidates to party committees. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(4) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20113.2\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 113.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c). Perhaps for that reason, a central concern of the District Court, the Government, multiple\n    <em>\n     amici curiae,\n    </em>\n    and the dissent has been the ability of party committees to transfer money freely. If Congress agrees that this is problematic, it might tighten its permissive transfer rules. Doing so would impose a lesser burden on First Amendment rights, as compared to aggregate limits that flatly ban contributions beyond certain levels. And while the Government has not conceded that transfer restrictions would be a perfect substitute for the aggregate limits, it has recognized that they would mitigate the risk of circumvention. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    One possible option for restricting transfers would be to require contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts and\n    spent only by their recipients. Such a solution would address the same circumvention possibilities as the current aggregate limits, while not completely barring contributions beyond the aggregate levels. In addition (or as an alternative), if Congress believes that circumvention is especially likely to occur through creation of a joint fundraising\n    committee, it could require that funds received through those committees be spent by their recipients (or perhaps it could simply limit the size of joint fundraising committees). Such alternatives to the aggregate limits properly refocus the inquiry on the delinquent actor: the recipient of a contribution within the base limits, who then routes the money in a manner that undermines those limits.

See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441i(b). So-called \"Levin funds\" are donations permissible under state law that may be spent on certain federal election activity-namely, voter registration and identification, get-out-the-vote efforts, or generic campaign activities.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30, 50-52. The Government argued that there is an opportunity for corruption whenever a large check is\n    given to a legislator, even if the check consists of contributions within the base limits to be appropriately divided among numerous candidates and committees. The aggregate limits, the argument goes, ensure that the check amount does not become too large. That new rationale for the aggregate limits-embraced by the dissent, see\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1472 - 1474 -does not wash. It dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    corruption articulated in our prior cases, and targets as corruption the general, broad-based support of a political party.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    In analyzing the base limits,\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    made clear that the risk of corruption arises when an individual makes large contributions to the candidate or officeholder himself.

We have no occasion to consider a law that would specifically ban candidates from soliciting donations-within the base limits-that would go to many other candidates, and would add up to a large sum.

As Edmund Burke explained in his famous speech to the electors of Bristol, a representative owes constituents the exercise of his \"mature judgment,\" but judgment informed by \"the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    The Speeches of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke 129-130 (J. Burke ed. 1867). Constituents have the right to support candidates who share their views and concerns.

Such responsiveness is key to the very concept of self-governance through elected officials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The Government has a strong interest, no less critical to our democratic system, in combatting corruption and its appearance.

First, the plurality says that given the base limits on contributions to candidates and political committees, aggregate limits do not further any independent\n    governmental objective worthy of protection.

In making this argument, the plurality relies heavily upon a narrow definition of \"corruption\" that excludes efforts to obtain \" 'influence over or access to' elected officials or political parties.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299544\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/480/#p497\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Citizens United, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 359,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p360\">\n     130 S.Ct. 876\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ); accord,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1450 - 1451, 1452 - 1456.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Second, the plurality assesses the instrumental objective of the aggregate limits, namely, safeguarding the base limits. It finds that they \"do not serve that function in any meaningful way.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1452. That is because, even without the aggregate limits, the possibilities for circumventing the base limits are \"implausible\" and \"divorced from reality.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1452 - 1453, 1453 - 1454, 1455 - 1456.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Third, the plurality says the aggregate limits are not a \" 'reasonable' \" policy tool. Rather, they are \"poorly tailored to the Government's interest in preventing circumvention of the base limits.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1456 - 1457 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y. v.

The plurality imagines several alternative regulations that it says might just as effectively thwart circumvention. Accordingly, it finds, the aggregate caps are out of \" 'proportion to the [anticorruption] interest served.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1456 - 1457 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Fox,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216467\" index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/469/#p480\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216467\" index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/469/#p480\">\n     at 480\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216467\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/469/#p480\">\n     109 S.Ct. 3028\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The plurality's first claim-that large aggregate contributions do not \"give rise\" to \"corruption\"-is plausible only because the plurality defines \"corruption\" too narrowly. The plurality describes the constitutionally permissible objective of campaign finance regulation as follows: \"Congress may target only a specific type of corruption-\n    <em>\n     'quid pro quo'\n    </em>\n    corruption.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1450 - 1451. It then defines\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    corruption to mean no more than \"a direct exchange of an official act for money\"-an act akin to bribery.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1441 - 1442. It adds specifically that corruption does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    include efforts to \"garner 'influence over or access to' elected officials or political parties.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1450 - 1451 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Citizens United, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 359,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p360\">\n     130 S.Ct. 876\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). Moreover, the Government's efforts to prevent the \"appearance of corruption\" are \"equally confined to the appearance of\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    corruption,\" as narrowly defined.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1450 - 1451. In the plurality's view, a federal statute could not prevent an individual from writing a million dollar check to a political party (by donating to its various committees), because the rationale for any limit would \"dangerously broade[n] the circumscribed definition of\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    corruption articulated in our prior cases.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1460.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    This critically important definition of \"corruption\" is inconsistent with the Court's prior case law (with the possible exception of\n    <em>\n     Citizens United,\n    </em>\n    as I will explain below). It is virtually impossible to reconcile with this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     McConnell,\n    </em>\n    upholding the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA). And it misunderstands the constitutional importance of the interests at stake. In fact, constitutional interests-indeed, First Amendment interests-lie on both sides of the legal equation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    In reality, as the history of campaign finance reform shows and as our earlier cases on the subject have recognized, the\n    anticorruption interest that drives Congress to regulate campaign contributions is\n    a far broader, more important interest than the plurality acknowledges. It is an interest in maintaining the integrity of our public governmental institutions. And it is an interest rooted in the Constitution and in the First Amendment itself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Consider at least one reason why the First Amendment protects political speech. Speech does not exist in a vacuum. Rather, political communication seeks to secure government action. A politically oriented \"marketplace of ideas\" seeks to form a public opinion that can and will influence elected representatives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    This is not a new idea.

Chief Justice Hughes reiterated the same idea shortly thereafter: \"A fundamental principle of our constitutional system\" is the \"maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion\n    <em>\n     to the end\n    </em>\n    that government may be responsive to the will of the people.\"\n    <em>\n     Stromberg v.

Rousseau, An Inquiry Into the Nature of the Social Contract 265-266 (transl. 1791).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The Framers responded to this criticism both by requiring frequent elections to federal office, and by enacting a First Amendment that would facilitate a \"chain of communication\n    between the people, and those, to whom they have committed the exercise of the powers of government.\" J. Wilson, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States of America 30-31 (1792). This \"chain\" would establish the necessary \"communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments\" between the people and their representatives, so that public opinion could be channeled into effective governmental action. The Federalist No. 57, p. 386 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison); accord, T. Benton, 1 Abridgement of the Debates of Congress, from 1789 to 1856, p. 141 (1857) (explaining that the First Amendment will strengthen American democracy by giving \" 'the people' \" a right to \" 'publicly address their representatives,' \" \" 'privately advise them,' \" or \" 'declare their sentiments by petition to the whole body' \" (quoting James Madison)). Accordingly, the First Amendment advances not only the individual's right to engage in political speech, but also the public's interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech\n    <em>\n     matters\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    What has this to do with corruption? It has everything to do with corruption. Corruption breaks the constitutionally necessary \"chain of communication\" between the people and their representatives. It derails the essential speech-to-government-action tie. Where enough money calls the tune, the general public will not be heard. Insofar as corruption cuts the link between political thought and political action, a free marketplace of political ideas loses its point. That is one reason why the Court has stressed the constitutional importance of Congress' concern that a few large donations not drown out the voices of\n    the many.

Rather, they are interests rooted in the First Amendment itself. They are rooted in the constitutional effort to create a democracy responsive to the people-a government where laws reflect the very thoughts, views, ideas, and sentiments, the expression of which the First Amendment protects. Given that end, we can and should understand campaign finance laws as resting upon a broader and more significant constitutional rationale than the plurality's limited definition of \"corruption\" suggests. We should see these laws as seeking in significant part to strengthen, rather than weaken, the First Amendment. To say this is not to deny the potential for\n    conflict between (1) the need to permit contributions that pay for the diffusion of ideas, and (2) the need to limit payments in order to help maintain the integrity of the electoral process. But that conflict takes place within, not outside, the First Amendment's boundaries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    Since the kinds of corruption that can destroy the link between public opinion and governmental action extend well beyond those the plurality describes, the plurality's notion of corruption is flatly inconsistent with the basic constitutional rationale I have just described. Thus, it should surprise no one that this Court's case law (\n    <em>\n     Citizens United\n    </em>\n    excepted) insists upon a considerably broader definition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Buckley,\n    </em>\n    for instance, the Court said explicitly that aggregate limits were constitutional because they helped \"prevent evasion ...

Moreover,\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    upheld the base limits in significant part because they helped thwart \"the\n    appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse\n    <em>\n     inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n     424 U.S., at 27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     96 S.Ct. 612\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

Read as the plurality reads them today, the statements from\n    <em>\n     Citizens United\n    </em>\n    about the proper contours of the corruption rationale conflict not just with language in the\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    opinion, but with\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    's very holding. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1469 - 1470. Did the Court in\n    <em>\n     Citizens United\n    </em>\n    intend to overrule\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    ? I doubt it, for if it did, the Court or certainly the dissent would have said something about it. The total silence of all opinions in\n    <em>\n     Citizens United\n    </em>\n    with respect to this matter argues strongly in favor of treating the language quoted above as dictum, as an overstatement, or as limited to the context in which it appears.\n    <em>\n     Citizens United\n    </em>\n    itself contains language that supports the last mentioned reading, for it says that \"[\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    ] did not\n    extend this rationale [about the reality or appearance of corruption] to\n    <em>\n     independent\n    </em>\n    expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p360\">\n     558 U.S., at 357\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p360\">\n     130 S.Ct. 876\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

That use does not come accompanied with a limiting context (independent expenditures by corporations and unions) or limiting language. It applies to the whole of campaign finance regulation. And, as I have pointed out, it is flatly inconsistent with the broader definition of corruption upon which\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    's holding depends.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    So: Does the Court intend today to overrule\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    ? Or does it intend to leave\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    and BCRA in place? The plurality says the latter.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1451, n. 6 (\"Our holding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits clearly does not overrule\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    's holding about 'soft money' \"). But how does the plurality explain its rejection of the broader definition of corruption, upon which\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    's holding depends? Compare\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1450 - 1452, with\n    <em>\n     McConnell,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p297\">\n     540 U.S., at 146, 149-153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p297\">\n     124 S.Ct. 619\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The plurality invalidates the aggregate contribution limits for a second reason. It believes they are no longer needed to prevent contributors from circumventing federal limits on direct contributions to individuals, political parties, and political action committees.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1452 - 1456.

Accordingly, the plurality concludes, the aggregate limits provide no added benefit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    The plurality is wrong. Here, as in\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    , in the absence of limits on aggregate political contributions, donors can and likely will find ways to channel millions of dollars to parties and to individual candidates, producing precisely the kind of \"corruption\" or \"appearance of corruption\" that previously led the Court to hold aggregate limits constitutional. Those opportunities for circumvention will also produce the type of corruption that concerns the plurality today. The methods for using today's opinion to evade the law's individual contribution limits are complex, but they are well known, or will become well known, to party fundraisers. I shall describe three.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    <em>\n     Example One: Gifts for the Benefit of the Party\n    </em>\n    . Campaign finance law permits each individual to give $64,800 over two years to a national party committee. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(1)(B) ; 78 Fed.Reg. 8532 (2013). The two major political parties each have three national committees.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1442, n. 1. Federal law also entitles an individual to give $20,000 to a state party committee over two years. \u00a7 441a(a)(1)(D). Each major political party has 50 such committees. Those individual limits mean that, in the absence of any aggregate limit, an individual could legally give to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party about $1.2 million over two years. See Appendix B, Table 1,\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1485. To make it easier for contributors to give gifts of this size, each party could create a \"Joint Party Committee,\" comprising all of its national and state party committees. The titular heads could be the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the House. A contributor could then write a single check to the Joint Party Committee-and its staff would divide the funds so that each\n    constituent unit receives no more than it could obtain from the contributor directly ($64,800 for a national committee over two years, $20,000 for a state committee over the same). Before today's decision, the total size of Rich Donor's check to the Joint Party Committee was capped at $74,600-the aggregate limit for donations to political parties over a 2-year election cycle. See \u00a7 441a(a)(3)(B) ; 78 Fed.Reg. 8532. After today's decision, Rich Donor can write a single check to the Joint Party Committee in an amount of about $1.2 million.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    Will political parties seek these large checks? Why not? The recipient national and state committees can spend the money to buy generic party advertisements, say television commercials or bumper stickers saying \"Support Republicans,\" \"Support Democrats,\" or the like. They also can transfer the money to party committees in battleground States to increase the chances of winning hotly contested seats. See \u00a7 441a(a)(4) (permitting national or state political committees to make unlimited \"transfers\" to other committees \"of the same political party\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    Will party officials and candidates solicit these large contributions from wealthy donors? Absolutely. Such contributions will help increase the party's power, as well as the candidate's standing among his colleagues.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Will elected officials be particularly grateful to the large donor, feeling obliged to provide him special access and influence, and perhaps even a\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    legislative favor? That is what we have\n    previously believed. See\n    <em>\n     McConnell,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p297\">\n     540 U.S., at 182\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p297\">\n     124 S.Ct. 619\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Large soft-money donations at a candidate's or officeholder's behest give rise to all of the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to the candidate or officeholder\");\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., at 308,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p297\">\n     124 S.Ct. 619\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)

And, as the statements collected in Appendix A,\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    make clear, we have believed this with good reason.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    <em>\n     Example Two: Donations to Individual Candidates (The $3.6 Million Check)\n    </em>\n    . The first example significantly\n    <em>\n     understates\n    </em>\n    the problem. That is because federal election law also allows a single contributor to give $5,200 to each party candidate over a 2-year election cycle (assuming the candidate is running in both a primary and a general election). \u00a7 441a(a)(1)(A) ; 78 Fed.Reg. 8532. There are 435 party candidates for House seats and 33 party candidates for Senate seats in any given election year. That makes an additional $2.4 million in allowable contributions. Thus, without an aggregate limit, the law will permit a wealthy individual to write a check, over a 2-year election cycle, for $3.6 million-all to benefit his political party and its candidates. See Appendix B, Table 2(a),\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1485.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    To make it easier for a wealthy donor to make a contribution of this size, the parties can simply enlarge the composition of the Joint Party Committee described in\n    <em>\n     Example One,\n    </em>\n    so that it now includes party candidates. And a party can proliferate such joint entities, perhaps calling the first the \"Smith Victory Committee,\" the second the \"Jones Victory Committee,\" and the like. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102.17\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 102.17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(5) (2012). (I say \"perhaps\" because too transparent a name might call into play certain earmarking rules. But the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) database of joint fundraising committees in 2012 shows similarly named entities,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    \"Landrieu Wyden Victory Fund,\" etc.).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    As I have just said, without any aggregate limit, the law will allow Rich Donor to write a single check to, say, the Smith Victory Committee, for up to $3.6 million. This check represents \"the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants\" in the Committee over a\n    2-year cycle. \u00a7 102.17(c)(5). The Committee would operate under an agreement that provides a \"formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds\" among its constituent units. \u00a7 102.17(c)(1). And that \"formula\" would divide the proceeds so that no committee or candidate receives more than it could have received from Rich Donor directly-$64,800, $20,000, or $5,200. See \u00a7 102.17(c)(6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    So what is wrong with that? The check is considerably larger than\n    <em>\n     Example One\n    </em>\n    's check. But is there anything else wrong? The answer is yes, absolutely. The law will also permit a party and its candidates to shift most of Rich Donor's contributions to a\n    <em>\n     single\n    </em>\n    candidate, say Smith. Here is how:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    The law permits each candidate and each party committee in the Smith Victory Committee to write Candidate Smith a check directly. For his primary and general elections combined, they can write checks of up to $4,000 (from each candidate's authorized campaign committee) and $10,000 (from each state and national committee).\n    <extracted-citation index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20432\">\n     2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 432\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(3)(B),\n    441a(a)(2)(A) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.3\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). This yields a potential $1,872,000 (from candidates) plus $530,000 (from party committees). Thus, the law permits the candidates and party entities to redirect $2.37 million of Rich Donor's $3.6 million check to Candidate Smith. It also permits state and national committees to contribute to Smith's general election campaign through making coordinated expenditures-in amounts that range from $46,600 to $2.68 million for a general election (depending upon the size of Smith's State and whether he is running for a House or Senate seat). 78 Fed.Reg. 8530-8532. See Appendix B, Table 2(b),\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1486.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    The upshot is that Candidate Smith can receive at least $2.37 million and possibly the full $3.6 million contributed by Rich Donor to the Smith Victory Committee, even though the funds must first be divided up among the constituent units before they can be rerouted to Smith. Nothing requires\n    the Smith Victory Committee to explain in advance to Rich Donor all of the various transfers that will take place, and nothing prevents the entities in the Committee from informing the donor and the receiving candidate after the fact what has transpired. Accordingly, the money can be donated and rerouted to Candidate Smith without the donor having violated the base limits or any other FEC regulation. And the evidence in the\n    <em>\n     McConnell\n    </em>\n    record reprinted in Appendix A,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    -with respect to soft money contributions-makes clear that Candidate Smith will almost certainly come to learn from whom he has received this money.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The parties can apply the same procedure to other large donations, channeling money from Rich Donor Two to Candidate Jones. If 10 or 20 candidates face particularly tight races, party committees and party candidates may work together to channel Rich Donor One's multimillion dollar contribution to the Most Embattled Candidate (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Candidate Smith), Rich Donor Two's multimillion dollar contribution to the Second Most Embattled Candidate (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Candidate Jones), and so on down the line. If this does not count as evasion of the base limits, what does? Present aggregate limits confine the size of any individual gift to $123,200. Today's opinion creates a loophole measured in the millions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    <em>\n     Example Three: Proliferating Political Action Committees (PACs)\n    </em>\n    . Campaign finance law prohibits an individual from contributing (1) more than $5,200 to any candidate in a federal election cycle, and (2) more than $5,000 to a PAC in a calendar year. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(1)(A), (C) ; 78 Fed.Reg. 8532. It also prohibits (3) any PAC from contributing more than $10,000 to any candidate in an election cycle. \u00a7 441(a)(2)(A). But the law does not prohibit an individual from contributing (within the current $123,200 biannual aggregate limit) $5,000 to each of an unlimited total number of PACs. And there, so to speak, lies the rub.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    Here is how, without any aggregate limits, a party will be able to channel $2 million from each of ten Rich Donors to each\n    of ten Embattled Candidates. Groups of party supporters-individuals, corporations, or trade unions-create 200 PACs. Each PAC claims it will use the funds it raises to support several candidates from the party, though it will favor those who are most endangered. (Each PAC qualifies for \"multicandidate\" status because it has received contributions from more than 50 persons and has made contributions to five federal candidates at some point previously. \u00a7 441a (a)(4) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.5\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 100.5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(3) ). Over a 2-year election cycle, Rich Donor One gives $10,000 to each PAC ($5,000 per year)-yielding $2 million total. Rich Donor 2 does the same.\n    So, too, do the other eight Rich Donors. This brings their total donations to $20 million, disbursed among the 200 PACs. Each PAC will have collected $100,000, and each can use its money to write ten checks of $10,000-to each of the ten most Embattled Candidates in the party (over two years). See Appendix B, Table 3,\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1487. Every Embattled Candidate, receiving a $10,000 check from 200 PACs, will have collected $2 million.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    The upshot is that ten Rich Donors will have contributed $2 million each, and ten Embattled Candidates will have collected $2 million each. In this example, unlike\n    <em>\n     Example Two,\n    </em>\n    the recipient candidates may not know which of the ten Rich Donors is personally responsible for the $2 million he or she receives. But the recipient candidate is highly likely to know who the ten Rich Donors are, and to feel appropriately grateful. Moreover, the ability of a small group of donors to contribute this kind of money to threatened candidates is not insignificant. In the example above-with ten Rich Donors giving $2 million each, and ten Embattled Candidates receiving $2 million each-the contributions would have been enough to finance a considerable portion of, and perhaps all of, the candidates' races in the 2012 elections. See Appendix C, Table 1,\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1488 (showing that in 2012, the average winning House candidate spent $1.6 million and the average winning Senate candidate spent $11.5 million).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    The plurality believes that the three scenarios I have just depicted either pose no threat, or cannot or will not take place. It does not believe the scenario depicted in\n    <em>\n     Example One\n    </em>\n    is any cause for concern, because it involves only \"general, broad-based support of a political party.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1460 - 1461. Not so. A candidate who solicits a multimillion dollar check for his party will be deeply grateful to the checkwriter, and surely could reward him with a\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    favor. The plurality discounts the scenarios depicted in\n    <em>\n     Example Two\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Example Three\n    </em>\n    because it finds such circumvention tactics \"illegal under current campaign finance laws,\" \" implausible,\" or \"divorced from reality.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1452 - 1453, 1453 - 1454, 1455 - 1456. But they are not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    The plurality's view depends in large part upon its claim that since this Court decided\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    in 1976, changes in either statutory law or in applicable regulations have come to make it difficult, if not impossible, for these circumvention scenarios to arise. Hence, it concludes, there is no longer a need for aggregate contribution limits. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1446 - 1447, 1452 - 1456. But a closer examination of the five legal changes to which the plurality points makes clear that those changes cannot effectively stop the abuses that I have depicted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    First, the plurality points out that in 1976 (a few months after this Court decided\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    ) Congress \"added limits on contributions\n    <em>\n     to\n    </em>\n    political committees,\"\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    to PACs.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1446; accord,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Stat.%20487\">\n     90 Stat. 487\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(1)(C) ). But\n    <em>\n     Example Three,\n    </em>\n    the here-relevant example, takes account of those limits, namely, $5,000 to a PAC in any given year. And it shows that the per-PAC limit does not matter much when it comes to the potential for circumvention, as long as party supporters can create dozens or hundreds of PACs. Federal law places no upper limit on the number of PACs supporting a party or a group of party candidates that can be established. And creating a PAC is primarily\n    a matter of paperwork, a knowledgeable staff person, and a little time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    Second, the plurality points out that in 1976, Congress \"also added an antiproliferation\n    rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1446. The rule provides that \"all contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled\" by the same corporation, labor organization, person, or group of persons, \"shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee.\" \u00a7 441a(a)(5). But different supporters can create different PACs. Indeed, there were roughly 2,700 \"nonconnected\" PACs (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    PACs not connected to a specific corporation or labor union) operating during the 2012 elections.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1453 - 1454. In a future without aggregate contribution limits, far more nonconnected PACs will likely appear. The plurality also notes that the FEC can examine certain \" 'circumstantial factors,' \" such as \" 'common or overlapping membership' \" or \" 'similar patterns of contributions,' \" to determine whether a group of PACs are affiliated.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1454 (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.5\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 100.5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(4)(ii) ). But the ultimate question in the affiliation inquiry is whether \"one committee or organization [has] been established, financed, maintain or controlled by another committee or sponsoring organization.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.5\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Just because a group of multicandidate PACs all support the same party and all decide to donate funds to a group of endangered candidates in that party does not mean they will qualify as \"affiliated\" under the relevant definition. This rule appears inadequate to stop the sort of circumvention depicted in\n    <em>\n     Example Three\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    Third, the plurality says that a post-\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    regulation has strengthened the statute's earmarking provision.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1446 - 1447. Namely, the plurality points to a rule promulgated by the FEC in 1976, specifying that earmarking includes any \"designation 'whether direct or indirect, express or implied, oral or written.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.5\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.6\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) );\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    accord, 41 Fed.Reg. 35950 (1976). This means that if Rich Donor were to give $5,000 to a PAC while \"designat[ing]\" (in any way) that the money go to Candidate Smith, those funds must count towards Rich Donor's total allowable contributions to Smith-$5,200 per election cycle. But the virtually identical earmarking provision in effect when this Court decided\n    <em>\n     Buckley\n    </em>\n    would have required the same thing. That provision also counted, when applying the base contribution limits, \"all contributions made by a person, either directly or indirectly, on behalf of a particular candidate, including contributions which are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to a candidate.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Stat.%201264\">\n     88 Stat. 1264\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; accord, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a(a)(8) (same). What is the difference?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    Fourth, the plurality points out that the FEC's regulations \"specify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate committee may not also contribute to a\n    <em>\n     single-\n    </em>\n    candidate committee for that candidate.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1447 (citing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(1) ; emphasis added). The regulations, however, do not prevent a person who has contributed to a candidate from also contributing to\n    <em>\n     multi\n    </em>\n    candidate committees that support the candidate. Indeed, the rules specifically authorize such contributions. See \u00a7 110.1(h) (\"A person\n    <em>\n     may contribute\n    </em>\n    to a candidate ... and\n    <em>\n     also contribute\n    </em>\n    to a political committee which has supported, or anticipates supporting, the same candidate in the same election,\" as long as the political committee is \"not the candidate's principal campaign committee\" or a \"single candidate committee\" (emphasis added)).\n    <em>\n     Example Three\n    </em>\n    illustrates the latter kind of contribution. And briefs before us make clear that the possibility for circumventing the base limits through making such contributions is a realistic, not an illusory, one. See Brief\n    for Appellee 36 (demonstrating that many PACs today explain in their public materials just what fairly small group of candidates they intend to support); Brief for Americans for Campaign Reform as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    14-15 (similar).\n    Fifth, the plurality points to another FEC regulation (also added in 1976), which says that \"an individual who has contributed to a candidate\" may not \"also contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate if the individual knows that 'a substantial portion [of his contribution] will be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,' that candidate.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1447 (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(2) ; brackets in original); accord, 41 Fed.Reg. 35948. This regulation is important, for in principle, the FEC might use it to prevent the circumstances that\n    <em>\n     Examples Two\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Three\n    </em>\n    set forth from arising. And it is not surprising that the plurality relies upon the existence of this rule when it describes those circumstances as \"implausible,\" \"illegal,\" or \"divorced from reality.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1452 - 1453, 1453 - 1454, 1455 - 1456.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    In fact, however, this regulation is not the strong anti-circumvention weapon that the plurality imagines. Despite the plurality's assurances, it does not \"disarm\" the possibilities for circumvention.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1452 - 1453. That is because the regulation requires a showing that donors have \"\n    <em>\n     knowledge\n    </em>\n    that a substantial portion\n    <em>\n     \"\n    </em>\n    of their contributions will be used by a PAC to support a candidate to whom they have already contributed. \u00a7 110.1(h)(2) (emphasis added). And \"knowledge\" is hard to prove.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    I have found nine FEC cases decided since the year 2000 that refer to this regulation. In all but one, the FEC failed to find the requisite \"knowledge\"-despite the presence of\n    <em>\n     Example Two\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Example Three\n    </em>\n    circumstances. See Factual and Legal Analysis,\n    <em>\n     In re: Transfund PAC,\n    </em>\n    Matter Under Review (MUR) 6221, p. 11 (FEC, June 7, 2010) (although the donor \"might reasonably infer that some portion of his contribution\" to a candidate's Leadership PAC would be used to support the candidate, \"such an inference alone does not suggest that [he] had 'actual knowledge' \" of such); Factual and Legal Analysis,\n    <em>\n     In re: John Shadegg's Friends,\n    </em>\n    MUR 5968, pp. 3, 6-7 (FEC, Nov. 10, 2008) (\"[T]here is no basis on which to conclude that [the donors] knew that the\n    funds they contributed to LEAD PAC would be used to support the Shadegg Committee\" even though Congressman Shadegg solicited the donations and LEAD PAC was Congressman Shadegg's Leadership PAC); Factual and Legal Analysis,\n    <em>\n     In re: Walberg for Congress,\n    </em>\n    MUR 5881, pp. 6, 9-11 (FEC, Aug. 15, 2007) (finding seven contributors, who gave to a candidate and to a PAC that provided 86% of the candidate's financing, had not shown \"knowledge\"); Factual and Legal Analysis,\n    <em>\n     In re: Matt Brown for Senate,\n    </em>\n    MUR 5732, p. 11 (FEC, Apr. 4, 2007) (\"Though it may be reasonable to infer that the individual donors solicited by Brown gave to the State Parties under the assumption that some portion of their contribution might then be donated to the Brown Committee, such an inference alone is insufficient to find reason to believe\n    <extracted-citation index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h) has been violated\"); First General Counsel's Report,\n    <em>\n     In re: Liffrig for Senate,\n    </em>\n    MUR 5678, pp. 8-9 (FEC, Nov. 27, 2006) (similar); First General Counsel's Report,\n    <em>\n     In re: Nesbitt,\n    </em>\n    MUR 5445, pp. 11-12 (FEC, Feb. 2, 2005) (similar); First General Counsel's Report,\n    <em>\n     In re: Keystone Corp.,\n    </em>\n    MUR 5019, pp. 23-29 (FEC, Feb. 5, 2001) (similar); General Counsel's Report # 2,\n    <em>\n     In re: Boston Capital Corp.,\n    </em>\n    MUR 4538, pp. 17-18 (FEC, Mar. 10, 2000) (recommending the FEC take no action with respect to the\n    \u00a7 110.1(h) issue). Given this record of FEC (in)activity, my reaction to the plurality's reliance upon agency enforcement of this rule (as an adequate substitute for Congress' aggregate limits) is like Oscar Wilde's after reading Dickens' account of the death of Little Nell: \"One must have a heart of stone,\" said Wilde, \"to read [it] without laughing.\" Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations 86 (N. Sherrin 2d ed. 2001).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    I have found one contrary example-the single example to which the plurality refers.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1454 (citing Conciliation Agreement,\n    <em>\n     In reRiley,\n    </em>\n    MURs 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (FEC, Dec. 19, 2001)). In that case, the FEC found probable cause to believe that three individual contributors to several PACs\n    had the requisite \"knowledge\" that the PACs would use a \"substantial portion\" of their contributions to support a candidate to whom they had already contributed-Sam Brownback, a candidate for the Senate (for two of the contributors), and Robert Riley, a candidate for the House (for the third). The individuals had made donations to several PACs operating as a network, under the direction of a single political consulting firm. The two contributors to Sam Brownback were his parents-in-law, and the FEC believed they might be using the PAC network to channel extra support to him. The contributor to Robert Riley was his son, and the FEC believed he might be doing the same. The facts in this case are unusual, for individual contributors are not typically relatives of the candidates they are seeking to support, and ordinary PACs do not tend to work in coordination under the direction of a consulting firm. In any event, this single swallow cannot make the plurality's summer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    Thus, it is not surprising that throughout the many years this FEC regulation has been in effect, political parties and candidates have established ever more joint fundraising committees (numbering over 500 in the last federal elections); candidates have established ever more \"Leadership PACs\" (numbering over 450 in the last elections); and party supporters have established ever more multicandidate PACs (numbering over 3,000 in the last elections). See Appendix C, Tables 2-3,\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1488 - 1489; FEC, 2014 Committee Summary (reporting the number of \"qualified\" (or multicandidate) PACs in 2012), online at http://www.fec.gov/data/CommitteeSummary.do (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 28, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    Using these entities, candidates, parties, and party supporters can transfer and, we are told, have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates, thereby avoiding the base contribution limits in ways that\n    <em>\n     Examples Two\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Three\n    </em>\n    help demonstrate. See Brief for Appellee 38-39, 53-54; Brief for Campaign Legal Center, et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    12-15;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    Brief of Democratic Members of the United States House of Representatives as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    28-29. They have done so without drawing FEC prosecution-at least not according to my (and apparently the plurality's) search of publicly available records. That is likely because in the real world, the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex than our stylized\n    <em>\n     Examples Two\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Three\n    </em>\n    depict. And persons have used these entities to channel money to candidates without any individual breaching the current aggregate $123,200 limit. The plurality now removes that limit, thereby permitting wealthy donors to make aggregate contributions not of $123,200, but of several millions of dollars. If the FEC regulation has failed to plug a small hole, how can it possibly plug a large one?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    The plurality concludes that even if circumvention were a threat, the aggregate limits are \"poorly tailored\" to address it.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1456 - 1457. The First Amendment requires \" 'a fit that is ... reasonable,' \" and there is no such \"fit\" here because there are several alternative ways Congress could prevent evasion of the base limits.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"446\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Fox,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216467\" index=\"447\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/469/#p480\">\n     492 U.S., at 480\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216467\" index=\"448\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/469/#p480\">\n     109 S.Ct. 3028\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). For instance, the plurality posits, Congress (or the FEC) could \"tighten ... transfer rules\"; it could require \"contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients\"; it could define \"how many candidates a PAC must support in order to ensure that 'a substantial portion' of a donor's contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate\"; or it could prohibit \"donors who have contributed the current maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already contributed.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1459 (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20110.1\">\n     11 CFR \u00a7 110.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(2) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    The plurality, however, does not show, or try to show, that these hypothetical alternatives could effectively replace aggregate\n    contribution limits. Indeed, it does not even \"opine on the validity of any particular proposal,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1459 -presumably because these proposals themselves could be subject to constitutional challenges. For the most part, the alternatives the plurality mentions were similarly available at the time of\n    <em>\n     Buckley.\n    </em>\n    Their hypothetical presence did not prevent the Court from upholding aggregate limits in 1976. How can their continued hypothetical presence lead the plurality now to conclude that aggregate limits are \"poorly tailored?\" See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1456 - 1457.

Determining whether anticorruption objectives justify a particular set of contribution limits requires answering empirically based questions, and applying significant discretion and judgment. To what extent will unrestricted giving lead to corruption or its appearance? What forms will any such corruption take? To what extent will a lack of regulation undermine public confidence in the democratic system? To what extent can regulation restore it?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    These kinds of questions, while not easily answered, are questions that Congress is far better suited to resolve than are judges. Thus, while court review of contribution limits has been and should be \"rigorous,\"\n    <em>\n     Buckley,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n     424 U.S., at 29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     96 S.Ct. 612\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , we have also recognized that \"deference to legislative choice is warranted.\"\n    <em>\n     Beaumont,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897598\" index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/146/#p164\">\n     539 U.S., at 155\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897598\" index=\"460\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/146/#p164\">\n     123 S.Ct. 2200\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And that deference has taken account of facts and circumstances set forth in an evidentiary record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    For another thing, a comparison of the plurality's opinion with this dissent reveals important differences of opinion on fact-related matters. We disagree, for example, on the possibilities for circumvention of the base limits in the absence of aggregate limits. We disagree about how effectively the\n    plurality's \"alternatives\" could prevent evasion. An evidentiary proceeding would permit the parties to explore these matters, and it would permit the courts to reach a more accurate judgment. The plurality rationalizes its haste to forgo an evidentiary record by noting that \"the parties have treated the question as a purely legal one.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1448, n. 4. But without a doubt, the legal question-whether the aggregate limits are closely drawn to further a compelling governmental interest-turns on factual questions about whether corruption, in the absence of such limits, is a realistic threat to our democracy. The plurality itself spends pages citing figures about campaign spending to defend its \"legal\" conclusion.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1453 - 1455, 1455 - 1456, 1456 - 1458. The problem with such reasoning is that this Court's expertise does not lie in marshaling facts in the primary instance. That is why in the past, when answering similar questions about the constitutionality of restrictions on campaign contributions, we have relied on an extensive evidentiary record produced below to inform our decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Without further development of the record, however, I fail to see how the plurality can now find grounds for overturning\n    <em>\n     Buckley.\n    </em>\n    The justification for aggregate contribution restrictions is strongly rooted in the need to assure political integrity and ultimately in the First Amendment itself. Part II,\n    <em>\n     supra.\n    </em>\n    The threat to that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real. Part III,\n    <em>\n     supra.\n    </em>\n    Even taking the plurality on its own terms and considering solely the threat of\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    corruption (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    money-for-votes exchanges), the aggregate limits are a necessary tool to stop circumvention.\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    And there is no basis for finding a lack of \"fit\" between the threat and the means used to combat it, namely the aggregate limits. Part IV,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    The plurality reaches the opposite conclusion. The result, as I said at the outset, is a decision that substitutes judges' understandings of how the political process works for the\n    understanding of Congress; that fails to recognize the difference between influence resting upon public opinion and influence bought by money alone; that overturns key precedent; that creates huge loopholes in the law; and that undermines, perhaps devastates, what remains of campaign finance reform.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    With respect, I dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    APPENDIXES\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    <em>\n     Existence of Large Donations\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Expert Report: \"During the 1996 election cycle, the top 50 nonfederal money donors made contributions ranging from $530,000 to $3,287,175....

Instead, they are likely to simply make unlimited contributions to Super PACs or 501(c)s.\" Hearing on Current Issues in Campaign Finance Law Enforcement before the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (2013).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-307\">\n     In addition, the percentage of contributions above the aggregate limits that even\n     <em>\n      could\n     </em>\n     be used for circumvention is limited by the fact that many of the modes of potential circumvention can be used only once each election. For example, if one donor gives $2,600 to 100 candidates with safe House seats in the hopes that each candidate will reroute $2,000 to Representative Smith, a candidate in a contested district, no other donor can do the same, because the candidates in the safe seats will have exhausted their permissible contributions to Smith. So there is no risk that the circumvention scheme will repeat itself with multiple other would-be donors to Smith.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
