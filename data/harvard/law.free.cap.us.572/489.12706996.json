Left unregulated, the emitting or upwind State reaps the benefits of the economic activity causing the pollution without bearing all the costs. See Revesz, Federalism and Interstate Environmental Externalities,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=144%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%202341\">\n    144 U. Pa. L.Rev. 2341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2343 (1996). Conversely, downwind States to which the pollution travels are unable to achieve clean air because of the influx of out-of-state pollution they lack authority to control. See S.Rep. No. 101-228, p. 49 (1989), 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3385. To tackle the problem, Congress included a Good Neighbor Provision in the Clean Air Act (Act or CAA). That provision, in its current phrasing, instructs States to prohibit in-state sources \"from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will ... contribute significantly\" to downwind States' \"nonattainment ..., or interfere with maintenance,\" of any EPA-promulgated national air quality standard.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207410\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(D) (i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Interpreting the Good Neighbor Provision, EPA adopted the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (commonly and hereinafter called the Transport Rule). The rule calls for consideration of costs, among other factors, when determining the emission reductions an upwind State must make to improve air quality in polluted downwind areas. The Court of Appeals\n   for the D.C. Circuit vacated the rule in its entirety. It held, 2 to 1, that the Good Neighbor Provision requires EPA to consider only each upwind State's physically proportionate responsibility for each downwind State's air quality problem. That reading is demanded, according to the D.C. Circuit, so that no State will be required to decrease its emissions by more than its ratable share of downwind-state pollution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), we reversed a D.C. Circuit decision that failed to accord deference to EPA's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous Clean Air Act provision. Satisfied that the Good Neighbor Provision does not command the Court of Appeals' cost-blind construction, and that EPA reasonably interpreted the provision, we reverse the D.C. Circuit's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Air pollution is transient, heedless of state boundaries. Pollutants generated by upwind sources are often transported by air currents, sometimes over hundreds of miles, to downwind States. As the pollution travels out of state, upwind States are relieved of the associated costs. Those costs are borne instead by the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and maintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the steady stream of infiltrating pollution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For several reasons, curtailing interstate air pollution poses a complex challenge for environmental regulators. First, identifying the upwind origin of downwind air\n   pollution is no easy endeavor. Most upwind States propel pollutants to more than one downwind State, many downwind States receive pollution from multiple upwind States, and some States qualify as both upwind and downwind. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 6. The overlapping and interwoven\n   linkages between upwind and downwind States with which EPA had to contend number in the thousands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further complicating the problem, pollutants do not emerge from the smokestacks of an upwind State and uniformly migrate downwind. Some pollutants stay within upwind States' borders, the wind carries others to downwind States, and some subset of that group drifts to States without air quality problems. \"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.\" The Holy Bible, John 3:8 (King James Version). In crafting a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution, regulators must account for the vagaries of the wind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, upwind pollutants that find their way downwind are not left unaltered by the journey. Rather, as the gases emitted by upwind polluters are carried downwind, they are transformed, through various chemical processes, into altogether different pollutants. The offending gases at issue in these cases-nitrogen oxide (NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   ) and sulfur dioxide (SO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   )-often develop into ozone and fine particulate matter (PM\n   <sub>\n    2.5\n   </sub>\n   ) by the time they reach the atmospheres of downwind States. See 76 Fed.Reg. 48222-48223 (2011). See also 69 Fed.Reg. 4575-4576 (2004) (describing the components of ozone and PM\n   <sub>\n    2.5\n   </sub>\n   ). Downwind air quality must therefore be measured for ozone and PM\n   <sub>\n    2.5\n   </sub>\n   concentrations. EPA's chore is to quantify the amount of upwind gases (NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   and SO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   ) that must be reduced to enable downwind States to keep their levels of ozone and PM\n   <sub>\n    2.5\n   </sub>\n   in check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Over the past 50 years, Congress has addressed interstate air pollution several times and with increasing rigor. In 1963, Congress directed federal authorities to \"encourage cooperative\n   activities by the States and local governments for the prevention and control of air pollution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Stat.%20393\">\n    77 Stat. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857a (1964 ed.). In 1970, Congress made this instruction more concrete, introducing features still key to the Act. For the first time, Congress directed EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public health. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Stat.%201679\">\n    84 Stat. 1679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1680, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7409 (2006 ed.). Once EPA settles on a NAAQS, the Act requires the Agency to designate \"nonattainment\" areas,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   locations where the concentration of a regulated pollutant exceeds the NAAQS. \u00a7 7407(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Act then shifts the burden to States to propose plans adequate for compliance with the NAAQS. Each State must submit a State Implementation Plan, or SIP, to EPA within three years of any new or revised NAAQS. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). If EPA determines that a State has failed to submit an adequate SIP, either in whole or in part, the Act requires the Agency to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP, within two years of EPA's determination, \"unless the State corrects the deficiency\" before a FIP is issued. \u00a7 7410(c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Act lists the matters a SIP must cover. Among SIP components, the 1970 version of the Act required SIPs to include \"adequate provisions for intergovernmental cooperation\" concerning interstate air pollution. \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Stat.%201681\">\n    84 Stat. 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(a)(2)(E). This statutory requirement, with its text altered over time, has come to be called the Good Neighbor Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In 1977, Congress amended the Good Neighbor Provision to require more than \"cooperation.\" It directed States to submit SIPs that included provisions \"adequate\" to \"prohibi[t] any stationary source within the State from emitting\n   any air pollutant in amounts which will ... prevent attainment or maintenance [of air quality standards] by any other State.\" \u00a7 108(a)(4),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Stat.%20693\">\n    91 Stat. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207410\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E) (1976 ed., Supp. II). The amended provision thus explicitly instructed upwind States to reduce emissions to account for pollution exported beyond their borders. As then written, however, the provision regulated only individual sources that, considered alone, emitted enough pollution to cause nonattainment in a downwind State. Because it is often \"impossible to say that any single source or group of sources is the one which actually prevents attainment\" downwind, S.Rep. No. 101-228, p. 21 (1989), 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3385, 3407, the 1977 version of the Good Neighbor Provision proved ineffective, see\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207410\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting the provision's inability to curb the collective \"emissions [of] multiple sources\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Congress most recently amended the Good Neighbor Provision in 1990. The statute, in its current form, requires SIPs to \"contain adequate provisions ... prohibiting ... any source or other type of emissions activity within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will ... contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect to any ... [NAAQS].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207410\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(D)(i) (2006 ed.). The controversy before us centers on EPA's most recent attempt to construe this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Three times over the past two decades, EPA has attempted to delineate the Good Neighbor Provision's scope by identifying when upwind States \"contribute significantly\" to nonattainment downwind. In 1998, EPA issued a rule known as the \"NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   SIP Call.\" That regulation limited NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   emissions in 23 upwind States to the extent such emissions contributed to nonattainment of ozone standards in downwind States. See 63 Fed.Reg. 57356, 57358. In\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 25171. The D.C. Circuit initially vacated CAIR as arbitrary and capricious. See\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

See 76 Fed.Reg. 48208-48209.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Under the Transport Rule, EPA employed a \"two-step approach\" to determine when upwind States \"contribute[d] significantly to nonattainment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48254, and therefore in \"amounts\" that had to be eliminated. At step one, called the \"screening\" analysis, the Agency excluded as\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   any upwind State that contributed less than one percent of the three NAAQS\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to any downwind State \"receptor,\" a location at which EPA measures air quality\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48236-48237.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   If all of an upwind State's contributions fell below the one-percent threshold, that State would be considered not to have \" contribute [d] significantly\" to the nonattainment of any downwind State.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48236. States in that category were screened out and exempted from regulation under the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The remaining States were subjected to a second inquiry, which EPA called the \"control\" analysis. At this stage, the Agency sought to generate a cost-effective allocation of emission reductions among those upwind States \"screened in\" at step one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The control analysis proceeded this way. EPA first calculated, for each upwind State, the quantity of emissions the State could eliminate at each of several cost thresholds. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48248-48249. Cost for these purposes is measured as cost per ton of emissions prevented, for instance, by installing scrubbers on powerplant smokestacks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   EPA estimated, for example, the amount each upwind State's NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   emissions would fall if all pollution sources within each State employed every control measure available at a cost of $500 per ton or less. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48249-48251. The Agency then repeated that analysis at ascending cost thresholds. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Armed with this information, EPA conducted complex modeling to establish the combined effect the upwind reductions projected at each cost threshold would have on air quality in downwind States. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48249. The Agency then identified \"significant cost threshold[s],\" points in its model where a \"noticeable change occurred in downwind air\n   quality, such as ... where large upwind emission reductions become available because a certain type of emissions control strategy becomes cost-effective.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   For example, reductions of NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   sufficient to resolve or significantly curb downwind air quality problems\n   could be achieved, EPA determined, at a cost threshold of $500 per ton (applied uniformly to all regulated upwind States). \"Moving beyond the $500 cost threshold,\" EPA concluded, \"would result in only minimal additional ... reductions [in emissions].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48256.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, EPA translated the cost thresholds it had selected into amounts of emissions upwind States would be required to eliminate. For each regulated upwind State, EPA created an annual emissions \"budget.\" These budgets represented the quantity of pollution an upwind State would produce in a given year if its in-state sources implemented all pollution controls available at the chosen cost thresholds. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48249.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   If EPA's projected improvements to downwind air quality were to be realized, an upwind State's emissions could not exceed the level this budget allocated to it, subject to certain adjustments not relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Taken together, the screening and control inquiries defined EPA's understanding of which upwind emissions were within the Good Neighbor Provision's ambit. In short, under the Transport Rule, an upwind State \"contribute[d] significantly\" to downwind nonattainment to the extent its exported pollution both (1) produced one percent or more of a NAAQS in at least one downwind State (step one) and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   could be eliminated cost-effectively, as determined by EPA (step two). See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48254. Upwind States would be obliged to eliminate all and only emissions meeting both of these criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For each State regulated by the Transport Rule, EPA contemporaneously promulgated a FIP allocating that State's emission budget among its in-state sources. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 48271, 48284-48287.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For each of these States, EPA had determined that the State had failed to submit a SIP adequate for compliance with the Good Neighbor Provision. These determinations regarding SIPs became final after 60 days, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V), and many went unchallenged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   EPA views the SIP determinations as having triggered its statutory obligation to promulgate a FIP within two\n   years, see \u00a7 7410(c), a view contested by respondents, see Part II,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A group of state and local governments (State respondents), joined by industry and labor groups (Industry respondents), petitioned for review of the Transport Rule in the U.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Over the dissent of Judge Rogers, the Court of Appeals vacated the rule in its entirety. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    696 F.3d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   EPA's actions, the appeals court held, exceeded the Agency's statutory authority in two respects. By promulgating FIPs before giving States a meaningful opportunity to adopt their own implementation plans, EPA had, in the court's view, upset the CAA's division of responsibility between the States and the Federal Government. In the main, the Court of Appeals acknowledged, EPA's FIP authority is triggered at the moment the Agency disapproves a SIP. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, when a State proposes a SIP inadequate to achieve a NAAQS, EPA could promulgate a FIP immediately after disapproving that SIP. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But the Court of Appeals ruled that a different regime applies to a State's failure to meet its obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision. While a NAAQS was a \"clear numerical target,\" a State's good neighbor obligation remained \"nebulous and unknown,\" the court observed, until EPA calculated the State's emission budget.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without these budgets, the Court of Appeals said, upwind States would be compelled to take a \"stab in the dark\" at calculating their own significant contribution to interstate air pollution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The D.C. Circuit read the Act to avoid putting States in this position: EPA had an implicit statutory duty, the court held, to give upwind States a reasonable opportunity to allocate their emission budgets among in-state sources before the Agency's authority to issue FIPs could be triggered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The D.C. Circuit also held that the Agency's two-part interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision ignored three \"red lines ... cabin[ing the] EPA's authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the D.C. Circuit interpreted the Good Neighbor Provision to require upwind States to reduce emissions in \"a manner proportional to their contributio[n]\" to pollution in downwind\n   States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Transport Rule, however, treated all regulated upwind States alike, regardless of their relative contribution to the overall problem. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It required all upwind States \"screened in\" at step one to reduce emissions in accord with the uniform cost thresholds set during the step two control analysis. Imposing these uniform cost thresholds, the Court of Appeals observed, could force some upwind States to reduce emissions by more than their \"fair share.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   According to the Court of Appeals, EPA had also failed to ensure that the Transport Rule did not mandate upwind States to reduce pollution unnecessarily. The Good Neighbor Provision, the D.C. Circuit noted, \"targets [only] those emissions from upwind States that 'contribute significantly\n   <em>\n    to nonattainment\n   </em>\n   ' \" of a NAAQS in downwind States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pollution reduction beyond that goal was \"unnecessary over-control,\" outside the purview of the Agency's statutory mandate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the emission budgets were calculated by reference to cost alone, the court concluded that EPA had done nothing to guard against, or even measure, the \"over-control\" potentially imposed by the Transport Rule. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, by deciding, at the screening analysis, that upwind contributions below\n   the one-percent threshold were insignificant, EPA had established a \"floor\" on the Agency's authority to act. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and n. 13. Again pointing to the rule's reliance on costs, the Court of Appeals held that EPA had failed to ensure that upwind States were not being forced to reduce emissions below the one-percent threshold. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In dissent, Judge Rogers criticized the majority for deciding two questions that were not, in her view, properly before the court. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 40-46, 51-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, she addressed the majority's insistence that FIPs abide a State's opportunity to allocate its emission budget among in-state sources. She regarded the respondents' plea to that effect as an untimely\n   attack on EPA's previous SIP disapprovals. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 40-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, in Judge Rogers' assessment, the respondents had failed to raise their substantive objections to the Transport Rule with the specificity necessary to preserve them for review. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 51-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the merits, Judge Rogers found nothing in the Act to require, or even suggest, that EPA must quantify a State's good neighbor obligations before it promulgated a FIP. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    at 46-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She also disagreed with the court's conclusion that the Transport Rule unreasonably interpreted the Act.

As the State respondents put it, a FIP allocating a State's emission budget \"must issue\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   EPA has quantified the States' good-neighbor obligations [in an emission budget] and given the States a reasonable opportunity to meet those obligations in SIPs.\" Brief for State Respondents 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Before reaching the merits of this argument, we first reject EPA's threshold objection that the claim is untimely. According to the Agency, this argument-and the D.C. Circuit's opinion accepting it-rank as improper collateral attacks on EPA's prior SIP disapprovals. As earlier recounted, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1597 - 1598, EPA, by the time it issued the Transport Rule, had determined that each regulated upwind State had failed to submit a SIP adequate to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision. Many of those determinations, because unchallenged, became final after 60 days, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and did so before the petitions here at issue were filed. EPA argues that the Court cannot question exercise\n   of the Agency's FIP authority without subjecting these final SIP disapprovals to untimely review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We disagree. The gravamen of the State respondents' challenge is not that EPA's disapproval of any particular SIP was erroneous. Rather, respondents urge that, notwithstanding these disapprovals, the Agency was obliged to grant an upwind State a second opportunity to promulgate adequate SIPs once EPA set the State's emission budget. This claim does not depend on the validity of the prior SIP disapprovals. Even assuming the legitimacy of those disapprovals, the question remains whether EPA was required to do more than disapprove a SIP, as the State respondents urge, to trigger the Agency's statutory authority to issue a FIP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Turning to the merits, we hold that the text of the statute supports EPA's position. As earlier noted, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1594 - 1595, the CAA sets a series of precise deadlines to which the States and EPA must adhere. Once EPA issues any new or revised NAAQS, a State has three years to adopt a SIP adequate for compliance with the Act's requirements. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207410\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Among those requirements is the Act's mandate that SIPs \"shall\" include provisions sufficient to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision. \u00a7 7410(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   If EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, the Agency's mandate to replace it with a FIP is no less absolute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"[EPA] shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2 years after the [Agency]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \"(A) finds that a State has failed to make a required submission or finds that the plan or plan revision submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum [relevant] criteria ..., or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \"(B) disapproves a [SIP] in whole or in part,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"unless the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA] approves the plan or plan revision, before the [Agency] promulgates such [FIP].\" \u00a7 7410(c)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In other words, once EPA has found a SIP inadequate, the Agency has a statutory duty to issue a FIP \"at any time\" within two years (unless the State first \"corrects the deficiency,\" which no one contends occurred here).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The D.C. Circuit, however, found an unwritten exception to this strict time prescription for SIPs aimed at implementing the Good Neighbor Provision.

Nothing in the Act differentiates the Good Neighbor Provision from the several other matters a State must address in its SIP. Rather, the statute speaks without reservation: Once a NAAQS has been issued, a State \"shall\" propose a SIP within three years, \u00a7 7410(a)(1), and that SIP \"shall\" include, among other components, provisions adequate to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision, \u00a7 7410(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Nor does the Act condition the duty to promulgate a FIP on EPA's having first quantified an upwind State's good neighbor obligations. As Judge Rogers observed in her dissent from the D.C.

Instead, a SIP's failure to satisfy the Good Neighbor Provision, without more, triggers EPA's obligation to issue a federal plan within two years. \u00a7 7410(c).

When Congress elected to make EPA's input a prerequisite to state action under the Act, it did so expressly. States developing vehicle inspection\n   and maintenance programs under the CAA, for example, must await EPA guidance before issuing SIPs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511a(c)(3)(B). A State's obligation to adopt a SIP, moreover, arises only after EPA has first set the NAAQS the State must meet. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). Had Congress intended similarly to defer States' discharge of their obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision, Congress, we take it, would have included a similar direction in that section.

Suppose the Agency sets a NAAQS, with respect to a particular pollutant, at 100 parts per billion (ppb), and that the level of the pollutant in the atmosphere of downwind State A is 130 ppb. Suppose further that EPA has determined that each of three upwind States-X, Y, and Z-contributes the equivalent of 30 ppb of the relevant pollutant to State A's airspace. The Good Neighbor Provision, as just observed, prohibits only upwind emissions that contribute significantly to downwind\n   <em>\n    nonattainment\n   </em>\n   . EPA's authority under the provision is therefore limited to eliminating a\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   of 30 ppb,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the overage caused by the collective contribution of States X, Y, and Z.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   How is EPA to divide responsibility among the three States? Should the Agency allocate reductions proportionally (10 ppb each), on a per capita basis, on the basis of the cost of abatement, or by some other metric? See Brief for Federal Petitioners 50 (noting EPA's consideration of different\n   approaches). The Good Neighbor Provision does not answer that question for EPA.

Nothing in the text of the Good Neighbor Provision propels EPA down this path. Understandably so, for as EPA notes, the D.C. Circuit's proportionality\n   approach could scarcely be satisfied in practice. See App. in No. 11-1302 etc. (CADC), p. 2312 (\"[W]hile it is possible to determine an emission reduction percentage if there is a single downwind [receptor], most upwind states contribute to multiple downwind [receptors] (in multiple states) and would have a different reduction percentage for each one.\").\n   To illustrate, consider a variation on the example set out above. Imagine that States X and Y now contribute air pollution to State A in a ratio of one to five,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   State Y contributes five times the amount of pollution to State A than does State X. If State A were the only downwind State to which the two upwind States contributed, the D.C. Circuit's proportionality requirement would be easy to meet: EPA could require State Y to reduce its emissions by five times the amount demanded of State X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The realities of interstate air pollution, however, are not so simple. Most upwind States contribute pollution to multiple downwind States in varying amounts. See 76 Fed.Reg. 48239-48246. See also Brief for Respondent Calpine Corp. et al\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   in Support of Petitioners 48-49 (offering examples). Suppose then that States X and Y also contribute pollutants to a second downwind State (State B), this time in a ratio of seven to one. Though State Y contributed a relatively larger share of pollution to State A, with respect to State B, State X is the greater offender. Following the proportionality approach with respect to State B would demand that State X reduce its emissions by seven times as much as State Y. Recall, however, that State Y, as just hypothesized, had to effect five times as large a reduction with respect to State A. The Court of Appeals' proportionality edict with respect to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   State A and State B appears to work neither mathematically nor in practical application. Proportionality as to one downwind State will not achieve proportionality as to others. Quite the opposite. And where, as is generally true, upwind States contribute pollution to more than two downwind receptors, proportionality becomes all the more elusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Neither the D.C. Circuit nor respondents face up to this problem. The dissent, for its part, strains to give meaning to the D.C. Circuit's proportionality constraint as applied to a world in which multiple upwind States contribute emissions to multiple downwind locations. In the dissent's view,\n   upwind States must eliminate emissions by \"whatever minimum amount reduces\" their share of the overage in each and every one of the downwind States to which they are linked. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1613 - 1614. In practical terms, this means each upwind State will be required to reduce emissions by the amount necessary to eliminate that State's largest downwind contribution. The dissent's formulation, however, does not account for the combined and cumulative effect of each upwind State's reductions on attainment in multiple downwind locations. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Under a proportional-reduction approach, State X would be required to eliminate emissions of that pollutant by whatever minimum amount reduces\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   State A's level by 0.2 unit and State B's by 0.7 unit.\" (emphasis added)). The result would be costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed in conflict with, the Good Neighbor Provision's goal of attainment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the dissent asserts that EPA will \"simply be required to make allowance for\" the overregulation caused by its \"proportional-reduction\" approach.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1615. What criterion should EPA employ to determine which States will have to make those \"allowance[s]\" and by how much? The dissent admits there are \"multiple ways\" EPA might answer those questions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But proportionality cannot be one of those ways, for the proportional-reduction approach is what led to the overregulation in the first place. And if a nonproportional approach can play a role in setting the final allocation of reduction obligations, then it is hardly apparent why EPA, free to depart from proportionality at the back end, cannot do so at the outset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Persuaded that the Good Neighbor Provision does not dictate the particular allocation of emissions among contributing States advanced by the D.C. Circuit, we must next decide whether the allocation method chosen by EPA is a \"permissible construction of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevron,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S., at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As EPA interprets the statute, upwind emissions rank as \"amounts [that] ... contribute significantly to nonattainment\" if they (1) constitute one percent or more of a relevant NAAQS in a nonattaining downwind State and (2) can be eliminated under the cost threshold set by the Agency. See 76 Fed.Reg. 48254. In other words, to identify which emissions were to be eliminated, EPA considered both the magnitude of upwind States' contributions and the cost associated with eliminating them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Industry respondents argue that, however EPA ultimately divides responsibility among upwind States, the final calculation cannot rely on costs. The Good Neighbor Provision, respondents and the dissent emphasize, \"requires each State to prohibit only those\n   <em>\n    'amounts'\n   </em>\n   of air pollution emitted within the State that 'contribute significantly' to another\n   State's nonattaintment.\" Brief for Industry Respondents 23 (emphasis added). See also\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1612 - 1613. The cost of preventing emissions, they urge, is wholly unrelated to the actual \"amoun[t]\" of air pollution an upwind State contributes. Brief for Industry Respondents 23. Because the Transport Rule considers costs, respondents argue, \"States that contribute identical 'amounts' ... may be deemed [by EPA] to have [made] substantially\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   \" contributions.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   But, as just explained, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1603 - 1604, the Agency cannot avoid the task of choosing which among equal\n   \"amounts\" to eliminate. The Agency has chosen, sensibly in our view, to reduce the amount easier,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   less costly, to eradicate, and nothing in the text of the Good Neighbor Provision precludes that choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Using costs in the Transport Rule calculus, we agree with EPA, also makes good sense. Eliminating those amounts that can cost-effectively be reduced is an efficient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good Neighbor Provision requires the Agency to address. Efficient because EPA can achieve the levels of attainment,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   of emission reductions, the proportional approach aims to achieve, but at a much lower overall cost. Equitable because, by imposing uniform cost thresholds on regulated States, EPA's rule subjects to stricter regulation those States that have done relatively less in the past to control their pollution. Upwind States that have not yet implemented pollution controls of the same stringency as their neighbors will be stopped from free riding on their neighbors' efforts to reduce pollution. They will have to bring down their emissions by installing devices of the kind in which neighboring States have already invested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Suppose, for example, that the industries of upwind State A have expended considerable resources installing modern pollution-control devices on their plants. Factories in upwind State B, by contrast, continue to run old, dirty plants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Yet, perhaps because State A is more populous and therefore generates a larger sum of pollution overall, the two States' emissions have equal effects on downwind attainment. If State A and State B are required to eliminate emissions proportionally (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   equally\n   <em>\n    ),\n   </em>\n   sources in State A will be compelled to spend far more per ton of reductions because they have already utilized lower cost pollution controls. State A's sources will also have to achieve greater reductions than would have been required had they not made the cost-effective reductions in the first place. State A, in other words, will be tolled for having done more to reduce pollution in the past.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   EPA'S COST-BASED ALLocation avoids these anomalies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Obligated to require the elimination of only those \"amounts\" of pollutants that contribute to the nonattainment of NAAQS in downwind States, EPA must decide how to differentiate among the otherwise like contributions of multiple upwind States. EPA found decisive the difficulty of eliminating each \"amount,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the cost incurred in doing so. Lacking a dispositive statutory instruction to guide it, EPA's decision, we conclude, is a \"reasonable\" way of filling the \"gap left open by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevron,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S., at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The D.C. Circuit stated two further objections to EPA's cost-based method of defining an upwind State's contribution. Once a State was screened in at step one of EPA's analysis, its emission budget was calculated solely with reference to the uniform cost thresholds the Agency selected at step two. The Transport Rule thus left open the possibility that a State might be compelled to reduce emissions beyond the point at which every affected downwind State is in attainment, a phenomenon the Court of Appeals termed \"over-control.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    696 F.3d, at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1598 - 1599. Second, EPA's focus on costs did not foreclose, as the D.C. Circuit accurately observed, the possibility that an upwind State would be required to reduce its emissions by so much that the State no longer contributed one percent or more of a relevant NAAQS to any downwind State. This would place the State below the mark EPA had set, during the screening phase, as the initial threshold of \"significan[ce].\" See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 20, and n. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeals to this extent: EPA cannot require a State to reduce its output of pollution by more than is necessary to achieve attainment in every downwind State or at odds with the one-percent threshold the Agency has set. If EPA requires an upwind State to reduce emissions by more than the amount necessary to achieve attainment in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   downwind State to which it is linked, the Agency will have overstepped its authority, under the Good Neighbor Provision, to eliminate those \"amounts [that] contribute ... to nonattainment.\" Nor can EPA demand reductions that would drive an upwind State's contribution to every downwind State to which it is linked below one percent\n   of the relevant NAAQS. Doing so would be counter to step one of the Agency's interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision. See 76 Fed.Reg. 48236 (\"[S]tates whose contributions are below th[e] thresholds do not significantly contribute to nonattainment ... of the relevant NAAQS.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Neither possibility, however, justifies wholesale invalidation of the Transport Rule. First, instances of \"over-control\" in particular downwind locations, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged, see\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    696 F.3d, at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , may be incidental to reductions necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere. Because individual upwind States often \"contribute significantly\" to nonattainment in multiple downwind locations, the emissions reduction required to bring one linked downwind State into attainment may well be large enough to push other linked downwind States over the attainment line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   As\n   the Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   downwind State, however, exceeding attainment in one State cannot rank as \"over-control\" unless unnecessary to achieving attainment in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   downwind State. Only reductions unnecessary to downwind attainment\n   <em>\n    anywhere\n   </em>\n   fall outside the Agency's statutory authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, while EPA has a statutory duty to avoid over-control, the Agency also has a statutory obligation to avoid \"under-control,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   to maximize achievement of attainment downwind. For reasons earlier explained, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1593 - 1594, a degree of imprecision is inevitable in tackling the problem of interstate air pollution. Slight changes in wind patterns or energy consumption, for example, may vary downwind air quality in ways EPA might not have anticipated. The Good Neighbor Provision requires EPA to seek downwind attainment of NAAQS notwithstanding the uncertainties. Hence, some amount of over-control,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   emission budgets that turn out to be more demanding than necessary, would not be surprising. Required to balance the possibilities of under-control and over-control, EPA must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, in a voluminous record, involving thousands of upwind-to-downwind linkages, respondents point to only a few instances of \"unnecessary\" emission reductions, and even those are contested by EPA. Compare Brief for Industry Respondents 19 with Reply Brief for Federal Petitioners 21-22. EPA, for its part, offers data, contested by respondents, purporting to show that few (if any) upwind States have been required to limit emissions below the one-percent threshold of significance. Compare Brief for Federal Petitioners 37, 54-55, with Brief for Industry Respondents 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   If any upwind State concludes it has been forced to regulate emissions below the one-percent threshold or beyond the point necessary to bring all downwind States into attainment,\n   that State may bring a particularized, as-applied challenge to the Transport Rule, along with any other as-applied challenges it may have.

With the statute involved in the present cases, however, Congress did it right. It specified quite precisely the responsibility of an upwind State under the Good Neighbor Provision: to eliminate those\n   <em>\n    amounts of pollutants\n   </em>\n   that it contributes to downwind problem areas. But the Environmental Protection Agency was unsatisfied with this system. Agency personnel, perhaps correctly, thought it more efficient to require reductions not in proportion to the\n   <em>\n    amounts of pollutants\n   </em>\n   for which each upwind State is responsible, but on the basis of how\n   <em>\n    cost-effectively\n   </em>\n   each can decrease emissions\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Today, the majority approves that undemocratic revision of the Clean Air Act. The Agency came forward with a textual justification for its action, relying on a farfetched meaning of the word \"significantly\" in the statutory text. That justification is so feeble that today's majority does not even recite it, much less defend it. The majority reaches its result (\"Look Ma, no hands!\") without benefit of text, claiming to have identified a remarkable \"gap\" in the statute, which it proceeds to fill (contrary to the plain logic of the statute) with cost-benefit analysis-and then, with no pretended textual justification at all, simply extends cost-benefit analysis beyond the scope of the alleged gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Additionally, the majority relieves EPA of any obligation to announce novel interpretations of the Good Neighbor Provision before the States must submit plans that are required to comply with those interpretations. By according the States primacy in deciding how to attain the governing air-quality standards, the Clean Air Act is pregnant with an obligation for the Agency to set those standards before\n   the States can be expected to achieve them. The majority nonetheless approves EPA's promulgation of federal plans implementing good-neighbor benchmarks before the States could conceivably have met those benchmarks on their own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   I would affirm the judgment of the D.C.

In reality, Congress itself has crafted the solution.

Alleged Textual Support: \"Significantly\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In the Government's argument here, the asserted textual support for the efficient-reduction approach adopted by EPA in the Transport Rule is the ambiguity of the word \"significantly\" in the statutory requirement that each State eliminate those \"amounts\" of pollutants that \"contribute\n   <em>\n    significantly\n   </em>\n   to nonattainment\" in downwind States. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (emphasis added). As described in the Government's briefing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   \"[T]he term 'significantly' ... is ambiguous, and ... EPA may permissibly determine the amount of a State's 'significant' contribution by reference to the amount of emissions reductions achievable through application of highly cost-effective controls.\" Reply Brief for Federal Petitioners 15-16 (emphasis added; some internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   And as the Government stated at oral argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   \"[I]n terms of the language, 'contribute significantly,' ... EPA reasonably construed that term to include a component of difficulty of achievement [\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   cost]; that is, in common parlance, we might say that dunking a basketball is a more\n   <em>\n    significant\n   </em>\n   achievement for somebody who is 5 feet 10 than for somebody who is 6 feet 10.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   But of course the statute does not focus on whether the upwind State has \"achieved significantly\"; it asks whether the State has \"contributed significantly\" to downwind pollution. The provision addresses the physical effects of physical causes, and it is only the magnitude of the relationship sufficient to trigger regulation that admits of some vagueness. Stated differently, the statute is ambiguous as to\n   <em>\n    how much\n   </em>\n   of a contribution to downwind pollution is \"significant,\" but it is not at all ambiguous as to whether factors unrelated to the\n   <em>\n    amounts of pollutants\n   </em>\n   that make up a contribution\n   affect the analysis.

It is evident that the current reformulation (targeting \"any air pollutant in amounts which will ... contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect to any [NAAQS]\") was meant simply to eliminate any implication that the polluting State had to be a but-for rather than merely a contributing cause of the downwind nonattainment or maintenance problem-not to allow cost concerns to creep in through the back door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In another respect also EPA's reliance upon the word \"significantly\" is plainly mistaken. The Good Neighbor Provision targets for elimination not only those emissions that \"contribute significantly to nonattainment [of NAAQS] in ... any other State,\" but also those that \"interfere with maintenance [of NAAQS] by ... any other State.\" \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The wiggle-word \"significantly\" is absent from the latter phrase. EPA does not-cannot-provide any textual justification for the conclusion that, when the same amounts of a pollutant travel downwind from States X and Y to a single area in State A, the emissions from X but not Y can be said to \"interfere with maintenance\" of the NAAQS in A just because they are cheaper to eliminate. Yet EPA proposes to use the \"from each according to its ability\" approach for nonattainment areas\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   maintenance areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   To its credit, the majority does not allude to, much less try to defend, the Government's \"significantly\" argument. But there is a serious downside to this. The sky-hook of \"significantly\" was called into service to counter the criterion of upwind-state responsibility plainly provided in the statute's text:\n   <em>\n    amounts of pollutants\n   </em>\n   contributed to downwind problem areas. See Brief for Federal Petitioners 42-45. Having forsworn reliance on \"significantly\" to convert responsibility for amounts of pollutants into responsibility for easy reduction of pollutants, the majority is impaled upon the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   B. The Alleged \"Gap\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   To fill the void created by its abandonment of EPA's \"significantly\" argument, the majority identifies a supposed gap in the text, which EPA must fill: While the text says that each upwind State must be responsible for its own contribution to downwind pollution, it does not say how responsibility is to be divided among multiple States when the total of their combined contribution to downwind pollution in a\n   particular area exceeds the reduction that the relevant NAAQS requires. In the example given by the majority,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1603 - 1604,\n   when each of three upwind States contributes 30 units of a pollutant to a downwind State but the reduction required for that State to comply with the NAAQS is only 30 units, how will responsibility for that 30 units be apportioned? Wow, that's a hard one-almost the equivalent of asking who is buried in Grant's Tomb. If the criterion of responsibility is\n   <em>\n    amounts of pollutants,\n   </em>\n   then surely shared responsibility must be based upon\n   <em>\n    relative amounts of pollutants\n   </em>\n   -in the majority's example, 10 units for each State. The statute makes no sense otherwise. The Good Neighbor Provision contains a gap only for those who blind themselves to the obvious in order to pursue a preferred policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   But not only does the majority bring in cost-benefit analysis to fill a gap that does not really exist. Having filled that \"gap,\" it then extends the efficiency-based principle to situations\n   <em>\n    beyond the imaginary gap\n   </em>\n   -that is, situations\n   <em>\n    where no apportionment is required\n   </em>\n   . Even where only a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   upwind State contributes pollutants to a downwind State, its annual emissions \"budget\" will be based not upon the amounts of pollutants it contributes, but upon what \"pollution controls [are] available at the chosen cost thresholds.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1597. EPA's justification was its implausible (and only half-applicable) notion that \"significantly\" imports cost concerns into the provision. The majority, having abandoned that absurdity, is left to deal with the no-apportionment situation with no defense-not even an imaginary gap-against a crystal-clear statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   C. The Majority's Criticisms of Proportional Reduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   1. Impossibility\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The majority contends that a proportional-reduction approach \"could scarcely be satisfied in practice\" and \"appears to work neither mathematically nor in practical application,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1605 -in essence, that the approach is impossible of application. If that were true, I know of no legal authority\n   and no democratic principle that would derive from it the consequence that EPA could rewrite the statute, rather than the consequence that the statute would be inoperative. \"There are sometimes statutes which no rule or canon of interpretation can make effective or applicable to the situations of fact which they purport to govern. In such cases the statute must simply fail.\" 3 R. Pound, Jurisprudence 493 (1959) (footnote omitted). In other words, the impossibility argument has no independent force: It is relevant only if the majority's textual interpretation is permissible. But in any event, the argument is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The impossibility theorem rests upon the following scenario: \"Imagine that States X and Y ... contribute air pollution to State A in a ratio of one to five....\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1605. And suppose that \"States X and Y also contribute pollutants to a second downwind State (State B), this time in a ratio of seven to one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Stat.%20693\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The majority concludes that \"[t]he Court of Appeals' proportionality edict with respect to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   State A and State B appears to work neither mathematically nor in practical application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Stat.%20693\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But why not? The majority's model relies on two faulty premises-one an oversimplification and the other a misapprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   First, the majority's formulation suggests that EPA measures the comparative downwind drift of pollutants in free-floating proportions between States. In reality, however, EPA assesses quantities (in physical units), not proportions. So, the majority's illustration of a 1-to-5 ratio describing\n   the relative contributions of States X and Y to State A's pollution might mean (for example) that X is responsible for 0.2 unit of some pollutant above the NAAQS in A and that Y is responsible for 1 unit. And the second example, assuming a 7-to-1 ratio underlying State X's and Y's contributions to State B's pollution, might mean that State X supplies 0.7 unit of the same pollutant above the NAAQS and State Y, 0.1 unit. Under a proportional-reduction approach, State X would be required to eliminate emissions of that pollutant by\n   whatever minimum amount reduces both State A's level by 0.2 unit and State B's by 0.7 unit. State Y, in turn, would be required to curtail its emissions by whatever minimum amount decreases both State A's measure by 1 unit and State B's by 0.1 unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   But, the majority objects, the reductions that State X must make to help bring State B into compliance may be more than those necessary for it to help bring State A into compliance, resulting in \"over-control\" of X with respect to A. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1604 - 1606, and n. 19. This objection discloses the second flaw in the impossibility theorem. Echoing EPA, see Brief for Federal Petitioners 47-48, the majority believes that the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision forbids over-control with respect to even a single downwind receptor. That is the only way in which the proportional-reduction approach could be deemed \"to work neither mathematically nor in practical application\" on its face.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1605. But the premise is incorrect. Although some of the D.C. Circuit's simplified examples might support that conclusion, its opinion explicitly acknowledged that the complexity of real-world conditions demands the contrary: \"To be sure, ... there may be some truly unavoidable over-control in some downwind States that occurs as a byproduct of the necessity of reducing upwind States' emissions enough to meet the NAAQS in other downwind States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    696 F.3d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (2012). Moreover, the majority itself recognizes that the Good Neighbor Provision does not categorically prohibit over-control. \"As the Good Neighbor Provision seeks attainment in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   downwind State, ... exceeding attainment in one State cannot rank as 'over-control' unless unnecessary to achieving attainment in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   downwind State.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1590. The majority apparently fails to appreciate that, having cleared up that potential point of confusion, nothing stands in the way of the proportional-reduction approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The majority relies on an EPA document preceding the Transport Rule to establish the Agency's supposed belief that the proportional-reduction approach \"could scarcely be satisfied in practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1605. But the document says no such thing. Rather, it shows that the Agency rejected a proportion-based, \"air[-]quality-only\" methodology not because it was impossible of application, but because it failed to account for costs. See App. in No. 11-1302 etc. (CADC), pp. 2311-2312. The document labels as a \"technical difficulty\" (not an impossibility) the fact that \"most upwind states contribute to multiple downwind [receptors] (in multiple states) and would have a different reduction percentage for each one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2312. The Clean Air Act is full of technical difficulties, and this one is overcome by requiring each State to make the greatest reduction necessary with respect to any downwind area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   2. Over-Control\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Apparently conceding that the proportional-reduction approach may not be impossible of application after all, the majority alternatively asserts that it would cause \"costly overregulation unnecessary to, indeed\n   in conflict with, the Good Neighbor Provision's goal of attainment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1605. This assertion of massive overregulation assumes that a vast number of downwind States will be the accidental beneficiaries of collateral pollution reductions-that is, nontargeted reductions that occur as a consequence of required reductions targeted at neighboring downwind States. (Collateral pollution reduction is the opposite of collateral damage, so to speak.) The majority contends that the collateral pollution reductions enjoyed by a downwind State will cause the required upwind reductions actually targeting that State to exceed the level necessary to assure attainment or maintenance, thus producing unnecessary over-control. I have no reason to believe that the problem of over-control is as extensive\n   and thus \"costly\" as the majority alleges, and the majority provides none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   But never mind that. It suffices to say that over-control is no more likely to occur when the required reductions are apportioned among upwind States on the basis of\n   <em>\n    amounts of pollutants\n   </em>\n   contributed than when they are apportioned on the basis of\n   <em>\n    cost\n   </em>\n   . There is no conceivable reason why the efficient-reduction States that bear the brunt of the majority's (and EPA's) approach are less likely to be over-controlled than the major-pollution-causing States that would bear the brunt of my (and the statute's) approach. Indeed, EPA never attempted to establish that the Transport Rule did not produce gross over-control. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    696 F.3d, at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What causes the problem of over-control is not the\n   <em>\n    manner of apportioning\n   </em>\n   the required reductions, but the\n   <em>\n    composite volume\n   </em>\n   of the required reductions in each downwind State. If the majority's approach reduces over-control (it admittedly does not entirely eliminate it), that is only because EPA applies its cost-effectiveness principle not just to determining the proportions of required reductions that each upwind State must bear, but to determining the volume of those required reductions. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1596.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In any case, the solution to over-control under a proportional-reduction system is not difficult to discern. In calculating good-neighbor responsibilities, EPA would simply be required to make allowance for what I have called collateral pollution reductions. The Agency would set upwind States' obligations at levels that, after taking into account those reductions, suffice to produce attainment in all downwind States. Doubtless, there are multiple ways for the Agency to accomplish that task in accordance with the statute's amounts-based, proportional focus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority\n   itself invokes an unexplained device to prevent over-control \"in uncommon particular applications\" of its scheme.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1609. Whatever that device is, it can serve just as well to prevent over-control under the approach I have outlined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   I fully acknowledge that the proportional-reduction approach will demand some complicated computations where one upwind State is linked to multiple downwind States and vice versa. I am confident, however, that EPA's skilled number-crunchers can adhere to the statute's\n   <em>\n    quantitative\n   </em>\n   (rather than efficiency) mandate by crafting\n   <em>\n    quantitative\n   </em>\n   solutions. Indeed, those calculations can be performed at the desk, whereas the \"from each according to its ability\" approach requires the unwieldy field examination of\n   many pollution-producing sources with many sorts of equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   D. Our Precedent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The majority agrees with EPA's assessment that \"[u]sing costs in the Transport Rule calculus ... makes good sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1607. Its opinion declares that \"[e]liminating those amounts that can cost-effectively be reduced is an efficient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the Good Neighbor Provision requires the Agency to address.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Efficient, probably. Equitable? Perhaps so, but perhaps not. See Brief for Industry Respondents 35-36. But the point is that whether efficiency should have a dominant or subordinate role is for Congress, not this Court, to determine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   This is not the first time parties have sought to convert the Clean Air Act into a mandate for cost-effective regulation.\n   <em>\n    Whitman v.

The provision at issue there, like this one, did not expressly bar cost-based decisionmaking-\n   and unlike this one, it even contained words that were arguably ambiguous in the relevant respect. Specifically, \u00a7 7409(b)(1) instructed EPA to set primary NAAQS \"the attainment and maintenance of which ... are requisite to protect the public health\" with \"an adequate margin of safety.\" One could hardly overstate the capaciousness of the word \"adequate,\" and the phrase \"public health\" was at least equally susceptible (indeed, much more susceptible) of permitting cost-benefit analysis as the word \"significantly\" is here. As the respondents in\n   <em>\n    American Trucking\n   </em>\n   argued, setting NAAQS without considering costs may bring about failing industries and fewer jobs, which in turn may produce poorer and less healthy citizens.

This remarkably expansive reasoning makes a hash of the Clean Air Act, transforming it from a program based on cooperative federalism to one of centralized federal control.

Implications of State Regulatory Primacy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Down to its very core, the Clean Air Act sets forth a federalism-focused regulatory strategy. The Act begins by declaring that \"air pollution prevention (that is, the reduction or elimination, through any measures, of the amount of pollutants produced or created at the source) and air pollution control at its source is\n   <em>\n    the primary responsibility of States and local governments\n   </em>\n   .\" \u00a7 7401(a)(3) (emphasis added). State primacy permeates Title I, which addresses the promulgation and implementation of NAAQS, in particular\n   . Under \u00a7 7409(a), EPA must promulgate NAAQS for each pollutant for which air-quality criteria have been issued pursuant to \u00a7 7408. Section 7410(a)(1), in turn, requires each State, usually within three years of each new or revised NAAQS, to submit a SIP providing for its \"implementation, maintenance, and enforcement.\" EPA may step in to take over that responsibility if, and only if, a State discharges it inadequately. Specifically, if the Agency finds that a State has failed to make a required or complete submission or disapproves a SIP, it \"shall promulgate a [FIP] at any time within 2 years ..., unless the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA] approves the [SIP] or [SIP] revision.\" \u00a7 7410(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   To describe the effect of this statutory scheme in simple terms: After EPA sets numerical air-quality benchmarks, \"Congress plainly left with the States ... the power to determine which sources would be burdened by regulation and to what extent.\"\n   <em>\n    Union Elec.

The States are to present their chosen means of achieving EPA's benchmarks in SIPs, and only if a SIP fails to meet those goals may the Agency commandeer a State's authority by promulgating a FIP. \"[S]o long as the ultimate effect of a State's choice of emission limitations is compliance with the [NAAQS], the State is at liberty to adopt whatever mix of emission limitations it deems best suited to its particular situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Train v.

In 1998, when it issued the NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   SIP Call under \u00a7 7410(k)(5), EPA acknowledged that \"[w]ithout determining an acceptable level of NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   reductions, the upwind State would not have guidance as to what is an acceptable submission.\" 63 Fed.Reg. 57370. EPA deemed it \"most efficient-indeed necessary-for the Federal government to establish the overall emissions levels for the various States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p2168\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Agency quantified good-neighbor responsibilities and then allowed States a year to submit SIPs to implement them.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 57450-57451.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Similarly, when EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005 under \u00a7 7410(c), it explicitly \"recognize[d] that States would face great difficulties in developing transport SIPs to meet the requirements of today's action without th[e] data and policies\" provided by the Rule, including \"judgments from EPA concerning the appropriate criteria for determining whether upwind sources contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment under [\u00a7 74]10(a)(2)(D).\" 70\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 25268-25269. The Agency thus gave the States 18 months to submit SIPs implementing their new good-neighbor responsibilities. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 25166-25167, 25176. Although EPA published FIPs before that window\n   closed, it specified that they were meant to serve only as a \"Federal backstop\" and would not become effective unless necessary \"a year after the CAIR SIP submission deadline.\" 71\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 25330-25331 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Even since promulgating the Transport Rule, EPA has repeatedly reaffirmed that States cannot be expected to read the Agency's mind. In other proceedings, EPA has time and again stated that although\n   \"[s]ome of the elements of the [SIP-SUBMISSION PROCESS] ARE RELATIVELY STraIGHTforward, ... others clearly require interpretation by EPA through rulemaking, or recommendations through guidance, in order to give specific meaning for a particular NAAQS.\" 76\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 58751 (2011). As an example of the latter, the Agency has remarked that the Good Neighbor Provision \"contains numerous terms that require substantial rulemaking by EPA in order to determine such basic points as what constitutes significant contribution,\" citing CAIR.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.,\n   </em>\n   n. 6. In fact, EPA repeated those precise statements not once, not twice, but\n   <em>\n    30 times\n   </em>\n   following promulgation of the Transport Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Notwithstanding what parties may have argued in other litigation many years ago, it is beyond responsible debate that the States cannot possibly design FIP-proof SIPs without knowing the EPA-prescribed targets at which they must aim. EPA insists that it enjoys significant discretion-indeed, that it can consider essentially whatever factors it wishes-to determine what constitutes a \"significan[t]\" contribution to interstate pollution; and it simultaneously asserts that the States ought to know what quantities it will choose. The Agency-and the majority-cannot have it both ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   C. Abuse of Discretion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The majority attempts to place the blame for hollowing out the core of the Clean Air Act on \"the Act's plain text.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1601. The first textual element to which it refers is\n   \u00a7 7410(c)'s requirement that after EPA has disapproved a SIP, it \"shall promulgate a[FIP] at any time within 2 years.\" That is to say, the Agency has discretion whether to act at once or to defer action until some later point during the 2-year period. But it also has discretion to work within the prescribed timetable to respect the rightful role of States in the statutory scheme by delaying the issuance or enforcement of FIPs pending the resubmission and approval of SIPs-as EPA's conduct surrounding CAIR clearly demonstrates. And all of this assumes that the Agency insists on disapproving SIPs before promulgating the applicable good-neighbor standards-though in fact EPA has discretion to publicize those metrics before the window to submit SIPs closes in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The majority states that the Agency \"retained discretion to alter its course\" from the one pursued in the NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   SIP Call and CAIR,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1601 - 1602, but that misses the point. The point is that EPA has discretion to arrange things so as to preserve the Clean Air Act's core principle of\n   state primacy-and that it is an\n   <em>\n    abuse of discretion\n   </em>\n   to refuse to do so. See \u00a7 7607(d)(9)(A) ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A) (identical text in the Administrative Procedure Act). Indeed, the proviso in \u00a7 7410(c)(1) that the Agency's authority to promulgate a FIP within the 2-year period terminates if \"the State corrects the deficiency, and [EPA] approves the [SIP] or [SIP] revision\" explicitly contemplates just such an arrangement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The majority's conception of administrative discretion is so sprawling that it would allow EPA to subvert state primacy\n   not only with respect to the interstate-pollution concerns of the Good Neighbor Provision, but with respect to the much broader concerns of the NAAQS program more generally. States must submit SIPs \"within 3 years\" of each new or revised NAAQS \"\n   <em>\n    or such shorter period as [EPA] may prescribe\n   </em>\n   .\" \u00a7 7410(a)(1) (emphasis added). Because there is no principled reason to read that scheduling provision in a less malleable manner than the one at issue here, under the majority's view EPA could demand that States submit SIPs within a matter of days-or even hours-after a NAAQS publication or else face the immediate imposition of FIPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The second element of \"plain text\" on which the majority relies is small beer indeed. The Good Neighbor Provision does not expressly state that EPA must publish target quantities before the States are required to submit SIPs-even though the Clean Air Act does so for NAAQS more generally and for vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, see \u00a7 7511a(c)(3)(B). From that premise, the majority reasons that \"[h]ad Congress intended similarly to defer States' discharge of their obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision, Congress ... would have included a similar direction in that section.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1601. Perhaps so. But EPA itself read the statute differently when it declared in the NO\n   <sub>\n    X\n   </sub>\n   SIP Call that \"[d]etermining the overall level of air pollutants allowed to be emitted in a State\n   <em>\n    is comparable to determining [NAAQS],\n   </em>\n   which the courts have recognized as EPA's responsibility, and is distinguishable from determining the particular mix of controls among individual sources to attain those standards, which the caselaw identifies as a State responsibility.\" 63 Fed.Reg. 57369 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The negative implication suggested by a statute's failure to use consistent terminology can be a helpful guide to determining meaning, especially when all the provisions in question were enacted at the same time (which is not the case here). But because that interpretive canon, like others, is just one clue to aid construction, it can be overcome by more\n   powerful indications of meaning elsewhere in the statute. It is, we have said, \"no more than a rule of thumb that can tip the scales when a statute could be read in multiple ways.\"\n   <em>\n    Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center,\n   </em>\n   568 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p824\">\n    133 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p824\">\n    184 L.Ed.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

That instruction requires EPA to eliminate amounts of upwind pollution that \"interfere with maintenance\" of a NAAQS by a downwind State. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i). This mandate contains no qualifier analogous to \"significantly,\" and yet it entails a delegation of administrative authority of the same character as the one discussed above. Just as EPA is constrained, under the first part of the Good Neighbor Provision, to eliminate only those amounts that \"contribute ... to\n    <em>\n     nonattainment,\n    </em>\n    \" EPA is limited, by the second part of the provision, to reduce only by \"amounts\" that \"interfere with\n    <em>\n     maintenance,\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    by just enough to permit an already-attaining State to maintain satisfactory air quality. (Emphasis added.) With multiple upwind States contributing to the maintenance problem, however, EPA confronts the same challenge that the \"contribute significantly\" mandate creates: How should EPA allocate reductions among multiple upwind States, many of which contribute in amounts sufficient to impede downwind maintenance? Nothing in\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    clause of the Good Neighbor Provision provides the criteria by which EPA is meant to apportion responsibility.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    To see why, one need only slightly complicate the world envisioned by the dissent. Assume the world is made up of only four States-two upwind (States X and Y), and two downwind (States A and B). Suppose also, as the dissent allows, see\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1614, that the reductions State X must make to eliminate its share of the amount by which State A is in nonattainment are more than necessary for State X to eliminate its share of State B's nonattainment. As later explained, see\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1608 - 1609, this kind of \"over-control,\" we agree with the dissent, is acceptable under the statute. Suppose, however, that State Y also contributes to pollution in both State A and State B such that the reductions it must make to eliminate its proportion of State B's overage exceed the reductions it must make to bring State A into attainment. In this case, the dissent would have State X reduce by just enough to eliminate its share of State A's nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its share of State B's overage. The converse will be true as to State Y: Under the dissent's approach, State Y would have to reduce by the \"minimum\" necessary to eliminate its proportional share of State B's nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its proportion of State A's overage. The result is that the total amount by which both States X and Y are required to reduce will exceed what is necessary for attainment\n    <em>\n     in all downwind States involved\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    in both State A and State B). Over-control thus unnecessary to achieving attainment in all involved States is impermissible under the Good Neighbor Provision. See\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1609, n. 23.

As described in text, the provision at issue here is even more categorical (\"absolute\") than the provision at issue in\n    <em>\n     American Trucking\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    In addition to the citations in text, see 77 Fed.Reg. 50654, and n. 7 (2012);\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 47577, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 46363, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 46356, and n. 9;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 45323, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 43199, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 38241, and n. 6;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 35912, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 34909, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 34901, and n. 8;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 34310, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 34291, and n. 8;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 33384, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 33375, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 23184, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 22543, and n. 4;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 22536, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 22253, and n. 8;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 21915, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 21706, and n. 6;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 16788, and n. 4;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 13241, and n. 5;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 6715, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 6047, and n. 4;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 3216, and n. 7; 76\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 77955, and n. 7 (2011);\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 75852, and n. 7;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 70943, and n. 6;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 62636, and n. 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    I am unimpressed, by the way, with the explanation that the majority accepts for EPA's about-face: that the D.C.
