The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was employed as a stevedore by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ant for sixty cents an hour, unloading salt from the hold of a steamer of more than fourteen hundred tons net tonnage, while the steamer was on navigable waters at the dock of the defendant in Gloucester. The shippers of the salt engaged and provided at the expense of the steamer a winchman, who was a regular member of the crew and not employed by the defendant, to hoist the salt in a bucket furnished, as was the hook by which it was attached to the rope, by the defendant. While so working, on October 18, 1934, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was struck by the bucket, and received injuries from which he died, without conscious suffering, on October 22, 1934. It was alleged, but not agreed, that the injuries and death were caused by negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">The Federal statute under which the action was brought is U. S. C. (1934 ed.) Title 46, \u00a7 688, which provides that \u201cin case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury [i.e. in the course of his employment] the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.\u201d The statute was put into that form by amendment contained in the merchant marine act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, \u00a7 33, 41 U. S. Sts. at Large, 1007. The provision as' to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d does not exclude the jurisdiction of State courts. <em>Bainbridge </em>v. <em>Merchants &amp; Miners Transportation Co. </em>287 U. S. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The defence is, that having secured by insurance payment of compensation to its employees under the Federal longshoremen\u2019s and harbor workers\u2019 compensation act of March 4, 1927, c. 509, 44 U. S. Sts. at Large, 1424, U. S. C. (1934 ed.) Title 33, \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, the defendant was relieved of other liability. The judge ordered a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The longshoremen\u2019s and harbor workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tion act provides that the liability of the employer under that act \u201cshall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death,\u201d where payment of compensation under the act has been secured by insurance, as in this case. U. S. C. (1934 ed.) Title 33, \u00a7 905. But compensation is payable under the act for disability or death of an employee only \u201cif the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\u201d U. S. C. (1934 ed.) Title 33, \u00a7 903 (a). It is plain that the injury occurred upon the navigable waters of the United States, and that recovery through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings might not validly have been provided by the law of this Commonwealth. <em>Atlantic Transport Co. of West Virginia </em>v. <em>Imbrovek, </em>234 U. S. 52. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>285 U. S. 22, 39-42. <em>Minnie </em>v. <em>Port Huron Terminal Co. </em>295 U. S. 647. <em>Duart </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>231 Mass. 313. <em>Wolf\u2019s Case, </em>285 Mass. 181, 186. <em>Nogueira </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>281 U. S. 128, 135. <em>Northern Coal &amp; Dock Co. </em>v. <em>Strand, </em>278 U. S. 142. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>281 U. S. 233. <em>Lauzon\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">Then follows in the act a special limitation upon compensation under that act, upon which this case turns. It is as follows: \u201cNo compensation shall be payable in respect of the disability or death of (1) A master or member of a crew of any vessel, nor any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net ...\u201d U. S. C. (1934 ed.) Title 33, \u00a7 903 (a). A person described in that limitation is not within the word \u201cemployee\u201d as used in the act. U. S. C. (1934 ed.) Title 33, \u00a7 902 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The plaintiff contends that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cmember of a crew\u201d of the vessel being unloaded, and consequently not an \u201cemployee\u201d under the longshoremen\u2019s and harbor workers\u2019 compensation act, nor entitled to its protection, nor barred from seeking another remedy against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\">It is true that a stevedore is held to be a \u201cseaman\u201d within the section of the merchant marine act under which this action is brought, on the ground that loading and unloading the vessel constituted a service formerly performed by the crew, and liability to a person under that act for an injury in the course of that service ought not to depend upon the accident of his being employed by the ship or by another. <em>International Stevedoring Co. </em>v. <em>Haverty, </em>272 U. S. 50. <em>Buzynski </em>v. <em>Luckenbach Steamship Co. Inc. </em>277 U. S. 226. <em>Northern Coal &amp; Dock Co. </em>v. Strand, 278 U. S. 142, 145, 146. <em>Jamison </em>v. <em>Encarnacion, </em>281 U. S. 635, 639. <em>Uravic </em>v. <em>F. Jarka Co. Inc. </em>282 U. S. 234. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Goltra, </em>293 U. S. 155, 156. <em>Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>302 U. S. 90, 92. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad </em>v. <em>Zahrobsky, </em>68 Fed. (2d) 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">But though a stevedore is a \u201cseaman\u201d within that act, it does not follow that he is a \u201cmember of a crew\u201d of a \u201cvessel\u201d and consequently excluded from the longshoremen\u2019s and harbor workers\u2019 compensation act. In <em>Nogueira </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>281 U. S. 128, 136, Hughes, C.J., said, \u201cIt appears that the bill [which became the longshoremen\u2019s and harbor workers\u2019 compensation act] originally excluded a master or members of a crew of a vessel, but was amended so as to extend to them the benefits of compensation (House Rep. No. 1767, 69th Cong., 2d sess.). As these seamen preferred to remain outside of the provisions of the bill, they were finally excluded and the bill was passed with the exceptions above-quoted. (Cong. Rec., 69th Cong., 2d. sess., vol. 68, pt. 5, p. 5908.) There was no exclusion of stevedores or of those sustaining injuries upon navigable waters in loading or unloading a vessel unless it was under eighteen tons net.\u201d See also <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Goltra, </em>293 U. S. 155, 160. In <em>Uravic </em>v. <em>F. Jarka Co. Inc. </em>282 U. S. 234, 239, Holmes, J., said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cWhile the \u00a7 33-[U. S. C. (1934 ed.) Title 46, \u00a7 688] is construed to give the rights of seamen to stevedores, it does not say or mean that stevedores are to be regarded as seamen on the particular vessel upon which for the moment they happen to be at work.\u201d We think that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was within the protection of the longshoremen\u2019s and harbor workers\u2019 compensation act, and that the remedy under that act is exclusive of any other remedy against the employer. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Christiensen Steamship Co. </em>53 Fed.
