The board of aldermen, to which the application was referred by the building commissioner, declined to approve it and denied it. The building commissioner exercised no independent judgment, but \u201cin accordance with this decision\u201d of the board of aldermen informed the petitioner that its application for a permit to build \u201cis hereby refused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The single justice found that the facts were as stated in the report of an auditor, and reported the case without decision. The writer of this opinion would be willing to decide the merits of the controversy upon the facts reported, but a majority of the court think that the general rule ought to be applied that mandamus cannot be invoked while another remedy exists. <em>Bellevue Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Building Commissioner of Boston, </em>299 Mass. 73. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Building Commissioner of Boston, </em>263 Mass. 589, 593. <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Building Commissioner of Boston, </em>257 Mass. 82, 86. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Mayor of Cambridge, </em>253 Mass. 193, 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The record before us does not show the authority under which the city enacted the building ordinance in question, but we suppose it was G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 143, \u00a7 3, author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>izing ordinances and by-laws regulating the \u201cinspection, materials, construction, alteration, repair, height, area, location and use of buildings and other structures.\u201d The ordinance required \u201cevery person intending to erect any building\u201d to apply to the building commissioner for a permit to erect it. If the building \u201cis intended to be used for a mercantile or business purpose,\u201d the application \u201cmay, if deemed advisable by the commissioner, be referred to the board of aldermen for approval, before being granted.\u201d A further provision created a board of appeal, and declared: \u201cAn applicant for a permit hereunder whose application has been refused, may appeal therefrom within thirty days to said Board.\u201d Although the practical construction of this provision has been to limit the right of appeal to decisions of the building commissioner made without reference to the board of aldermen, we are unable to see from the fragments of the ordinance put before us why the right of appeal should be so limited. The petitioner took the precaution of appealing to the board of appeal. It must pursue that remedy before coming to this court upon a petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
