It is provided by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 41, \u00a7 38A, as amended by St. 1936, c. 201, that a city or town \u201cmay by ordinance or by-law, notwithstanding any other provision of law, general or special, provide that the collector of taxes shall collect, under the title of city or town collector, all accounts due the city or town, and may in like manner define his powers and duties in relation to the collection of such accounts.\u201d Accordingly the city of Woburn had an ordinance by which the \u201cCollector of taxes\u201d was thereafter to be \"designated as the City Collector\u201d and was directed, in addition to his duties as \"Tax Collector,\u201d to \"collect, under the title of City Collector, all accounts due the City as provided by\u201d the statute. The statute and the ordinance did not create a new and separate office of \u201cCity Collector,\u201d but merely added new duties to the existing office of \u201cCollector of taxes\u201d to be performed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the incumbent of that office under the designation of \u201cCity Collector.\u201d The same officer is variously mentioned in the ordinances as \u201cCollector of taxes,\u201d \u201cCity Collector,\u201d \u201cTax Collector\u201d and simply \u201cCollector.\u201d When, therefore, the city council on July 7, 1938, voted to \u201cproceed to the election of a City Collector,\u201d and all present but one voted for the petitioner, and no reference was made to \u201cCollector of taxes,\u201d there can be no reasonable doubt that the council intended to elect and did elect the petitioner to the single office designated by the ordinance first above mentioned as city collector, but more commonly in the statutes and elsewhere referred to under the name of collector of taxes. <em>People </em>v. Akin, 17 Ill. 167. <em>Questions and Answers, </em>107 Maine, 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">So also the condition of the petitioner\u2019s bond, which after reciting his appointment as \u201cTax Collector\u201d bound him faithfully to perform \u201call the duties of his office as required by law,\u201d protected the city with respect to all funds to be collected by the petitioner in his official capacity as collector of taxes, including \u201call accounts\u201d so collected and not merely taxes alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">There is another point relating to the bond which seems to have been saved by exception and argued on the respondents\u2019 brief and with which we must therefore deal. There is in Woburn an ordinance (Revised Ordinances, 1934, c. 3, \u00a7 2) applicable to various officers, including the \u201cCity Collector,\u201d requiring such officers to give bonds \u201cin such form as the city solicitor shall approve\u201d for the faithful discharge of the duties of their offices and for their accounting as required by law for moneys coming into their hands. The surety company executing such a bond is to be approved by the mayor. The ordinance includes this, \u201cThe bond of every such officer except that of City Clerk shall be executed and approved and delivered before the officer enters upon the duties of his office, and within thirty days after his election. Failure to give such bond within the required time shall render the election void.\u201d The petitioner failed to comply with this ordinance in that the form of his bond was never approved by the city solicitor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>and the surety company executing it was never approved by the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In our opinion, however, these requirements of the ordinance are no longer in force as to bonds of collectors of taxes. Prior to 1916 there was in R. L. c. 25, \u00a7 77, a simple provision that a collector of taxes should give bond to the town in a sum and with sureties approved by the selectmen. By \u00a7 1 of chapter 131 of the acts of that year a provision was added that the form of the bond should be approved by the tax commissioner. The section was revised by St. 1926, c. 65, \u00a7 2. The provision for approval of the form of the bond by the commissioner (now designated as the commissioner of corporations and taxation) was retained, but the power of the selectmen (or mayor and aldermen) to fix the sum was made subject to the condition that: such sum should not be less than an amount established by the commissioner, and a requirement was added that a copy of each such bond should be delivered to the commissioner. The former provision for approval of the sureties by the selectmen was omitted, probably because it had already been enacted by St. 1924, c. 404, \u00a7 9, that every municipal officer (including collectors of taxes) required to furnish a bond with surety should furnish a surety company as such surety. It was also provided in the 1926 act that the bond should be given before the commitment to the collector of any taxes of any year. Finally by St. 1937, c. 143, \u00a7 5, a new sentence was added reading, \u201cIf the collector does not give bond as herein required, the selectmen or mayor and aldermen may declare the office vacant and the vacancy may be filled in the manner prescribed by section forty or sixty-one A of chapter forty-one, as the case may be.\u201d The entire section as it stood at the time of the petitioner\u2019s election is found in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 60, \u00a7 13, as amended by St. 1937, c. 143, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">These successive changes disclose a legislative purpose to standardize the form and the security of collectors\u2019 bonds and in large measure to remove these matters from local control. It seems to have been intended that only one bond should be given. The requirement of the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>that the city solicitor approve the form of that bond is inconsistent with the provision of the statute by which control over the form is delegated to the commissioner. The provision of the ordinance that failure to give a bond in accordance with the ordinance \u201cshall render the election void\u201d is inconsistent with the provision of the statute that \u201cIf the collector does not give bond as herein required [i.e. as required by the statute], the selectmen or mayor and aldermen may declare the office vacant . . . .\u201d The petitioner gave a bond in compliance with the statute and is entitled to hold the office to which he has been elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\">It is now provided in substance by St. 1939, c. 44, enacted since the hearing of this case, that collectors authorized to collect \u201call accounts\u201d shall give bond before the collection of any account not included in a previous bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
