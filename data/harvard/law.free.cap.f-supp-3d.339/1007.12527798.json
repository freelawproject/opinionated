Nunley, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court pursuant to Plaintiffs' and Defendants' Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. (ECF Nos. 51 and 52.) Plaintiffs Tracy Rifle and Pistol LLC (\"Tracy Rifle\"), Michael Baryla (\"Baryla\"), Ten Percent Firearms (\"Ten Percent\"), Wesley Morris (\"Morris\"), Sacramento Black Rifle, Inc., Robert Adams, PRK Arms, Inc., Jeffrey Mullen, Imbert &amp; Smithers, Inc. (\"Imbert &amp; Smithers\"), and Alex Rolsky (\"Rolsky\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") oppose Defendants' Motion. (ECF No. 55.) Defendants Kamala D. Harris, in her official capacity as Attorney General, and Stephen J. Lindley, in his official capacity of Chief of California Department of Justice Bureau of Firearms (\"DOJ\"), (collectively, the \"Government\") oppose Plaintiffs' Motion. (ECF No. 56.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, (ECF No. 51), and DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, (ECF No. 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, retail firearms dealerships and their owners, argue that California Penal Code \u00a7 26820 is unconstitutional under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and therefore seek declaratory and injunctive relief. (ECF No. 22.) Section 26820 provides: \"No handgun or imitation handgun, or placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof, shall be displayed in any part of the premises where it can readily be seen from the outside.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2026820\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 26820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several Plaintiffs have been cited for violations of \u00a7 26820, and several more would engage in speech prohibited by the statute but for the enforcement of it. (ECF No. 55-2 at 2-3.) The parties do not dispute the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about February 23, 2010, the DOJ inspected Ten Percent and discovered a metal sign shaped like a revolver in its parking lot. (ECF No. 55-2 at 2.) The DOJ inspector informed Morris, Ten Percent's owner, that the sign violated the handgun restriction, and Ten Percent removed the sign. (ECF No. 55-2 at 2-3; ECF No. 51-4 at 16.) The DOJ then issued a citation to Ten Percent and Morris for violating the handgun advertising ban. (ECF No. 55-2 at 3.) On September 12, 2014, the DOJ inspected Tracy Rifle. (ECF No. 55-2 at 2.) At the time of the inspection, Tracy Rifle's exterior windows were covered with large vinyl decals depicting four firearms-three handguns and a rifle. (ECF No. 55-2 at 2.) The DOJ cited Tracy Rifle and Baryla, Tracy Rifle's owner, for violating \u00a7 26820 and required them to take corrective action by February 11, 2015. (ECF No. 55-2 at 2; ECF No. 51-4 at 6.) On January 28, 2015, the DOJ inspected Imbert &amp; Smithers and found a logo depicting an outline of a single-action revolver displayed on the building's exterior. (ECF No. 55-2 at 3.) The DOJ cited Imbert &amp; Smithers and Rolsky, Imbert &amp; Smithers's owner, for violating \u00a7 26820 and required them to take corrective action by July 28, 2015. (ECF No. 55-2 at 3; ECF No. 51-4 at 37.) All Plaintiffs wish to display truthful, nonmisleading on-site handgun advertising that is visible from the outside of their dealerships, and would do so, but for \u00a7 26820 and the threat of losing their dealer's licenses. (ECF No. 56-1 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs request this Court enter a declaratory judgment stating \u00a7 26820 violates the First Amendment and enter an injunction enjoining the enforcement of \u00a7 26820. (ECF No. 22 at 8-9.) Plaintiffs and the Government each move for summary judgment. (ECF Nos. 51 and 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Government argues its objective of preventing handgun suicides is achieved in two steps. \"First, the advertisements restricted by section 26820 inhibit purchases by people with impulsive personality traits, a conclusion supported by Professor Gundlach's expert report.\" (ECF No. 52 at 18.) \"[S]econd, people with impulsive personality traits are at a higher risk for committing suicide, a conclusion supported by Professor Mann's expert report.\" (ECF No. 52 at 18.) The Government argues suicide is the leading cause of death for purchasers in the year after a handgun purchase, thus California's ten-day waiting period,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026815\">\n     Cal.

The Government's argument that \u00a7 26820 directly advances its interest in handgun crime follows a similar vein-advertisements restricted by \u00a7 26820 tend to induce purchase by people with impulsive personality traits, and impulsive people are more likely to engage in crime. (ECF No. 52 at 23-24.) Thus, the\n    Government's theory is essentially that an impulsive person will see a handgun sign outside a store, will impulsively buy the gun (although the Government does not identify a specific purpose for the purchase), and then, at some unspecified future time likely years later, the person's impulsive temperament will lead him to impulsively misuse the handgun that he bought in response to seeing the sign.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The Government claims \u00a7 26820 directly advances both its interests because it inhibits people with \"impulsive personality traits\" from purchasing a handgun in the first place.

The Government aims to stop a group of law-abiding adults with the shared personality trait of \"impulsiveness\" from making what it sees the bad decision of purchasing a handgun. The Government believes if it can inhibit such persons from making the initial decision to purchase a handgun, it will save them from harming themselves or others with the handgun at some later date, likely years from the initial purchase. However, the Government may not restrict speech that persuades adults, who are neither criminals nor suffer from mental illness, from purchasing a legal and constitutionally-protected product, merely because it distrusts their personality trait and the decisions that personality trait may lead them to make later down the road. Moreover, in the effort to restrict impulsive individuals from purchasing handguns, the Government has restricted speech to all adults, irrespective of whether they have this personality trait.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Therefore, the Government impermissibly seeks to achieve its goals through the indirect means of restricting certain speech by certain speakers based on the fear that a certain subset of the population with a particular personality\n    trait could potentially make what the Government contends is a bad decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In addition to the Supreme Court's rejection of this type of approach, \u00a7 26820 is fatally underinclusive. \"[U]nderinclusivity is relevant to\n    <em>\n     Central Hudson's\n    </em>\n    direct advancement prong because it 'may diminish the credibility of the government's rationale for restricting speech in the first place.' \"\n    <em>\n     Valle Del Sol\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547260\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/808/#p816\">\n     709 F.3d at 824\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Metro Lights, L.L.C. v.

The Government offers no meaningful distinction between this case and\n    <em>\n     Pitt News\n    </em>\n    . Plaintiffs could display a large neon sign reading \"GUNS GUNS GUNS\" or a 15-foot depiction of a modern sporting rifle, and this would be permissible. Moreover, Plaintiffs are free to advertise through any other channels of communication. This includes a print advertisement with a map to the store, a billboard with directions to the store (which could be blocks away), or a radio jingle that makes it easy to find the store. The underinclusivity of this law gravely diminishes the credibility of the Government's rationale.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    More fundamentally, however, the Government has not demonstrated that \u00a7 26820 would have any effect on handgun suicide or violence. The Government's first expert, Professor Gregory T. Gundlach, opines that \"it is reasonable to conclude that the display of a handgun or imitation handgun or placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof, in any part of the premises of a California licensed handgun seller, that can be readily seen from the outside, contributes in a positive way to the impulsive purchase of handguns.\" (ECF No. 43-1 \u00b6 10.) Professor Gundlach defines an \"impulsive purchase\" as \"an unplanned and sudden buying act, in response to subjective or external stimuli, accompanied by a powerful and persistent urge.\" (ECF No. 43-1 \u00b6 31.) According to Professor Gundlach, \"[i]mpulse buying is distinguished from other forms of buying based on the fact that it is primarily driven by strong hedonic temptations of immediate satisfaction and improved mood with little or no regard for consequences.\" (ECF No. 43-1 \u00b6 34.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    In reaching his conclusion, Professor Gundlach relies on studies of impulsive purchases generally. (ECF No. 43-1 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 50-52.) The question, however, is not whether advertising restrictions can generally reduce impulsive purchases, but rather whether \u00a7 26820 directly and materially advances the Government's interest in reducing handgun purchases among impulsive people and in turn the risk of handgun suicide or crime. The little evidence Professor Gundlach relies on to tie impulsive purchases to handguns includes a remark by a firearm manufacturer's executive during an earnings call, a passing mention in an industry publication, and two commenters on firearms blogs. (ECF No. 43-1 \u00b6 33.) This evidence is trivial. Notably, it is\n    unclear whether the use of the word \"impulse\" in any of these scenarios refers to the same \"impulse\" referred to by Professor Gundlach. Further, a study Professor Gundlach relies on explains that firearms fall into a product category least likely to involve impulse purchasing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Clinton Amos et al.,\n    <em>\n     A Meta-Analysis of Consumer Impulse Buying\n    </em>\n    , 31 J. Retailing &amp; Consumer Servs. 86 (2014) (\"An examination of product type did produce substantial difference as impulse buying was greater for fashion merchandise than supermarket purchases and general merchandise.\"). Handguns are substantially different from most purchases, both in terms of product type and cost. However, none of the studies Professor Gundlach relies on specifically address the impact of advertising on impulse purchases of handguns, let alone the impact specifically caused by the signage prohibited by \u00a7 26820. Nor does Professor Gundlach explain why the impulse purchases of handguns would be similar to other products. He similarly fails to address whether California handgun purchase regulations, such as the ten-day waiting period or required firearms law and safety test, would have an impact on impulsive handgun purchases. Thus, Professor Gundlach's data simply does not reveal that \u00a7 26820 reduces impulsive handgun purchases, let alone to a material degree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The Government does not satisfy its burden of materiality on a content-based commercial speech restriction by procuring an expert who, after citing some statistics and studies not directly related to the issue at hand, merely finds it \"reasonable to conclude\" that a statute does what the Government says it does and fails to express any opinion regarding the magnitude of this conclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     44 Liquormart\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745611\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/484/#p503\">\n     517 U.S. at 506\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745611\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/484/#p503\">\n     116 S.Ct. 1495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (plurality opinion) (holding the government failed to meet the direct advancement prong when it \"presented no evidence to suggest that its speech prohibition [would]\n    <em>\n     significantly\n    </em>\n    reduce marketwide consumption\" of alcohol).

John Mann to demonstrate that \"people with impulsive personality traits are at a higher risk for committing suicide.\" (ECF No. 52 at 18.) Particularly, \"Professor Mann offers the opinion that people with impulsive personality traits are more likely to make a suicide attempt and that having a handgun in the home further increases the risk that they will.\" (ECF No. 52 at 20.) Professor Mann goes on to explain that \"[s]uicidal behavior is generally impulsive and 70% of suicide attempters act less than one hour after deciding to kill themselves.\" (ECF No. 43-2 \u00b6 24.) Professor Mann did not study the effect of \u00a7 26820 on impulsive handgun purchases, but rather assumes that if the invalidation of \u00a7 26820 would result in an increase in handgun purchases\n    by people with impulsive personality traits, if \u00a7 26820 were invalidated, \"it would result in more handgun suicides in direct proportion to the increase in handgun purchases by a vulnerable subgroup of the general population characterized by more pronounced impulsive personality traits.\" (ECF No. 43-2 \u00b6 15.) The Government also cites several studies that found handgun purchases are associated with an increased risk of suicide for the purchaser and members of the purchaser's household. (ECF No. 52 at 21.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Both Professor Mann's report and the studies the Government cite conclude that impulsive personality traits increase the risk of suicide or are associated with suicide. Plaintiffs do not challenge the accuracy of these conclusions, (ECF No. 55-2 at 24-25), but instead, challenge what they mean. (ECF No. 55 at 20.) Even if these conclusions are valid, they both fail to demonstrate to any degree whether people who impulsively purchase handguns, as opposed to those who non-impulsively purchase handguns or obtain a handgun through means other than store purchase, commit suicide with that handgun. In other words, the Government fails to make the link that impulsive handgun purchases result in impulsive handgun suicides. In fact, according to Professor Mann, the most relevant factor in handgun suicide is not whether the person who commits suicide purchases the handgun (let alone whether they impulsively purchase the handgun), but rather is whether a firearm is available in the home. (ECF No. 55-1 at 28 (\"The gun in the house is what places people at risk. It's not necessarily whether they bought the gun or another family member bought the gun.\").) Professor Mann's opinion thus focuses on the general notion that fewer handguns means less handgun suicide, rather than whether restricting impulsive handgun purchases would reduce handgun suicides. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 43-2 \u00b6 33 (\"The more handguns that are purchased the more handgun suicides will happen.\").) But, the Court already held that the Government may not advance its asserted interests by demonstrating that as a general matter fewer handguns results in less handgun crime and violence. (ECF No. 32 at 10.) Ultimately, the Government fails to show that \u00a7 26820 has any direct or material effect on reducing handgun suicides because it fails to bridge the gap between those who impulsively purchase handguns and those who impulsively commit suicide with a handgun. Instead, the Government relies on mere speculation and conjecture. Accordingly, the Government fails to demonstrate that an impulsive handgun purchase results in an impulsive handgun suicide, i.e., that an impulsive handgun purchase is actually a \"bad decision.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Although the bulk of the Government's argument focuses on suicide, the Government still maintains, as it did in the preliminary injunction stage, that \u00a7 26820 also directly advances California's interest in reducing handgun crimes. (ECF No. 52 at 23-24.) The Government still, however, has not produced evidence that \u00a7 26820 reduces impulsive handgun purchases and that this reduction in turn leads to less impulsive handgun crime, beyond what California's ten-day waiting period already provides. In the absence of evidence and with no common-sense relation, the Government has not met its burden of demonstrating that \u00a7 26820 directly and materially advances that interest. In sum, the Government fails to show that \u00a7 26820 has any effect on handgun suicide or crime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Whether \u00a7 26820 Is More Extensive Than Necessary\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Finally, the last prong of the\n    <em>\n     Central Hudson\n    </em>\n    test requires the Government to demonstrate that the challenged statute \"is no more extensive than necessary to further\" the Government's interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <em>\n     Cent.

For example, California has several laws that, if enforced, further its substantial interest in reducing handgun suicide and crime without restricting speech. The most notable of these laws imposes a ten-day waiting period before a purchaser can receive a gun.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026815\">\n     Cal. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 26815\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), 27540(a). This law, unlike \u00a7 26820, is precisely related to the Government's interests in preventing handgun suicide and violence as it \"provides time not only for background checks, but for the purchaser to reflect on what he or she is doing, and, perhaps, for second thoughts that might prevent gun violence.\"\n    <em>\n     Silvester v.

Additionally, California limits purchasers to one handgun purchase within a thirty-day period, \u00a7 27535, and requires the purchaser complete a firearm safety certificate program, \u00a7\u00a7 31610-31670. Unlike \u00a7 26820, which purportedly serves only to deter the impulsive purchase of a handgun (ECF No. 58 at 11), these laws act directly to deter the potential harmful consequences of handgun purchases without restricting speech. They allow purchasers not only the time to reflect on their purchases, but also provide an opportunity for purchasers to learn about gun safety. Further, to deter handgun crime, the Government has an arsenal of criminal laws it may enforce. Thus, the Government could further its asserted interests simply by enforcing these existing laws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    If the Government considers its existing safeguards inadequate to combat handgun\n    suicide and crime, it may pass additional direct regulations within constitutionally permissible boundaries.

For example, the Government could run an educational campaign focused on the dangers of handguns or the consequences of impulsive decision making. Although it appears the Government has rejected this idea, it has not demonstrated why this alternative would not be more effective than \u00a7 26820. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that \"educational campaigns focused on the problems [at issue] might prove to be more effective\" than advertising regulations designed to decrease demand of a product.\n    <em>\n     44 Liquormart\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745611\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/484/#p503\">\n     517 U.S. at 507\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745611\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/484/#p503\">\n     116 S.Ct. 1495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (plurality opinion).
