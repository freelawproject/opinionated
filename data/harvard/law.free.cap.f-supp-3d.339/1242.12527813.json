The complaint states that Count One is for strict liability and Count Two is for negligence. Plaintiff alleges that while he was working as a conductor for defendant on October 1, 2016, the train on which he was assigned to work was equipped with a defective and insufficient coupler. He alleges the coupler broke in the course of the operation of the train, which required plaintiff to change out the\n   broken knuckle. During the course of doing so, plaintiff suffered injury. Plaintiff contends the defective and insufficient coupler is a violation of the FSAA and imposes strict liability on defendant. He further asserts that defendant failed to provide a safe workplace in violation of the FELA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(a) F.R.Cv.P.

The court finds that principle inapposite here. A non-movant may not create a genuine dispute of material fact by simply challenging the credibility of a witness, even if the witness is a party. Rather, the opposing party must offer specific facts that call into question the credibility of the witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Desia v.

Causation would be straightforward if, for example, a coupler detached and this caused a railroad car to derail, injuring a passenger in the car. In the present case, plaintiff was not injured until he sought to repair or replace the knuckle. The obvious question is whether the applicable standard establishes \"but-for causation.\" In other words, if not for the knuckle breaking, plaintiff would not have attempted to replace the knuckle, which he contends led to his injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Indeed, the dissent in\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   expressed the view that the Supreme Court was establishing \"no limit at all. It is simply 'but for' causation.\"\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924482,12450501\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/685/\">\n    564 U.S. at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924482,12450501\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/685/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). This court is not persuaded, at least in a case of the present type. For example, the majority in\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   cited\n   with approval\n   <em>\n    Richards v. Consol.

In\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   , a defective brake malfunctioned en route, and the employee was injured while inspecting underneath the train to locate the problem. In the same footnote, the Supreme Court also cited with approval\n   <em>\n    Norfolk Southern R. Co. v.

Both cases were submitted to a jury. The Supreme Court stated that the causal link was \"hardly farfetched,\" but that those courts observed that the evidence did not show mere \"but-for causation.\"\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924482,12450501\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/685/\">\n    564 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   700 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924482,12450501\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/685/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[I]f as a result of a defective appliance a plaintiff is required to take certain actions and he or she is injured while taking those actions, the issue of causation generally should be submitted to a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123230\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/428/\">\n    330 F.3d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kukowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20834235\">\n    2018 WL 834235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *15 (parties' dueling theories of causation \"present the quintessential issue of fact for the jury\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This is logical, because if the plaintiff's negligence was the sole cause of the injury, then the violation of FSAA could not have contributed in whole or in part to the injury.\n   <em>\n    Onysko v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway Co. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20372235\">\n    2017 WL 372235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 (M.D.Penn.2017). Plaintiff contends that defendant has waived any \"sole cause\" defense because it was not stated as an affirmative defense in defendant's answer. The court disagrees. The liberal pleading rules established by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the pleading of affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    Stapp v. Curry Co.

The court must avoid hyper-technicality in pleading requirements and focus instead on enforcing the actual purpose of the rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=672%20Fed.%20Appx.%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The purpose of Rule 8(c) F.R.Cv.P. is to give the opposing party notice of the defense and an opportunity to respond.\n   <em>\n    Ahmad v.

Defendant's answer states defendant \"affirmatively asserts the theory of intervening cause as a complete or partial bar to any recovery by Plaintiff.\" (# 6 at 3, \u00b6 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The phrase \"intervening cause\" is usually associated with traditional proximate cause analysis, but the court finds it close enough. The alleged intervening cause is obviously plaintiff's conduct. The court sees no prejudice or unfair surprise, as proof of causation is part and parcel of plaintiff's burden of proof. Accordingly, the court finds no waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the alternative, plaintiff argues that a sole-cause defense is futile because defendant cannot meet the high threshold. The court finds this to be an issue for the jury. Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v. Penn R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1135153\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/156/877/\">\n    156 F.2d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir.1946). In that case, the court disapproved the district court's sole-proximate-cause jury instruction where \"there was\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   of any independent acts of negligence by the decedent that were the sole cause of the accident and his death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1135153\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/156/877/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1135153\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/156/877/\">\n    at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, defendant has pointed to sufficient evidence to present a genuine dispute of material fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   # 43 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Turning to plaintiff's standard FELA claim (count two - negligence), plaintiff must prove the traditional common-law elements of negligence. These are: duty, breach of duty, foreseeability and causation.\n   <em>\n    Rine v. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Ry. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203599182\">\n    2012 WL 3599182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (N.D.Okla.2012). Because the court has found as a matter of law that the defective coupler constitutes a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation under FSAA, it therefore establishes duty and breach of duty as a matter of law. The\n   parties have of course addressed causation, but have not addressed foreseeability. The court finds summary judgment is not appropriate in plaintiff's favor regarding foreseeability and causation. Therefore, the FELA general negligence claim will also be submitted to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the FSAA claim, plaintiff argues that he is entitled to partial summary judgment as to defendant's defense of contributory negligence. The governing statute is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the claim is one of general negligence under FELA, \"a plaintiff's contributory negligence will not bar recovery, but it may reduce damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Kukowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20834235\">\n    2018 WL 834235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *16 (D.Minn.2018). By contrast, \"Defendant may not assert contributory negligence as a defense to Plaintiff's FSAA claim.\" Rather, \"once a violation of the FSAA is established ... a plaintiff's contributory negligence, if any, may not be considered at all.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20834235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant essentially concedes the matter as to the FSAA claim, but not as to the general negligence claim under FELA. The court agrees with defendant. \"[C]ontributory negligence remains a viable partial defense to a claim of general negligence, but it may not be used when a claim is predicated on a statutory violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20834235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a sense, the basis for plaintiff's general negligence claim is also \"predicated on a statutory violation,\" but such was the situation in\n   <em>\n    Kukowski\n   </em>\n   , and that court nevertheless ruled as described. The interplay when both an FSAA claim and a FELA claim are asserted is somewhat convoluted, but the court is persuaded the foregoing is correct under the present record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is the order of the court that the motion of the plaintiff for partial summary judgment (# 37) is hereby granted in part and denied in part.
