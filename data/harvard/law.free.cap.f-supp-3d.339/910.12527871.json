Defendants have filed a Response (Doc. 30), and Plaintiffs have filed a Reply (Doc. 31). Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to summary judgment on the first claim of their two-count Complaint, for violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FHA) claim against Defendant Villa de Paz Apartments, LLC (hereinafter \"Villa de Paz\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In August, 2016, Plaintiffs Zhou and Burton entered into a lease to rent an apartment unit at Villa de Paz, located in Phoenix, Arizona. Plaintiff Zhou had two minor children, B.S. and G.Y. living with her and Burton\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the time. In October 2016, Plaintiff Lucas Sesanto and April McCarty entered into a lease to rent an apartment unit at Villa de Paz. Their two minor children, B.S. and G.Y. lived with them at the time. The resident manager at Villa de Paz was Janice Bessette (hereinafter \"Bessette\"). During Plaintiffs' tenancy, Villa de Paz sent them a notice entitled \"Villa De Paz Residents Please Read!\" which read, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Minor occupants are [sic] need to be supervised at all times! Parents are responsible of [sic] their children when playing outside; please keep your children in front of your units. The noise level has been out of control during the day and into the evenings. Not following the rules of the property will result in a 10 day notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Docs. 27-4, Exh. 1; 30-3, Exh. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Villa de Paz also sent a \"reminder\" notice to Plaintiffs that read, in relevant part, as follows: \"Residents please remember under age minors must be supervised at all times.\" (Docs. 27-4, Exh. 2; 30-4, Exh. B.) In another written communication to Plaintiffs, Villa de Paz reminds them that \"children must have parental supervision while playing outside at all times.\" (Doc. 27-4, Exh. 12.) The supervision rules applied to all minors under the age of 18. Villa de Paz does not dispute these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Whether and to what extent the supervision rules were enforced is disputed by the\n   parties. Plaintiff Zhou claims that in September 2016, her two children were outside playing unsupervised when Bessette told them to go inside. (Doc. 27-2, Decl. Zhou \u00b6 3). On another occasion in late 2016, a male tenant yelled at her daughter and another child who were playing outside at the complex that they needed to be quiet and go home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff Zhou saw this man go into Bessette's apartment unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Zhou confronted Bessette the next day after receiving a notice that read in part, \"no standing, walking, sitting, dancing on picnic tables is allowed; this is a safety issue,\" and \"[m]inor occupants need to be supervised at all times.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff Zhou also claims that on other occasions Bessette told her that she preferred that Zhou be outside with the kids when they are playing, and on other occasions stood outside and glared at Zhou as the children played. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July, 2017, near the end of Zhou's lease, she asked Bessette if they could go on a month-to-month tenancy, but claims that Bessette told her that \"[w]e do not do month-to-month anymore.\" (Doc. 27-2, Decl. Zhou \u00b6 8.) At all times relevant to this lawsuit, Villa de Paz did not offer month-to-month tenancies. (Doc. 30-5, Exh. C at 35-36.) Zhou did not renew her lease and moved out of the apartment complex in August, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June, 2017, the 13-year old son of Plaintiff Sesanto, B.S., was walking through the complex, \"bouncing a racket [sic] ball,\" when Bessette took his ball and then said, \"[i]f I see you with this type of ball again, you'll be getting kicked out.\" (Doc. 27-4, Decl. Sesanto \u00b6 3.) On several other occasions, B.S. would be playing in the common areas with balls and a frisbee and was told by Bessette to stop playing with those items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) When Sesanto complained to Bessette, she would respond, \"[t]his is where people live. It's not a park.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Desanto received a notice sent to the community that read: \"PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS NOT A PARK: NO BALL PLAYING ALLOWED.\" (Docs. 27-4, Exh. 12) (emphasis in original). The notice also read that \"[t]his is not a community park. This is our home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September, 2017, Sesanto went to the office to pay rent and commented to Bessette that the rules were too strict and needed to be relaxed. (Doc. 2704, Decl. Lucas Sesanto \u00b6 4.) The following day he received a notice of termination of lease, though he was current on his rent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Villa de Paz later filed an eviction notice against Sesanto. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sesanto does not dispute that he never received any notices of lease violation for any violation of Villa de Paz's rules regarding supervision of minors, although he received lease notices for violating other community policies. (Doc. 30-7, Exh. E at 46-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Villa de Paz asserts that Plaintiffs were never given notice of lease violations due to minors being unsupervised. (Docs. 30-1 \u00b6 1.) Villa de Paz also disputes Plaintiff Zhou's version of events relating to her daughter playing outside: Villa de Paz claims that Bessette saw Zhou's four-year old daughter with a non-resident who appeared to be seven or eight years older, and who appeared to be cursing and directing inappropriate comments toward her, which is why Bessette told her to go inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted if the evidence shows there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). The moving party must produce sufficient evidence to persuade the court that there is no genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nissan Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Conversely,\n   to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must show that there are genuine issues of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

A material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and a factual issue is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p250\">\n    at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p250\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

If the nonmoving party would bear the burden of persuasion at trial, the moving party may carry its initial burden of production under Rule 56(a) by producing \"evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's case,\" or by showing, \"after suitable discovery,\" that the \"nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element of its claim or defense to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Nissan Fire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11533921\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/1099/#p1102\">\n    210 F.3d at 1105-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(a), the nonmoving party must produce evidence to support its claim or defense by more than simply showing \"there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.
