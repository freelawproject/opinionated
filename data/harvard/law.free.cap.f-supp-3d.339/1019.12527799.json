Wesco claims that in May 2016 Liberty stopped making payments.

The fourth and fifth causes of action seek declaratory relief that, if it is entitled to reimbursement, it must satisfy only a single $100,000 retention. In its sixth cause of action, the JPA seeks a declaration that Liberty breached its insurance contract by failing to pay reimbursement for losses when the claims were due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Wesco's first cross-claim asserts that Liberty must pay the entirety of the Smith and Velazquez claims. Wesco's second cross-claim asserts that it is entitled to \"time on the risk\" allocation if it has any obligation to pay as to the Velazquez or Smith claims. Wesco's third cross-claim asserts that the two insurers allegedly reached an agreement to allocate expenses for the Smith and Velazquez claims. Fourth, Wesco seeks reimbursement for any sums paid, because it asserts that 100% of liability falls on Liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Liberty seeks in its motion for summary judgment a declaration that:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (1) By the terms of the insurance policy that Liberty issued to the JPA, no coverage is afforded for loss incurred by the JPA with respect to cumulative injury to employees, where the employees' last exposure to injurious workplace conditions occurred after the end of the Liberty policy period\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (2) The terms of the Liberty policy are not nullified or superseded by operation of the California Labor Code\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (3) Liberty did not enter into an actual or implied contract with Wesco to waive the terms of the Liberty policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dkt.

The excess insurer, on the other hand, does not pay\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   worker's compensation benefits but rather reimburses the JPA after the JPA has paid these benefits. Excess insurance under California law is optional and not required by any workers' compensation statutory scheme.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203702.8\">\n    Cal.

B. at 54 (\"1. the bodily injury (including cumulative trauma) by accident must occur during the policy period ... 2. the bodily injury (including cumulative trauma) by disease must be caused or aggravated by the conditions of your employment.

Liberty Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As the Court has determined that Section 5500.5 is irrelevant to an excess policy of a self-insurer, these provisions do not apply. Therefore, the remaining issue is whether or not the Smith and Velasquez claims fall within the language of the Liberty Policy as written. Wesco argues the express language of the Liberty policy imposes the \"last exposure date\" limitation only on bodily injury by disease claims and that the Smith and Velasquez claims do not constitute \"diseases\" because they are injuries caused accidentally by repetitive motions and the long term effects of lifting objects. Liberty argues that cumulative injury by disease under its policy encompasses \"any and all work-related injury or disease that results from long term 'exposure' to hazardous conditions.\" Dkt. No. 38 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Liberty has the better position. Cumulative injury can constitute \"bodily injury by disease\" in an excess insurer's policy. Indeed, such a possibility is explicitly accounted for in the Wesco policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. B at 54. (\"the bodily injury (including\n   <em>\n    cumulative trauma\n   </em>\n   ) by disease must be caused or aggravated by the conditions of your employment. The employee's last day of last exposure to the conditions causing or aggravating such bodily injury (including\n   <em>\n    cumulative trauma\n   </em>\n   ) by disease must occur during the policy period.\") (emphasis added). Moreover, the Liberty policy explicitly defines an accident to be \"each accident or occurrence or series of accidents of occurrences arising out of\n   <em>\n    any one event\n   </em>\n   \" and that \"the accident is deemed to end 72 hours after the event commences.\" Ex. A at 40. Accordingly, cumulative injury of the type suffered by Smith and Velasquez under the Liberty policy cannot constitute an \"accident\" and must necessarily be accounted for by the \"bodily injury by disease\" provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It is undisputed that the dates of Smith and Velasquez's last exposure to injurious conditions occurred after the Liberty Policy expired on July 1, 2013.

Therefore, these claims fall outside the scope of the Liberty Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Based on the terms of the Wesco Policy, the Court concludes that Wesco is responsible for 100% of any workers compensation benefits paid as to the Smith and Velasquez claims paid in excess of the JPA's retention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. B at 54 (providing excess insurance coverage for amounts in excess of the JPA's retention because the \"employee's last day of last exposure to the conditions causing or aggravating such bodily injury (including cumulative trauma) by disease\" occurred during the policy period). Based on the foregoing, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Liberty's Motion for Summary Judgment as to the First, Second, Third, and Sixth Causes of Action in the JPA's First Amended Complaint and as to Wesco's First, Second, and Fourth Cross-Claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Number of Retention's-JPA's Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiff's Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action in the First Amended Complaint seek a judicial declaration that the JPA is \"only required to satisfy one retention\" and that Liberty is obligated to reimburse the JPA for all unreimbursed expenses incurred in excess of the $100,000 retention as to the Velazquez and Smith claims Liberty argues that it is \"entitled to summary judgment as to all causes of action within the first amended complaint.\" Dkt. No. 33-1. The parties have not sufficiently briefed the number of retentions required to trigger liability. Nonetheless, the Court finds that these causes of action are\n   <strong>\n    MOOT\n   </strong>\n   because Liberty has no obligation to pay for unreimbursed expenses incurred in excess of the $100,000 retention for the Velasquez and Smith claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Breach of Contract Claim-Wesco's Third Cross-Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Liberty also moves for summary judgment as to Wesco's Third Cross-Claim for breach of contract. Wesco has asserted that notwithstanding the terms of the Liberty Policy, Liberty and Wesco entered into an agreement to share the reimbursement of JPA's expenses for the Velazquez and Smith claims in excess of JPA's retention. Dkt. No. 34 at 21-24. Under that agreement, the parties purportedly agreed to the following allocation of claims in excess of JPA's retention: 59.5% (Liberty)/40.5% (Wesco) allocation for the Velasquez claim and a 91.5% (Liberty)/8.5% (Wesco) allocation for the Smith claim. Wesco alleges that Liberty has breached this agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Liberty asserts that Wesco has not provided evidence of such a contract and that Wesco did not identify any documents or witnesses relevant to such an agreement in its Rule 26 disclosures. Dkt. No. 33-4, Topp Decl., Ex. A. Wesco asserts that its counsel Stephen Soskin made an unintentional oversight by failing to identify witnesses and documents related to the breach of contract claim and has since served a \"First Supplement\" of initial disclosures identifying witnesses and documents that Wesco believes establish the existence of a contract between Wesco and Liberty to share the costs of the Velazquez and Smith claims on their relative \"time on the risk.\" Dkt. No. 36 at 28. In these disclosures, Wesco has included a claims summary regarding the Velasquez claim which shows that \"Authority was received from Liberty Mutual for 59.5% of the settlement or $26,775.00.\" Dkt. No. 36-2, Ex. 2 at 14. Further, Wesco has included an email related to the Smith Claim from the\n   JPA's claims administrator (Athens Administrators) to Liberty's Rebecca Bearman, with Wesco CC'ed, stating that she \"received everyone's approval\" for an allocation related to the Liberty claim. Dkt. No. 36-3, Ex. 3 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Liberty has not shown an absence of a genuine dispute of material fact as to the existence of a valid and enforceable contract between Liberty and Wesco. Liberty has not provided an evidentiary basis upon which the Court can conclude that no contract exists. Meanwhile, Wesco has provided evidence suggesting conduct indicating that a contractual agreement between Liberty and Wesco may have been reached. Accordingly, at this juncture the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Liberty's Motion for Summary Judgment on this basis without prejudice to its reassertion at a later stage, as discovery appears ongoing as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Based on the reasoning above, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Wesco's Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety and will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENY IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Liberty's Motion for Summary Judgment. Accordingly, what remains in this case is: (1) Wesco's Third Cross-Claim for Breach of Contract and (2) Liberty's Counterclaim for Reimbursement from the JPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DECLARES\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   1. By the terms of the insurance policy Liberty issued to the JPA, no coverage is afforded for loss incurred by the JPA with respect to cumulative injury to employees, where the employees' last exposure to injurious workplace conditions occurred after the end of the Liberty policy period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   2. The terms of the Liberty Policy are not nullified or superceded by operation of Section 5500.5 of the California Labor Code. California Labor Code 5500.5(a) does not apply to the Velasquez and Smith claims or any future claims based on the Liberty Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   3. Because the Liberty Policy does not apply as to the Smith and Velasquez claims, under the Wesco Policy, Wesco is responsible for 100% of any workers compensation benefits paid as to the Smith and Velasquez claims paid in excess of the JPA's retention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   4.
