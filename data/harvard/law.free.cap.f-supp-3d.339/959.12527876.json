ECF No. 497. Specifically, the court addresses the following: a limitation of liability clause in a contract between Copart, Inc. and Sparta Consulting, Inc.; Copart's equitable unjust enrichment and California Unfair Competition Law (UCL) claims; the question of prejudgment interest to Sparta on its successful breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim against Copart; and dismissal of Copart's trade secrets misappropriation claim. The court provides its conclusions and reasoning below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, the court gave the jury Preliminary Instruction No. 2, which the court excerpts below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In this action, the plaintiff and counterdefendant is Copart, Inc. The defendants in this case are Sparta Consulting, KPIT Infosystems, Inc. and KPIT Technologies Ltd. Sparta is also the counterplaintiff in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Copart processes damaged or donated vehicles that it then sells for insurers or nonprofit organizations during online auctions. Sparta designs and builds custom business management software systems for companies. KPIT Infosystems is Sparta's parent company, and KPIT Technologies is Sparta's parent company's parent, or grandparent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2011, Copart hired Sparta to design a new business management software system to replace Copart's existing software system. Following the completion of the design, Copart hired Sparta to build the new system. Before Sparta finished building the new system, in September 2013, Copart terminated the contract with Sparta.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Copart and Sparta have sued each other for damages related to the project. Copart has also sued Sparta's parent company, KPIT Infosystems, and its parent company's parent, KPIT Technologies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Copart contends that it is owed money by Sparta for fraud, professional negligence, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violations of computer fraud statutes and other misconduct. Copart also contends that it is owed money by KPIT Infosystems and KPIT Technologies for misappropriation of trade secrets, violations of computer fraud statutes and other misconduct. Sparta and the KPIT entities deny Copart's claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Sparta claims that Copart has failed to pay money that it owes to Sparta for work performed on the new software system. Copart denies that it owes anything to Sparta.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Preliminary Instruction No. 2, ECF No. 398 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Copart and Sparta executed multiple contracts during their business relationship. One of these agreements was the Implementation Services Agreement (ISA). Trial Ex. JX-1 (JX-1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). Under the parties' agreements, Sparta would complete numbered \"milestones\" by certain dates, Copart would approve those milestones and Copart would pay a fee to Sparta for completion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ISA \u00a7\u00a7 1.22-1.24, 3.1, 4.1-4.4, 9.1. The first four milestones comprised a design phase for the new business management software system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX-2 (Design Statement) at 25; D-1055. The remaining milestones, Milestones 5 through 15, comprised the build phrase for the software system. JX-3 (Build Statement or Realization Statement) at 33. Copart paid Sparta $11,364,460.88 for completing Milestones 1 through 7. Copart terminated Sparta \"for convenience\" on September 17, 2013 without paying any other milestone fees. ISA \u00a7 15.2; D-301-1. The parties dispute how much work Sparta completed before Copart terminated Sparta.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , P-1041.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before trial, the court ordered \"the parties to meet and confer and provide, by the first day of trial, a joint annotated version of the relevant contracts, or their competing\n   versions, showing contract terms the parties request be construed either by the court or the jury.\" Order on Mot. in Lim. and Mot. to Bifurcate, ECF No. 390 at 18, 51. The parties \"exchanged terms that [they] believe[d] the court or the jury can interpret,\" and the court directed the parties to provide a joint binder reflecting which contract provisions the court should construe and which provisions the jury should interpret. April 23 Trial Tr. at 41:19-43:20, ECF No. 414. The court received this jointly annotated binder, listing Copart and defendants' positions as to multiple contract provisions. For ISA \u00a7 18, only defendants have presented a position: \"This section should be interpreted by the [c]ourt, consistent with the [c]ourt's prior interpretation of this [s]ection as set forth in the Summary Judgment Order [ECF No. 264 at 16], and as set forth in [d]efendants' Trial Brief [ECF NO. 383 at 22-24].\" Long Decl. Ex. A at 17, ECF No. 519-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ISA \u00a7 18 is a limitation of liability clause. Defendants had initially proposed an instruction on this clause, ECF No. 388 at 98-100 (defendants' proposed instruction and Copart's objections), but the parties later agreed the court would construe this clause following trial, instead of putting it before the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 11 Trial Tr. at 56:7-15, ECF No. 471; May 16 Trial Tr. at 244:25-248:4, ECF No. 482;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   May 17 Trial Tr. at 3:22-4:3, ECF No. 490 (confirming parties' agreement, that \"as needed, the [c]ourt will conduct essentially a bench trial,\" making \"any legal decisions\" but \"to the extent there are any factual decisions,\" the court also would make those).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When discussing Copart's unjust enrichment and UCL claims with the court, Copart at one point stated, \"We'd like the jury to decide the facts and for those facts then to be binding on the [c]ourt with respect to its determination.\" May 11 Trial Tr. at 19:13-15. Defendants stated their view was that the court \"should decide those claims\" as \"equitable\" claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:17-21. The court stated it had contemplated \"the latter\" view and would let the parties know if that changed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:22-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Regarding prejudgment interest for an award on contract claims, defendants asserted this interest was \"an issue for the [c]ourt to decide.\" May 11 Trial Tr. at 57:9-10. The parties later jointly agreed to the court's deciding prejudgment interest, \"[e]ven the fact of\" prejudgment interest, \"[e]ntirely.\" May 16 Trial Tr. at 225:7-12, 226:3-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During trial, Copart withdrew its trade secrets misappropriation claim. ECF No. 468 at 1 (discussing \"Copart's withdrawal of its trade secret misappropriation [claim],\" offer to stipulate to dismissal with prejudice and request that \"this particular dispute be the focus of motion practice after trial, on a full record\"). The parties agreed Copart's withdrawn trade secrets misappropriation claim \"should not go to the jury\" and that they would address whether the court should dismiss \"with prejudice or without prejudice ... after trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court granted defendants' \"motion for judgment as a matter of law\" as to Copart's agency claims. May 14 Trial Tr. at 5:9-14, ECF No. 476.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After closing arguments, the court provided the jury its final instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Jury Instructions (Instructions), ECF Nos. 485, 488 (correcting Instruction Nos. 45 and 52, and adding Instruction No. 51A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury reached a verdict, finding Sparta liable for \"fraud against Copart in the form of concealment\" and awarding Copart $4.69 million. Verdict Form at 2, ECF No. 497. The jury also found Sparta\n   committed professional negligence and awarded Copart $20.37 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. But the jury found Copart \"20%\" responsible for this negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The jury awarded Sparta $4.88 million for Copart's breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on Sparta's work performed and completed and unreimbursed expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8; Instruction No. 52; ISA \u00a7 15.2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Post-Verdict Briefing and Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After the verdict, Copart and defendants filed briefs addressing four issues: (1) the application of ISA \u00a7 18, the limitation of liability clause, to the jury verdict; (2) defendants' liability under Copart's unjust enrichment and UCL claims; (3) Sparta's entitlement to prejudgment interest for its successful breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counterclaim; and (4) whether Copart's withdrawn trade secrets claim should be dismissed with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 503 (defendants' brief), 505 (Copart's brief). The court held a hearing on these issues on July 13, 2018. ECF Nos. 510, 515. After the hearing, Copart and defendants submitted supplemental briefs, then final reply briefs. ECF Nos. 516, 518, 520, 521.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court resolves the four issues below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Seventh Amendment provides that \"no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Copart relies on defendants' proposed jury instructions to support its argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3624080\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/1105/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Copart is correct that defendants' proposed limitation of liability instruction only proposed a complete bar to \"lost profits\" damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 374 at 76. Defendants also proposed an instruction listing \"Copart's internal labor\" and \"Copart's internal expenses\" as available items of damages for professional negligence and fraud claims. ECF No. 374 at 72. These proposed instructions reflect a position that the \"indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages\" prohibited under ISA \u00a7 18(A) only prohibit lost profits, at least in this case. The court's review of the complete proposed instruction discloses defendants accounted for ISA \u00a7 18(B)(X)-(Y) by including a direction to the jury that it \"in no event shall\" it award damages \"of any type that exceed the greater of (a) $5,000,000 or (b) amounts actually paid or payable by Copart to Sparta pursuant to the ISA.\" ECF No. 374 at 76. Although the parties agreed to resolve the application of ISA \u00a7 18 after the jury verdict, this agreement occurred well after defendants had submitted proposed final jury instructions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 374 (filed April 9),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   May 11 Trial Tr. at 56:7-15,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   May 16 Trial Tr. at 244:25-248:4.

But as Copart observed, defendants cite no case in which fees a plaintiff paid to the negligent defendant were not recoverable because they were held to be \"indirect\" or \"consequential.\" Neither\n   <em>\n    Orrick\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   discusses limitation of liability clauses. They address general or special damages only as limited to contract damages. Thus, the authority defendants cite merely shows ISA \u00a7 18's preclusion of \"any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or relating to [a party's] performance or failure to perform ... even if advised of the possibility of such damages\" applies only to contract damages. Here, the court finds no damages more direct than the fees Copart paid for a product that never launched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   To the extent Copart put forth evidence at trial that the product created by defendants had no value, Copart was showing a difference between the value of the product purchased and how much Copart paid, as outlined in\n   <em>\n    Orrick\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , April 26 Trial Tr. at 57:11-58:9, 59:13-60:2, 60:8-15, ECF No. 416 (testimony that Sparta never delivered \"lot master lockdown\" functionality);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:4-39:1, 39:2-41:3, 43:8-11, 41:4-43:7, 44:15-45:1 (testimony that Sparta did not deliver multiple functions to track customer credits and payments);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:19-20, 49:1-14, 51:9-17, 53:1-18, 57:1-8 (no delivery of \"call for release\" or \"gate pass\" functions). Testimony at trial indicated Copart abandoned Sparta's system because it was \"laden with bugs,\" \"unstable\" and poorly documented, making it ultimately unusable for Copart's business. May 1 Trial Tr. at 19:8-20, ECF No. 424;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 163:16-164:6; May 3 Trial Tr. at 157:9-11, ECF No. 425. Again, this testimony shows a discrepancy between the value of the system Copart received and the value Copart paid Sparta for the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Thus, either because the \"indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages\" limitations do not apply to tort claims, or because Copart has shown general damages by showing a difference between the value of the system delivered and the value Copart paid to Sparta, the only portion of the limitation of liability clause applicable to Copart's professional negligence award is therefore ISA \u00a7 18(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   d)\n   <em>\n    Paid or Payable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Copart asserts the phase \"actually paid or payable\" means the limitation of liability clause accounts for Copart's fees paid to Sparta, $11,364,461, and the jury award to Sparta for $4,880,000 based on Sparta's claim against Copart for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. ECF No. 505 at 38-39. But this interpretation ignores the ISA's use of \"payable\" throughout the agreement. For instance, Milestone fees \"shall be payable\" to Sparta only after \"Acceptance\" and \"in accordance\" with \"the payment schedule in the applicable Statement of Work.\" ISA \u00a7 9.1. The jury's award to Sparta does not conform to that use of \"payable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Instruction No. 40 (requiring a finding that \"Copart unfairly interfered with Sparta's rights to receive the benefits of the contract,\" in order to find for Sparta on its claim against Copart for breach of the\n   implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing). This interpretation respects the requirement that \"[t]he whole of a contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201641\">\n    Cal.

Alternatively, it argues, if this court rules ISA \u00a7 18(B)(Y)'s language of \"AMOUNTS ...

In response, Copart asserts \"the jury received evidence of direct damages-including fees Copart paid to Sparta and third parties that were expressly contemplated by the contract-that exceed $23 million and fall outside the restriction of [ISA \u00a7 18(A) ].\" ECF No. 520 at 2 (citing ECF Nos. 505 at 33-36, 516 at 5-6). The court has already rejected defendants' argument above as waived or alternatively, if not waived, has rejected it on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Sparta's liability to Copart for the professional negligence claim would be $11,364,461, or $16,244,461 if the damages owed to Sparta for its contract-related claim were a fee \"payable by Copart to [Sparta]\" and the \"amounts actually paid or payable\" is not properly read as a disjunctive \"or\" phrase. ISA \u00a7 18(B)(X)-(Y) (limiting damages to \"$5,000,000 or\" ... amounts actually paid or payable ....\"). Because Copart's successful fraud-concealment claim involves \"willful misconduct\" and is not limited by \u00a7 18, the professional negligence claim award is limited to the fees Copart paid, or Copart's fees payable, to Sparta. As discussed above, the jury award of $4,880,000 is not properly calculated as part of the liability limit because it does not qualify as \"payable\" and ISA \u00a7 18 permits Copart to recover for the amount \"actually paid\" or \"payable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants contend the 20 percent comparative fault of Copart, as found by the jury, applies after determining the cap on Copart's professional negligence damages.

The jury also heard testimony from Phillips, who signed off on Milestones 1 through 7 for Copart, about Sparta's never informing him about the contents of Sparta communications about project issues. May 3 Trial Tr. at 109:16-111:4, 111:19-112:5, 115:13-116:2, 146:10-19, 149:23-150:1. This evidence existed well before Phillips's signing off on Milestones 3 through 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D-870-1, D-1055, D-1056, D-1057, D-1058. Other evidence supported the jury's causation finding on Copart's fraud-concealment claim. One e-mail, P-134, dated March 3, 2012, which Phillips had not seen or learned of, May 3 Trial Tr. at 121:8-15, was sent shortly after Phillips signed off on Milestone 3 but well before Phillips signed off on Milestone 4.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   P-134,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   D-870-1 (Philips signed Feb. 29, 2012),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   D-1055 (Phillips signed Mar. 28, 2012). Communications in P-213, an internal Sparta email, occurred shortly after Phillips signed off on Milestone 5 but well before Phillips signed off on Milestones 6 through 7.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   P-213 (May 10 to May 25, 2012),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   D-1056 (Phillips signed May 4, 2012), D-1057 (Phillips signed June 7, 2012),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   D-1058 (Phillips signed June 29, 2012). Phillips also testified that \"two to five days\" before code delivery for Milestones 5-7, Sparta employees told him \"that this represented quality code that they had tested and was ready to be moved into user acceptance testing.\" May 3 Trial Tr. at 131:17-20. Phillips then approved the code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131:21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   If Phillips had known of the information contained in internal Sparta emails, Phillips would not have terminated Sparta for convenience under the ISA-he testified \"absolutely\" would have terminated Sparta for cause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164:7-16. The jury found causation sufficient to sustain a finding that if \"the omitted information [had] been disclosed, Copart reasonably would have behaved differently.\" Instruction No. 17. The jury also found \"a causal connection between the negligent conduct and any resulting injury to Copart\" for professional negligence, where the jury awarded $20.37 million based in part on \"[p]ayments to Sparta for Milestones 1 through 7.\" Instruction No. 45;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Although the exhibits referring to the February 2012 timeframe are dated February 22 or later, those exhibits and Phillips's testimony still support causation with respect to Milestone 2. First, a Sparta employee communicating in a December 11, 2012 email contained in exhibit P-474 refers to \"back in Feb\" without specifying when in February the \"lack of documentation\" occurred. Second, in P-118, dated February 22, 2012, a Sparta employee in an internal email observed \"many placeholders\" when Sparta's \"design phase is [technically] complete and should not have ANY placeholder.\" These observations are close enough in time to support causation in relation to Copart's fraud-concealment claim and Phillips signing off on Milestone 2. Phillips testified that at no time did Sparta tell him about the placeholder issue. May 3 Trial Tr. at 109:16-111:4, 111:19-112:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The only Milestone for which causation is lacking is Milestone 1. There, Copart relies on P-90, an email exhibit dated over a month after Phillips signed off on the first Milestone.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   P-90,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   D-1053.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   And Phillips never testified about this exhibit. The jury therefore had no evidence on which to find \"actual reliance\" or causation linking any omissions reflected in P-90 and Phillips's signing off on Milestone 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tobacco II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896287\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/46/298/#p325\">\n    46 Cal. 4th at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20559\">\n    93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20P.3d%2020\">\n    207 P.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding, in context of fraudulent prong UCL, phrase \"as a result of\" in California Business &amp; Professions Code section 17204 requires a plaintiff show \"actual reliance\" on a defendant's misrepresentation or omission).

Although a Sparta employee stated certain \"functional specification documents\" were \"poor quality\" in an email contained in P-90, the same employee expressed a prospective view that \"every functional specification document that we are delivering should be accurate ....\" The court finds no basis to link these email communications to a Milestone sign-off occurring over a month earlier. Additionally, other evidence, such as the Sparta employee's referring to a documentation problem as being \"the case back in Feb[ruary 2012],\" P-474, does not support a finding of causation for a Milestone sign-off occurring on December 8, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D-1053.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In sum, the jury's factual findings support causation under fraudulent prong and unfair prong UCL claims for Milestones 2 through 7.

Under ISA \u00a7\u00a7 15.4 and 15.5, Copart would \"not be obligated to pay any costs, fees, or charges or other amounts in connection with any termination of\" the ISA for cause. Thus, excluding Milestone 1 fees for which Copart could not establish causation, the value of Copart's UCL restitution award would be $10,064,460.88.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P-1076.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   However, the Ninth Circuit requires a focus on \"what a reasonable consumer would have paid at the time of purchase without the fraudulent or omitted information.\"\n   <em>\n    Pulaski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341713\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/979/#p989\">\n    802 F.3d at 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury's finding on the fraud-concealment claim resulted in an award of $4.69 million, which included consideration of \"[p]ayments to Sparta for Milestones 1 through 7.\" Instruction No. 45; Verdict Form at 2. The jury also considered payments for Milestones 1 through 7 as part of the jury's award of $20.37 million for Copart's professional negligence claim. Verdict Form at 4. But the jury awarded $4.88 million to Sparta on its breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, necessarily finding \"Sparta did all, or substantially all of the significant things that the contract required it to do or that it was excused from having to do those things.\" Instruction No. 40; Verdict Form at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The $4.88 million award to Sparta did not include \"New Services\" payments the jury found Sparta had waived. Verdict Form at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Instruction Nos. 41. Those \"New Services,\" defined in Instruction No. 41 as \"New Services, as used in ISA \u00a7 2.2,\" would have required a \"written proposal\" and Copart's agreeing \"upon the terms for such new services.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ISA \u00a7 2.2. The court therefore looks only to the fees due to Sparta for successful completion of the rest of the project, Milestones 8 through 15. The fees due to Sparta for completion of Milestones 8 through 15 totaled $13,160,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX-4 at 5 (ISA Amendment). Sparta asked for $12.7 million based on \"84 percent of the fee.\" May 17 Trial Tr. at 86:15-16. Although the jury did not award Sparta its requested amount, the jury's awarding $4.88 million contains an implicit factual determination that the work Sparta did had some value; it was not worthless. The court therefore relies on the jury award of $4.88 million out of a possible fee value of $13.16 million for Sparta's work to conclude the appropriate amount of restitution is $6,332,350.77 to Copart, out of a possible restitution award of $10,064,460.88 for the milestones on which Copart is eligible for a restitution award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   As defendants correctly note, and given the court's analysis above, Copart's request of \"restitution by Sparta of any future amounts that Copart pays Sparta under the contract,\" ECF No. 505 at 10, 49-50, \"would be a violation of the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial\" because it calls on the court \"to disregard a jury's\n   finding of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048939\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/800/#p828\">\n    718 F.3d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other jury findings support the existence of a conflict between Copart's request for restitution of future amounts paid and the jury award of $4.88 million to Sparta. For example, although the jury could have rejected Copart's affirmative defense of unclean hands for a failure to satisfy any of three elements, the jury did not \"find that Sparta had unclean hands.\" Verdict Form at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Instruction No. 42 (listing three elements Copart must prove to establish an unclean hands affirmative defense against Sparta). And the jury also found Copart 20 percent responsible for Sparta's professional negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form at 8. These jury findings do not support the equitable remedy of restitution for all of Copart's fees paid to Sparta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The court next addresses defendants' concerns about an impermissible double recovery and Copart's election of remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Recognizing the jury has already awarded damages based on \"[p]ayments to Sparta for Milestones 1 through 7,\" Instruction No. 45, Copart contends the court \"may find Sparta liable under the UCL and determine the amount of restitution while withholding judgment on Copart's restitution demand until the post-trial motions are resolved.\" ECF No. 516 at 4. According to Copart, \"[b]ecause this award in equity would furnish an independent basis for\" a portion \"of the professional negligence damages award imposed by the jury verdict, the [c]ourt need not add that amount to Sparta's overall liability in the judgment so long as the [restitution award] is deemed to be included in Copart's professional negligence award.\" ECF No. 503 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Defendants assert \"Copart has already elected to affirm the contract\" and that Copart \"provides no rationale or justification for why the [c]ourt should entertain\" Copart's request \"until after all post-trial motions have been briefed, heard, and adjudicated.\" ECF No. 521 at 5 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The jury awarded damages on both Copart's fraud-concealment claim and professional negligence claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Instruction No. 45.

Although Copart asserts defendants \"never presented the jury with admissible evidence of a settlement demand, much less a reasonable one,\" ECF No. 516 at 2 &amp; n.2, Sparta's CEO, Vaibhav Nadgauda, testified at trial about the steps Sparta took in response to Copart's termination for convenience under ISA \u00a7 15.2. May 16 Trial Tr. at 172:20-174:7. Nadgauda testified about exhibit D-301-1, admitted at trial, which was a letter dated September 17, 2013; in the letter, Copart's general counsel informed Nadgauda that Copart had terminated the ISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 16 Trial Tr. at 171:17-24. Copart's letter asserted Copart \"has no obligation to pay any costs, fees, charges, or other amounts associated with this termination unless expressly provided for in Section 15.2.\" D-301-1. Copart's general counsel stated, \"I invite you or your representative to contact [Copart] to discuss the services that Sparta believes have been performed, completed, and documented as of today for Copart's review and, as appropriate, Copart's agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530019\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/885/542/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Nadgauda testified that Sparta sent a response on October 18, 2013, about a month later, based on Sparta's \"work[ing] to kind of gather the information that was requested by Copart and then ... asking for what we were owed.\" May 16 Trial Tr. at 173:2-4, 14-17. Defendants requested a response to their letter by November 1.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173:18-19. Copart responded with \"a lawsuit\" in Texas \"alleging fraud and contract-breach of contract and a few other things.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174:3-4. Prior to November 1, Copart had not accused Sparta of fraud or breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174:5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Copart had terminated the ISA under ISA \u00a7 15.2, a \"Termination for Convenience.\" It did not terminate under the provision for \"Termination for Specified Events,\" including as one event Copart's not accepting a milestone by the completion date, nor did it rely on \"Termination for Cause,\" where the other party \"fails to perform any of its obligations under\" the ISA. ISA \u00a7\u00a7 15.3-15.4. ISA \u00a7 15.5 clarifies that only \u00a7 15.2 permits \"any costs, fees, charges or other amounts in connection with any termination of this [ISA] pursuant to Section 15.\" Although Copart contends Sparta's demand was exorbitantly high, Hr'g Tr. at 31: 19-2, Copart has not satisfactorily explained why its response at the time, instead of a counter-offer or rejection, was to immediately file suit in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Nadgauda's testimony is sufficient to demonstrate Copart refused a definite settlement demand at the outset. Moreover, Sparta's settlement demand was based on Copart's choice to terminate Sparta for convenience instead of for cause. ISA \u00a7 15.2 contemplated Sparta's receiving payment for the work it had completed. Copart has argued the court should not review unadmitted exhibits to assess prejudgment\n   interest, including D-1226.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Llewellyn Decl. Ex. D, ECF No. 504-4 (D-1226). But the parties agreed prejudgment interest for contract claims was \"an issue for the [c]ourt to decide,\" even \"the fact of\" prejudgment interest, \"[e]ntirely.\" May 11 Trial Tr. at 57:9-10; May 16 Trial Tr. at 225:7-12, 226:3-15. And, as noted above, the court omitted a prejudgment interest instruction to the jury based on the parties' agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 16 Trial Tr. at 248:15-16. The court overrules Copart's objection based on its previous agreement and considers Sparta's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   In D-1226, Copart acknowledged Sparta had not requested the entire outstanding contract price. Yet Copart asserted \"Sparta's unreasonable position\" regarding the amount Copart owed under ISA \u00a7 15.2, based on Copart's termination for convenience, \"caused Copart to file suit against Sparta.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Copart asserted because it did \"not agree, nothing is due under section 15.2.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ISA \u00a7 15.2 (stating in part \"Copart shall pay [S]parta only for the portion of the Services that have been performed and completed as of the termination date, as such portion agreed by Copart\"). Copart referred to Sparta's \"demand\" as \"groundless and inflated,\" but did not suggest an alternative. Instead, Copart sued Sparta \"for breach of contract, fraud, fraud in the inducement, promissory fraud, as well as for unfair business practices\" approximately two weeks after Sparta provided its estimate of the amount owed for the work it had performed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D-1226. Copart sued in Texas state court on the same day Sparta had requested a response to its estimate: November 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Copart, Inc., v. Sparta Consulting Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:13-CV-0013, ECF No. 1 at 1; May 16 Trial Tr. at 173:18-174:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   To the extent Copart maintains it should not be penalized for litigating a bona fide dispute, the court finds prejudgment interest based on the jury's award of $4.88 million instead of Sparta's requested award of more than $12 million would not result in penalizing Copart to the extent it did litigate a bona fide dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   No party asserts Sparta was at fault for delaying resolution of this case, although Copart says \"Sparta refused to even consider any payment to Copart\" in settlement discussions without providing any additional detail or support for this assertion. ECF No. 516 at 2 n.3. Again, Copart sued before considering settlement or engaging in the negotiation contemplated under ISA \u00a7 15.2 based on Copart's choice to terminate for convenience. Copart does refer to \"late-produced documents from Sparta\" to justify \"its motion for leave to amend the complaint in March 2016.\" ECF No. 505 at 19. The court addresses this justification below when assessing the start date for prejudgment interest accrual. The court does not find that Sparta delayed the litigation. Nor does the court find an award of prejudgment interest set to start at the appropriate time would penalize Copart for litigating any bona fide dispute in this case. Copart's refusal to settle or meaningfully negotiate, especially when that was the course contemplated by the contract and chosen as one among many options Copart had under that contract, and Copart's other litigation conduct caused Sparta \"loss of use of money during the prejudgment period.\"\n   <em>\n    Gourley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2358827\" index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/53/121/#p132\">\n    53 Cal. 3d at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20666\">\n    3 Cal.Rptr.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=822%20P.2d%20374\">\n    822 P.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Copart cites to\n   <em>\n    Lewis C.

Copart's reference to ISA \u00a7 10.2 does not point to a stipulated interest rate related to breach, fee disputes or termination for convenience. Rather, the stipulated rate there applies to \"the amount of overcharge\" if Sparta \"has overcharged Copart.\" ISA \u00a7 10.2;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Resolution Tr. Corp. v.

In resolving summary judgment on September 26, 2017, the court rejected Copart's arguments regarding Sparta's contract claim, specifically rejecting Copart's argument that it had \"unfettered discretion whether to 'agree' to Sparta's evaluation of work completed\" under ISA \u00a7 15.2, a claim Copart had asserted in its letter to Sparta notifying Sparta of Copart's lawsuit. ECF No. 264 at 15; D-1226 (\"[S]ince Copart does not agree, nothing is due under section 15.2\"). Copart's continued pursuit of this claim, including through trial, cuts against an assertion that Copart pursued bona fide litigation by refusing to acknowledge Copart owed Sparta anything.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , May 17 Trial Tr. at 106:18-19 (\"Their request for a dollar is offensive, much less 13 million .... Copart didn't agree that Sparta completed this work.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The court also finds Copart's decision to respond with litigation is a clear rejection of a settlement demand, when the litigation commenced a mere two weeks after Sparta provided its settlement calculation, following the process envisioned by the\n   ISA upon a termination for convenience. Copart suggested no alternative number and did not negotiate before filing suit. Copart sued, then told Sparta it believed Sparta breached the contract and committed fraud, and asserted Sparta was owed nothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D-1226; May 16 Trial Tr. at 174:5-7 (Nadgauda stating \"[n]o\" when asked if Copart ever accused Sparta of fraud or breach of contract before the letter notifying Sparta of the lawsuit). Copart's suing in Texas state court led to a delay of approximately 10 months involving removal to federal court and eventually transfer to this court over Copart's opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Copart, Inc. v. Sparta Consulting, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:14-cv-013-L-BK, ECF No. 26 at 6-7 (granting motion to transfer venue to Eastern District of California in part because Sparta \"points to more than a dozen current and former employees of [Copart's] that have relevant knowledge of this case and reside within the subpoena power of the district court of the Eastern District of California\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 12, 22 (Copart moving to transfer case filed in Eastern District of California to Northern District of Texas, then withdrawing motion after Northern District of Texas transferred case here). It is the 10-month delay that supports setting the start date here in December 2016, ten months before the court's summary judgment decision issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   After careful consideration, the court concludes setting the starting date earlier than December 26, 2016 risks penalizing Copart unnecessarily for the bonafide litigation it did undertake, including by seeking to amend the complaint to add a trade secret misappropriation claim based on its review of document production, the natural progression of complex litigation or any \"delays in this matter [that] were due to the [c]ourt's case load.\"\n   <em>\n    Patriot Rail Corp. v.
