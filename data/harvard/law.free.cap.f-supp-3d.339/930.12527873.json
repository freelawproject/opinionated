After Mehtani was denied $1 million in fire insurance coverage under his insurance policy with Defendant General Star Indemnity Company (\"General Star\" or \"Defendant\"), he sued Defendant and his insurance brokers Ophelia Riego and Riego Insurance and Financial Services (\"Riego\"). Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 5-11. Defendant settled with Mehtani for $135,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.

As a result, Plaintiff has brought this lawsuit against Defendant alleging a claim for equitable indemnity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Defendant has moved to dismiss with prejudice and Plaintiff opposes. Mem., ECF No. 8-1; Opp., ECF No. 10.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or around July 10, 2013, a fire damaged a residential care facility owned by Mehtani. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9. After Defendant denied Mehtani coverage under his $1 million fire insurance policy, Mehtani brought a bad faith insurance lawsuit in October 2015 against Defendant, Riego, and others in\n   <em>\n    Mehtani v. The AHBE Group, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 34-2015-00185527 in Sacramento County Superior Court (the \"Underlying Action\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11; Def. Req. for Judicial Notice (\"RJN\"), ECF No. 8-3, Exhs. 2, 3. Mehtani brought claims against Defendant for breach of the insurance contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. RJN, Exhs. 2, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff provided Riego a defense in the Underlying Action under the Underwriters E &amp; O Policy. Compl., \u00b6 14. Though the fire damage exceeded $1 million, Defendant paid Mehtani only $135,000 to settle his claim against it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. After Defendant settled with Mehtani, Plaintiff paid Mehtani $1,000,000 under Riego's Underwriters E &amp; O Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. Plaintiff alleges Defendant should have been paid this amount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. As a result, Plaintiff has brought the immediate equitable indemnity claim against Defendant to recover the more than $865,000 that it paid to Mehtani.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.

None of these cases, however, hold that violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing gives rise to tort liability for the purpose of a third-party's equitable indemnity claim.

Even though Mehtani brought a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing against Defendant, Plaintiff lacks authority to support its claim that Defendant is consequently liable in tort for the purpose of an equitable indemnity claim. Because Plaintiff's claim for equitable indemnity relies on an unsupported legal theory, the Court finds that Plaintiff's claim may not proceed and that it must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Finding otherwise would seem to require this Court to create new law. It will not do so.
