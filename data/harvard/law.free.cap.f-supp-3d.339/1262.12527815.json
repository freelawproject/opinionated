Barbee's Motion for Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs (doc. 22) (the \"Motion\") pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (\"EAJA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), filed on September 6, 2018. Defendant Nancy A. Berryhill, Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, (the \"Commissioner\") filed her opposition (doc. 23) to the Motion on September 19, 2018. Plaintiff then filed her reply brief (doc. 24) in support of the Motion on September 28, 2018. Thus, the Motion is ripe for review. For the reasons stated in this opinion, the Motion is due to be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this action on January 30, 2015, seeking a review of a final adverse decision of the Commissioner, who denied her application for disability insurance benefits. (Doc. 1 at 1-2). On June 2, 2015, the Commissioner filed an unopposed Motion for Remand (doc. 7) pursuant to sentence six of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The Motion for Remand sought a sentence-six remand of the social security appeal \"for further administrative proceedings\" because \"the recording of the oral administrative hearing in this case [was] defective in that it [was] partially inaudible due to a malfunction of computer equipment.\" (Doc. 7 at 2). The Court granted the Motion for Remand on June 3, 2015. (Doc. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After proceedings at the administrative level, Plaintiff filed a Motion To Reopen Case for Further Review (doc. 9) on September 6, 2017. The Court granted the Motion To Reopen Case for Further Review on November 1, 2017. (Doc. 10). The Commission then filed its Answer (doc. 11) on November 27, 2017. Briefing was completed on March 23, 2018. (Docs. 16, 17, 18). On July 24, 2018, the Court issued its Memorandum Opinion (doc. 19) and Final Order (doc. 20) affirming in part and reversing in part the decision of the Commissioner and remanding the case pursuant to sentence four of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, on September 6, 2018, Plaintiff filed the Motion (doc. 22), which was then briefed by the parties.

The Court will address Plaintiff's request as follows. First, the Court will determine whether Plaintiff has met the statutory conditions to be eligible for an award of attorney's fees and other expenses. Second, the Court will determine whether to award Plaintiff her requested $16,799.37 in attorney's fees. Third, the Court will determine whether to award Plaintiff her requested $625.68 in costs.

Before addressing the three statutory conditions recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, the Court will first address whether, as required by the EAJA, Plaintiff \"incurred [the attorney's fees and other expenses] ... in [a] civil action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). Here, Plaintiff seeks attorney's fees and other expenses both for the time spent on her social security appeal before this Court and for the time spent at the administrative level between the sentence-six remand on June 3, 2015 (doc. 8) and the reopening of the case in this Court on November 1, 2017 (doc. 10). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 22-2 at 9-11). Plaintiff can clearly recover attorney's fees and other expenses for the time spent on her social security appeal before this Court because the EAJA states that the term \"civil action\" \"includ[es] proceedings for judicial review of agency action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). Further, Plaintiff can also recover attorney's fees and other expenses for the time spent at the administrative level after the sentence-six remand.

The Court determines that it should take into account the increase in the cost of living and thus adjust the statutory cap upward from $125.00.

In the footnote to which the Commissioner cites, the\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   court stated that \"[its] review of attorney's fees awarded in [\n   <em>\n    the Middle District of Florida]\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    in recent months\n   </em>\n   indicate[d] that an award in excess of thirty hours is\n   <em>\n    uncommon\n   </em>\n   \" and then cited twelve cases that it had reviewed.\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205970717\">\n    2013 WL 5970717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.1 (emphases added). This footnote in\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   , however, does not support the Commissioner's argument for three reasons. First, the Commissioner argues that \"57.2 hours ... is nearly double the amount\n   <em>\n    other courts in this Circuit\n   </em>\n   have acknowledged as reasonable.\" (Doc. 23 at 6). However, the\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   court is clear that it only reviewed \"attorney's fees awarded in [\n   <em>\n    the Middle District of Florida] in recent months\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205970717\">\n    2013 WL 5970717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.1 (emphases added). Thus, the Commissioner presents an argument that is too broad to be supported by the review conducted by the\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   court of twelve cases that were all decided in the Middle District of Florida between April 24, 2013, and October 31, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205970717\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   court only stated that \"an award in excess of thirty hours is\n   <em>\n    uncommon\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205970717\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Just because an award in excess of thirty hours is uncommon, however, does not mean, as the Commissioner argues, that it is unreasonable. In fact, the Middle District of Florida found that 58.8 hours for work completed before the district court was reasonable in\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Apfel\n   </em>\n   , No. 98-651,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201658575\">\n    2000 WL 1658575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Fla.

Jan. 19, 1995) ). Third, even ignoring these first two problems, the footnote in\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   still would not support the Commissioner's argument. This is because all twelve cases that the\n   <em>\n    Huntley\n   </em>\n   court reviewed and cited involved the district court accepting as reasonable the exact number of hours that the plaintiff requested.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cruz v.

The Commissioner argues that the \"34.5 hours\" that Plaintiff's attorney spent on \"research, transcript review, preparing the statement of facts, and editing\" for Plaintiff's \"opening brief\" (doc. 16) are excessive and that the \"8.9\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   hours [that Plaintiff's attorney spent] researching and drafting a 9-page reply brief\" (doc. 18) are excessive. (Doc. 23 at 3-5). The Court will first address the Commissioner's arguments regarding Plaintiff's opening brief. The Court will then address the Commissioner's arguments regarding Plaintiff's reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Regarding the 34.5 hours spent on the opening brief that the Commissioner argues is excessive, the Commissioner breaks down her argument into certain tasks, and the Court will address these more specific arguments in turn. First, the Commissioner argues that the \"1.5 hours\" that Plaintiff's attorney spent \"researching the credibility issue alone\" was excessive because the credibility issue is \"an issue in which an attorney with experience representing Social Security claimants would be well versed\" and because Plaintiff's attorney \"spent only 2.5 hours\n   <em>\n    drafting\n   </em>\n   the credibility argument.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). However, the Court does not find 1.5 hours to be excessive for this research.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sommerville v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643778\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/555/1251/#p1254\">\n    555 F.Supp.2d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1254 (D. Kan. 2008) (\"[T]he fact that plaintiff's attorney has the expertise to handle a case with greater efficiency than other practitioners means little in this context, as this court will not disregard time honestly spent working on the brief simply because the attorney preparing it is experienced. As such, plaintiff's request is granted.\"). Further, the Commissioner does not state how long an inexperienced attorney would take to research this issue, and thus it is quite possible that Plaintiff's attorney did indeed spend fewer hours researching this issue than a less experienced attorney would have spent researching this issue. The Court also notes that a low ratio of time spent drafting an argument to time spent researching an argument does not always mean that the time spent researching that argument was excessive. After all, it makes sense that the better an attorney researches an issue and an argument, the less time its takes him to draft the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, the Commissioner argues that the \"10.3 hours\" that Plaintiff's attorney spent \"preparing the statement of facts\" for the opening brief is excessive because \"this Court's scheduling order did not require [that] the brief contain a fact section.\" (Doc. 23 at 4-5) (citing doc. 12). However, the Court notes that opening briefs by plaintiffs commonly contain a fact section. Indeed, Plaintiff responds to the Commissioner's argument by stating that her attorney \"has always included a Statement of the Case and ... Statement of Facts in every brief filed in the appeal of a Social Security disability claim\" and that, \"[f]or the first time[,] the Commissioner [now] argues that the Statement of Facts is unnecessary.\" (Doc. 24 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Third, the Commissioner argues that the \"6.9 hours\" that Plaintiff's attorney spent \"for transcript review ... in the district court matter\" and the \"7 hours\" that Plaintiff's attorney spent \"for transcript review at the administrative level\" are \"duplicative and excessive given the transcript's average length of 855 pages.\" The Court finds that the hours spent on transcript review at the two levels are not duplicative, especially when, as here, the transcript reviews occurred more than one year apart. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 22-2 at 10-11). After all, an attorney must be prepared at both the administrative level and the district court level. The Court also finds that 13.9 hours spent reviewing an 855-page transcript is not excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walsh v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-6033,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203987289\">\n    2012 WL 3987289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D.

Sept. 11, 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Fourth, the Commissioner argues that the 11.3 hours that Plaintiff's attorney \"spent editing the opening brief\" is excessive and that \"approximately half that time, or 5.5 hours, is more than reasonable to edit a brief, particularly given the attorney's assertion that he spent nearly 30 hours meticulously writing it.\" (Doc. 23 at 5) (citing doc. 22-2 at 10-11). However, the Commissioner's argument is based on false premises. Plaintiff's attorney did not spend nearly 30 hours meticulously\n   <em>\n    writing the opening brief\n   </em>\n   ; instead, Plaintiff's attorney spent nearly 30 hours\n   <em>\n    reviewing the transcript, conducting legal research, and drafting the opening brief\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 22-2 at 10-11). More specifically, of these nearly 30 hours, only 18 hours were spent \"[d]rafting\" the opening brief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Plaintiff's attorney did not spend all 11.3 hours \"editing the opening brief\". Instead, Plaintiff's attorney actually spent those 11.3 hours \"editing\" the opening brief\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   doing a \"final review of [the] opening brief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, the Commissioner offers no reason why 5.5 hours is a sufficient amount of time to edit a 57-page opening brief-especially one that an attorney has only \"[d]rafted\" and has not \"meticulously writ[ten].\" Thus, the Court finds that the 11.3 hours that Plaintiff's attorney spent editing (and doing a final review of) the opening brief is not excessive and is reasonable. Accordingly, the Court will not deduct any hours that Plaintiff's attorney spent working on the opening brief as excessive or unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Now, the Court will address the Commissioner's argument that the \"8.9\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   hours [that Plaintiff's attorney spent] researching and drafting a 9-page reply brief\" are excessive. (Doc. 23 at 5). The Court notes, however, that Plaintiff's\n   attorney actually spent only 8.4 hours researching and drafting the reply brief (2.5 hours conducting further legal research for the reply brief and 5.9 hours drafting the reply brief). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 22-2 at 11). Still, because 8.4 hours is close to 8.9 hours, the Court will address the Commissioner's three arguments as to why these hours are excessive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the Commissioner argues that the reply brief \"addressed the same substantive issues as the opening brief.\" (Doc. 23 at 5). The Court notes, however, that this does not necessarily mean that the hours spent on the reply brief were excessive; indeed, reply briefs frequently address the same substantive issues as the opening brief. Second, the Commissioner argues that \"portions of the opening brief are cut and pasted or just slightly re-worded in the reply brief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing doc. 16 at 30, 33; doc. 18 at 4, 6). The Court, however, has reviewed the pages of the opening brief and the reply brief that the Commissioner cites, and the Court disagrees that \"portions of the opening brief are cut and pasted or just slightly re-worded in the reply brief.\" Even if this were true-which, again, the Court disputes-it is true of at most two pages of a 9-page reply brief, providing an insufficient basis to argue that the 8.9 hours spent were excessive; after all, Plaintiff's attorney might have spent more time on the reply brief if these two pages were not, as the Commissioner argues, \"cut and pasted or just slightly re-worded\" from what he wrote in the opening brief. Third, the Commissioner argues that the 8.9 hours is \"excessive considering the brevity of Plaintiff's reply and the thoroughness of Plaintiff's opening brief,\n   <em>\n    which should translate to greater efficiency\n   </em>\n   with respect to researching and writing a reply.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). However, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that a district court \"should bear in mind that the measure of reasonable hours is determined by the profession's judgment of the time that may be conscionably billed and\n   <em>\n    not the least time in which it might theoretically have been done\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Norman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549528\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/836/1292/#p1299\">\n    836 F.2d at 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, even if Plaintiff's attorney could have theoretically researched and drafted the reply brief in fewer than 8.9 hours, the Court cannot reduce the number of requested hours for that reason. Thus, the Court will not deduct any hours that Plaintiff's attorney spent working on the reply brief as excessive or unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The lodestar is $16,745.34, and the Court will not adjust it\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   After determining the reasonable hourly rate and the reasonable number of hours that Plaintiff's attorney spent working on this case, the Court must calculate the lodestar.

Thus, the Court will focus on the \"overall results\" obtained and not on the result of each issue.

In her reply brief in support of the Motion, Plaintiff states that the \"transcript contained 1,465 pages\" (doc. 24 at 3) and argues that a total of 13.9 hours spent reviewing a transcript over 1,000 pages is not excessive. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) (citing\n    <em>\n     Sommerville\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643778\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/555/1251/#p1254\">\n     555 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1254 ). The discrepancy regarding the length of the transcript appears to be caused by Plaintiff referring to the full transcript and the Commissioner referring only to the supplemental transcript that was filed after the administrative proceedings pursuant to the sentence-six remand. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    doc. 11-1; doc. 11-2). Further, it appears from the invoice for legal services that Plaintiff's attorney spent 7 hours reviewing 1,323 pages of the transcript at the administrative level and then spent 6.9 hours reviewing the transcript over a year later at the district court level (although the invoice for legal services does not reflect whether Plaintiff's attorney reviewed all 1,465 pages of the transcript or just the 855 pages of the supplemental transcript). (Doc. 22-2 at 10). The Court finds these hours (even if Plaintiff's attorney only reviewed the 855-page supplemental transcript for his 6.9 hours of review at the district court level) to be reasonable on this record. Further, the Court notes that, as stated above, even assuming that the Commissioner is correct that Plaintiff's attorney spent 13.9 hours reviewing only the 855-page supplemental transcript, the 13.9 hours are not excessive and are reasonable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Walsh\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203987289\">\n     2012 WL 3987289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Because the Court will address the Commissioner's arguments regarding why 8.9 hours are excessive, the Court will refer, as the Commissioner did, to 8.9 hours. However, the Court notes that every time it references 8.9 hours, the time actually spent was 8.4 hours.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
