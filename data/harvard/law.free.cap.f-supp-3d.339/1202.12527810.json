Crabtree, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Nancy Little brings this action individually and as the personal representative of the estate of her father, Robert L. Rabe, against defendant The Budd Company. Plaintiff alleges that her father was exposed to asbestos-containing pipe insulation while working as a Pipefitter for the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad (\"ATSF\") between 1951 and the mid-to-late 1970s. She contends that this exposure caused her father to develop asbestos-related malignant mesothelioma, causing his death on December 28, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant allegedly manufactured passenger railcars and sold them to ATSF. Plaintiff contends that defendant placed asbestos and asbestos-containing products into its railcars, thereby exposing her father to asbestos during his employment with ATSF. Plaintiff asserts state law claims for negligence, strict product liability/design defect, and strict product liability/warning defect. Alternatively, plaintiff asserts a state law claim for negligence per se based on defendant's alleged violation of two federal statutes: (1) the Locomotive Inspection Act, and (2) the Federal Safety Appliance Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 71) seeking summary judgment against each of plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff has filed a Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. 81), and defendant has submitted a Reply (Doc. 90). Plaintiff also seeks a summary judgment ruling of her own. She has filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 73), asking the court to grant summary judgment in her favor on certain elements of her claims and against some of defendant's affirmative defenses. Defendant has submitted a Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. 78) to that\n   motion, and plaintiff has submitted a Reply (Doc. 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After considering the parties' arguments, the court grants defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment in part and denies it in part. Also, it grants plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in part and denies it in part. The court explains why it made these decisions, below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before turning to the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the court considers plaintiff's Objections to Portions of Defendant's Summary Judgment Evidence and Motion to Strike. Doc. 82. It asks the court to strike one paragraph of a Declaration that defendant submitted as support for its Motion for Summary Judgment. The Declaration is from Brian Bastien, defendant's President. Mr. Bastien declares that he has served as an officer of defendant since April 11, 2008, when he became the company's Treasurer. Since July 1, 2013, Mr. Bastien has served as its President.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Bastien's Declaration explains that defendant made and sold thousands of passenger railcars from 1932 to 1987. So, by his own admission, Mr. Bastien did not start working for the company for some 20 years after it stopped manufacturing railcars. Mr. Bastien attests that the information provided in his Declaration is \"true of my own personal knowledge except those matters stated on information and belief, and, as to those matters, [he] believe[s] them to be true.\" Doc. 72-1 at 1 (Bastien Decl. \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Specifically, plaintiff objects to paragraph 6 of Mr. Bastien's Declaration. Plaintiff asserts that Mr. Bastien's Declaration never reveals how he knows the information asserted in paragraph 6. Thus, plaintiff contends, Mr. Bastien bases the assertion on \"information and belief\"-and not his personal knowledge. Paragraph 6 of Mr. Bastien's Declaration reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   When the Budd passenger railcars were in use the steam came from a steam locomotive, a diesel locomotive equipped with a steam generator or a steam generator car if a steam generator-equipped locomotive was not available. The main steam lines of all the passenger cars in a train were designed to be, and were, connected to each other and to their power source, most usually the locomotive and most infrequently a steam generator car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (Bastien Decl. \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant offers Mr. Bastien's assertion to support its affirmative defense based on a preemption theory. As the court discussed in an earlier Order denying defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, the Locomotive Inspection Act (\"LIA\") prohibits state regulation of the \" 'design, the construction, and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61 at 9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Napier v. Alt. Coast Line R.R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501252\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/605/#p611\">\n    272 U.S. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501252\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/605/#p611\">\n    47 S.Ct. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501252\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/272/605/#p611\">\n    71 L.Ed. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1926) ). On summary judgment, defendant argues that the LIA preempts plaintiff's claims here because they involve passenger railcars that \"were designed to be, and were connected\" to\n   locomotives. Doc. 72-1 at 2 (Bastien Decl. \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the court should strike this paragraph from the summary judgment record for three independent reasons: (1) defendant never disclosed Mr. Bastien under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) ; (2) the information contained in paragraph 6 is not based on Mr. Bastien's personal knowledge; and (3) the information provided in paragraph 6 is inadmissible opinion evidence provided by a non-expert. As discussed below, the court excludes paragraph 6 of Mr. Bastien's Declaration for the first reason advanced by plaintiff-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , defendant is precluded from offering this summary judgment evidence because it never identified Mr. Bastien under Rule 26(a)(1)(A). Because it decides plaintiff's motion on this basis, the court need not address plaintiff's two additional arguments seeking to exclude this summary judgment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 26(a)(1)(A) requires a party to identify to the other party \"each individual likely to have discoverable information-along with the subjects of that information-that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A). A party's failure to comply with Rule 26(a)(1)(A)'s disclosure requirements may preclude the party from offering an unidentified witness's testimony later in the proceedings. Federal Rule 37(c)(1) provides: \"If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vesom v. Atchison Hosp. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082535\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/279/624/#p631\">\n    279 F. App'x 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (10th Cir. 2008) (\"The exclusion of evidence presented out of time is automatic and mandatory unless the violation was either justified or harmless.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A district court has discretion to decide whether a Rule 26 violation is justified or harmless and, when doing so, should consider the following factors: \"(1) the prejudice or surprise to the party against whom the testimony is offered; (2) the ability of the party to cure the prejudice; (3) the extent to which introducing such testimony would disrupt the trial; and (4) the moving party's bad faith or willfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobsen v. Deseret Book Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9441140\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/936/#p953\">\n    287 F.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953 (10th Cir. 2002) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11589358\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/985/#p993\">\n    170 F.3d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 993 (10th Cir. 1999) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   These factors favor excluding Mr. Bastien's Declaration under Rule 37. First, plaintiff is prejudiced and surprised by the Declaration. Defendant never identified Mr. Bastien as a fact witness, who could provide testimony to support defendant's affirmative defense based on LIA preemption. So, plaintiff contends, defendant denied her the opportunity to discover information about Mr. Bastien's testimony. This deprivation includes that option to take his deposition. In contrast, defendant asserts that plaintiff had ample notice of Mr. Bastien's testimony because defendant identified him as its designated records custodian. Also, Mr. Bastien verified defendant's discovery responses. According to defendant, plaintiff was well aware that defendant intended to rely on ancient business records to support its defenses. So, defendant contends, plaintiff sustained no prejudice or surprise because she should have anticipated that defendant's records custodian would provide testimony about those documents. The court is unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Typically, a records custodian just is responsible for keeping records in the ordinary course of business.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Jewish Health v. WebMD Health Servs. Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4158498\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/305/247/#p255\">\n    305 F.R.D. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255 (D. Colo. 2014) (\"The purpose of a records custodian is to ensure the records' 'credibility, reliability, accessibility and ultimate disposition or destruction.' \") (quoting The Sedona Conference,\n   <em>\n    Best Practices Guidelines &amp; Commentary for Managing Information &amp; Records in the Electronic Age\n   </em>\n   , cmt. 4.e, p. 34 (2d ed. Nov. 2007) );\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Dwire Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIVA04CV02182WYD-OES,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203543058\">\n    2005 WL 3543058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Colo. Dec. 27, 2005) (\"[A] records custodian's only purpose is to identify the records as having been kept in the regular course of business....\");\n   <em>\n    Custodian of Evidence\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"A custodian responsible for securing and controlling access to evidence and maintaining the evidence in exactly the condition it was in when received.\"). So, defendant's identification of Mr. Bastien as its records custodian could not have placed plaintiff on notice that defendant also intended for Mr. Bastien to provide substantive testimony about the content of defendant's business records. As plaintiff correctly asserts, defendant never disclosed the\n   <em>\n    nature\n   </em>\n   of Mr. Bastien's testimony-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that he would provide testimony supporting defendant's preemption affirmative defense. Defendant's omission surprised plaintiff, and now it has prejudiced her position in the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant cites two cases to support its argument that its failure to disclose Mr. Bastien as a Rule 26(a)(1)(A) witness is not prejudicial, but instead harmless. The court finds neither one persuasive, at least not here. In the first case, the court found harmless a plaintiff's failure to identify a witness in her Rule 26 initial disclosure because plaintiff later identified the witness in her responses to defendant's interrogatories as someone who may have knowledge about plaintiff's allegations and who plaintiff may call as a witness at trial.\n   <em>\n    Taboas v. Fiddler, Gonzalez &amp; Rodriguez, PSC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343835\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/41/137/#p143\">\n    41 F.Supp.3d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143 (D.P.R. 2014). In contrast here, defendant never identified Mr. Bastien as a witness who may provide substantive testimony about one of defendant's affirmative defenses. Instead, defendant just identified him as a records custodian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second case held that a defendant's failure to identify a witness in its Rule 26 initial disclosures was harmless when plaintiff had a \"fair and full opportunity\" to depose a different witness on the same topic.\n   <em>\n    Curley v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016850\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/120/992/#p999\">\n    120 F.Supp.3d 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 999-1000 (N.D. Cal. 2015). Here, defendant asserts, plaintiff had the opportunity to question defendant's Rule 30(b)(6) witness about its LIA preemption affirmative defense. So, defendant contends, plaintiff sustained no prejudice. The court disagrees that plaintiff had the same \"fair and full\" opportunity to depose defendant's Rule 30(b)(6) witness on the same topic. Indeed, the testimony of defendant's Rule 30(b)(6) is markedly different than the assertion made by Mr. Bastien's Declaration. The Rule 30(b)(6) witness testified that he did not know whether defendant built its passenger railcars to comply with the federal requirements for locomotives. Doc. 91-3 at 8-9 (Bauer Dep. 168:24-169:2). Also, the Rule 30(b)(6) witness testified that he never spoke with Mr. Bastien about his deposition testimony and that he was not relying on any information provided by Mr. Bastien.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (Bauer Dep. 12:1-5). The court thus finds that plaintiff never had an opportunity to depose any witness about the assertion that Mr. Bastien now makes in his Declaration-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that defendant's passenger railcars \"were designed to be, and were connected\" to locomotives. Doc. 72-1 at 2 (Bastien Decl. \u00b6 6). Defendant's nondisclosure thus surprised and prejudiced plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Turning to the second factor, the court considers plaintiff's ability to cure the prejudice. Here, a cure would require reopening discovery proceedings and the\n   summary judgment record. This second factor influences the third factor. Reopening discovery after both parties have moved for summary judgment and just a few months before trial will disrupt the proceedings. Finally, and though the record does not suggest that defendant acted willfully or in bad faith when it failed to identify Mr. Bastien in its Rule 26(a) initial disclosures, plaintiff asserts that Mr. Bastien-as defendant's President-was never an unknown witness. Also, defendant has asserted its preemption affirmative defense at the case's beginning-first raising the defense on November 2, 2016, when it filed its Answer. Doc. 6 at 6 (Answer \u00b6 2 (Affirmative Defenses) ). So, plaintiff argues, defendant's failure to identify Mr. Bastien as a witness is not justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After considering all four factors, the court concludes that they favor excluding paragraph 6 of Mr. Bastien's Declaration from the summary judgment record. Defendant's omission violated Rule 26(a)(1)(A), and it neither was substantially justified nor harmless. Thus, the court strikes this paragraph from Mr. Bastien's Declaration under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court now turns to consider the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Unconverted Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The following facts are either stipulated facts taken from the Pretrial Order (Doc. 68), or uncontroverted for purposes of the parties' summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   From 1951 until his retirement in 1994, Robert Rabe, worked for ATSF in its repair shops in Topeka, Kansas. From 1952 to 1981, Mr. Rabe worked as a Pipefitter and Sheet Metal Worker. One of his duties involved replacing pipe insulation on passenger railcars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   From 1932 to 1987, defendant manufactured and sold passenger railcars containing asbestos insulation to ATSF. ATSF repaired and renovated these passenger railcars during plaintiff's tenure working in the Topeka repair shops. Defendant's passenger railcars had a steam pipe running the length of the undercarriage. The steam pipe was wrapped with insulation containing asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During his employment, Mr. Rabe worked with and around the steam pipe insulation contained in defendant's passenger railcars. Also, Mr. Rabe worked with and around asbestos-containing insulted water pipes. These water pipes were not connected to the railcar's steam line. During his employment, Mr. Rabe also was exposed to dust from asbestos insulation removed from air conditioning pipes. In 2012, Mr. Rabe, was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. He died on December 29, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates that \"no genuine dispute\" exists about \"any material fact\" and that it is \"entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When it applies this standard, the court views the evidence and draws inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Nahno-Lopez v.

Defendant bases its preemption defense on two distinct federal laws. First, defendant argues that Congress, when it enacted the LIA, intended for it to occupy the field of locomotives and their appurtenances. Defendant argues that the uncontroverted summary judgment facts establish that the equipment at issue here-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pipe insulation-is a locomotive appurtenance. And thus, defendant contends, the LIA preempts plaintiff's state law claims. Second, defendant makes an alternative preemption argument based on the Federal Safety Appliance Act-the SAA. This argument contends that Congress intended for the SAA to occupy the field of safety equipment on railcars. Defendant asserts that the uncontroverted facts establish that pipe insulation is a safety appliance under the SAA. Thus, defendant contends, the SAA preempts plaintiff's state law claims based on the allegedly defective pipe insulation.

For support, defendant relies on Brian Bastien's Declaration. Specifically, defendant cites paragraph 6 of the Declaration where Mr. Bastien attests that the main steam lines of defendant's passenger rail cars were designed to connect to each other and their power source-\"most usually\" the locomotive and \"most infrequently\" a steam generator car. Doc. 72-1 at 2 (Bastien Decl. \u00b6 6). As explained in Part I\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the court has excluded the summary judgment evidence in Mr. Bastien's paragraph 6 because defendant never disclosed him as a witness as Rule 26(a) requires. But the court's summary judgment decision isn't purely the product of its procedural conclusion under Rule 26. For even if defendant had established the same evidence offered in Mr. Bastien's paragraph 6 by a qualified witness, the court still would\n   deny defendant's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This evidence, even if accepted as a summary judgment fact, doesn't establish that defendant's pipe insulation is a locomotive appurtenance as a matter of law. Indeed, even Mr. Bastien's Declaration concedes that locomotives didn't always supply the steam to the passenger railcars' steam lines. Mr. Bastien explains that the steam \"came from a steam locomotive, a diesel locomotive equipped with a steam generator\n   <em>\n    or a steam generator car if a steam generator-equipped locomotive was not available.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). And, while Mr. Bastien attests that the steam lines \"most usually\" were connected to the locomotive as the power source, Mr. Bastien also concedes that the power source sometimes was derived from \"a steam generator car,\" albeit \"most infrequently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Asbestos Prods.

She therefore established a genuine dispute of material fact precluding summary judgment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant responds to this problem in the summary judgment facts by arguing that ATSF made a \"post-purchase choice to manufacture and use\" their own steam cars as the power source for the steam lines instead of a locomotive. Doc. 90 at 11. Defendant also argues that the summary judgment facts establish that ATSF never had more than six steam cars in use during a 20-year period when defendant manufactured more than 275 passenger railcars for ATSF.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. From these facts, defendant contends, no triable issue exists whether defendant designed its steam lines to use a steam car as a power source instead of a locomotive. The court cannot leap to this conclusion on these summary judgment facts. Even if ATSF used no more than six steam cars, this fact-viewed in plaintiff's favor-presents a triable issue whether defendant designed its steam pipes to connect to steam cars as a power source and not merely locomotives. This is especially true here because Mr. Bastien concedes that defendant designed the main steam lines of all the passenger rail cars to connect to each other and their power source-which sometimes (albeit \"most infrequently\") was a steam generator car, not a locomotive. Doc. 72-1 at 2 (Bastien Decl. \u00b6 6) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Also, plaintiff offers other summary judgment evidence that creates a triable issue whether the asbestos-containing pipe insulation is a locomotive appurtenance. Two former ATSF employees-Dale Stout and Darrel Nimmo-attest by Affidavit that they often observed passenger trains using steam generator cars-instead of the locomotive-as the steam source for the steam pipes on passenger railcars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Stout and Mr. Nimmo explain that when a\n   steam generator car was employed, it served as the power source for the passenger railcars' steam pipes-not the locomotive. And, Mr. Nimmo attests, the steam generator cars and the locomotive did not interconnect or function together to create steam or for any other reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff also has submitted the Affidavit of Robert Elliott, Jr.-a former Amtrak employee and railroad historian. Mr. Elliott attests that ATSF used steam generator cars as the power source for passenger railcars' steam lines-both before and after Amtrak acquired the passenger railcars from ATSF. Mr. Elliott explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Both before and after the establishment of Amtrak, steam generator cars were placed in trains as needed, like any other railcar on the passenger train. Steam generator cars had their own boiler fuel tanks, their own water tanks, and thereby functioned as a stand-alone source of steam for the passenger cars ... Steam generator cars were not mechanically dependent on the locomotive and did not require a locomotive to function as intended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Doc. 81-3 at 3 (Elliott Aff. \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Viewing the facts asserted in Mr. Stout, Mr. Nimmo, and Mr. Elliott's Affidavits in plaintiff's favor, they present a genuine issue whether defendant designed the passenger railcars' steam pipes to connect to the locomotive. Thus, the court cannot decide on summary judgment whether the asbestos-containing pipe insulation is a locomotive appurtenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Also, plaintiff asserts that her father was exposed not just to asbestos-containing insulation covering steam pipes but also to insulation covering water and air conditioning pipes present in defendant's passenger railcars. And plaintiff offers summary judgment facts presenting a triable issue whether the water and air conditioning pipes are locomotive appurtenances. Indeed, plaintiff has adduced admissible evidence that, if accredited by the jury, would establish that these water and air conditioning pipes never were connected to the steam lines or the locomotive. Instead, this evidence asserts, the water and air conditioning pipes were self-contained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 81-3 at 4 (Elliott Aff. \u00b6 13) (\"Each passenger car's water lines were unique and self-contained to that car alone, and were not connected by any manner to the piping of any other car, nor to the locomotive.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 81-4 at 2 (Annis Aff. \u00b6 4) (\"Each [passenger railcar] had its own water tank and plumbing system. Some of the earlier cars from the 1940's had steam powered air conditioning, but the later cars all had electromechanical air conditioning. By the mid-1960's, we had converted all the cars to electromechanical air-conditioning, so every car had its own stand-alone air-conditioning system and diesel generator which was not dependent on a source of steam.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   After a trial, plaintiff's evidence might or might not persuade the jury on this important issue. But, for now, the evidence suffices to create a genuine, triable issue whether the defective product that allegedly caused Mr. Rabe's death-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , asbestos-containing pipe insulation-is a locomotive appurtenance. The court thus cannot decide on this summary judgment record whether the LIA preempts plaintiff's state law claims as a matter of law.

Second, in\n   <em>\n    Gilvary v.

Alternative Claim Based on Federal Law Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff asserts an alternative claim of negligence per se claim under Kansas law. This claim alleges that defendant violated the standards promulgated by the LIA and SAA. Although plaintiff specifically denies that these two federal statutes preempt her state law claims, she seeks to assert an alternative state law claim based on defendant's alleged violation of the LIA and SAA, if the court finds that the two federal statutes preempt her other state law claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendant asserts several reasons why plaintiff's alternative claim fails as a matter of law. First, defendant asserts, although the equipment that injured plaintiff's father falls within the field preempted by the LIA and SAA, these two federal statutes never specifically regulate pipe insulation. So, defendant contends, the LIA and SAA do not impose a federal standard of care, as required by plaintiff's alternative claim.

So, moving to\n   <em>\n    Landgraf\n   </em>\n   's second step, the court considers whether the statute has a retroactive effect. It does. Imposing the penalty provision on defendant would increase its liability for past conduct. It is undisputed that plaintiff's father worked as a pipefitter on defendant's passenger railcars between 1951 and 1981.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 81 at 11 (Pl.'s Designation of Additional Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 1). During that time, the LIA and SAA applied only to railroads-and not manufacturers like defendant. Thus, if the court applied the penalty provision here, it would do so retroactively, making defendant liable for past conduct. Under these circumstances, the court presumes that the statute does not apply unless Congress expressed a clear intent for retroactive application. No clear intent exists here. The court thus declines to apply the LIA and SAA retroactively here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff responds to defendant's argument, asserting that her cause of action did not accrue until her father was diagnosed with mesothelioma and died in\n   2012-after Congress amended the statute to include manufacturers in the penalty provision. But plaintiff's argument still requires the court to apply the amendments retroactively. Plaintiff's claim may have accrued in 2012, when she first learned a cause of action might exist. But her claim seeks to impose liability for asbestos exposure that occurred when her father was working on defendant's passenger rail cars. Because it is undisputed that plaintiff's father stopped working as a pipefitter on passenger railcars in 1981, plaintiff seeks to impose the penalty provisions on defendant for conduct that occurred at least 37 years ago. In short, defendant's conduct occurred long before Congress amended the LIA and SAA to include the penalty provisions. The court declines to apply the penalty provisions retroactively here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For this reason, the court grants summary judgment against plaintiff's negligence per se claim premised on defendant's violation of the LIA and SAA. Because the two statutes did not apply to manufacturers when plaintiff's father allegedly was exposed to asbestos-containing pipe insulation, the court cannot apply the standards contained in those statutes retroactively to impose liability on defendant in the form of a state law claim for negligence per se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The court now turns to plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Plaintiff seeks summary judgment: (1) in her favor on the issue whether asbestos exposure caused her father (Mr. Rabe) to contract mesothelioma ; (2) against defendant's affirmative defense that Mr. Rabe contributed to the cause of his damages; and (3) against defendant's affirmative defense that concurrent and successive exposures to asbestos caused Mr. Rabe's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In defendant's Memorandum in Response and Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 78), defendant asserts that it does not contest that Mr. Rabe was diagnosed with mesothelioma and that asbestos exposure caused him to contract the disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The court thus grants summary judgment for plaintiff on the first issue presented by plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant's Memorandum also withdraws its affirmative defense that Mr. Rabe contributed to the cause of his mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant agrees that Mr. Rabe's smoking did not cause his mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But defendant explains that it nonetheless reserves the right to present evidence of Mr. Rabe's 40-year smoking history at trial because, defendant contends, this evidence is relevant to his medical condition, life expectancy, and whether he would have followed adequate safety warnings. Plaintiff responds that the admissibility of her father's smoking history is an issue that the court need not address until the evidence is offered at trial. The court agrees. The court thus declines to decide now whether defendant can introduce evidence of Mr. Rabe's smoking history at trial. But it grants summary judgment against defendant's affirmative defense that Mr. Rabe contributed to the cause of his mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Thus, the only summary judgment issue remaining from plaintiff's motion is the third issue it raises-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the summary judgment facts present a triable issue about defendant's defense that other exposures to asbestos caused Mr. Rabe to contract mesothelioma. Plaintiff asserts that the summary judgment record contains no evidence that Mr. Rabe's other exposures to asbestos were a substantial contributing factor to the cause of his death. The controlling cases permit defendant to present a reasonable inference that\n   exposure to another product was a substantial contributing factor to Mr. Rabe's injuries if it comes forward with \"evidence of exposure to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in proximity to where [Mr. Rabe] actually worked.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillon v.

Kan. 1998) (applying the\n   <em>\n    Dillon\n   </em>\n   standard to determine whether plaintiff had met her burden to prove causation). Defendant has adduced admissible evidence sufficient to establish a genuine issue whether other asbestos exposure contributed to Mr. Rabe's death. As the next paragraph explains, defendant has met its summary judgment burden on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant submitted interrogatory responses that Mr. Rabe verified in a lawsuit he filed against ATSF in 1990 for injuries based on asbestos exposures. In those interrogatory responses, Mr. Rabe identified each asbestos product to which he was exposed during his employment by ATSF. His interrogatory responses describe asbestos-containing pipe insulation-presumably the same product at issue in this case. But they also describe several other sources of asbestos exposure. They include valve packing, gloves, and solid sheets used to make hot pads. Also, defendant has presented Affidavits that Mr. Rabe submitted to several asbestos bankruptcy trusts in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In those 11 Affidavits, Mr. Rabe swore that he had at least six months' worth of exposure to various asbestos-containing products other than pipe insulation. Doc. 78-5. The summary judgment evidence also includes the deposition testimony of Jim Shaw, one of Mr. Rabe's former co-workers. Mr. Shaw testified that he believes that both he and Mr. Rabe were exposed to asbestos from pipe insulation installed inside ATSF's buildings and\n   from cement insulation mixed in buckets that created a significant amount of dust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendant also asserts that plaintiff's experts have conceded that other asbestos exposures contributed to Mr. Rabe's mesothelioma. Plaintiff's pathologist expert, Dr. Victor Roggli, testified that he could not discount other asbestos exposures-at least not the three products he was questioned about during his deposition-as contributing causes of Mr. Rabe's mesothelioma. Also, another of plaintiff's medical experts, Dr. Arthur Frank, opines that \"[t]he cumulative exposures that [Mr. Rabe] had to asbestos,\n   <em>\n    from any and all products\n   </em>\n   , containing any and all fiber types, would have contributed to his developing\" his asbestos-related disease. Doc. 78-7 at 1. Thus, Dr. Frank recognizes that other sources of asbestos-not just pipe insulation-could have contributed to Mr. Rabe's mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to defendant, a reasonable jury could conclude that exposure to other asbestos-containing products-and not just defendant's asbestos-containing pipe insulation-were a substantial contributing factor to Mr. Rabe's death. The court thus denies plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against defendant's affirmative defense that asserts other asbestos exposures caused Mr. Rabe to contract mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In a final argument, plaintiff asserts that defendant cannot argue that other manufacturers caused Mr. Rabe's mesothelioma when it never disclosed these third-parties as parties responsible for plaintiff's damages. Defendant argues that the court should not consider plaintiff's argument because she has raised it improperly in her Reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liebau v. Columbia Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9459265\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/176/1236/#p1244\">\n    176 F.Supp.2d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1244 (D. Kan. 2001) (\"Courts in this district generally refuse to consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief\" (citations omitted) ). But, even considering plaintiff's argument, the court isn't persuaded by it. Defendant's affirmative defense doesn't try to shift liability to other parties. Instead, the affirmative defense allows defendant to try to persuade the jury that it is not responsible for causing Mr. Rabe's mesothelioma because other products-not just the asbestos-containing pipe insulation in defendant's passenger railcars-could have contributed to causing Mr. Rabe's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For reasons explained, the court grants defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment in part and denies it in part.
