Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff met the insured status requirements of the Act through December 31, 2017. (Dkt. 7-2 at 13). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since October 10, 2012, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of cervical disc herniation, degenerative disc\n   disease of the lumbar spine, and chronic migraine headaches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The ALJ also identified non-severe impairments, including right knee contusion, bronchitis, goiter, obesity, and hypertension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.04 and 11.00 in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform less than a full range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Specifically, the ALJ found that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   can lift and carry 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently; sit six hours in an eight-hour workday and stand and/or walk four hours in an eight-hour workday, alternating every 15 minutes between sitting and standing.

At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of storage facility clerk, furniture rental consultant, and machine tender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-186). During these visits, Plaintiff reported some improvement in her back and neck pain, and Dr. Capicotto's clinical findings remained the same. At the May 14, 2013 visit, Dr. Capicotto assessed Plaintiff's disability as \"Moderate, temporary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176). Dr. Capicotto further noted that Plaintiff reported she was examined in employee health by a Kaleida Heath physician, who opined that, if she continued work as an LPN, she would have to go back to work with significant restrictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In her written determination relating to the assessment of Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ noted that Dr. Capicotto's opinion was the\n   only opinion in the record from a treating source. (Dkt. 7-2 at 20). The ALJ found that Dr. Capicotto's opinions that Plaintiff had a \"total temporary\" and \"moderate temporary\" disability were \"of limited value in assessing the claimant's residual functional capacity because they do not state specific limitations and [Dr. Capicotto] does not appear to consider anything other than the claimant's back impairment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Despite the \"limited value\" of Dr. Capicotto's opinions, the ALJ gave them \"substantial weight\", on the sole basis that these opinions were consistent with the fact that Plaintiff's RFC had improved by May 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ). Specifically, the ALJ found that \"Dr. Capicotto's May 2013 opinion that the claimant had a 'moderate' disability at that point is consistent with the residual functional capacity, which allows for only a limited range of light work level.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ gave \"some weight\" to a June 2013 opinion of the consultative examiner, Donna Miller, D.O., as the medical records suggested more substantial limitations than those indicated by Dr. Miller. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ incorporated Dr. Miller's limitations, but to a \"greater extent than she suggested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In deciding a disability claim, an ALJ is tasked with \"weigh[ing] all of the evidence available to make an RFC finding that [is] consistent with the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta v.

As noted by the ALJ, Dr. Capicotto's opinion is the only opinion in the record from a treating source, and the ALJ found that Dr. Capicotto's opinions as to Plaintiff's disability were of \"limited value\" because they were vague. (Dkt. 7-2 at 20 (Dr. Capicotto's opinions \"do not state specific functional limitations\") ). The ALJ further found that Dr. Capicotto's opinions were incomplete. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (Dr. Capicotto's opinions \"[do] not appear to consider anything other than the claimant's back impairment\") ). Despite these identified inadequacies in Dr. Capicotto's opinions, the ALJ assigned them \"significant weight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, it is unclear which portion of Dr. Capicotto's vague and incomplete opinions informed the ALJ's RFC, which is quite specific, in that it addresses Plaintiff's ability to lift and carry; sit, stand, and walk; and stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, and reach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). The ALJ therefore failed to adequately explain the reasons for the weight given to Dr. Capicotto's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To the extent the ALJ relied on Dr. Capicotto's use of the term \"moderate\n   temporary\" to inform the RFC (Dkt. 7-2 at 20), this was also improper, considering the lack of additional information in the record as to what Dr. Capicotto meant when he used that term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perozzi v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). Dr. Miller opined that Plaintiff had \"mild limitations for heavy lifting, bending, carrying, kneeling, and squatting. The claimant should also avoid any dust, irritants, or tobacco exposure which may exacerbate her pulmonary issue.\" (Dkt. 7-7 at 210-14). The ALJ gave Dr. Miller's opinion \"some weight\" but not \"great weight.\" (Dkt. 7-2 at 20). Like the ALJ's assessment of Dr. Capicotto's opinions, it is unclear which portions of Dr. Miller's opinions informed Plaintiff's RFC, other than the inclusion of some degree of limitation on lifting, carrying, and kneeling. Dr. Miller did not offer any opinion on Plaintiff's ability to sit, stand and/or walk for certain durations. Further, Dr. Miller did not offer any opinion on Plaintiff's ability to stoop, crouch, crawl, or reach. However, these limitations are included in the assessed RFC, and the written determination is devoid of any opinion evidence as to what informed the limitations on these particular activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant argues that there is no requirement that the ALJ's decision correspond perfectly with any medical opinion, and the Second Circuit has upheld RFC determinations with no corresponding functional assessment. The Commissioner cites to three Second Circuit opinions, including\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Berryhill,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12396496\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/687/45/\">\n    687 F.

However, these cases are distinguishable, because the record in each was clear as to what informed the assessed RFC. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Monroe,\n   </em>\n   the ALJ rejected the treating physician's medical assessment, but relied on the physician's treatment notes in formulating the RFC.\n   <em>\n    Monroe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390458\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/676/5/\">\n    676 F.

The Second Circuit held that this was proper \"[b]ecause the ALJ reached her RFC determination based on Dr. Wolkoff's contemporaneous treatment notes-while at the same time rejecting his post hoc medical opinion ostensibly based on observations memorialized in those notes--that determination was adequately supported by more than a mere scintilla of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390458\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/676/5/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12390458\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/676/5/\">\n    at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
