(Doc. 144). Ms. Rodriguez opposes Miami-Dade County's motion. (Doc. 151). She also moves for additur, to amend or alter judgment on the jury's findings on damages on her retaliation claim, and, alternatively, for a new trial on damages. (Doc. 145).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Entering judgment in Ms. Rodriguez's favor on her retaliation claim (Count II) constituted manifest error of law. Therefore, Miami-Dade County's motion to amend or alter judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   An additur of nominal damages on Ms. Rodriguez's retaliation claim is inappropriate. The jury's verdict on her retaliation claim (Count II) constituted no manifest error of law or fact. And the great weight of evidence supports the jury's decision on Ms. Rodriguez's retaliation claim. Therefore, Ms. Rodriguez's motions for additur, to amend or alter judgment, or for a new trial on damages are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Rodriguez sued Miami-Dade County for violations under Title VII. (Doc. 1). After Ms. Rodriguez, initially proceeding pro se, failed to properly serve Miami-Dade County, the court granted Miami-Dade County's motion to quash and ordered Ms. Rodriguez to submit an amended complaint, which she did. (Docs. 13, 15). Ms. Rodriguez later obtained counsel and submitted her second amended complaint. (Doc. 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her second amended complaint, Ms. Rodriguez alleged three Title VII violations by Miami-Dade County: discrimination based on her national origin; retaliation against her for opposing unlawful employment practices; and hostile work environment. (Doc. 42). Ms. Rodriguez also claimed Miami-Dade County violated the False Claims Act (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After the ruling on Miami-Dade County's motion for summary judgment, only Ms. Rodriguez's national origin discrimination and retaliation claims remained. (Doc. 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Rodriguez worked as an assistant site manager and in the centralized maintenance crew section at Miami-Dade County's office for Public Housing Community Development. (Doc. 101, p. 2). Leshia Elie was Ms. Rodriguez's supervisor at Miami-Dade County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Elie allegedly discriminated against Ms. Rodriguez based on her national origin, which led Ms. Rodriguez to file a complaint with Miami-Dade County's Office for Fair Employment. (Doc. 101, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Rodriguez claimed Ms. Elie retaliated against her for filing a complaint with Miami-Dade County's Office for Fair Employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Specifically, Ms. Rodriguez claimed that, during an April 10, 2013 telephonic hearing with a referee about Ms. Rodriguez's application for unemployment benefits, Ms. Elie called Ms. Rodriguez seventeen times to disrupt Ms. Rodriguez's testimony. (Doc. 101, pp. 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The case proceeded to a four-day jury trial. On the first interrogatory of the verdict from for the national origin discrimination claim, the jury answered \"no\" on whether the jury found, from a preponderance of the evidence, that Ms. Rodriguez's national origin was a motivating factor in Miami-Dade County's decision to discharge her. (Doc. 136). That answer required no further answers from the jury on that verdict form; therefore, the court directed the Clerk to enter judgment in Miami-Dade County's favor on the national origin discrimination claim (Count I). (Doc. 138).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the verdict form for Ms. Rodriguez's retaliation claim, the jury answered in the following way:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    TITLE VII RETALIATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

(Doc. 139).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Miami-Dade County moves to amend or alter judgment on the retaliation claim. (Doc. 144). Ms. Rodriguez opposes Miami-Dade County's motion and instead requests relief that includes requests for additur, to amend of alter the judgment on her retaliation claim, and, alternatively, for a new trial on damages. (Docs. 145, 151, 157). The court will address each side's contentions, beginning with Miami-Dade County's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Miami-Dade County's Motion to Amend or Alter Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Miami-Dade County argues the judgment on Ms. Rodriguez's retaliation claim reflects manifest error of law and fact. (Doc. 144, p. 1). According to Miami-Dade County, the jury did not find in Ms. Rodriguez's favor on her retaliation claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Miami-Dade County argues that, consistent with the Eleventh Circuit's pattern jury instruction given to the jury, Ms. Rodriguez had to prove she suffered damages to prevail on her retaliation claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Miami-Dade County points out no dispute existed between the parties on the elements needed to prove retaliation, including damages. (Doc. 144, p. 2). Because the jury answered \"no\" on whether Ms. Rodriguez suffered damages because of Miami-Dade County's adverse employment action, Miami-Dade County concludes that judgment on the retaliation claim should be amended in its favor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ms. Rodriguez argues that a Title VII plaintiff need not suffer \"financially quantifiable damages\" to prevail on a retaliation claim. (Doc. 151, p. 2). Instead, Ms. Rodriguez argues a plaintiff need only prove a \"materially adverse action\" by the employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). According to Ms. Rodriguez, she presented sufficient evidence at trial of Ms. Elie's interference with Ms. Rodriguez's unemployment compensation hearing, which constitutes the \"materially adverse action\" needed to succeed on her retaliation claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). Therefore, Ms. Rodriguez concludes that the court should deny Miami-Dade County's motion to amend or alter judgment on the retaliation claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) allows the court to alter or amend a judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).

Pattern Jury Instr. Civ\n   </em>\n   . 4.22 (2013). Although some differences existed between Ms. Rodriguez's proposed jury instruction on her retaliation claim and Miami-Dade County's proposed jury instruction, both parties included the language stating that Ms. Rodriguez had to prove each of the four elements to succeed on her retaliation claim. (Doc. 116, pp. 28-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The jury answered \"no\" on whether Ms. Rodriguez proved by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffered damages because of Miami-Dade County's adverse employment action. (Doc. 137, p. 2). Because Ms. Rodriguez needed to prove she suffered damages because of Miami-Dade County's adverse employment action, and she failed to do so, entering judgment in her favor on the retaliation claim (Count II) was a manifest error of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To support her claim that the court properly entered judgment in her favor on her retaliation claim, Ms. Rodriguez primarily relies on two cases, but neither held that damages are unnecessary to succeed on a retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). She specifically refers to her own testimony and her nurse practitioner Don Davis's testimony about her emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Rodriguez claims the jury ignored this \"uncontroverted evidence\" about her emotional distress and mental damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Mr. Davis, without his medical notes, testified the first time he treated Ms. Rodriguez was in October 2017. Mr. Davis testified that Ms. Rodriguez was on medications, including Klonopin (anti-anxiety medication) and Trazodone (an antidepressant), before she came to Mr. Davis. During Ms. Rodriguez's first visit with Mr. Davis, he performed a psychiatric evaluation. Mr. Davis stated that he remembered Ms. Rodriguez saw another clinician in 2013, but he could not recall other details about any prior treatment Ms. Rodriguez received. After the psychiatric evaluation, he recommended Ms. Rodriguez return for ongoing treatment and continued her on four medications, including Trazodone and Klonopin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Mr. Davis testified that he has treated Ms. Rodriguez three times, strictly for medication management, since her initial visit in October 2017. He remembered diagnosing Ms. Rodriguez with major depressive disorder. Mr. Davis had no opinion with respect to whether he expects Ms. Rodriguez's treatment, including her medications, must continue in the future. Mr. Davis recalled that Ms. Rodriguez's condition improved, and she required no medication changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Ms. Rodriguez also testified about Ms. Elie's calls during the unemployment compensation hearing and her claimed damages. Ms. Rodriguez testified that Ms. Elie's calls disrupted her ability to testify at the unemployment compensation hearing, but she did not testify that the phone calls prevented her from receiving unemployment benefits. She testified Ms. Elie never called her again after the unemployment compensation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Ms. Rodriguez testified that she first sought treatment from a mental health professional in October 2014. She testified that she was hospitalized in October 2014 for four days because she stopped eating and sleeping. Ms. Rodriguez testified that she could not work for two or three years after her hospitalization. She testified she is still on medication, but she never medicated\n   before her hospitalization in October 2014. She testified she still suffers from depression. Ms. Rodriguez testified she had to withdraw over $10,000 from her son's prepaid college tuition account to pay for living expenses. She testified she currently has difficulties making payments on her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The jury's finding that Ms. Rodriguez suffered no damages because of Miami-Dade County's adverse employment action despite the evidence Ms. Rodriguez presented at trial is not manifest error of fact. Mr. Davis testified Ms. Rodriguez first visited him for treatment in October 2017-more than four years after Ms. Elie called Ms. Rodriguez seventeen times during her unemployment compensation hearing. Mr. Davis, without his treatment notes, recalled that Ms. Rodriguez previously received treatment from another clinician in 2013. But whether Ms. Rodriguez's previous treatment was before or after Ms. Elie's seventeen phone calls is uncertain from Mr. Davis's testimony. Further, Ms. Rodriguez introduced no medical records or bills from her mental health treatment into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ms. Rodriguez testified she first sought mental health treatment and was hospitalized in October 2014-more than one year after Ms. Elie's seventeen phone calls. Although she testified about employment and financial problems, she did not claim those problems resulted from Ms. Elie's seventeen phone calls (as opposed to resulting from Ms. Elie's alleged national origin discrimination). Nor did Ms. Rodriguez provide other opinions, medical or otherwise, about the extent of her mental damages after Ms. Elie's seventeen phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Credibility determinations are for the jury to decide.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
