Section M, Article 1 of the policy, which is entitled \"Benefit Payment Period,\" further provides that, \"if Disability begins at or after age 65,\" benefits are payable \"until the later of the date of Social Security Normal Retirement Age, or the date of completion of the number of months shown below after the Benefit Payment Period begins.\" Docket No. 4 at 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The table immediately below this provision reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-22\"><strong>Member's Age on the Date Disability</strong> <strong>Months of the Benefit Payment Period</strong> <strong>Begins</strong> <strong>(Beginning with the date the Benefit</strong> <strong>Payment Period begins)</strong> 65-67 24 68-69 18 70-71 15 72 and over 12</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The policy then lists a number\n   of events - such as the policyholder's death, the end of the policyholder's disability, or the policyholder's failure to submit required proof of disability - that will terminate benefit payments regardless of the Benefit Payment Periods identified in the table.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Benefit Payment Periods table is reproduced in the \"Long Term Disability Insurance Summary\" next to the heading \"Maximum Benefit Payment Period.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18; Docket No. 18-1 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the \"Benefit Payment Period\" provisions, the policy contains a number of provisions including the phrase \"own occupation.\" The policy defines \"Own Occupation\" as \"[t]he occupation you are routinely performing when Disability begins. Own Occupation does not mean the specific tasks or job you are performing for the Policyholder or at a specific location.\" Docket No. 18-1 at 10. The policy further defines \"Own Occupation Period\" as \"[t]he first two year(s) of the Benefit Payment Period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The terms \"Own Occupation\" and \"Own Occupation Period\" appear in the policy's definition of disability, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   You will be considered Disabled if, solely and directly because of sickness, injury, or pregnancy:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   During the Elimination Period and the Own Occupation Period, one of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   a.

You cannot perform the majority of the Substantial and Material Duties of any occupation for which you are or may reasonably become qualified based on education, training, or experience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   b.

Docket No. 15 at 7-8. The Court agrees. Evaluating the policy as a whole, it is clear that the \"Benefit Payment Period\" and \"Own Occupation\" provisions serve two different functions. The \"Benefit Payment Period\" provisions govern the amount of time for which benefits are payable under the policy. In contrast, the \"Own Occupation\" provisions help to define a sliding scale for when an individual will be considered disabled. When read together, the provisions establish that an individual who is 72 years of age or older will be considered disabled and thus eligible to receive long term disability benefits if, during the initial period of the claimed disability, he \"cannot perform the majority of the Substantial and Material Duties of [his] Own Occupation\" or he is \"performing the duties of [his] Own Occupation on a Modified Basis or any occupation and [is] unable to earn more than 80% of [his] Indexed Predisability\n   Earnings.\" Docket No. 18-1 at 9. After that initial period (which is comprised of a 180-day Elimination Period plus the 2-year Own Occupation Period), the requirements for disability become more stringent. Thus, an individual will only continue to qualify as disabled if he \"cannot perform the majority of the Substantial and Material Duties of\n   <em>\n    any occupation for which [he is] or may reasonably become qualified\n   </em>\n   based on education, training, or experience\" or is \"performing the Substantial and Material Duties of [his] Own Occupation or any occupation on a Modified Basis and [is] unable to earn more than\n   <em>\n    60%\n   </em>\n   of [his] Indexed Predisability Earnings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (emphasis added). Thus, the requirements for continued benefits eligibility are heightened in two respects after the expiration of the Own Occupation Period: (1) the policyholder must be unable to perform any occupation, not simply the job he was performing at the time his disability began; and (2) the policyholder must be unable to earn more than 60% of his predisability earnings, not just 80%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The \"Benefit Payment Period\" provisions exist separately from these requirements. Rather than defining the period of disability, the Benefit Payment Period caps the number of months an individual may receive long term disability benefits based on the individual's age at the time the disability began. The cap is not defined according to the period of disability, as indicated by the \"Benefit Payment Period\" provision, which states that, notwithstanding the age-based limits on the Benefit Payment Period, \"in no event [ ] will benefits continue beyond ... the date Disability ends.\" Docket No. 4 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff reads the policy as establishing a separate two-year Benefit Payment Period for those qualifying as disabled under the \"Own Occupation\" provisions. Plaintiff makes four principal arguments in support of this interpretation. First, he contends that the \"Own Occupation\" definition of disability is the only category of disability that has a separate heading in the \"Long Term Disability Insurance Summary,\" which \"contains limits on the time periods during which benefits will be paid.\" Docket No. 18 at 6. Because \"two year(s)\" is listed under the heading \"Own Occupation Period,\" plaintiff interprets the summary as stating \"that the benefit period for 'Own Occupation' disabilities is two years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There are two flaws in this argument. As an initial matter, the summary is meant to be an overview of all key terms in the insurance policy. The first column of the summary, which lists \"Own Occupation Period,\" also includes terms such as \"Minimum Hours Requirement,\" \"Who Pays for Coverage,\" and \"Elimination Period.\" Docket No. 18-1 at 4. Neither these terms nor the information provided in conjunction with these terms - e.g., \"Employees must be working at least 20 hours a week\"; \"You are not required to pay a part of the premium for insurance under the Group Policy\"; and \"180 days\" - relate to \"limits on the time periods during which benefits will be paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the mere inclusion of \"Own Occupation Period\" in the policy summary does not support a conclusion that the \"Own Occupation Period\" defines the period in which benefits will be paid for those qualifying under the \"Own Occupation\" provisions. The second flaw in plaintiff's argument is that the summary does not state that the \"benefit period for 'Own Occupation' disabilities is two years.\" Docket No. 18 at 6. Plaintiff draws this inference based on the fact that \"two year(s)\" is listed under the heading \"Own Occupation Period.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 4 at 18. Yet the same could be said of the \"180 days\" listed under \"Elimination Period,\" but plaintiff makes no contention that 180 days reflects a shorter benefits period for certain policyholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff next asserts that he is entitled to a two-year benefits period under the policy because the definition of \"Own Occupation Period\" does not refer to the age-related limitations on the \"Maximum Benefit Period,\" and the provisions concerning the \"Maximum Benefit Period\" do not refer to the \"Own Occupation Period.\" Docket No. 18 at 6. However, the fact that the provisions do not cross-reference each other supports, rather than undermines, a conclusion that the \"Own Occupation\" provisions have no bearing on the maximum benefit period under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This conclusion is further bolstered by the definition of \"Own Occupation Period.\" In his third argument, plaintiff cites the definitions of \"Own Occupation\" and \"Own Occupation Period\" as evidence that the one-year age-related limitation on benefits does not apply to disabilities based on the inability to perform one's \"own occupation.\" Docket No. 18 at 7. To the contrary, by defining \"Own Occupation Period\" as \"[t]he first two year(s) of the Benefit Payment Period,\" the policy not only establishes that the \"Own Occupation Period\" is distinct from the maximum period in which benefits are payable, but also incorporates the applicable \"Benefit Payment Period\" as a limitation on the \"Own Occupation Period.\" Docket No. 18-1 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's final argument is that defendant's interpretation of the policy would render the two-year \"Own Occupation Period\" meaningless, thereby violating the general rule that contracts should be construed so as to give effect to every provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub. Utils. Comm'n v. City of Durango\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4629791\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/171/553/\">\n    171 Colo. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4629791\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/171/553/\">\n    469 P.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (1970) (\"It is a familiar rule of contract construction that a contract is to be construed as a whole and effect given, if possible, to its every provision.\"). Again, however, plaintiff ignores the separate purposes served by the \"Own Occupation\" and \"Benefit Payment Period\" provisions: while the \"Own Occupation\" provisions help to define the varying requirements for when an individual will be considered disabled, the \"Benefit Payment Period\" provisions, including the \"Maximum Benefit Payment Period,\" govern the amount of time for which benefits are payable under the policy regardless of whether an individual qualifies as disabled. There is thus no conflict between these provisions even if, in some circumstances, the \"Maximum Benefit Payment Period\" will limit the \"Own Occupation Period\" applicable to the policyholder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because the insurance policy, read as a whole, unambiguously limits plaintiff's entitlement to long term disability benefits to a period of one year, plaintiff has failed to present a plausible basis for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
