The Commissioner has moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), which Lau has opposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Commissioner's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lau applied for Disability Insurance Benefits (\"DIB\") on August 1, 2014, alleging a disability onset date of May 1, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Administrative Record, filed Apr. 9, 2018 (Docket # 16) (\"R.\"), 9, 68, 142. The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Lau's application for DIB on October 14, 2014. R. 9, 77-81. Lau requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") to review the denial, R. 83-85, which occurred on September 8, 2016, R. 28-66. In a written decision dated September 23, 2016, the ALJ found that Lau was not disabled between May 1, 2012 - his alleged disability onset date - and December 31, 2014 - his date last insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 9-16. Lau requested that the Appeals Council review the ALJ's decision, R. 137-40, 236, but on October 18, 2017, the Appeals Council denied Lau's request, R. 1-5. That made the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. R. 1. Lau timely filed this action on November 2, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, dated Nov. 2, 2017 (Docket # 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lau was represented by non-attorney representative Jerry Adler at the hearing before the ALJ. R. 30. Also present and testifying were two medical experts, Dr. Osvaldo Fulco and Dr. Sharon Grand, and\n   a vocational expert (\"VE\"), Michele Erbacher. R. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lau testified that prior to the onset of his allegedly disabling conditions he had worked consistently for at least ten years as a computer programmer and systems engineer at various companies, having completed a bachelor's degree in China. R. 33-37. His last job in computer programming was at Blue Cross Blue Shield, which laid him off in May 2009 when the company outsourced its programming work to India. R. 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lau explained that he developed a persistent and heavy cough after he was laid off, which he feared was a sign of lung cancer, R. 38-39, but might have been lung damage \"related to the 9/11 attack,\" R. 41, 47-48. He said the cough caused insomnia and at one time he went six straight months without sleep. R. 40. Otherwise, Lau did not attribute any physical limitations to the cough. R. 38-40. To treat his cough, Lau said his doctor recommended that he use \"asthma spray\" and prescribed antibiotics. R. 41. His doctor also recommended surgery, which Lau declined. R. 41. Lau also testified to having high blood pressure for which he takes an alpha beta blocker. R. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lau also talked at length about his psychiatric treatment. He explained that he first saw a psychiatrist \"at the beginning of 2015,\" when the Human Resources Administration referred him to \"several psychiatrists\" after he applied for Medicaid. R. 42. Thereafter, he saw various psychiatrists with some consistency. R. 42-44, 46-47. One psychiatrist, whom he saw for his insomnia, told him that his insomnia was \"a severe mental problem ... close to bipolar,\" for which the doctor prescribed him Seroquel. R. 40. Lau was also prescribed Haldol. R. 43. Lau explained that he was anxious about \"everything,\" including people following him. R. 47. He thought the government had been following him since he \"joined the Occupy Wall Street in 2011,\" and feared that the government would \"disappear\" him as it had done to others. R. 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lau testified that he lived in a homeless shelter where he had his own room but shared common living spaces with the other residents. R. 32-33. Because of the limited facilities at the shelter, he does not cook or clean. R. 44. For recreation, he walks in the park when it is warm and otherwise stays at the shelter \"watch[ing] some games and watch[ing] some movies [and] TV,\" though he struggles to concentrate. R. 45. Because he \"sometimes just lose[s] [his] mind in the library,\" he will \"fall asleep\" and be kicked out by a librarian. R. 46. He does not see friends or relatives. R. 45. As for transportation, Lau said that he rarely uses public transportation because he \"just feel[s] unsafe\" since \"[a] lot of people [have been] pushed out on the track,\" R. 45; rather, he drives and owns a car, R. 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Grand, identified as a \"mental health medical expert,\" R. 12, testified that the record supports Lau's diagnosis for \"schizophrenia, paranoid type and a hoarding disorder.\" R. 50-51. In her view, Lau's schizophrenia met listing 12.03, because Lau reported persistent delusions and paranoia, was unable to maintain a residence, was hoarding in his room at the shelter, and had marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning. R. 51-52. Dr. Grand believed Lau met the listing as far back as January 2015, but no earlier because \"[i]t's not documented clearly.\" R. 52-53. \"It seems likely\" that it started before January 2015, she testified, but said she could not speak to any functional limitations before January 2015 because of the lack of documentation. R. 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. Fulco, a medical doctor who reviewed Lau's records, testified that Lau may have developed \"reactive airway disease\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   after working at Ground Zero for about two months after 9/11. R. 55. \"[T]he evidence is sufficient ... to establish th[is] diagnosis,\" which he explained is \"classic of individuals that were exposed to the dust, fumes, and chemicals in very, very high concentration that occurred [at] Ground Zero.\" R. 56. As a result of this disease, the \"bronchial [tubes] become extremely sensitive to any kind of inhalants,\" often causing a cough\"so severe that it may interfere with the ability to complete ... an eight-hour day.\" R. 56. But he noted \"that is my opinion on this,\" because the record did not contain a test, usually called methacholine provocation, which would confirm the diagnosis. R. 56. He contended that the various chest x-rays which reported normal results were \"not inconsistent with [his] opinion that the claimant has reactive airway disease\" and that as a result of this disease, Lau could not work \"even going back to 2012.\" R. 57. This opinion was based on Lau's consistent self-reporting of a heavy cough. R. 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ asked VE Verbacher to consider whether a person of Lau's age, education, and work history who is \"limited to the performance of medium work\" and who could not be exposed to \"pulmonary irritants\" could perform Lau's past work as a programmer. R. 63. Verbacher said such a person would have difficulty finding suitable jobs. R. 64. But if such person could \"occasionally\" be exposed to pulmonary irritants, then that person would be able to perform Lau's past work. R. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both Lau and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 2-6; Comm'r Mem. at 5-14. While the Commissioner's summary is more detailed, Lau's summary is substantially consistent with it. Accordingly, the Court adopts Lau's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The ALJ denied Lau's application for DIB on September 23, 2016. R. 6-16. Following the five-step test set forth in SSA regulations, the ALJ found at step one that Lau had not engaged in \"substantial gainful activity\" during the time between his alleged disability onset date - May 1, 2012 - and his date last insured - December 31, 2014 (the \"Relevant Period\"). R. 11. At step two, the ALJ found through the date last insured that Lau suffered from the \"severe impairments\" of \"restrictive airway disease and hypertension.\" R. 11. Because the record contained \"insufficient evidence prior to [Lau's] date last insured documenting significant functional limitations arising from his mental impairments,\" the ALJ concluded that Lau did not suffer from a severe mental impairment during the Relevant Period. R. 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that none of Lau's severe impairments singly or in combination met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart p, Appendix 1. R. 13. The ALJ gave \"particular attention ... to listings 3.02 and 4.01,\" which address \"chronic pulmonary insufficiency\" and \"impairments of the cardiovascular system,\" respectively. R. 13. Having found that Lau could not meet listings 3.02 and 4.01, the ALJ next assessed Lau's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"). R. 13. The ALJ found that Lau, through the date last insured, had the RFC \"to perform medium work ... with\n   additional restrictions insofar as he could have no more than occasional exposure to pulmonary irritants, dust, odors, fumes, and extremes of heat and cold.\" R. 13. In making this assessment, the ALJ reviewed the medical record, including the opinions of all consulting, examining, and treating medical sources; and Lau's testimony, finding Lau's testimony \"not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record.\" R. 14. At step four, the ALJ found that Lau could return to his prior work as \"a program analyst for web applications.\" R. 16. Since he could perform his prior work, the ALJ concluded that Lau was not disabled within the meaning of the Act during the Relevant Period.

Comm'r Mem. at 16. Lau's brief argues that the ALJ ignored or mischaracterized evidence in his favor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 10-11, which we construe as an argument that the ALJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-14. Because we find substantial evidence supports the ALJ's opinion, we grant the Commissioner's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Substantial Evidence for Finding Lau's Mental Impairment Non-Severe\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We start by evaluating Lau's claim that the ALJ should have found that he had the severe impairment of paranoid schizophrenia during the Relevant Period, and in turn, that this impairment was so severe as to render him disabled either at step three or step four.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Lau suffered from only \"restrictive airway disease and hypertension\" through December 31, 2014, his date last insured. R. 11. The ALJ acknowledged that \"[t]he record establishes that the claimant suffers from psychiatric symptoms,\" but found that \"[p]rior to 2015, the record fails to establish that the claimant's alleged anxiety and insomnia, considered either singly or in combination, caused any more than minimal limitations in the claimant's ability to perform basic mental work activities.\" R. 11-12. In support of this conclusion, the ALJ looked to records from Lau's various treating mental health professionals and accepted that \"the records from these treating sources sufficiently document severe psychiatric impairments in 2015 and 2016.\" R. 12. Nonetheless, he accorded those opinions \"little weight with respect to [Lau's] mental functioning prior to his date last insured.\" R. 12. In particular, he discounted the opinions of Dr. Adriel Gerard and Dr. Sharon Eberstein because they \"did not begin treating [Lau] until 2016, and [thus] were not in a position to adequately evaluate his mental functioning\" before then. R. 12. The ALJ also considered the four functional areas set forth in the Commissioner's regulations for evaluating mental disorders, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1, \u00a7 12.00C. R. 12. \"[A]fter consideration of all the evidence,\" however, the ALJ found \"that the claimant had no more than mild limitation[s] in these functional areas during [the Relevant Period] ... [and no] episodes of decompensation.\" R. 12. Additionally, the testimony of Dr. Sharon Grand, who testified that the record did not reveal any severe mental impairments prior to 2015 when Lau began to live on the street, supported this conclusion.

Although Lau notes he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and hoarding disorder, Pl. Mem. at 5, Lau was not diagnosed with either disorder during the Relevant Period. The first record diagnosing Lau with schizophrenia and taking note of his hoarding is from February 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 340, well outside the Relevant Period. None of Lau's treating sources diagnosed Lau with these conditions at an earlier period. While Dr. Gerard remarked in a May 2016 medical report that Lau had a \"[h]istory of schizophrenia,\" R. 300, Dr. Gerard also disclaimed at that same visit any knowledge as to when Lau's mental health issues first appeared,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 305. Similarly, while Dr. Sharon Eberstein opined that Lau had experienced a \"profound decline in social and occupational functioning over the past 10-15 years,\" she provided no time period when plaintiff's limitations manifested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 393-98. Neither doctor treated Lau prior to 2016. R. 300, 393. Additionally, Dr. Sharon Grand, who testified that she had reviewed Lau's mental health records, opined that Lau met the listings as of January 23, 2015, on account of his schizophrenia, but declined to diagnose Lau with an earlier onset because no records so indicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 50-53 (\"And did the claimant have any severe mental impairment prior to January 2015? It's not documented clearly, but ... again, it seems likely, but I really wouldn't be able to speak on what the functional impairments would be during that time. He certainly had some anxiety ... and some insomnia going back ... to 2012.\"). Accordingly, because of the lack of retrospective diagnoses and any other record evidence of schizophrenia or hoarding disorder during the Relevant Period, the ALJ could properly find that Lau did not suffer from such medically determinable impairments during that period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry v.

Lau reported to Dr. Daniel Knoepfmacher that he was seen by a psychiatrist in 2006 and 2007 who prescribed him Zoloft, but did not explain why and also informed Dr. Knoepfmacher that he stopped taking Zoloft after a year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 309. Thereafter, the next mention in the record of insomnia or anxiety is in August 2012, but the treating source, Dr. Cynthia Tam, does not document any specific treatment for Lau's mental impairments. R. 276. A 2014 consultative examiner report noted that Lau was then taking Sertraline, also known as Zoloft. R. 240. The first psychiatric notes appear in the record in August 2015, outside the Relevant Period. R. 285. At that time, the treating psychiatrist, Dr. Andrew Chan, diagnosed Lau with \"Anxiety Disorder\" and noted that Lau was taking Seroquel and Klonopin. R. 285.

Dr. Grand testified at Lau's hearing that Lau \"certainly had some anxiety ... and some insomnia going back ... to 2012,\" but she stated that she could not find any disabling limitations going back beyond January 2015 which was when Lau started living in a shelter. R. 52-53. When asked specifically about Lau's insomnia and anxiety, she said the record, in her view, showed no resulting limitations. R. 53. The ALJ could appropriately choose to give Dr. Grand's opinion great weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Lau's self-reported activities of daily living and functioning supports the ALJ's determination that his insomnia and anxiety were not severe impairments during\n   the Relevant Period. In his function report, dated August 2014, Lau wrote that he lived independently in a basement room of a town house, that he exercised outside in a park \"almost every day,\" visited the library, prepared his own food, and read books at home. R. 184-85. He also denied any problems performing activities of self-care, like dressing or bathing; said that he could drive a car, go shopping, and could take care of his own money; and denied any memory problems, problems following instructions, or completing tasks. R. 185-92. Lau reported engaging in similar activities to Dr. Linell Skeene in that same month. R. 241 (\"He is able to shower, bathe, and dress independently. The claimant cooks, cleans, does laundry, and shopping, but no childcare. He watches TV and reads in his spare time.\"). While Lau also indicated that his insomnia caused him to take naps during the day, disclaimed any social activities, stated that he was being evicted from his home, and said that he finds it hard to concentrate after a bad night's sleep, R. 184-91, these statements do not detract from the ALJ's conclusion that Lau's lack of social contacts and eviction were not evidence of more than mild impairment in the area of social functioning. Likewise, with respect to his difficulty concentrating, a stray and unquantifiable assertion that Lau found it \"hard to [concentrate]\" does not, on its own, require the ALJ to find moderate limitations in concentration.

Dr. Skeene noted that a pulmonary function test revealed \"low vital capacity possibly due to restriction of lung volumes,\" and diagnosed Lau with bronchial asthma, infiltrate of the left lung, and hypertension. R. 242. The ALJ gave the opinion \"some weight ... to the extent that the claimant's respiratory limitations are supported by the pulmonary function test results.\" R. 15. Dr. Skeene did not note any specific limitations, however, and did not indicate how long Lau's condition was expected to last.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The ALJ did not err in according \"little weight\" to Dr. Cynthia Tam, a colleague of Dr. Shen and Dr. Zhang, who had opined in August 2012 that Lau \"can not engage in strenuous physical activity.\" R. 276. The ALJ discounted this opinion because \"it [was] not supported by objective tests or clinical findings,\" though he acknowledged that Lau's \"documented respiratory impairment would reasonably preclude heavy levels of exertion and would warrant a finding that he avoid prolonged exposure to respiratory irritants.\" R. 14-15. We find no error in the ALJ's determination of how much weight to give Dr. Tam, even though she was a treating source. Dr. Tam's opinion that Lau could not engage in strenuous activity was, as noted by the ALJ, not supported by any clinical findings or the product of an identifiable examination,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 276, and is inconsistent with Lau's testimony that he exercised daily in the park, R. 185.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In any event, to the extent the opinions of Dr. Tam or Dr. Skeene merited greater weight, their opinions were consistent with the ALJ's ultimate finding that Lau was limited to no more than medium levels of exertion.

Dr. Fulco explained that individuals working at Ground Zero \"develop[ed] this condition called reactive airway disease because they basically have, like, a burn of the bronchial [tubes].\" R. 56. According to Dr. Fulco, a \"typical symptom of this condition is episodes of ... cough,\" and \"the cough is so severe that it may interfere with the ability to complete in length an eight-hour day,\" and that would have been true as far back as 2012. R. 56, 57. Dr.\n   Fulco acknowledged, however, that his \"opinion on this is ... insufficiently documented\" as such a disease is \"usually\" documented by \"a test called methacholine provocation.\" R. 56;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   R. 59 (acknowledging that there are no clinical findings to support a diagnosis). But he felt that Lau's consistent reports of a chronic cough and testimony concerning his work at Ground Zero supported his diagnosis and functional limitations opinion. R. 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The ALJ rejected Dr. Fulco's opinion as to the functional limitations of \"reactive airway disease,\" because the doctor's opinion \"[was] contradicted by substantial other evidence in the file, including the opinions of the treating physicians discussed above, and is, by his own admission, not supported by the record.\" R. 16. Dr. Fulco recognized that the mostly normal findings on Lau's 2012 chest x-ray, and mild abnormalities noted on pulmonary function tests, contradicted his retrospective opinion on Lau's limitations. R. 57, 59. Because Dr. Fulco's opinion was contradicted by the opinions of Dr. Shen and Dr. Zheng in addition to the opinion of Dr. Skeene, the ALJ did not err in rejecting it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 242, 291-95, 404-08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The ALJ concluded that Lau could perform work requiring a medium level of exertion, except that he could have no more than \"occasional exposure to pulmonary irritants.\" R. 14. In addition to the medical opinions already discussed, the ALJ's finding was supported by medical tests in the record and plaintiff's self-reported abilities and activities of daily living. Lau's medical test results were repeatedly described as \"unremarkable.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 391. While chest x-rays consistently revealed a patchy infiltrate and left lower lobe patchy airspace disease, which was not growing or only \"slightly increased\" in size, the results did not reveal any evidence of consolidation or pleural effusion and consistently revealed clear lungs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 259, 277, 282-83. Pulmonary function tests also showed no wheezing on auscultation of the chest. R. 241, 245, 279. As for plaintiff's self-reports, he complained of a chronic cough and shortness of breath, which produced a yellowish phlegm,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 240, and monthly asthma attacks (of which the record contains no information),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p31\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p31\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   but Lau also said that he exercises daily, performs all daily chores comfortably, walks his neighborhood often during the summer, and regularly visits the library,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 45, 176, 185, 241.

Here, the ALJ properly inquired of a vocational expert given that Lau's RFC contained the non-exertional limitation of \"occasional exposure to pulmonary irritants.\" R. 13.
