ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant argues that the \u00a7 6751 claims should be dismissed under the variance doctrine, or in the alternative,\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   Under the variance doctrine, a taxpayer is \"barred from raising in a refund suit grounds for recovery which had not previously been set forth in its claim for refund.\" (Dkt. No. 32 at 4) (citing\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12171961\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/181/\">\n    843 F.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2016).) In essence, the Government argues that since the Taxpayers never alleged that the penalties were improperly assessed under \u00a7 6751 in any of the prior proceedings, including the years of litigation and the administrative refund claims, they are barred from now raising these claims in the refund suit. (Dkt. No. 32 at 6-7.) Alternatively, Defendant argues that the \u00a7 6751 claims are barred under\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   because the issue of the application of the penalty was actually litigated in the prior partnership-level proceedings. (Dkt. No. 47 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Taxpayers counter that the variance doctrine does not apply here because (1) Taxpayers have not relied on the Government's non-compliance with \u00a7 6751 as a defense to the penalties giving rise to the refund claims; and (2) any \"variance\" between the refund claims and this refund suit is due to the Government's own failure to follow its internal procedures, which Taxpayers could not have been aware of when they filed the original refund claims. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 43.) Relying heavily on the Second Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   , Taxpayers argue that any claim for compliance with \u00a7 6751 does not need to be made \"unless and until the Government fails to meet that burden.\" (Dkt. No. 43 at 3.) Taxpayers argue that Defendant was required to comply with \u00a7 6751 when making\n   the penalty determination against the individual partners after the partnership-level proceeding because such a determination is unique to each individual partner. (Dkt. No. 56 at 5; Dkt. No. 116, Hr'g Tr. at 20:17-21:7 (\"[MR. CULLINAN: So any time the IRS, in our view, determines to assert a penalty or actually to assess a penalty against an individual partner, that's - that requires compliance with Section 6751.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taxpayers essentially ask this Court to extend the holding in\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   to require that Defendant prove compliance with \u00a7 6751 as part of its\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case at the partner-level TEFRA proceeding. Taxpayers argue that Defendant must obtain written supervisor approval before issuing the notice that applies the results of the partnership-level proceeding, that is, the penalties that have already been conclusively determined-and fully litigated-as part of the partnership-level proceeding. Absent clear authority, requiring compliance with \u00a7 6751 as part of the Government's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case at the partner-level TEFRA proceeding, the Court declines to do so. Under TEFRA's two-tiered structure, the penalty determination occurs-and indeed, concludes-at the partnership-level. It thus follows that any \"initial determination\" of such penalty, as required by \u00a7 6751, must be done prior to the initiation of the partnership-level proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the Fifth Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Rodgers\n   </em>\n   , \"TEFRA [ ] created a two-stage procedure for the IRS to determine partnership-related tax matters: first, the IRS assesses partnership items, making any adjustments it deems necessary, and then it may initiate proceedings against individual partners.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12171961\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/181/\">\n    843 F.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (5th Cir. 2016).

Given the conclusive nature of the penalty assessment that is made at the partnership-level proceeding, it necessarily follows that any approval to assess that penalty must take place prior to the subsequent partner-level proceeding. In determining when approval must be obtained, the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   found that \"it must be the case that the approval is obtained when the supervisor has the discretion to give or withhold it. That discretion is lost once the Tax Court [or district court] decision becomes final.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277232\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/190/#p196\">\n    851 F.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   was focused on the finality of deficiency procedures under \u00a7 6215, the same finality rings true of the partnership-level proceedings under TEFRA. Any discretion to assess the penalty is lost once the adjustments are finalized by either the FPAA or a district court's decision under \u00a7 6226. As such, the initial penalty determination under \u00a7 6751 must come before the initiation of the partner-level proceedings, which merely apply the penalty to the individual partners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Allowing taxpayers to assert \u00a7 6751 at the partner-level proceeding would also frustrate the intended purpose of TEFRA's two-tiered structure. The Supreme Court cautioned in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   that \"barring partnership-level courts from considering the applicability of penalties that cannot be imposed without partner-level inquiries would render TEFRA's authorization to consider some penalties at the partnership level meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701994\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/31/\">\n    571 U.S. at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701994,12584652\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/557/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This streamlined process allows the IRS to pursue partnership items against the partnership as a whole rather than against its individual partners in individual deficiency proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callaway v.

Indeed, as the Fifth Circuit has noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Before 1982, examining a partnership for federal tax purposes was a tedious process. A partnership filed an informational tax return on a Form 1065, which reflected the distributive shares of partnership income, gains, deductions, and credits attributable to the partners. If the IRS sought to adjust an item on a\n   partnership return, the IRS had to examine each partner's individual return. As a result, the IRS could not ensure consistent adjustments of partnership items among partners. In response, Congress enacted the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-248,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Stat.%20324\">\n    96 Stat. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648-671(\"TEFRA\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Duffie v.

The Fifth Circuit pointed out that TEFRA's singular partnership proceeding meant the IRS would not have \"to conduct individual 'partner level' proceedings for each member of a partnership.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223139\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/362/#p365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Prati v.

Cl. 2008) ). Requiring the IRS to get an initial determination, pursuant to \u00a7 6751, before applying the partnership-related penalties to the individual partners would undermine TEFRA's procedural structure and make the penalty determinations at the partnership-level proceeding an empty gesture. Moreover, to find otherwise would force the district court to revisit the applicability of the penalty at the partner-level proceeding, which directly contradicts the statutory language and both the purpose and limited scope of the partner-level proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As the applicability of the penalties has already been conclusively determined and extensively litigated, the Court finds the present circumstances are more in line with those in which other circuits refused to consider \u00a7 6751 claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mellow Partners v.

In\n   <em>\n    Mellow Partners\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit declined to consider the taxpayer's \u00a7 6751 claim because it never raised this challenge during the Tax Court proceedings. The court reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Nothing precluded [the taxpayer] from doing so. Section 6751 has been in existence since 1998. [The taxpayer] was free to raise the same, straightforward statutory interpretation argument the taxpayer in\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   made-that is, that the language of \u00a7 6751(b)(1) requires IRS to obtain written approval by a certain point in the process in order to impose penalties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Mellow Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516901\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1070/#p1080\">\n    890 F.3d at 1081-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Kaufman\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit found the taxpayers had waived their \u00a7 6751 claim because they failed to raise it \"before taking th[e] appeal (or, indeed, at any earlier point in the labyrinthine history of th[e] litigation).\"\n   <em>\n    Kaufman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181902\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/56/\">\n    784 F.3d at 59, 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, despite the years of ongoing litigation that have ensued, the Taxpayers raised compliance with \u00a7 6751\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     for the first time\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   not in the underlying partnership-level proceedings or their appeals, not in the administrative claim for a refund, not in the complaint, but in the initial disclosures served after this refund case was filed. The proper place to raise compliance with \u00a7 6751 was at the partnership-level proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court also notes that this finding is in line with the very purpose of \u00a7 6751, which was to prevent the IRS from asserting inappropriate penalties or using penalties as bargaining chips.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277232\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/190/#p196\">\n    851 F.3d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the legislative history). After the partnership-level TEFRA proceeding, the penalty has been conclusively determined to be justified against the partnership. The intent and purpose behind the procedural safeguard of \u00a7 6751 is met at that time. Here, the penalties had already been asserted as part of the partnership-level proceedings and subsequent years of litigation in both the district court and the Fifth Circuit. The penalties are clearly appropriate and thus there is no need for such a procedural safeguard at\n   the partner-level proceeding which merely applies the penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
