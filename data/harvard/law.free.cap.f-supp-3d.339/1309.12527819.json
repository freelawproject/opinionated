BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Debra Perkins (\"Perkins\") lives at 455 N.W. 30th Terrace, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where she has lived for over 30 years. ECF No. [39] at 3 \u00b6 4. The front portion of Perkins' residence has a ground-level porch area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From the porch, there is single step up to the front door to access the residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Reynard Stevens (\"Stevens\") worked as a \"mail carrier assistant\" for the United States Postal Service (\"Defendant\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 5. Defendant advises the Court that pursuant to USPS policy, \"carriers are to leave packages at residence in a location that the customers do not step out and hurt themselves.\" ECF No. [39] at 5 \u00b6 10. Stevens attended USPS \"academy training\" for mail carriers, where he received further instruction regarding placement of packages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [39-2] at 11:4-13. Specifically, Stevens was trained to always place packages behind the door rather than in the doorway so that people do not fall on them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 23, 2013, Stevens delivered a package to Perkins at her residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 \u00b6 7. Stevens placed the package on Perkins' front porch away from the opening area of the door.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later that same day, upon exiting her residence, Perkins stepped out of the front door and tripped on the package.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; ECF No. [47] at 2 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this lawsuit, Perkins has sued Defendant for negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\") alleging that Defendant breached its duty to have packages placed in a reasonably safe manner, causing her to slip on the package and sustain injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [1]. Defendant has moved to dismiss the Complaint and, in the alternative, for summary judgment, on the basis that the USPS mail carrier's decision of whether or not to leave a package and/or where to place it at a residence, is encompassed within the discretionary function exception to the FTCA ( 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2680(a) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [39] at 2.

Cir. 1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, the Defendant advises the Court that \"[p]ursuant to USPS policy (currently in force as well as that which was applicable in April 2013) carriers are to leave packages at residences in a location that the customers do not step out and hurt themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [39] at 5 \u00b6 10. Additionally, Stevens testified in his deposition that he was trained by USPS to always place packages behind the door rather than in the doorway so that people do not fall on them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. ECF No. [39-2] at 11:4-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant contends that \"no USPS policy regarding package placement of residential mail required USPS carriers to use any particular procedure or direct the manner of such delivery (e.g. package placement in front or behind the door).\" ECF No. [54] at 1. Acknowledging that Stevens has testified he was trained to place packages behind the door, Defendant appears to argue that USPS's training of its mail carriers does not amount to USPS policy. The Court is not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sakal v. United States\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff slipped and fell on a boat ramp at Everglades National Park (the \"Park\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203782138\">\n    2010 WL 3782138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 28, 2010). Plaintiff sued the Government pursuant to the FTCA, alleging that it failed to maintain the subject premises in a safe condition by allowing water, debris, seaweed, moss, and algae to accumulate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203782138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, contending that the Park's employees' decisions as to how to maintain the ramp are discretionary and the sort of policy decisions Congress intended to shield with sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203782138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In determining what constituted the Park's policy, the Court considered the Park's (1) written and unwritten policies requiring employees to identify, report, and mitigate hazardous conditions; and (2) unwritten policy and practice of employees to visually inspect the ramp on a daily basis and walk across it to determine whether it felt slippery and needed cleaning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Court concluded that \"the Park's written and unwritten policies provided a fixed, readily ascertainable mandate to visually inspect and maintain the Ramp, and thus the government's conduct was not discretionary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Sakal\n   </em>\n   , this Court considers USPS's official policy and the unwritten policy and practice of employees, to assess\n   the standard that USPS provided for employees to follow. USPS's training of its carriers to place packages behind the door, together with its official policy that carriers are to leave packages in a location that the customers do not step out and hurt themselves, \"provided a fixed readily ascertainable mandate\" for employees to follow. USPS instructed mail carriers as to where they must specifically place packages (behind the door). As such, the Court finds that Stevens' conduct was not discretionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, even if Stevens' conduct involved an element of judgment, the discretionary function exception would not apply unless \"the challenged actions are the kind of conduct that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1526-27 (internal citations omitted).
