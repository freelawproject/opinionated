Rather, all that is alleged is that Iovance's data was copied. In other words, the complaint does not allege that the location of Iovance's original electronic files, to the extent they exist in physical form, was ever changed. As a consequence, Iovance has not alleged that Fischkoff \"receive[d] or br[ought]\" into the State of New Jersey, the only actual \"movable property\" that could be the subject of a claim under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Certainly, Fischkoff's act of copying caused him to possess a copy of Iovance's electronic files in some physical form. But by alleging that these files were copied from Iovance's servers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PAA \u00b6\u00b6 34, 42, 98, the PAA by implication alleges that Fischkoff created an entirely new electronic file on his hard drive or on the email server of his service provider. In any event, there is no allegation that a physical file in Iovance's possession was ever transported from Iovance's offices or servers to New Jersey. Iovance's claim thus fails for the same reasons as would a claim by Iovance that Fischkoff took photographs of confidential Iovance information and brought those photographs to New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   While this interpretation of the statute seems obvious, it is bolstered by the fact that, under New Jersey law, where a criminal statute is subject to a broad and a narrow interpretation, the court is \"constrained to apply the narrow one.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Indeed,\n   <em>\n    A &amp; G Research\n   </em>\n   , like our case, involved a claim that the defendant had copied plaintiff's computer files.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-8. After discussing the arguments for and against the application of the statute to this conduct, the court asserted merely that \"it is apparent that questions of fact exist as to whether the New Jersey Theft and Related Offenses statute applies on these facts and, further, as to whether Defendants are liable under the statute ... for their conduct in downloading and using computer data from A &amp; G's computers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *21. The court gave no explanation as to why the claim actually fit into the Theft Act's elements. In light of the lack of reasoning, and given the fact that\n   lovance's data remained where it was after Fischkoff committed the conduct complained of in the counterclaim, we decline to follow A &amp; G Research\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because Iovance has not stated a claim under the Theft Act, assertion of the proposed counterclaim in an amended complaint would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendant's motion to amend (Docket # 106) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defendant's Notice of Motion for Leave to Amend Answer and Counterclaims, filed July 27, 2018 (Docket # 106); Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants' Motion for Leave to Amend Answer and Counterclaims, filed July 27, 2018 (Docket # 106-1); Declaration of Kimberly Lunetta in Support of Defendants' Motion for Leave to Amend Answer and Counterclaims, filed July 27, 2018 (Docket # 106-2) (\"Lunetta Decl.\"); Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Leave to Amend Their Answer and Counterclaims, filed August 17, 2018 (Docket # 113) (\"P.
