RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner WTA Tour, Incorporated (\"WTA\") is a New York non-profit membership corporation that organizes a circuit of international women's tennis tournaments. Its members include female tennis players and the companies that own and operate the affiliated tournaments. Co-Petitioner Steve Simon is the WTA's CEO. Respondent Super Slam Limited (\"Super Slam\" or \"SSL\") is a Cypriot company and WTA member. Super Slam is owned by co-Respondent Ion Tiriac, a retired professional tennis player and businessman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Three lawsuits have been filed against the WTA (two of which also name Simon) in Cyprus, Romania, and Spain. Petitioners argue that these suits have been brought by, or on behalf of, respondents. Petitioners further argue that the suits are precluded by Super Slam's Membership Agreement with the WTA, which includes an arbitration clause. Petitioners therefore ask that this Court (1) compel Respondents to arbitrate their claims against WTA and Simon, and (2) enjoin Respondents from prosecuting the foreign lawsuits. Petitioners further request limited discovery relating to the Spanish lawsuit that might support the motion for an anti-suit injunction. Respondents, in turn, move to dismiss the petition on the ground that the arbitration clause does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After receiving full briefing from the parties, the Court heard oral argument on September 17, 2018. Upon careful consideration, the Court, on October 1, 2018, issued a \"bottom-line\" Order granting the petition to compel arbitration, denying the motion to dismiss the petition, granting Petitioners' request for limited discovery relating to the Spanish lawsuit, granting the motion for an anti-suit injunction as to the Cyprus lawsuit, and denying the motion for an anti-suit injunction as to the Romanian and Spanish lawsuits, with leave to renew the motion as to the Spanish lawsuit upon completion of the ordered discovery. This Opinion sets forth the reasons for these rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Super Slam's WTA Membership Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The underlying facts are largely undisputed. Petitioner WTA is a New York non-profit membership corporation that organizes a circuit of women's tennis tournaments in 30 countries. Pet. \u00b6 14, ECF No. 1. This circuit is known as the \"WTA Tour.\" Pet. \u00b6 14. Its members include professional tennis players and the owners of affiliated tournaments. Pet. \u00b6 2. Petitioner Steve Simon is WTA's CEO. Pet. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Respondent Ion Tiriac is a retired Romanian tennis star and current Monaco resident. Pet. \u00b6 13. Petitioners allege that Tiriac is the owner of Respondent Super Slam Limited, a Cypriot company. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Although Respondents' Rule 7.1 Disclosure Statement (which is not formally part of this motion practice) alleges that Super Slam is wholly owned by Tiriac Holdings Limited, also a Cypriot company, which is in turn owned by the Puma Foundation, a Panamanian company,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16, Respondents concede in their papers that\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   part of this motion practice that Ion Tiriac is at least \"one of the beneficial owners\" of Tiriac Holdings. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 2, ECF No. 21. But (while not essential to any of the Court's bottom-line rulings here) it appears that he is in fact the sole owner, or at least is estopped from claiming otherwise, because of the following history:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 2, 2008, the WTA entered into a Membership Agreement with Evington Finance Corporation. Leader Decl. Exh. A, ECF No. 6-1. On June 23, 2010, Ion Tiriac\n   sent a request to the WTA asking that the membership rights of Evington Finance Corporation be transferred to a Cypriot company \"subject to the confirmation that [Tiriac is] the owner\" of both companies. Leader Decl. Exh. A. As part of that request, Tiriac \"certif[ied] and covenant[ed]\" to the WTA that he was the \"sole owner\" of both Evington Finance and the Cypriot company. Leader Decl. Exh. A. Tiriac further represented that \"[w]e shall continue to comply with the terms of the aforementioned agreement.\" Leader Decl. Exh. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The initially unnamed Cypriot company was later identified as Super Slam Limited. Specifically, on December 13, 2011, Super Slam sent a letter to the WTA \"to confirm that Super Slam Limited is a company owned 100% by Mr. Ion Tiriac\" and that it was \"Mr. Tiriac's wish\" that the membership be transferred to Super Slam. Leader Decl. Exh. B, at 3, ECF No. 6-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter was accompanied by certificates indicating that Super Slam's stock was held by two shareholders in trust for Tiriac. Leader Decl. Exh. B, at 4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That same day, a representative of WTA confirmed the transfer. Leader Decl. Exh. E, at 3, ECF No. 6-5. No transfer fee was required because the WTA understood this to be \"a transfer in name only\" and that \"Ion remain[ed] the sole owner of the membership.\" Leader Decl. Exh. E, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 13, 2012, the WTA entered into a Membership Agreement to transfer Evington's membership rights to Super Slam. Pet. Exh. 1, at 2, ECF No. 1-1. As part of the transfer, Super Slam agreed to assume all of Evington's rights, responsibilities, and obligations under the Membership Agreement. Pet. Exh. 1, at 2. In particular, Super Slam would now have \"the right to organize and stage a top level WTA Tournament in Madrid.\" Pet. Exh. 1 \u00b6 2. Super Slam would also be required to arbitrate any disputes \"aris[ing] out of or relat[ing] to\" the Agreement, as well as \"any issues relating to [Super Slam's] WTA membership.\" Pet. Exh. 1 \u00b6 16. Disputes would be governed by New York state law, and the arbitration would be conducted according to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Pet. Exh. 1 \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a result of the WTA Membership Agreement, Super Slam now owns the Mutua Madrid Open, a WTA tournament in Madrid, Spain. The Open is a \"combined event,\" meaning that there is both a women's and a men's tournament, the men's side being organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals. Pet. \u00b6 18. The Open is also one of only four \"Premiere Mandatory events,\" meaning all players who qualify for it must participate. Pet. \u00b6 18; Pet. Exh. 1 \u00b6 3. The Open is, in Respondents' words, \"one of the most prestigious annual tennis events,\" subordinate only to the Grand Slam events and the finals. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Super Slam, as a condition of its Membership Agreement, is required to pay equal prize money in both the men's and women's tournaments. Pet. Exh. 1 \u00b6 8(a). According to Respondents, Super Slam has assigned the right to manage the Madrid Open to Limpet Sports Management BV, a Dutch company, which has in turn contracted with Madrid Trophy Promotion (\"MTP\"), a Spanish company, to organize and promote the tournament. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Ilie Nastase is Disciplined by the WTA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In April 2017, Ilie Nastase, another former Romanian tennis star (and not a party to this action), was serving as the \"non-playing\n   captain\" of the Romanian team during the Federation Cup (or \"Fed Cup\") event. Pet. \u00b6 20. The Fed Cup is organized by the International Tennis Federation; it is not a WTA event. Pet. \u00b6 20. Nastase was ejected from the court for \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" after swearing at game officials and British players, and the ITF provisionally suspended him. Pet. \u00b6 20. According to Petitioners, Nastase had also made a series of inappropriate comments in the days leading up to the event. Pet. \u00b6 20. Because several of his insults were directed at WTA members, the WTA placed Nastase on its \"No Credential List,\" meaning he could attend WTA events but could not participate or enter restricted areas. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The next month, May 2017, the WTA learned that Nastase was going to present the trophy to the winner of the Mutua Madrid Open. Pet. \u00b6 22. Petitioner Simon sent an email cautioning the tournament director against allowing Nastase to participate, since he was on the No Credential List, and warning that sanctions would follow if the tournament went through with it. Pet. \u00b6 22. Nonetheless, Nastase was allowed to present the winner of the Open with a trophy during the on-court ceremony. Pet. \u00b6 23. According to Respondents, the \"Ion Tiriac Trophy\" is named for and belongs to Tiriac, and is \"one of the most expensive trophies ever made for sport.\" Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 7-8. Respondents also admit that Tiriac decides which guests attend the award ceremony and that it was his decision to have Nastase present the trophy. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following the close of the tournament, petitioner Steve Simon released this statement on the WTA website and Twitter account:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   It was an exciting final match and I heartily congratulate Simona and Kristina for their outstanding display of tennis. The only shadow cast on the day was Mr. Nastase's invitation to participate in today's award ceremony. He had no place on court today. He is currently under a provisional suspension by the ITF for his prior offensive actions and we revoked his credential privileges at WTA events while the investigation is being completed. It was both irresponsible and unacceptable of the Madrid Open to bestow him an official role. The Madrid tournament is a Premier-level event and held to the highest standards of professional tennis and leadership which were not reflected today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pet. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Foreign Lawsuits Are Filed Against the WTA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Subsequently, Tiriac brought two lawsuits against the WTA and Simon alleging that the above-quoted statement was defamatory. The first was filed in Cyprus on October 27, 2017, by Tiriac and Super Slam. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 9-10; Pet. Exh. 7, at 2, ECF No. 1-7. The second was brought by Tiriac and Nastase in Romania in January 2018. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 9; Pet. Exh. 3, ECF No. 1-3. Petitioners were served in the Romanian action in February 2018, and in the Cyprus action in April 2018. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, Madrid Trophy Promotion sued the WTA in Spain on September 24, 2017, alleging that the WTA had engaged in anti-competitive practices by forcing tournament owners to award equal prize money to male and female winners. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 10-11. Petitioners claim that Tiriac directed MTP to file this lawsuit. Pet. \u00b6 34. At least as of August 13, 2018, Petitioners claimed not to have been served in the Spanish action. Tr. Aug. 13, 2018, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Instant Petition to Compel Arbitration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Petitioners now seek to enforce the arbitration clause of the Membership Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   They ask this Court to compel Super Slam and Tiriac to submit to arbitration. They also seek an anti-suit injunction against all three foreign lawsuits. Pet. at 13. As a fallback alternative to arbitration, Petitioners ask this Court to compel Respondents to litigate their claims in New York, as Petitioners argue is required by the forum selection clause of the WTA By-Laws. Pet. Exh. 2 \u00a7 10.12(a), (c), ECF No. 1-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Respondents object that several parties to the foreign litigation - Tiriac, Nastase, and MTP - are not signatories to the Membership Agreement between WTA and Super Slam, nor, they argue, have Petitioners alleged any plausible theory by which a non-signatory could be bound by the arbitration agreement. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 12-17. While Respondents do not contest that Super Slam is bound by the Membership Agreement, they take the position that none of the claims at issue in the foreign lawsuits fall within the scope of the arbitration clause. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the initial conference on August 13, 2018, Petitioners' counsel affirmed that no discovery was requested so far as either the Cypriot or Romanian actions were concerned. Tr. Aug. 13, 2018, at 10. Petitioners requested, however, limited discovery regarding the Spanish action, specifically relating to MTP's relationship to Super Slam and Tiriac. Tr. Aug. 13, 2018, at 10-11. Counsel envisioned \"10 or 12 items\" of document discovery and three depositions, of Tiriac; of Gerard Tsobanian, the director of the Madrid Open; and of Christos Liasi, a signatory for Super Slam. Tr. Aug. 13, 2018, at 11. Respondents asked that the instant motions be resolved before any discovery were ordered, and this Court agreed. Tr. Aug. 13, 2018, at 14-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Petition to Compel Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Petitioners seek to compel respondents Super Slam and Ion Tiriac to arbitrate their disputes with WTA and Simon. Respondents do not challenge that the Membership Agreement between Super Slam and WTA is valid, including its arbitration clause. They argue, instead, (1) that the Membership Agreement does not bind non-signatories, including Tiriac, and (2) that the scope of the Membership Agreement does not encompass the claims raised by the foreign lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[F]ederal policy strongly favors arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution process,\" and that policy is \"even stronger in the context of international business transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    David L.

Respondent Super Slam, a signatory of the Membership Agreement, is plainly bound by the arbitration clause, and Respondents have not argued otherwise. Respondents contend, however, that Tiriac, Nastase, and MTP cannot be bound by the Agreement's arbitration clause because they are not signatories. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As an initial matter, Respondents insist that Petitioners seek to compel non-parties Ilie Nastase and MTP to arbitration, and argue that the Court cannot issue an order compelling non-parties to arbitrate. It does not matter whether the Court\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   do so, however, because - contra Respondents - Petitioners have never asked the Court to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. at 13 (requesting only that the Court grant relief against Respondents); Pet'r's Reply Mem. Supp. Pet. 5, ECF No. 28 (repeating that \"Petitioners\n   are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking to compel MTP or Nastase to arbitrate\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The only remaining question, then, is whether Tiriac may be bound by the arbitration agreement, despite not signing it. Because arbitration is a creature of contract, typically only the parties to an arbitration agreement can be compelled to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    Thomson-CSF, S.A. v. Am.

This does not, however, exempt non-signatories entirely. The Second Circuit has recognized five theories, \"aris[ing] out of common law principles of contract and agency law,\" by which a signatory to an arbitration agreement may compel a non-signatory to arbitrate: incorporation by reference; assumption; agency; veil-piercing/alter-ego; and estoppel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414732\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/773/#p776\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Petitioners argue that Tiriac is bound to the present arbitration agreement by estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"A party is estopped from denying its obligation to arbitrate when it receives a 'direct benefit' from a contract containing an arbitration clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

A benefit is \"direct\" when it \"flow[s] directly from the agreement,\" while an indirect benefit is one that derives from the contractual\n   <em>\n    relation\n   </em>\n   between the parties rather than from the contract itself.\n   <em>\n    MAG Portfolio Consultant, GMBH v.

Although Petitioners' initial papers could have been clearer in this respect, the Court finds that the argument was adequately presented. Petitioners argued that Tiriac could not \"avoid the obligations in the Membership Agreement when he takes the\n   <em>\n    direct benefits\n   </em>\n   of the same agreement - including the reputational, operational, and financial benefits from owning the Madrid Tournament pursuant to the Membership Agreement.\" Pet'r's Mem. Supp. Pet. 14, ECF No. 5 (emphasis added). This language of \"direct benefits\" plainly sounds in estoppel. Moreover, immediately following this sentence were citations to two cases about compelling a non-signatory to arbitration via estoppel, followed by explanatory parentheticals highlighting the discussion of the estoppel theory. Pet'r's Mem. Supp. Pet. 14-15. While Petitioners would have been well served to include the word \"estoppel\" outside of parentheses in their opening memorandum, their failure to do so does not prevent this Court from considering the argument, especially since Respondents were able to respond to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp.

Leader Decl. Exh. A. In that same document, Tiriac promised that \"[w]e shall continue to comply with the terms of the aforementioned agreement that granted the sanction or membership rights.\" Leader Decl. Exh. A. Super Slam has itself represented to the WTA that it is \"100% owned by Mr. Ion Tiriac.\" Leader Decl. Exh. B, at 3. WTA understood the transfer to be \"a transfer in name only\" because \"Ion [Tiriac] remains the sole owner of the membership,\" and it waived the transfer fee that would ordinarily apply on that basis. Leader Decl. Exh. E, at 3. Further still, Tiriac has described himself to the press as the \"owner\" of the Madrid tournament, Leader Decl. Exh. C, ECF No. 6-3, as well as claiming to make tens of millions of Euros in profit from the tournament each year, Leader Decl. Exh. D, ECF No. 6-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Respondents offer virtually no rebuttal beyond misrepresenting Petitioners' argument as \"merely contend[ing] that Tiriac is the 100% owner of SSL.\" Resp. Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). Respondents are correct that Tiriac's mere ownership of Super Slam would not bind Tiriac to Super Slam's arbitration agreements. But it is obvious that Tiriac directly benefits from the Membership Agreement, given that he requested the transfer of ownership from Evington to Super Slam; he, Super Slam, and WTA all understood Tiriac to be the real party in interest and the true owner of the Madrid Open; and Tiriac represented himself to the press as owning the Open. Indeed, Respondents' own presentation of the facts notes that the winner of the Madrid Open receives the \"Ion Tiriac trophy,\" which is \"one of the most expensive trophies ever made for sport\" and \"the personal property of Tiriac,\" \"awarded to the winner of the tournament in a ceremony where ... guests of his choice participate.\" Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 7-8. Respondents also describe the Madrid Open as \"one of the most prestigious annual tennis events.\" Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, even apart from any financial benefit, it is quite clear that Tiriac receives a direct reputational benefit from the fact that his wholly-owned company runs a prestigious tennis tournament featuring a lavish trophy named in his honor. In other words, Tiriac directly benefits from Super Slam's ownership of the tournament, which is itself entirely the result of the Membership Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tencara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585994\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/349/#p353\">\n    170 F.3d at 351-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that shipowners were bound by arbitration clause in contract between shipyard and American Bureau of Shipping, which inspected the boat; inspection directly benefitted shipowners because it entitled them to lower insurance rates and to sail under the French flag);\n   <em>\n    Everett v.

His interests are neither represented nor vindicated by Tiriac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Petitioners suggest that this Court can simply enjoin Tiriac from proceeding in the Romanian litigation, leaving Nastase's claims alone. In other words, Petitioners argues that the \"action\" for\n   <em>\n    China Trade\n   </em>\n   purposes is Tiriac's Romanian claims against WTA and Simon, not the Romanian lawsuit as a whole. The caselaw does not clearly resolve whether Petitioners are correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On the one hand, in articulating the standard, the Second Circuit has consistently demanded that the parties to the foreign suit be the same.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Paramedics Electromedicina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247113\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/645/#p652\">\n    369 F.3d at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the parties to the \"parallel litigation\" must be the same).

Moreover, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that an anti-suit injunction would be warranted if Tiriac had brought a separate Romanian action, no obvious interest is served by permitting him to insulate himself from that remedy by joining his case to the claims of another plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This Court has found only a few decisions from courts in this Circuit addressing this precise issue.

For one thing, if the\n   <em>\n    China Trade\n   </em>\n   analysis could be conducted piecemeal, there would be no need for the doctrine that \"substantial similarity\" between the parties suffices. The cases applying that doctrine could instead have been resolved on the ground that the party to be enjoined was present in both actions and that that party's claims were separable from those of the other parties in the foreign lawsuit.

Those principles suggest that, absent extraordinary circumstances, such injunctions should ordinarily be limited to situations where foreign litigation entirely duplicates domestic litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   However, while this means that an anti-suit injunction will not lie in the case of the Romanian action, a separate issue is presented by the Spanish action, which is by MTP against the WTA.

Moreover, the basis for the Spanish lawsuit - which heavily relies on the WTA Membership Agreement - suggests that either Super Slam or Tiriac, or both, may in fact\n   have a significant interest in that lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the full nature of the relationship between Tiriac and MTP remains unclear, and Petitioners have not demonstrated that Tiriac either caused the Spanish lawsuit to be filed or controls its prosecution.

Cyprus does not have a stronger interest in hearing this dispute than a New York arbitral forum, nor is it better suited to resolving the threshold issues of arbitrability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Ordinary Factors for Granting an Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Additionally, however, Petitioners must meet the ordinary standard for a preliminary injunction, i.e. likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm absent the injunction, and a showing that the injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    North American Soccer League\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516072\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/32/#p37\">\n    883 F.3d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As to the first prong, Petitioners are correct that the relevant inquiry is the likelihood of success on the merits of their argument that the claims must be submitted to arbitration - not, as respondents claim, on the merits of the substantive foreign law claims.

March 7, 1995] ); Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 24-25. For the reasons stated above, the Court has already concluded that the claims must be submitted to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Petitioners claim that the \"specter of inconsistent rulings\" constitutes irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Keep on Kicking Music\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265513\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/585/#p590\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court is not convinced by this argument; every instance of concurrent litigation will raise at least the possibility of inconsistent rulings, yet\n   <em>\n    China Trade\n   </em>\n   is quite clear that anti-suit injunctions are to be unusual, not the norm. Nonetheless, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm if they are forced to litigate rather than arbitrate this dispute. Even if they ultimately prevail in the foreign proceedings, they will have lost the very benefit of the arbitration clause, which was to avoid litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, a preliminary injunction serves the public interest, as enforcing the arbitration clause supports the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paramedics Electromedicina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247113\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/645/#p652\">\n    369 F.3d at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Petitioners' motion for an anti-suit injunction is granted as to the Cypriot action.

The motion is denied with respect to the Romanian action, based on the lack of identity of parties. The motion is also denied with respect to the Spanish action, with leave to Petitioners to renew that application upon completion of the discovery ordered herein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Petitioners' Request for Limited Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   At the August 13, 2018 conference, Petitioners requested limited discovery\n   into the relationship between Super Slam, Tiriac, and MTP. The original petition includes little more than allegations that Tiriac controls MTP and caused it to file the Spanish lawsuit. However, those allegations are made somewhat more robust by exhibits attached to Petitioners' reply papers. It appears to the Court that all of the reply exhibits should have been available to Petitioners from the start, and Petitioners offer no explanation for their failure to include them with the original petition. Respondents object, somewhat half-heartedly, to the exhibits being considered. Resp. Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 1 n.1. However, since Respondents filed a sur-reply to Petitioners' reply, and since they do not claim surprise or request additional time to rebut the new exhibits, Respondents have not been prejudiced. Moreover, some of the exhibits seem genuinely material to the issue of whether Petitioners are entitled to any discovery. The Court therefore exercises its discretion to consider the reply exhibits discussed herein.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bayway Refining Co.\n   </em>\n   , 215 F.3d at 226 ;\n   <em>\n    Revise Clothing, Inc. v.

H, at 5, ECF No. 30-8; another article describing him as the \"manager\" of MTP, Leader Reply Exh. L, at 12, ECF No. 30-12; correspondence from Gerard Tsobanian, Director General of MTP, describing himself as reporting to Tiriac, Leader Reply Exh. M, at 22-23, ECF No. 30-13; and an article describing Tsobanian as Tiriac's \"representative in Spain,\" Leader Reply Exh. N, at 5, ECF No. 30-14. Petitioner Simon declares that in his conversations with Tiriac and Tsobanian, it has always been clear that Tiriac was in charge. Simon Reply Decl. \u00b6 7. Finally, Simon also declares that Tiriac told him that he (Tiriac) had filed suit against the WTA in Madrid. Simon Reply Decl. \u00b6 31. Given all this, Petitioners' suspicions about Tiriac's ownership or control of MTP are plausible. The Court therefore grants Petitioners' request for limited discovery on the subject of Tiriac's ownership or control of MTP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Respondents' Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, Respondents move to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Resp. Mem. Opp. Pet. 11-12. Because the Court has found that the petition not only states a claim for relief, but in fact demonstrates entitlement to relief, Respondents' motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion and Orders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby reconfirms its Order of October 1, 2018, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (1) The petition to compel Respondents Super Slam Limited and Ion Tiriac to submit their claims to arbitration in New York is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (2) Respondents Super Slam Limited and Ion Tiriac are hereby enjoined from prosecuting, directing, or participating in the proceedings entitled\n   <em>\n    Super Slam Limited and Ion Tiriac v.
