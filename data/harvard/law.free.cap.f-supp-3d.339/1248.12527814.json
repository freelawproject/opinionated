By the Declaratory Judgment Act, Congress sought to place a remedial arrow in the district court's quiver; it created an opportunity, rather than a duty, to grant a new form of relief to qualifying litigants. Consistent with the nonobligatory nature of the remedy, a district court is authorized, in the sound exercise of its discretion, to stay or to dismiss an action seeking a declaratory judgment before trial or after all arguments have drawn to a close. In the declaratory judgment context, the normal principle that federal courts should adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction yields to considerations of practicality and wise judicial administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Wilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563900\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/277/\">\n    515 U.S. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563900\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/277/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and footnote omitted).

There is no concern about friction between, or inconsistent rulings from, the state court and this court, because the same issues are not being decided in both fora. Specifically, the factual underpinnings of the state-court action -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Hethcoat's liability to the state plaintiffs - will not be relevant to the issue of coverage that forms the basis of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Accordingly, Hethcoat's argument that this court should abstain from hearing this declaratory judgment action under the Supreme Court's opinions in\n   <em>\n    Wilton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Hethcoat provides no further argument explaining why those parties are indispensable. In response, Penn National simply states that it has \"resolved the issues regarding coverage with Christopher Enterprises and is currently determining whether to join additional parties to this action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Although Hethcoat argues there are missing necessary parties, it failed to move to dismiss under Fed.

It is the defendant's burden to establish whether Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b) requires dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Molinos Valle Del Cibao, C. por A. v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, this court finds that the issue of whether Penn National has a duty to defend Hethcoat &amp; Davis is ripe for adjudication, the issue of whether Penn Nation has a duty to indemnify Hethcoat is not ripe, there is no parallel litigation pending in state court requiring the dismissal or stay of this declaratory action, and Hethcoat did not satisfy its burden of demonstrating that Penn National failed to join necessary parties. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the state plaintiffs' motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to the issue of Penn National's duty to indemnify, but DENIED as to the issue of Penn National's duty to defend.

If the court agrees that the absent person is required, as defined in Rule 19(a), then the court must join that person if feasible. If the absent person cannot be joined - usually because of jurisdictional issues - then the court must decide, using the standards set forth in Rule 19(b), whether to proceed without that person or dismiss the suit. As a practical matter, many Rule 19 motions are filed in the hope that the motion will lead to dismissal of the suit rather than joinder of the absent person.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
