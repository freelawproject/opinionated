(CAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 36.) Cresud is an Argentine company that is a leading owner of prime agricultural land in Argentina, producing basic agricultural commodities in Latin American countries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Cresud beneficially owns 64% of the outstanding common shares of IRSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 7, 2014, IRSA, together with non-party E.T.H. M.B.M Extra Holdings Limited (\"Extra\"), jointly acquired an interest in IDB Development Corporation Limited (\"IDBD\"), an Israeli holding company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 44.) IRSA invested in IDBD through its subsidiary, Dolphin Netherlands B.V. (\"Dolphin\"), and Dolphin and Extra jointly acquired a total of 53.3% of the outstanding shares in IDBD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 52, 57; Wang Decl. Ex. 1, at 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this transaction, Dolphin and Extra each held 50% of the joint interest in IDBD. (CAC \u00b6 13; Wang Decl. Ex. 1, at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to a shareholders agreement dated November 17, 2013 (\"Shareholders Agreement\"), IRSA was entitled to appoint three of nine directors on the IDBD Board of Directors (\"IDBD Board\"). As of December 31, 2014, Dolphin had appointed Alejandro Elsztain (a non-party) and Defendants Elsztain and Zang to the IDBD Board. (CAC \u00b6 14; Wang Decl. Ex. 4, at 13.) Dolphin and Extra also agreed to participate, jointly and severally, in the capital increases agreed to by the IDBD Board through resolution to carry out its business plan for 2014 and 2015, (CAC \u00b6 13), and \"pledged to participate\" in tender offers for the acquisition of shares of IDBD for a total of approximately $150 million during the years 2014 to 2016, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 10, 2015, pursuant to a rights offering approved by the IDBD Board (\"Rights Offering\"), Dolphin acquired approximately 61% of the common shares of IDBD. (CAC \u00b6 15; Wang Decl. Ex. 3.) Extra did not purchase shares in\n   the Rights Offering. (CAC \u00b6 15.) Later in the day after the Rights Offering was completed, Dolphin sold approximately 12% of the common shares of IDBD to a related party, Inversiones Financieras Del Sur Stock Corporation (\"IFISA\"). (CAC \u00b6 16; Wang Decl. Ex. 3.) IRSA publicly disclosed these transactions on February 11, 2015. (Wang Decl. Ex. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the Rights Offering, Extra demanded from Dolphin that Extra be permitted to acquire its pro rata portion of IDBD shares acquired by Dolphin in the Rights Offering-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 50% of the shares. (Wang Decl. Ex. 5, at 15.) By February 26, 2015, Extra and Dolphin had agreed to arbitrate Extra's demand for its pro rata portion of the shares. (CAC \u00b6 18; Wang Decl. Ex. 5, at 15; Wang Decl. Ex. 7, at 27; Wang Decl. Ex. 8, at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 28, 2015, Extra activated the \"Buy Me Buy You\" (\"BMBY\") provision in the Shareholders Agreement. (CAC \u00b6 63; Wang Decl. Ex. 7, at 28.) The BMBY clause provides that each party to the Shareholders Agreement can offer to the other shareholder to acquire or sell the shares it holds in IDBD at a fixed price. (CAC \u00b6 63; Wang Decl. Ex. 7, at 28.) The arbitration between Dolphin and Extra proceeded to determine whether Dolphin or Extra would be the purchaser of the other's IDBD shares under the BMBY clause. (Wang Decl. Ex. 7, at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to that meeting, on June 28 and June 30, 2015, Extra submitted a motion to the arbitrator seeking an injunction to prevent changes to the IDBD Board at the shareholders' meeting to be held on July 7, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, 34.) On July 6, 2015, the arbitrator granted Extra's motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) Dolphin was therefore prohibited from appointing any additional directors to the IDBD Board beyond the three it had appointed immediately following its original IDBD investment in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 24, 2015, the arbitrator issued the arbitration award related to the BMBY clause, and determined that Dolphin and IFISA should be designated as buyers and Extra designated as the seller. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, Extra sold all of its IDBD shares to IFISA on October 11, 2015, and the members of the IDBD Board appointed by Extra resigned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) IRSA disclosed its dispute with Extra, the arbitration, and arbitrator's award in public disclosures between June 17 and November 17, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5, at 15;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7, at 27-28, 34-35.) Following the acquisition of Extra's shares of IDBD, IRSA also disclosed that it was \"assessing ... the impact of the closing of the BMBY process with IFISA as the purchaser of the shares of IDBD held by Extra.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7, at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 19, 2015, Spruce Point Capital Management (\"Spruce Point\"), a short seller hedge fund, released a 46-page investment research report on IRSA (\"Spruce Point Report\"), warning that IRSA was in danger of breaching its debt covenants and recommending a \"strong sell\" of all IRSA and Cresud securities. (CAC \u00b6 109; Wang Decl. Ex. 8, at 1, 4.) The Spruce Point Report disclosed that Spruce Point had a short position in IRSA and Cresud shares and that Spruce Point \"[stood] to realize significant gains in the event\" the price of IRSA or Cresud shares declined after its release. (Wang Decl. Ex. 8, at 2.) The Report also stated that Dolphin did not qualify as a VCO, and therefore IDBD's $6.7 billion of net debt should have been consolidated with IRSA's financial statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8, at 5; CAC \u00b6 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 20, 2015, IRSA issued a public statement disputing the contents of the Spruce Point Report, affirming the accuracy of IRSA's financial statements, and confirming IRSA's compliance with its\n   debt covenants. (CAC \u00b6 118.) On November 24, 2015 IRSA released a more detailed response, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   At both June 30 and September 30, 2015, IRSA, IFISA and [Extra] were parties to a joint control agreement (the \"Joint Control Agreement\") with respect to their respective investments in IDBD. Therefore, IRSA did not have effective control over [IDBD] on either of such dates. For this reason, and in accordance with [the International Financial Reporting Standard], IRSA did not consolidate IDBD in its annual or most recent unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements.... Due to the October 11 termination of the Joint Control Agreement, IRSA is currently assessing whether or not it should begin to consolidate [IDBD] commencing on the date as of which the Elsztain group (i.e., IFISA, IRSA and related companies) obtained effective control over IDBD. No conclusion has been reached yet.... IRSA has carefully reviewed all its debt agreements and believes that it is in compliance with all applicable covenants and, assuming no increase in IRSA's shareholding in IDBD, will remain in compliance even if it consolidates IDBD in its future financial statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Wang Decl. Ex. 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CAC \u00b6\u00b6 119, 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 30, 2015, IRSA announced that IRSA would \"consolidat[e] IDBD in its financial statements since October 11, 2015, [the] date in which the group controlled by Eduardo Sergio Elsztain took effective control of IDBD.\" (CAC \u00b6 122;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Wang Decl. Ex. 11.) IRSA's financial statements for 2015 consolidated IDBD as a subsidiary as of October 11, 2015. (Wang Decl.

(Doc. 1.) On June 27, 2016, Defendants IRSA and Cresud moved to transfer venue to the Southern District of New York, (Doc. 2), which Plaintiff did not oppose, (Doc. 7). On July 13, 2016, Judge Paul S. Diamond so-ordered the stipulation entered into by the parties to transfer the case to the Southern District of New York, (Doc. 8), and the case was transferred and assigned to me.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 8, 2016, I granted Plaintiff's motion to appoint Stefan Sachsenberg as lead plaintiff pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(2)(B) and The Rosen Firm, P.A. as lead counsel pursuant to \u00a7 78u-4(a)(2)(B)(v).

Jan. 27, 2014) (\"Plaintiffs do not rely solely on [a short seller report], and courts in this district frequently accept allegations based on short-seller reports at this stage in a case.\"). Therefore, at this stage in the proceedings, I accept the Spruce Point Report as a sufficiently reliable factual source for Plaintiff's allegations in the CAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    IRSA's Control of IDBD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At the core of the parties' dispute is when IRSA was required to consolidate IDBD into its financials. Plaintiff alleges in the CAC that IRSA controlled IDBD as of February 11, 2015, and that IRSA's failure to disclose that control-as well as its subsequent failure to consolidate IDBD into its financials-constitutes a material misstatement or omission. Movants argue that Plaintiff's allegations are belied by the same accounting standards on which the CAC purports to rely. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IRSA Mem. 11-15.) The IFRS 10-which the parties agree governs here-states that the test for consolidation of a subsidiary is actual practical control over the subsidiary free of any \"barriers (economic or otherwise) that prevent\" an investor from exercising control, (Wang Decl. Ex. 13, \u00b6\u00b6 B22, B23), and that an investor has a \"[m]ajority of the voting rights but no power\" where those voting rights are not substantive and the holder lacks the \"practical ability to exercise\" a majority of voting rights, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 B22, B36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Movants argue that IRSA was not required to consolidate IDBD until after the Rights Offering on February 10, 2015 because IRSA lacked the \"practical ability\" to exercise control over IDBD. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IRSA Mem. 11-15.) Specifically, IRSA had a \"majority of the voting rights but no power\" because IRSA did not have the ability to appoint additional board members until the arbitrator issued his award with respect to the BMBY clause. Therefore, IRSA did not have power over IDBD until October 11, 2015, when IRSA regained control of the IDBD Board. Relying on the same IFRS 10 standard, Plaintiff argues that Extra's belief that it was necessary to enjoin IRSA in June 2015 from installing members to the IDBD Board is evidence that IRSA had the capability to change the composition of the Board prior to that date. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 12-13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, IRSA was required to consolidate IDBD as of February 11, 2015, and its failure to do so constitutes a material misstatement or omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, as I must, Plaintiff fails to allege that IRSA's failure to consolidate IDBD into its financials was a material misstatement or omission. IRSA's alleged failure to consolidate\n   IDBD turns on whether-and when-it had control over IDBD. Plaintiff argues that Dolphin had control over IDBD and could have appointed its directors any time before the arbitrator's injunction on July 6, 2015. Plaintiff repeats this theory in his opposition, but this fact is not alleged in the CAC. Plaintiff does not allege how Dolphin could have installed its directors before the arbitrator's award on October 11, 2015-either before or after the arbitrator's injunction on July 6, 2015. Instead, the facts in the CAC concerning the arbitration show that IRSA never had the \"practical ability to exercise\" control over IDBD, free from \"barriers (economic or otherwise) that prevent [IRSA] from exercising\" that control. (Wang Decl. Ex. 13, \u00b6\u00b6 B22, B23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff's reliance on the arbitrator's injunction on July 6, 2015 does not save his claim. Plaintiff contends that, at the very least, IRSA had control over IDBD from February 11, 2015-when it held a majority of the common shares of IDBD-until July 6, 2015-when the arbitrator issued the injunction. Plaintiff ignores that the next shareholders' meeting after February 11, 2015 was scheduled for July 7, 2015, and at that meeting, Dolphin could have ostensibly cast its votes for its director nominees to the IDBD Board. However, Extra sought and obtained an injunction from the arbitrator on July 6, 2015,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , prior to the date of the annual shareholders' meeting, thereby blocking Dolphin's ability to exercise control. The CAC does not otherwise allege any way that Dolphin could have installed directors to the IDBD Board prior to the annual shareholders' meeting, or otherwise exercise the necessary requisite control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    IRSA's Compliance with its Debt Covenants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff also fails to plead any facts sufficient to allege a material misstatement or omission regarding IRSA's compliance with its debt covenants. Plaintiff makes no attempt to respond to Defendants' argument that Plaintiff fails to plead that IRSA breached its debt covenants, (IRSA Mem. 16), and appears to abandon this claim in his opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romeo &amp; Juliette Laser Hair Removal, Inc. v. Assara I LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-CV-442 (TPG)(FM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204723299\">\n    2014 WL 4723299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2014) (\"At the motion to dismiss stage, where review is limited to the pleadings, a plaintiff abandons a claim by failing to address the defendant's arguments in support of dismissing that claim.\"). That failure by itself is sufficient to warrant accepting Movants' argument on this issue. In any event, the CAC pleads virtually no facts suggesting the plausibility of any such breach. The Spruce Point Report-on which Plaintiff relies-offers, at most, speculation that IRSA might have breached its debt covenants with consolidation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wang Decl. Ex. 8, at 4 (citing \"apparent covenant breach\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (\"[IRSA] appears to be in violation of its covenants ....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing \"risk of a covenant breach\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citing Spruce Point's \"belief that [IRSA] is currently in violation of its debt covenants\").) These equivocal allegations are insufficient to state a claim under Section 10(b), or to create an inference that would support such a claim. Moreover, it is undisputed that IDBD has been consolidated in the financials of IRSA since October 2015, and that no IRSA noteholder has ever declared breach of the debt covenant (or any other covenant) over the past two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that Plaintiff has not adequately pleaded a material misstatement or omission, which alone warrants dismissal of his claim for securities fraud under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To establish a strong inference of scienter, Plaintiff proceeds solely on a theory under the \"strong circumstantial evidence\" prong, arguing that the CAC adequately pleads conscious misbehavior or recklessness. (Pl. Opp. 19-23.) Even though Plaintiff does not assert an argument under the motive and opportunity to defraud prong, Plaintiff's allegations, taken as a whole, fail to establish a strong inference of scienter under this prong. Plaintiff fails to show that Defendants \"benefitted in some concrete and personal way from the purported fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    ECA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717182\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/553/187/#p196\">\n    553 F.3d at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only potential motive in the CAC that could be construed as a concrete benefit is that \"IRSA wanted to avoid consolidating the financial statements of IDBD into its own, because to consolidate would mean it was in breach of the debt covenants contained in its Global Notes Indenture.\" (CAC \u00b6 50.) But as courts in this Circuit have held, this alleged motive is insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter under the \"motive and opportunity\" prong.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mechel OAO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181632\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/811/853/#p867\">\n    811 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   867 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Cross Media Mktg.

Plaintiff primarily argues that IRSA was \"minimally reckless in not knowing that it controlled IDBD for all practical purposes between February 10, 2015 and July 6[,] 2015, and that straightforward accounting principles required Defendants both to acknowledge that control and to consolidate IDBD's financial statement's into IRSA's.\" (Pl. Opp. 20.) This circular argument is insufficient to show conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As with his argument as to material misrepresentation or omission, Plaintiff incorrectly contends that IRSA controlled IDBD for all practical purposes as of February 10, 2015. As described above, to consolidate IDBD under IFRS 10, IRSA was required to have the \"practical ability to exercise\" control over IDBD, free from \"barriers (economic or otherwise) that prevent [IRSA] from exercising\" that control. (Wang Decl., Ex. 13 (IFRS 10) \u00b6\u00b6 B22, B23.) Plaintiff repeatedly emphasizes that the arbitrator's injunction was only imposed on July 6, 2015, and that therefore IRSA controlled IDBD until at least that point in time. (Pl. Opp. 20.) The arbitrator's injunction, however, was imposed before the shareholders' meeting at which Dolphin would have apparently had its first opportunity to vote for its director nominees. The injunction stopped Dolphin from voting for its own directors to replace Extra's directors. Thus, Dolphin did not have the practical ability to exercise control over IDBD between February 10, 2015 and July 6, 2015, and it did not gain such control until October 2015. There are also no allegations that support an inference that had the meeting been scheduled earlier Extra could not have sought an injunction from the arbitrator at an earlier date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that IDBD is part of IRSA's \"core operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) However, Plaintiff's allegation that a misstatement concerned IRSA's core operations, on its own, is insufficient to show recklessness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fialkov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201276455\">\n    2016 WL 1276455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.

At most, and taken as a whole, the CAC shows that Defendants knew that Dolphin purchased a majority of IDBD shares and that Defendants hoped to obtain control over IDBD in Dolphin's dispute with Extra. Plaintiff fails to provide any basis for a conclusion that Defendants had a motive to defraud, and its allegations of conscious misbehavior or recklessness are virtually nonexistent. Although scienter allegations \"need not be irrefutable,\" or \"even the most plausible of competing inferences,\" to withstand a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    551 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), the CAC's allegations do not meet the heightened standards of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA. In other words, I find that any reasonable shareholder would deem the inference of scienter to be far less compelling than an inference of, at most, non-actionable mismanagement and negligence on the part of Defendants.

Plaintiff's letter should also specify whether any of the Individual Defendants are located in a foreign country, in which case Rule 4(m), by its own terms, would not apply.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Standard Commercial Tobacco Co. v. Mediterranean Shipping Co., S.A.\n    </em>\n    , No. 94 CIV. 7040(PKL),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20753901\">\n     1995 WL 753901\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 1995) (\"Rather, where service is in a foreign country, the Court uses a flexible due diligence standard to determine whether service of process is timely.\"). If any of the Individual Defendants is located in a foreign country, Plaintiff should explain in his letter whether this due diligence standard is met as to those defendants. I note that it is likely that even if Plaintiff's service on the Individual Defendants is deemed timely, Plaintiff's claims against the Individual Defendants will fail for the same reasons that his \u00a7 20(a) claim fails against Cresud.
