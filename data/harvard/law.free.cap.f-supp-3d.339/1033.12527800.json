Cammarata, d/b/a/ Cammarata Associates, as successor to MHP II Corporation (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Cammarata\"), filed this diversity action for declaratory relief and monetary damages against Defendants Kelly Capital, LLC, Kelly Escrow Fund V, LLC, and Michael R. Kelly. (Docket No. 1.) On December 18, 2017, Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment. (Docket No. 28.) On January 19, 2018, this Court granted Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) motion to continue briefing on this motion until after a reasonable period for discovery. (Docket No. 43.) On July 9, 2018, this motion became fully briefed and ripe for consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As will be explained in further detail below, because each of Plaintiff's claims for relief are untimely, Defendants' motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Tobacco Escrow Accounts and Escrow Releases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A brief overview of the circumstances giving rise to the contracts at issue will help in understanding the underlying dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts recited are taken directly from Plaintiff's Complaint or the findings of fact made by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in\n   <em>\n    Kelly Capital, LLC v. S &amp; M Brands, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850107\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/873/659/\">\n    873 F.Supp.2d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. 2012), on which Plaintiff's Complaint partially relies and to which Defendants do not dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at pp. 2-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the 1990's, several states initiated class actions against tobacco manufacturers seeking compensation for expenses incurred, or to be incurred, in treating diseases associated with smoking tobacco. Those actions were settled pursuant to a 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (\"MSA\"). However, not all tobacco companies were parties to the class actions or the MSA. To bring the non-signing manufacturers into the fold and achieve the same result as the MSA, states passed legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a result of the MSA or the state legislation, tobacco manufacturers in Virginia and 45 other states are required either to have signed the MSA, or to contribute annually to an escrow account certain sums for each carton of cigarettes sold. The deposited funds must remain in escrow for 25 years. While in escrow, those funds may only be used to pay judgments on, or settlements of, tobacco-related claims. At the end of 25 years, the depositing company is entitled to the deposited funds then remaining in the escrow account,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the portion of the principal that has not been used to pay judgments on, or settlements of, tobacco-related claims. The deposited funds may be invested, under tightly regulated circumstances, in very restricted investment vehicles that produce interest income. In essence, the deposited funds earn interest and the depositing company is entitled to that interest as it is earned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   S &amp; M Brands, Inc. (\"S &amp; M\") is a tobacco manufacturer and distributor of cigarettes and other tobacco products. S &amp; M is not a party to this case. S &amp; M did not sign the MSA, and thus, as required by state laws, it has established escrow accounts in each state in which it sells cigarettes. The escrow accounts are governed by an Escrow Agreement between S &amp; M and a national banking association. S &amp; M has a separate escrow account for each year in which it has sold cigarettes and thereafter funded the escrow accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The tobacco companies that establish and fund these escrow accounts cannot sell, transfer, distribute, or use the principal funds deposited in the accounts until expiration of the 25-year period. However, they can sell or distribute what are called \"escrow releases.\" An escrow release,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   vests in the purchasing entity: (1) the right to the interest income earned from the funds that have been deposited into the escrow accounts; and/or (2) the right to receive any funds, principal or interest, that remain in the escrow account at the end of the 25-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Tobacco companies that were signatories to the MSA were able to take tax deductions for their contributions to the escrow accounts because those accounts were designated as Qualified Settlement Funds (\"QSF\"). Conversely, tobacco companies that were not signatories to the MSA, and who created their own escrow accounts, were not entitled to the benefit of the QSF deduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Relationship Between Plaintiff and Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2009, S &amp; M engaged Cammarata to help locate purchasers for their escrow releases. Cammarata contacted Defendant Kelly Capital, LLC (\"Kelly Capital\"), a private equity venture that acquired and managed asset-based businesses, real estate debt, and other investments. Subsequently, Cammarata formed MHP II Corporation\n   (\"MHP\") to assist Kelly Capital with its efforts to purchase tobacco escrow releases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Commission Agreement and Kelly Capital's April 16, 2010 Purchase of S &amp; M's Escrow Releases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 12, 2010, MHP and Kelly Capital entered into a written agreement entitled, \"Commission Agreement.\" Under the terms of the Commission Agreement, MHP agreed to introduce Kelly Capital to S &amp; M, and Kelly Capital agreed to pay MHP a 5% commission based on the gross purchase price Kelly Capital or its assignee paid to S &amp; M for its tobacco escrow releases. Additionally, \"[Kelly Capital] and MHP agree that MHP shall be entitled to receive a commission fee paid upon close of any escrow relating solely to the [ S &amp; M] Escrow Funds\" by Kelly Capital or its assignee \"in the amount of [5%] of the gross purchase price ... (the 'Commission').\" (Docket No. 1-2, Compl., Ex. A., \"Commission Agreement\" \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 16, 2010, Kelly Capital assigned its rights to purchase S &amp; M's escrow releases to SEI, who purchased $30 million of S &amp; M's escrow releases for a purchase price of $10 million (the \"first tranche of escrow releases\"). It is undisputed that Kelly Capital was obligated to pay (and in fact paid) MHP a commission of $500,000 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   5% of $10 million) for this purchase, and that payment of this commission is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Kelly Capital's July 15, 2010 Purchase of S &amp; M's Escrow Releases and the First Amendment to the Commission Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 15, 2010, although there appears to be disagreement regarding the order in which they occurred, it is undisputed that three things happened: 1) Kelly Capital assigned its remaining rights to purchase S &amp; M's escrow releases to Kelly Escrow Fund V, LLC (\"Kelly Escrow\"); 2) Kelly Escrow purchased an additional $40 million of S &amp; M's escrow releases for a purchase price of $13.6 million (the \"second tranche of escrow releases\"); and 3) Kelly Capital and MHP entered into the First Amendment to the Commission Agreement (\"First Amendment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In relevant part, the First Amendment modifies the timing of Kelly Capital's payment of \"the Commission due to MHP,\" and the term \"Commission\" is defined in the Commission Agreement. (Docket No. 1-3, Compl., Ex. B., \"First Amendment\" \u00b6 1.) Specifically, the First Amendment states, \"[Kelly Capital] and MHP agree that [Kelly Capital] will pay the Commission due to MHP for the sale of any [Kelly Capital] Escrow Funds pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement upon the sale, conveyance and/or transfer of the escrow releases for [Kelly Capital] Escrow Funds to a third party end user and/or financial institution ('3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Party Buyer').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is undisputed that Kelly Capital never paid a commission to MHP for Kelly Escrow's purchase of the second tranche of escrow releases. It is this commission, in the amount of $680,000 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   5% of $13.6 million), that Plaintiff seeks to recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 111-112.) A breach of contract claim based on a written instrument is subject to a four-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. Code Civ.

To support this argument, Defendants submitted evidence that \"there has been no sale, conveyance, or transfer\" by Kelly Escrow to a third-party end user or financial institution that would trigger Defendants' obligation to pay Plaintiff's commission. Alternatively, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claim is time-barred because, by the Complaint's own allegations, the alleged breach occurred on July 15, 2010, and therefore the statute of limitations ran out on July 15, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff appears to have changed his theories of liability regarding his breach of contract claim. As Defendants observe, Plaintiff's theory, as pleaded in the Complaint, is that his second commission is \"due and owing\" under either contract. (Compl. \u00b6 112.) Under this theory, unless the discovery rule applies, Plaintiff's failure to establish a valid excuse for the late filing of his breach of contract claim means the statute of limitations ran out on October 14, 2014 at the latest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nowhere in the Complaint does Plaintiff allege that Kelly Escrow sold, conveyed or transferred the second tranche of escrow releases (or otherwise allege Defendants' obligation to pay his second commission was triggered).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in opposition, Plaintiff asserts for the first time that Kelly Escrow did in fact transfer the second tranche of escrow releases, and therefore Defendants breached the First Amendment by failing to pay his commission at the time of the transfer. Although Plaintiff's theory was not properly alleged in his Complaint, in the interests of justice and to preserve judicial economy, the Court has reviewed its merits to determine whether a triable issue of material fact exists. Plaintiff's opposition submitted evidence to establish the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   - On July 14, 2010, Kelly Capital, Emmett David Hart (\"Hart\"), Susan Ekkebus (\"Ekkebus\"), and HCF, LLC (\"HCF\") created Kelly Escrow.

B) (emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Construing all factual inferences in Plaintiff's favor for purposes of resolving Defendants' motion, the Court infers the following: 1) 50% of Kelly Capital's interest in the second tranche of escrow releases was transferred on July 14, 2010; and 2) Kelly Capital's remaining 50% interest in the escrow releases and its .00649% interest in Kelly Escrow were transferred on January 1, 2012. In addition, when the Commission Agreement and the First Amendment are read together, a reasonable finder of fact could interpret Plaintiff's and Kelly Capital's agreement as to payment of Plaintiff's second commission as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   - Kelly Capital assigned its rights to purchase S &amp; M's escrow releases to its \"affiliated entity,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Kelly Escrow, which purchased S &amp; M's escrow releases (the second tranche of escrow releases).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   - Kelly Capital is obligated to pay Plaintiff (as MHP) a 5% commission for Kelly Escrow's purchase of the second tranche of escrow releases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   - Kelly Capital's payment of said commission to Plaintiff (as MHP) is due when\n   <em>\n    Kelly Capital\n   </em>\n   , through its assignee/affiliated entity (Kelly Escrow) sold, transferred, or conveyed its interest in the second tranche of escrow releases to a third-party or financial institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Under this interpretation, the triggering event for partial payment of Plaintiff's commission occurred on July 14, 2010, when Kelly Capital transferred its 50% interest in the second tranche of escrow releases to Hart and Ekkebus. The second triggering event for the remainder of Plaintiff's commission occurred on January 1, 2012, when Kelly Capital's interest in the other 50% of the second tranche of escrow releases and its .00649% interest in Kelly Escrow were transferred to HCF, LLC. However, to the extent that the First Amendment contemplates payment only upon sale, conveyance or transfer of\n   <em>\n    Kelly Capital's\n   </em>\n   interest (through Kelly Escrow) in the second tranche of escrow releases, the triggering event for the entirety of Plaintiff's commission occurred on January 1, 2012, when Kelly Capital ceased to be affiliated with Kelly Escrow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This means that unless Plaintiff has affirmatively pleaded a valid excuse, the statute of limitations ran out on either July 14, 2014 for half of Plaintiff's commission, or on January 1, 2016, for the second half (or the entirety) of Plaintiff's commission. But as explained above, the Complaint does not allege these facts, let alone affirmatively plead Plaintiff's diligence in attempting to discover them. Nor does Plaintiff's opposition attempt to explain when and how Plaintiff made this discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, Plaintiff's breach of contract claim is untimely under any of the theories he asserts in his Complaint and opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's opposition also newly contends that three months after Defendants sued S &amp; M, \"Defendants' position was that based on the filing of the Virginia Case it [sic] could not sell, transfer or convey the escrow releases but had to\n   'wait until there's an answer form the Court on who's responsible for the taxes,' 'put the brakes on' and were 'dead in our tracks' [sic].\" (Opp'n. at p. 17.) Although this argument is not clearly articulated, it appears to be that because Plaintiff \"learned in 2014 that [the Virginia Case] had been resolved against Kelly Capital\" and thereafter issued the demand letters discussed above, it is now treating Defendants' failure to respond as an anticipatory breach. Again, not only were these facts not alleged in the Complaint, but even if they were, Plaintiff's opposition does not establish when or how he learned of Defendants' position that they would not sell, convey, or transfer the second tranche of escrow releases. The \"when\" and \"how\" is necessary to justify tolling the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For all of these reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Seventh Claim for Relief is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Fourth and Fifth Claims for Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiff's Fourth and Fifth Claims for Relief are for breach of the implied duty to perform with reasonable care and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, respectively. (Compl. pp. 16-17, 19-20.) The parties agree that each of these claims arise out of the Commission Agreement and/or First Amendment and are subject to a four-year statute of limitations under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants contend that both of these claims are predicated on their alleged failure to pay Plaintiff his commission for Kelly Escrow's purchase of the second tranche of escrow releases, and therefore the statute of limitations on these claims ran out on July 15, 2014. In opposition, Plaintiff does not directly respond to Defendants' arguments. Instead, Plaintiff collectively addresses these claims as his \"breach of contract claims,\" which the Court addressed immediately above. Thus, the Court's analysis regarding Plaintiff's breach of contract claim equally applies to these claims, but the Court shall also consider the claims individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The underlying facts of the Fourth Claim for Relief are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   - \"Defendants were required to pay Plaintiffs [sic] commission\n   <em>\n    upon the close of escrow for Defendants' purchase, transfer and conveyance of the Escrow Funds from S &amp; M.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   - \"Defendants did not pay Plaintiffs [sic] commission due and owing upon the close of escrow,\n   <em>\n    based on the purchase, transfer and conveyance of Escrow Funds from S &amp; M.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   - \"Defendants failed to use reasonable care when Defendants\n   <em>\n    assigned its [sic] rights to purchase escrow releases\n   </em>\n   to Kelly Escrow.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-91) (emphasis added.) It is clear that this claim arises out of Defendants' obligation under the Commission Agreement to pay Plaintiff a commission upon the close of escrow of its purchase of the second tranche of escrow releases from S &amp; M (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   July 15, 2010), as opposed to Defendants' obligation under the First Amendment to pay Plaintiff's commission at the time Kelly Escrow sells, conveys, and/or transfers the escrow releases \"to a third party end user and/or financial institution ('3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Party Buyer').\" (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. A &amp; Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Similarly, the Fifth Claim for Relief only vaguely alleges \"Defendants unfairly interfered with the rights of Plaintiffs to receive the benefits of the agreements.\" (Compl. \u00b6 97.) A review of the Complaint demonstrates the only \"benefit\" identified is the alleged outstanding commission for Defendants' purchase of the second tranche of escrow releases, which occurred on July 15, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As with the claims discussed above, based on the facts pleaded in the Complaint, Plaintiff should have been aware of Defendants' wrongdoing on October 14, 2010 based on Defendants' alleged representation on July 15, 2010 that the second commission would be paid 60-90 days after July 15, 2010. And because Plaintiff's opposition does not establish a valid excuse to toll these claims any further, the four-year statute of limitations alternatively ran out on October 14, 2014 at the latest. Thus, Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Fourth and Fifth Claims is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Sixth Claim for Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff's Sixth Claim for Relief is for rescission of the First Amendment. Under California law, a claim \"based upon the rescission of a contract in writing\" is subject to a four-year statute of limitations. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 337. \"The time begins to run from the date upon which the facts that entitle the aggrieved party to rescind occurred. Where the ground for rescission is fraud or mistake, the time does not begin to run until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176283\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/638/1125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendants argue that if Plaintiff prevails on this claim (thereby reinstating Defendants' obligation to pay the second commission under the Commission Agreement), he would nevertheless be unable to recover his second commission because his claim under the Commission Agreement accrued on July 15, 2010, and the statute of limitations ran out on July 15, 2014. Instead, of directly addressing this argument, Plaintiff's opposition appears to rely on the same collective \"breach of contracts claims\" arguments that the Court has addressed above. Accordingly, the Court finds its earlier analysis also applies to this claim, but nevertheless considers the claim individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, but for Defendants alleged misrepresentations and concealments, he would not have entered into the First Amendment or \"agreed to Defendants' substitute performance.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.) Plaintiff does not specify the alleged misrepresentations and concealments, and therefore the Court concludes that Plaintiff intended to rely on the same alleged misrepresentations and concealments as the First, Second, and Third Claims for Relief. Consequently, this claim is also untimely for the same reasons stated above, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Sixth Claim for Relief is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Tenth Claim for Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiff's Tenth Claim for Relief is for quantum meruit.

And because neither Plaintiff's Complaint nor its opposition establishes why the discovery rule should apply to this\n   claim, the statute of limitations ran out on October 14, 2012 at the latest.
