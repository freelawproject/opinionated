Proposed Second Amended Complaint (annexed as Ex. 1 to Klein Aff.) (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 6. Fischkoff conducts pharmaceutical and cellular therapy research and was hired in February 2016 to be Iovance's Vice President and Chief Medical Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Fischkoff conducted clinical trials among other duties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. As part of Fischkoff's written Employment Agreement, he was to be paid a base salary of $400,000 and was eligible for additional compensation bonuses, including salary incentives and stock options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. If Fishkoff were to be fired for cause, however, he would be entitled only to \"his accrued or vested compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The Employment Agreement defined cause as either \"(I) a material breach of the Employment Agreement;\" or \"(ii) improper use of confidential information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2017, Fischkoff received a letter from Iovance's Human Resources office stating that he was in material breach of his Employment Agreement because he had failed to \"perform faithfully and diligently\" his duties under the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Later that day, Fischkoff received another letter from Fardis, the Chief Executive Officer of Iovance, stating that Iovance was putting Fischkoff on a Performance Improvement Plan (\"PIP\"), under which Fischkoff could be terminated in 30 days if he did not \"improve.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. On February 22, 2017, before the 30-day PIP had expired, Fardis informed Fischkoff that he had failed the PIP and extended a new PIP period through March 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Four days after the second PIP expired, Iovance terminated Fischkoff's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fischkoff alleges that he properly performed his duties and that Iovance fabricated reasons for his termination to avoid paying money due to him contractually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 29-30. Fischkoff's amended complaint alleges breach of contract, New York Labor Law violations, retaliation under the New York Labor Law, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 55-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fischkoff now seeks to amend his complaint to add a claim for defamation based on two Iovance corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-54. The new allegations state that \"[o]n or about November 2, 2017, Defendants publicly filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2017 ... in which Defendants stated that 'Dr. Fischkoff was terminated \"for cause\" as that term is defined in his employment agreement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. The proposed complaint also alleges that \"[o]n or about March 12, 2018, the Company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 ... [that] repeated the same Defamatory Statement from the November 2017 Form 10-Q.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While not alleged in the complaint, it is undisputed that these forms are required to be filed pursuant to federal law.
