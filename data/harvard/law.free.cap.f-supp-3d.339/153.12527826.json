Kevin Castel, United States District Judge\n   Lead plaintiff IBEW Local 98 Pension Fund (\"IBEW\") has filed this federal securities fraud suit against defendants Omega Protein Corp. (\"Omega\"), Bret D. Scholtes, and Andrew C. Johannesen on behalf of itself and all others who purchased Omega stock from August 6, 2013 to March 1, 2017. After the Court consolidated multiple separate suits with IBEW's suit, defendants moved to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint. Because IBEW has not alleged an actionable misrepresentation or omission, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Omega was a publically traded nutritional products company that operated in two primary industry segments, human nutrition and animal nutrition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Consolidated Second Amended Complaint (\"CSAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13, 25). It conducted the majority of its operations in the animal nutrition segment through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Omega Protein, Inc. (\"Omega's Subsidiary\"), which was responsible for sixty-one to ninety-one percent of Omega's revenue from 2012 to 2016. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). To produce certain animal nutrition products, Omega's Subsidiary harvested menhaden, a species of fish found in the coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. (CSAC \u00b6 26). The harvesting and production process generated \"fish waste\" and bilge water (which is water that collects in the lowest part of a ship) containing oil that required disposal. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 36-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Clean Water Act establishes requirements for monitoring and disposing of fish waste and oily bilge water, and in 2011, United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia filed a criminal information charging Omega's Subsidiary with violating these requirements at its Reedville, Virginia facility. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 39, 43, 45). Two years later, Omega's Subsidiary entered into a plea agreement (the \"Virginia Plea Agreement\"), which required it to plead guilty to \"knowingly discharging pollutants from a point source into waters of the United States without a permit\" and \"knowingly discharging oil into waters of the United States in a quantity that may be harmful on numerous and discrete occasions.\" (CSAC \u00b6 46). Omega's Subsidiary agreed to pay a $5.5 million fine and $2 million for community service and to serve three years on probation. (CSAC \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Virginia Plea Agreement also required Omega's Subsidiary to develop and implement at all of its facilities an environmental compliance program. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 50-51). Omega's Subsidiary established rules and guidelines pertaining to, among other things, \"the maintenance of oil record books, safety inspections and equipment, bilge management, bilge off-loading and bail water management.\" (CSAC \u00b6 51). In addition, it created a reporting system that ostensibly allowed employees to report anonymously any non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with any applicable law or regulation, and Omega's Subsidiary stated that \"[n]o employee may be terminated or otherwise retaliated against for reporting deficiencies except where an employee abuses the system or intentionally submits false reports.\" (CSAC \u00b6 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 6, 2013, which is the start of the class period, Omega filed a press release with the Securities and Exchange\n   Commission (\"SEC\") on Form 8-K, reporting Omega's financial results for the second quarter of 2013. (CSAC \u00b6 76). Scholtes, who was Omega's CEO and President during the class period, commented on the financial results, stating that \"[w]e are pleased with [Omega's] increased earnings in the second quarter as we continued to benefit from better animal nutrition sales prices which helped drive higher revenue per ton and consolidated gross margin expansion versus the comparable period last year.\" (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 17, 76). Omega also filed on the same day its Form 10-Q, in which Omega explained that it \"has made, and anticipates that it will make in the future, expenditures in the ordinary course of its business in connection with environmental and regulatory matters\" and that \"[i]t is possible that newly enacted or existing environmental laws and regulations could require material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the Company's operations.\" (CSAC \u00b6 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Omega addressed the Virginia Plea Agreement in its Form 10-Q filing as well. It stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2010, the Company received a request for information from the EPA concerning its bail wastewater practices used in its fishing operations at its Reedville facility. In February 2011, the U.S. Coast Guard conducted inspections at the Company's Reedville facility regarding the Reedville vessels' bilge water discharge practices. Based on these inquiries, both agencies commenced investigations of the Company's bail waste water and bilge water practices at its Reedville facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2013, the Company's subsidiary, Omega Protein, Inc., resolved both the U.S. Coast Guard and EPA investigations by entering into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Pursuant to terms of the plea agreement, the Company's subsidiary pled guilty to two Clean Water Act violations. The plea agreement required the subsidiary to pay a $5.5 million fine, be placed on a three year term of probation, and implement an environmental compliance program. In addition to the $5.5 million fine, the subsidiary was required to make a $2 million contribution to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to fund projects in Virginia related to the protection of the environmental health of the Chesapeake Bay. The plea agreement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in June 2013 and the subsidiary paid both the $5.5 million fine and the $2.0 million contribution in July 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (CSAC \u00b6 80). Omega made similar disclosures on several other Forms 10-Q during the class period, each of which Johannesen (Omega's CFO) signed. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 68, 86, 93, 102, 134). Omega varied this language only slightly and added on some Forms 10-Q that Omega's Subsidiary \"will be on probation until June 2016, unless the probation period is terminated earlier by the court.\" (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 68, 86, 93, 102;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CSAC \u00b6 134). Scholtes commented on Omega's financial results on Omega's Form 8-K several more times during the class period, sometimes stating the results were \"fueled\" by, \"benefit[ed] from,\" or \"reflect[ed]\" some benign aspect of Omega's business. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 82, 98, 136, 142, 150, 152).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On all but the last Form 10-K filed during the class period, each of which Scholtes and Johannesen signed, Omega addressed the risk of Omega's Subsidiary failing to comply with the terms of its probation. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 68, 95, 122, 148). Omega explained that \"[i]f [Omega's Subsidiary] fails to comply with the terms of\n   its probation under a plea agreement entered into in June 2013, we could be subject to criminal prosecution.\" (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 95, 122, 148). Omega also reiterated that \"[t]he plea agreement and the terms of the court's sentencing order require [Omega's Subsidiary] to develop and implement an environmental compliance program at all of its facilities\" and stated that \"[t]he Company has implemented a comprehensive compliance program which covers the areas addressed by the plea agreement.\" (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 95, 122, 148, 169).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 3, 2016, Omega disclosed on its Form 10-Q that it had \"received a petition on probation ... and as a result of that petition ha[d] become aware of a criminal investigation ... into the waste water discharge practices\" of Omega's Subsidiary at its Abbeville, Louisiana facility. (CSAC \u00b6 154). Omega noted that \"[t]he petition on probation seeks to revoke the subsidiary's probation based on alleged Clean Act Water [sic] [v]iolations\" but that Omega was \"unable to determine [the petition's] potential outcome or its effects on the Company's probation status.\" (CSAC \u00b6 154). Additionally, Omega stated that if Omega's Subsidiary were found to be out of compliance with its probation terms, Omega's Subsidiary \"could be subject to additional criminal penalties or prosecution,\" including new criminal charges in the Western District of Louisiana. (CSAC \u00b6 154).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Omega asserted in its next Form 10-Q, filed on November 2, 2016, that it \"ha[d] initiated its own investigation and ha[d] been cooperating with [federal prosecutors].\" (CSAC \u00b6 158). Based on the information it had obtained, it \"believe[d] that it [was] probable that a liability ha[d] been incurred and some financial fine or penalty in connection with the Abbeville facility's wastewater discharges practices may be imposed,\" although it could not determine whether Omega's Subsidiary's actions would affect Omega's Subsidiary's probation status. (CSAC \u00b6 158).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 16, 2016 Omega filed a press release with the SEC on Form 8-K, disclosing that Omega's Subsidiary had \"entered into a plea agreement\" (the \"Louisiana Plea Agreement\") \"with the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Louisiana to resolve the previously disclosed government investigation related to [Omega's] Subsidiary's Abbeville, Louisiana operations.\" (Doc. 42-8 at 3, 4). It attached the Louisiana Plea Agreement to the Form 8-K. (Doc. 42-8 at 3, 5-10). Omega stated that \"[u]nder the [Louisiana] Plea Agreement, [Omega's] Subsidiary agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts under the Clean Water Act\" and that the prosecutors and Omega's Subsidiary \"will jointly recommend a sentence consisting of (i) a $1.0 million fine, (ii) a 3-year probationary period for [Omega's] Subsidiary, and (iii) a payment by [Omega's] Subsidiary of $200,000 for community service.\" (Doc. 42-8 at 3). Omega also disclosed that a federal district court in the Eastern District of Louisiana imposed an additional two years of probation following a hearing to determine whether Omega's Subsidiary had violated the terms of its probation. (Doc. 42-8 at 3). These additional two years of probation were to run concurrent with the three year term of probation agreed to in the Louisiana Plea Agreement. (Doc. 42-8 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Omega's Subsidiary finalized and submitted the Louisiana Plea Agreement to the court on January 18, 2017. (Doc. 42-6). The prosecutors and Omega's Subsidiary stipulated that Omega's Subsidiary, on December 8, 2014 and February 1, 2016, improperly discharged waste water from an effluent pond by failing to monitor or sample the discharged waste water and by using a pump instead of the outfall designated in its discharge permit. (Doc. 42-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Omega's Subsidiary agreed to plead guilty to two counts of \"knowingly discharg[ing] a pollutant from a point source into a water of the United States in violation of a permit\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201319\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Bill of Information,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Omega Protein, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Cr. 292 (DEW) (CBW), (W.D. La. Dec. 6, 2016). The court accepted the plea agreement, imposed a $1 million fine and $200,000 for community service, and placed Omega's Subsidiary on a three year term of probation. Judgment,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Omega Protein, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Cr. 292 (DEW) (CBW), (W.D. La. Jan. 27, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After regular trading had closed on March 1, 2017, Omega filed its Form 10-K for 2016. (CSAC \u00b6 160). In this filing, Omega disclosed, in addition to adjusted earnings per diluted share purportedly lower than expected, that \"[i]n December 2016, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information in connection with an investigation relating to a Company subsidiary's compliance with its probation terms and the Company's protection of whistleblower employees.\" (Doc. 42-12; Doc. 42-13);\n   <em>\n    SEC Form 10-K for Year Ended Dec. 31, 2016\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Omega noted that it was \"in the process of producing responsive documents to the SEC.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC Form 10-K for Year Ended Dec. 31, 2016\n   </em>\n   . And it warned that it could not \"predict the outcome of the investigation or the effect of the findings of the investigation on the Company, but [that] it is possible that the foregoing matter could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, Omega's stock fell $6.25 per share, a decrease of 23.81% from its previous closing price. (CSAC \u00b6 161).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Several investors that acquired stock from August 6, 2013 to March 1, 2017 filed suit against Omega, Scholtes, and Johannesen. Those cases were consolidated with the present case, and IBEW was appointed lead plaintiff. (Doc. 25). IBEW, in the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint, alleges on behalf of itself and others similarly situated that defendants knowingly made material misrepresentations and omissions in Omega's filings with the SEC during the class period, ultimately causing Omega's stock price to decline on March 2, 2017. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 178, 188-202). It asserts a claim for securities fraud against all defendants under section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), through section 10(b)'s implementing regulation, Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 188-96). IBEW also seeks to hold Scholtes and Johannesen liable under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), as the individuals controlling Omega. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 197-202).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It predicates these claims not only on defendants' non-disclosure of the two Clean Water Act violations at the Louisiana facility, but also on defendants' failure to disclose that Omega's Subsidiary purportedly did not monitor pH levels or comply with pH level requirements when it disposed of waste water from its Mississippi facility. (CSAC \u00b6\u00b6 53-60;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CSAC \u00b6 77). IBEW does not allege that these purported violations at the Mississippi facility have ever been discovered by government officials, investigated, charged, or, until this lawsuit, even disclosed publicly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Doc. 40). In support, defendants have attached excerpts of reports from a third-party monitor concerning Omega's Subsidiary's compliance with the terms of its probation and referenced these reports in their opening brief. (Doc. 42-1). IBEW has moved to strike the attached excerpts and any references to, and any assertions or arguments based on, these excerpts in defendants' briefing. (Doc. 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Defendants' statements concerning Omega's \"comprehensive compliance program\" are not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IBEW maintains that certain omissions rendered other statements concerning the Virginia Plea Agreement misleading. It contends that defendants were required to disclose that Omega's Subsidiary was violating the terms of its probation and that Omega's Subsidiary had failed to put in place an effective environmental compliance system because defendants disclosed that the Virginia Plea Agreement \"required\" Omega's Subsidiary to \"be placed on a three year term of probation\" and to \"implement an environmental compliance program.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , CSAC \u00b6 80). This duty arises, IBEW argues, because \"when [a company] makes a disclosure about a particular topic, whether voluntary or required, the representation must be 'complete and accurate.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Morgan Stanley Info. Fund Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686878\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/347/#p366\">\n    592 F.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Glazer v.

Defendants' disclosures\n   on this topic-the requirements of the Virginia Plea Agreement-were complete and accurate. Defendants stated exactly what the Virginia Plea Agreement required: for Omega's Subsidiary to serve a three year term of probation and to implement an environmental compliance program. IBEW's attempt to pull a duty to disclose information concerning a different topic-that is, whether Omega was complying with the requirements of the Virginia Plea Agreement-from the principle that a disclosure must be complete and accurate \"stretches th[is] principle[ ] past [its] logical breaking point.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42543\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/149/#p157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The same is true of IBEW's claim that defendants' repeated statements that Omega's Subsidiary \"will be on probation until June 2016, unless the probation period is terminated earlier by the court,\" required defendants to disclose that Omega's Subsidiary was engaged in activity that presented a risk that its probation would be extended. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , CSAC \u00b6 86). Defendants' disclosures were complete and accurate statements of the term of probation that the Virginia Plea Agreement imposed. To the extent that IBEW predicates its argument on the fact that defendants stated that Omega's Subsidiary's probation could terminate earlier than June 2016 without disclosing that its probation could also be extended, no reasonable investor would view the omission of such an obvious potential result of violating a term of probation as \"alter[ing] the 'total mix' of information available,\" and, thus, the omission is not actionable.\n   <em>\n    In re Time Warner Inc.
