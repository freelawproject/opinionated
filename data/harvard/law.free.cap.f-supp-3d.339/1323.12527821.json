(DE 135). This motion has not yet been briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This action arises from an alleged Ponzi scheme orchestrated by non-parties Robert H. Shapiro (\"Shapiro\") and his company, Woodbridge Group of Companies, LLC d/b/a Woodbridge Wealth (\"Woodbridge\"). Plaintiff's allegations, many of which were taken from a related pending enforcement action brought in this District against Shapiro and Woodbridge by the SEC (\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Robert H. Shapiro, Woodbridge Group of Companies, LLC\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , 17-24624-CV-MGC (S.D. Fla.) (the \"SEC Action\") ), describe a scheme by which Plaintiffs were marketed and sold promissory notes, fund equity units, and other offerings as low-risk, high-yield investments backed by high interest rate loans made to commercial borrowers. (DE 6 (hereinafter \"First Amended Complaint\" or \"FAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 2, 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The Scheme\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shapiro and Woodbridge offered two primary types of investments: (1) a twelve-to-eighteen month term promissory note marketed as paying a 5-8% annual return on a monthly basis known as a First Position Commercial Mortgage (\"FPCM\"), and (2) seven different private placement fund offerings with five-year terms (\"Fund Offerings\"), marketed as paying a 6-10% annual return on a monthly basis and, at the end of five years, a 2% accrued dividend and share of the profits (collectively, the \"Woodbridge Investments\" or the \"Investments\"). (FAC \u00b6 74). Neither of the Investments were ever registered with the SEC or another government agency. (FAC \u00b6 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Shapiro and Woodbridge's purported revenue source was: (1) the development and sale of properties for a profit (FAC \u00b6 77), and (2) the interest a Woodbridge affiliate would be receiving on loans to third-party owners of commercial real estate (FAC \u00b6 76). Woodbridge\n   purportedly told investors that it would pool money from its many investors and lend it to these third-party borrowers for a short term, and for only about two-thirds of the value of the real estate securing the transaction, which would ensure that the properties that secure the mortgages are worth considerably more than the loans themselves at closing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These third-party borrowers were allegedly paying Woodbridge 11-15% annual interest for short-term financing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that despite being told that they would be repaid from high interest rates that Shapiro's companies were earning on loans made to third-party borrowers, all of the third-party borrowers were actually companies affiliated with Shapiro and had no revenue or bank accounts, and did not actually pay interest on the loans. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 78). Instead, Shapiro relied on new investor funds from the Woodbridge Investments to pay the interest and dividends owed to its earlier investors, constituting a Ponzi scheme. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 78, 79). Shapiro employed the RS Trust, whose trustee is Shapiro, to conceal his fraudulent scheme and hide the fact that most of the third-party borrowers and owners of the underlying property were Shapiro and his family. (FAC \u00b6 97). \"None of the publicly available documentation indicated the RS Trust was the ultimate owner of the underlying properties that had been purchased with funds from\" the Investments, and the vast majority of loans were made to entities that Shapiro controlled and which had no revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Sales of the Investments through Sales Agents\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To sell the FPCMs and Fund Offerings, Shapiro purportedly had a team of thirty in-house employees and a network of hundreds of external sales agents to solicit investments from the public. (FAC \u00b6 80). Many of the sales agents were not licensed or registered with any regulatory agency, which was purportedly not disclosed to investors. (FAC \u00b6 82). Woodbridge paid external sales agents a 9% wholesale rate, and the sales agents in turn offered the FPCMs to their investor clients at 5% to 8% interest, and the external sales agent received the difference. (FAC \u00b6 83). Woodbridge also offered incentives to the external sales agents for promoting the FPCMs, including cash bonuses and the opportunity to earn 25 basis points on each FPCM sale for each FPCM sale closed by a colleague of a sales agent through a program called \"Pass It On.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 84). Nina Pederson, the Comptroller of Woodbridge, mischaracterized transactions from Woodbridge's operating account that were often used to pay commissions to Woodbridge's external sales force, and to pay for mortgages on property secretly purchased through the RS Trust. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 62, 102).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To sell the Investments, Woodbridge provided the sales agents with uniform, scripted information and sales materials which were in turn provided to investors (the \"Woodbridge Script\"). (FAC \u00b6 85). Plaintiffs allege that all of the information in the Woodbridge Script was false, and that in addition to outlining Woodbridge and Shapiro's purported source of revenue, Woodbridge told investors that the borrowers were \"bona fide commercial property owners who could not obtain traditional loans and were willing to pay higher rates for short-term financing.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 85-86). The Woodbridge Script purportedly told the investors that their investment, to be used to loan money to a third-party borrower, was \"secured by a hard asset collateral - the property itself.\" (FAC \u00b6 89). Woodbridge also told FPCM investors that they had a \"pro rata first-position 'lien' interest in the underlying properties,\" which meant that the investor would have priority over any other liens or claims on a property if the property owner\n   defaulted. (FAC \u00b6 91). Plaintiffs allege that Woodbridge raised at least $1.22 billion from investors in the Investments, but issued only $675 million in \"loans\" for real estate securing those investments, which generated just $13.7 million in interest from third-party borrowers. (FAC \u00b6 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The external sales agents were supervised by non-party Dayne Roseman (\"Roseman\"), the Managing Director of Woodbridge who was responsible for supervising the external sales agents and sales program of the Woodbridge Investments. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 61, 95). Roseman was purportedly \"responsible for ensuring that the sales force followed the Woodbridge [S]cript, knowing that representations relating to the Woodbridge [I]nvestments were false or misleading,\" and withholding such information from investors. (FAC \u00b6 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Kornfeld Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants Barry and Ferne Kornfeld, principals of First Financial Tax Group, were employed as external sales agents for Woodbridge. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 104-05). The Kornfeld Defendants are Florida residents. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 19-22). Mr. Kornfeld purportedly held himself out to be a \"financial advisor with an 'unsurpassed level of expertise' and promises 'trusting relationships with his clients' and 'the best possible results.' \" (FAC \u00b6 106). He \"claims a specialized focus on providing retirees and senior citizens with guaranteed income financial products to 'ensure lives of prosperity and security in retirement' based on his purported understanding of 'the complex psychology of aging and retirement planning.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Kornfeld allegedly promoted the Woodbridge Investments and held himself out as having a specialized knowledge of FPCMs, which he stated are safe and secure with a fixed high return. (FAC \u00b6 107). Ms. Kornfeld is allegedly a former registered securities broker \"who promotes herself as an experienced investment advisor specializing in providing investment advice and 'guaranteed' returns to retirees.\" (FAC \u00b6 109). Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Kornfeld taught a course on retirement planning and income optimization that she used to solicit investments in the Woodbridge Investments, and that the Honig Plaintiffs were specifically targeted, solicited, and induced into buying such securities after attending Ms. Kornfeld's course. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 110-111). In doing so, Plaintiffs allege that the Kornfeld Defendants used the Woodbridge Script to induce the Honig Plaintiffs, along with Plaintiffs David and Carolyn Lippman, and John Hertvik, all Florida residents, to purchase Woodbridge Investments. (FAC \u00b6 112). The Kornfeld Defendants purportedly sold Woodbridge Investments to at least 300 clients who invested over $50 million with Woodbridge. (FAC \u00b6 113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Klager Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants Albert and Michelle Klager are allegedly a married couple who conducted an investment advisory business through Defendant Atlantic Insurance and Financial Services, Inc. (FAC \u00b6 115). The Klager Defendants are Florida residents. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 26-28). The Klager Defendants purportedly held themselves out to be investment advisors, and utilized the Woodbridge Script to recommend and sell Woodbridge Investments to Plaintiff Gerald Roy, a Florida resident, and hundreds of additional investors in Florida and throughout the United States. (FAC \u00b6 116). The Klager Defendants allegedly raised approximately $20 million through the sale of Woodbridge Investments and were paid in excess of $1.2 million in commissions by Woodbridge. (FAC \u00b6 117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Knowles Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants Lynette Robbins and Theodore Leutz are allegedly a married couple who conducted an investment advisory business through Defendant Knowles Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (FAC \u00b6 118). The Knowles Defendants are citizens of Florida. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 23-25). The Knowles Defendants purportedly held themselves out to be investment advisors, and utilized the Woodbridge Script to recommend and sell Woodbridge Investments to Plaintiff Hermant Nanavaty, an Illinois resident, and hundreds of additional investors in Florida, Chicago, and throughout the United States. (FAC \u00b6 119). The Knowles Defendants allegedly raised approximately $100 million through the sale of Woodbridge Investments and were paid in excess of $8 million in commissions by Woodbridge. (FAC \u00b6 117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Other External Sales Agent Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs also make factual allegations against other External Sales Agents, including: HD Vest; Kovack Securities, Inc.; the Wieniewitz Defendants, comprised of Henry Wieniewitz, a Tennessee resident, and Wieniewitz Wealth Management, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company; Jerry Davis Raines, a Texas resident; the Hannah Defendants, comprised of Gordon C. Hannah, a Florida resident, and Retirement Planning Solutions, LLC, a Florida business; the OSFG Defendants, consisting of Old Security Financial Group, Inc., a Texas corporation, and Tony MacKenzie and Robert S. Davis, Jr., Texas residents; the Paramount Defendants, consisting of Douglas R. Andrew, a Utah resident, and Paramount Financial Services, Inc., a Utah corporation; the Shield Defendants, comprised of Shield Financial Group, Inc., a Texas corporation, and David Ouellette, a Texas resident; and James H. Gilchrist, a Florida resident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 31-57). Plaintiffs allege that, as with the Kornfeld, Klager, and Knowles Defendants, these other External Sales Agent Defendants \"similarly utilized the false and misleading Woodbridge sales script to recommend and sell Woodbridge Investments to thousands of additional investors in Florida and throughout the United States.\" (FAC \u00b6 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 26, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Class Action Complaint (\"FAC\") alleging seven causes of action against forty Defendants who, with one exception,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were all purportedly sales agents who sold promissory notes and other investments on behalf of non-parties Robert H. Shapiro (\"Shapiro\") and Woodbridge Group of Companies, LLC (\"Woodbridge\") in an alleged Ponzi scheme. (DE 6 (\"FAC\") ). The seven named Plaintiffs, on behalf of a putative class, assert claims for (1) negligence (Counts I-III), (2) negligent misrepresentation (Counts IV-VI), (3) breach of fiduciary duty (Counts VII-IX), (4) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty (Count X), (5) sale of unregistered securities, in violation of Chapter 517, Florida Statutes (Counts XI-XII), (6) civil conspiracy (Count XIII), and (7) vicarious liability against all corporate defendants (Count XIV).

Defendants argue that FPCMs are not securities under this test because they were based on short-term loans advanced for a commercial and consumer purpose - to make loans to third-party owners of commercial real estate and to purchase property to develop and sell for a profit - and therefore are not securities. (DE 41 at 10-11; DE 53 at 15-17). Although Defendants are correct that the profits were used for such a purpose, the expenditures are more geared towards use of the money for the seller's \"general use of a business enterprise or to finance substantial investments\" than any commercial or consumer purpose. The reality of the transaction, as alleged in the FAC, was that new investor funds derived from FPCM sales were used to almost wholly support Woodbridge's business operations and to pay commissions to the external sales agents. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 76-78, 83). Moreover, the FPCM buyer's primary motivation was likely the 5-8% annual return, paid on a monthly basis, and representations that the offerings were \"low-risk, high-yield investments backed by high interest rate loans made to commercial borrowers.\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6, 74). Thus, the first factor cuts in favor of the FPCMs being securities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5393\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/56/#p67\">\n    494 U.S. at 67-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5393\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/56/#p67\">\n    110 S.Ct. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding first factor weighed in favor of calling note a security when notes were \"sold to raise capital for its general business operations, and purchasers bought them in order to earn a profit in the form of interest\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The second factor also weighs in favor of classifying the FPCM as a security. Plaintiffs allege that the FPCMs were sold to \"over 8,400 ... investors nationwide\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 72), and that \"a network of several hundred external sales agents ... solicit[ed] investments from the public ... through television, radio, newspaper advertising, cold calling, social media, websites, seminars, and in-person presentations\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 80-81). The FPCMs were clearly \"offered and sold to a broad segment of the public,\" and therefore the second factor weighs in favor of declaring the FPCMs to be securities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

With regard to the third element of this claim, the only factual allegation asserted against the majority of the External Sales Agent Defendants was that they \"similarly utilized the false and misleading Woodbridge sales script to recommend and sell Woodbridge investments to thousands of additional investors in Florida and throughout the United States,\" which \"provided Woodbridge with a constant and significant source of investor funds necessary to keep the Ponzi scheme afloat.\" (FAC \u00b6 121). There are no other factual allegations in the FAC supporting the notion that the Non-Resident Sales Agent Defendants had actual knowledge of the Woodbridge scheme or Shapiro's breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, mere allegations that the External Sales Agent Defendants \"utilized the false and misleading Woodbridge sales script,\" and that the Defendants \"knew or should have known\" that the Woodbridge investments were fraudulent are insufficient to establish that the Defendants\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that Shapiro was breaching his fiduciary duties and provided substantial assistance to him to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 6, 111-12; 116; 119; 146; 150; 154). Although Plaintiffs identify several \"red flags\" that should have indicated to the Kornfeld, Klager, and Knowles Defendants that something was amiss with the Woodbridge securities, these red flags fail to establish actual knowledge on the part of the External Sales Agent Defendants. Moreover, Plaintiffs' attempt to lower this knowledge standard to \"recklessness\" is contrary to Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In fact, numerous factual allegations that Woodbridge and Shapiro intentionally concealed the scheme lend support to the proposition that the Defendants did not have actual knowledge of Shapiro's breach of fiduciary duty. For example, Plaintiffs allege that (1) Shapiro \"maintained exclusive operational control over Woodbridge\" and \"orchestrated and operated the fraud\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 73, 94), (2) Roseman, Woodbridge's Head of Sales who reported directly to Shapiro, \"directed internal and external sales agents to continue to raise funds from investors knowing that Woodbridge had no inventory of available real property and lacked revenue ... necessary to make interest payments to investors\" (FAC \u00b6 95), (3) Roseman was responsible for ensuring the sales force followed the Woodbridge Script, \"knowing that the representations relating to the Woodbridge investments were false or misleading\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 85, 96), (4) Shapiro used various tactics to conceal the fraudulent scheme, including using his RS Trust and concealing or mischaracterizing transactions from the Woodbridge operating account, including those to pay commissions to the External Sales Agents (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-102), and (5) \"Woodbridge's sales agents falsely mischaracterized the dispositions of regulatory actions to external sales agents claiming that the company was exonerated of wrongdoing or fraudulent activity\" (FAC \u00b6 132). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' allegations fail to establish that Defendants had any actual knowledge of Shapiro's\n   breach of fiduciary duty and fail to state a claim for aiding and abetting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, the dearth of factual allegations on Defendants' purported knowledge regarding the Woodbridge scheme and Shapiro's breach of fiduciary duty fail to give rise to the reasonable inference that the Defendants \"substantially assisted or encouraged the wrongdoing.\" A mere recitation of the elements is insufficient to state a claim, and Plaintiffs' allegations regarding Defendants' alleged substantial assistance or encouragement fail to rise above that level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs are permitted to re-plead to attempt to state a claim here by adding specific factual allegations that could plausibly give rise to the reasonable inference that Defendants had actual knowledge of Shapiro's breach of fiduciary duty, and that they substantially assisted or encouraged the wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Civil Conspiracy (Count XIII)\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs allege a civil conspiracy claim against all External Sales Agent Defendants in Count XIII.

Plaintiffs also allege that \"[t]he common purpose and design of the conspiracy was to generate substantial wealth and profits through the sale of Woodbridge Investments by engaging in uniform, widespread misrepresentations, omissions, and breaches of fiduciary duty,\" (FAC \u00b6 218) and that \"the Sales Agent Defendants each reached and entered into an express or tacit agreement with at least one or more of the co-conspirators, including specifically but not limited to Shapiro and Roseman, to pursue ... [a] course of concerted, unlawful conduct in exchange for substantial compensation\" (FAC \u00b6 219). With regard to the existence of agreement to do an unlawful act, Plaintiffs allege Defendants \"reached and entered into an express or tacit agreement with at least one or more of the other co-conspirators,\" \"agreed to join in and participate in the Woodbridge civil conspiracy,\" and \"knew or should have known that the solicitation, recommendation, and sale of the Woodbridge securities ... was improper and unlawful\" are conclusory.

Additionally, although more specific allegations are pled with regard to the Kornfeld, Klager, and Knowles Defendants, Plaintiffs allege that the other External Sales Agent Defendants in this action \"utilized the false and misleading Woodbridge sales script to recommend and sell Woodbridge investments to thousands of additional investors in Florida and throughout the United States ... provid[ing] Woodbridge with a constant and significant source of investor funds necessary to keep the Ponzi scheme afloat.\" (FAC \u00b6 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Construing all well-pled facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient to state a claim for civil conspiracy because they do not plead facts showing that Defendants agreed to do any unlawful purpose or act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As an initial matter, there must be some underlying tort or wrong to state a claim for conspiracy under Florida law. Individuals cannot agree to be negligent, and therefore Plaintiffs' negligence claims cannot serve as the basis for the civil conspiracy claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sonnenreich v.

Thus, the underlying legal wrongs that could form the basis for Plaintiffs' civil conspiracy claim include sale of unregistered securities and breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Applying these underlying wrongs to Plaintiffs' civil conspiracy claim, Plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts demonstrating that any of the Defendants agreed to breach their fiduciary duties, sell unregistered securities, or do any other unlawful act. There are no factual allegations from which this Court could plausibly infer that any defendant knew of the unlawful scheme, and Plaintiffs' allegations that the Defendants \"reached and entered into an express or tacit agreement with at least one or more of the other co-conspirators,\" \"agreed to join in and participate in the Woodbridge civil conspiracy,\" and \"knew\n   or should have known that the solicitation, recommendation, and sale of the Woodbridge securities ... was improper and unlawful\" are conclusory. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 219, 221-23). Plaintiffs correctly point out that they need not show that the External Sales Agent Defendants knowingly agreed to join and participate in Woodbridge's alleged Ponzi scheme, or that the proceeds from their sales of Woodbridge securities were used to operate the scheme. Even so, Plaintiffs' allegations fail to plausibly plead the existence of a separate civil conspiracy whereby the External Sales Agent Defendants knowingly entered into an agreement with Shapiro and other Woodbridge insiders to recommend and sell unregistered Woodbridge securities using the Woodbridge Script. These conclusory allegations of agreement do not establish a civil conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Indeed, the only \"example\" alleged by Plaintiffs in the civil conspiracy count that purportedly demonstrates the External Sales Agent Defendants' agreement to join in the scheme is an email between non-parties Shapiro and Roseman, two individuals alleged in the FAC to have concealed the nature of the scheme, discussing how the Knowles, Paramount, and Kornfeld Defendants were \"all slow at the moment.\" (FAC \u00b6 224). I fail to see how this email, which did not include any of the aforementioned Defendants, provides any support for the notion that the External Sales Agent Defendants agreed to engage in any unlawful conduct.

Plaintiffs' allegations that each natural person defendant \"was employed by, an officer of, or affiliated with\" each defendant's respective alleged corporate entity such that the natural person was \"acting within the course and scope of his actual or apparent agency ... at all times material to this action\" are conclusory. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 228-242). Plaintiffs fail to specify whether they are proceeding under a theory of actual or apparent agency as to each natural person defendant, and do not even attempt to plead facts to meet the legal tests for actual or apparent agency. Importantly, \"since actual and apparent agency are not independent causes of action, but instead theories of liability,\" Plaintiffs fail to specify which underlying torts allegedly committed by the agents serve as the basis for their vicarious liability claims.\n   <em>\n    Flaherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208227674\">\n    2015 WL 8227674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for vicarious liability. If Plaintiffs choose to amend, they must specify which underlying torts, committed by whom, serve as the basis for each vicarious liability claim against each corporate defendant. Additionally, if Plaintiffs attempt to re-plead this claim, it may make sense for Plaintiffs to separate the apparent and actual agency theories into two separate counts for vicarious liability to promote clarity for the parties and the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     GBH CPAS, PC\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Although Plaintiffs name GBH as a defendant in this action and make allegations against it in their FAC, Plaintiffs do not assert any claims against GBH, purportedly due to \"drafting/scrivener's error.\" (DE 102 at 44). Accordingly, GBH's Motion to Dismiss is granted, and Plaintiffs may assert any claims they have against GBH in an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   V.\n   <strong>\n    MOTION TO STAY DISCOVERY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Separately, Defendant HD Vest moves the Court to stay potentially burdensome discovery in this matter because of the Court's expressed concerns on whether it can exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over this case in light of certain CAFA exceptions. (DE 135). Although the Court still shares those concerns, it is apparent from the Parties' previous briefing on the issue that the Parties do not have sufficient information yet on certain issues, including the composition of the putative class, to determine whether a CAFA exception would apply. In any case, the Plaintiffs and two Defendants believe that no CAFA exception applies. In light of the fact that this Court facially has subject-matter jurisdiction over this suit, and only may be prevented from exercising it should the CAFA exception apply, I decline to stay discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.
