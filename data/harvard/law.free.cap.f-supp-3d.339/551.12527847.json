On August 11, 2017, Fidelity removed the action to this court [D.E. 1]. On December 1, 2017, Fidelity moved for judgment on the pleadings [D.E. 13]. On January 22, 2018, Carter responded in opposition [D.E. 15]. On February 5, 2018, Fidelity replied [D.E. 16]. As explained below, the court grants Fidelity's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fidelity issued two life insurance policies to William Kearney (the \"insured\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [D.E. 1-1] \u00b6 4; Answer [D.E. 9] \u00b6 4. Carter is the record beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 9-1] 9, 18. The policies cover accidental deaths and provide that \"[u]pon receipt of due proof of the Accidental Death of the Insured while coverage on such Insured is in force, Fidelity Life Association will pay the Death Benefit of this policy if the Insured dies solely as a result of injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 5.

The insured crashed the ATV vehicle and died from blunt head trauma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 9. Thereafter, Carter submitted claims under the life insurance policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 1-1] \u00b6 9. Fidelity denied the claims and invoked the \"blood alcohol exclusion\" to the policies because the insured's blood alcohol level was 0.21 when he crashed the ATV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; [D.E. 13] 3 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) permits a party to move for judgment on the pleadings \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial.\" Fed.

The parties dispute, however, whether an ATV is a \"motor vehicle\" under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The policy does not define \"motor vehicle.\" Thus, the court must apply the ordinary, non-technical meaning of \"motor vehicle.\" The term \"motor vehicle\" has an ordinary, non-technical meaning that encompasses the ATV. The dictionary defines \"motor vehicle\" as \"an automotive vehicle not operated on rails;\n   <em>\n    especially\n   </em>\n   : one with rubber tires for use on highways.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Motor Vehicle,\n   <em>\n    https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   (last visited Apr. 30, 2018);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vehicle\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"vehicle\" as \"[a]n instrument of transportation or conveyance\"). Similarly, North Carolina's Motor Vehicle Act defines \"motor vehicle\" as \"[e]very vehicle which is self-propelled and every vehicle designed to run upon the highways which is pulled by a self-propelled vehicle.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-4.01\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-4.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23). The Motor Vehicle Act further defines \"vehicle\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [e]very device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway, excepting devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon fixed rails or tracks; provided, that for the purposes of this Chapter bicycles and electric assisted bicycles shall be deemed vehicles and every rider of a bicycle or an electric assisted bicycle upon a highway shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-4.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-4.01(49). The definition contains two exceptions: (1) \"a device which is designed for and intended to be used as a means of transportation for a person with a mobility impairment,\" and (2) \"an electric personal assistive mobility device.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-4.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As evidenced by the exceptions, the Motor Vehicle Act's definition of \"vehicle\" includes ATVs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   An ATV falls within the ordinary, non-technical definition of \"motor vehicle\" because it is an automotive vehicle not operated on rails. Moreover, the Motor Vehicle Act specifically defines an ATV as \"[a] motorized vehicle....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-4.01\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-4.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(c). Although the Motor Vehicle Act's definition of ATV also states that ATVs are \"manufactured for off-road use,\" and the cited definitions contemplate use of the vehicle on public roadways or highways, such contemplation does not mean that ATVs are not \"motor vehicles\" when the term is given its ordinary, non-technical meaning. The insured's ATV was an automotive, four-wheeled vehicle that the insured could operate on a public road. Indeed, the insured was operating the\n   ATV on a public road when he crashed. Accordingly, the ordinary, non-technical definition of \"motor vehicle\" includes the ATV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Progressive Advanced Ins.
