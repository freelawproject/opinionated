And under the federal felon-in-possession statute, a prior felony conviction that has been expunged or set aside does not qualify as a prior felony conviction for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1) unless the expungement \"expressly provides\" that the individual cannot possess firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20). The certificate Aka received setting aside his conviction made no mention of firearms.

The Court concludes that because the source of Aka's set-aside-\u00a7 24-906 of the YRA-\"expressly provide[d]\" that he cannot possess firearms, his District of Columbia conviction may serve as a predicate offense for a charge under \u00a7 922(g)(1).

Cir. 1999). The predicate offense alleged in the indictment is Aka's conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2050-2201\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 50-2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .05b(b)(2) for fleeing law enforcement. The parties do not dispute that such a crime is one punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. But for purposes of the felon-in-possession statute, this prior conviction must qualify as a \"conviction\" as that term is defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Aka contends that his 2011 conviction cannot qualify as a predicate conviction because it has been set aside under the YRA. Section 921(a)(20), he notes, provides that a conviction that has been set aside is not a \"conviction\" for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1) unless it expressly provides that the individual may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms. And his certificate of discharge, he maintains, \"provides none of the required language directly, indirectly or by reference\" to trigger that exception. Def.'s MTD \u00b6 14. Moreover, Aka argues, none of the purposes enumerated in \u00a7 24-906(f) of the YRA for which set-aside convictions can still be used contemplate the conviction serving as a predicate under the\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   felon-in-possession laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MTD \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The government, however, insists that Aka's 2011 conviction constitutes a conviction for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1) because the YRA specifically provides that convictions that are set aside may nonetheless still be used as the predicate felony in a future firearm possession charge. Gov't's Opp'n at 4. Even though a conviction that has been set aside ordinarily cannot serve as a predicate conviction for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government argues that the limitations on Aka's right to possess a firearm imposed by the section of the YRA under which his conviction was set aside trigger the exception in \u00a7 921(a)(20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The question on which Aka's motion turns, then, is whether that exception applies here-in other words, whether Aka's set-aside \"expressly provides\" that he may not possess firearms.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20). And the antecedent analytical question is\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   the Court may look to determine whether this is so. If the Court may look to the statutory provision under which Aka's conviction was set aside, then the limitations imposed by \u00a7 24-906(f)(8) of the YRA would appear to trigger the exception in \u00a7 921(a)(20) -subject to additional arguments advanced by Aka, which are discussed below-and Aka's 2011 conviction would qualify as a predicate felony conviction. But if the firearm limitations must be expressly set forth in the actual certificate issued to the defendant, because the Certificate Aka received made no mention of any restrictions on his right to possess a firearm, his 2011 conviction cannot support a charge under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To determine whether an individual has in fact been \"convicted\" in a state of a crime punishable by more than one year's imprisonment, \u00a7 921(a)(20) directs courts to look to that state's laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The courts of appeal, however, have disagreed over how that instruction applies to the second sentence of \u00a7 921(a)(20) -that is, if courts, in determining whether limitations on possessing firearms were \"expressly provide[d]\" by a pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights, may look to the whole of a state's law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Circuit weighed in on this issue in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The issue presented in\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   was whether a defendant may be considered a convicted felon for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1)\"if the law in the state of conviction prohibits felons from ... possessing ... firearms even though the statute or the procedure that restores the felon's civil rights is silent on the subject.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693407,463\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1333/\">\n    87 F.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that \u00a7 921(a)(20), and specifically the language \"unless\n   <em>\n    such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights\n   </em>\n   expressly provides\" (emphasis added), requires courts to \"look no further than the source\" of said pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights, as opposed to the whole of the state's law.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693407,463\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1333/\">\n    87 F.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, because the defendant in that case had received a certificate restoring his civil rights that imposed no restrictions on his right to possess a firearm, the\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   court concluded that his prior conviction did not qualify under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, however, the statute that is the source of Aka's set-aside is not \"silent on the subject\" of the firearms limitation.\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693407,463\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1333/\">\n    87 F.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the government need not (and in any event could not under\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   ) argue that the Court look to all of District of Columbia\n   law to determine whether Aka was subject to limitations on his right to possess firearms. The government merely contends that the Court should look to the very statute under which Aka's conviction was set aside, which plainly subjects him to continuing firearm restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-906\">\n    D.C.

The threshold question for the Court, therefore, is not whether it may look to the whole of the District of Columbia's law, but rather whether, when examining the source of Aka's set-aside conviction, it may look to the specific statute through which Aka's conviction was set aside\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   the face of the Certificate he received to that effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court determines that it can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 921(a)(20) directs courts to look specifically to the \"pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights\" for any express firearm restrictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That language, the Circuit concluded in\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   , requires courts to \"look no further than the source\" of said expungement, pardon, or restoration of civil rights.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693407,463\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1333/\">\n    87 F.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that leads to the subsequent question: what, in particular circumstances, constitutes the \"source\"? The\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   court further instructed that courts should \"determine whether the defendant was nevertheless expressly deprived of the right to possess a firearm\n   <em>\n    by some provision of the restoration law or procedure\n   </em>\n   of the state of the underlying conviction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693407,463\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1333/\">\n    87 F.3d at 1336-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added and removed) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In the case of an individual's conviction being expunged or his civil rights restored automatically by operation of statute, then,\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   makes clear that courts must look to the language of that statute to determine whether it expressly provided any firearm restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1337.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   By that same reasoning, when an individual's conviction is set aside upon issuance of a certificate pursuant to a specific statute, the Court concludes that that authorizing statute is as much a part of the \"expungement\" as is the certificate itself. In such a case, both the statute and the certificate are properly considered part of \"the restoration law or procedure\" to\n   which the Circuit has directed courts to look.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1336-37 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10510265\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/206/#p213\">\n    991 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   213 ). Indeed, although the\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   court did not address this question directly, the analysis it undertook implicitly confirms this understanding. The court in that case proceeded to examine \"two such sources\" of the restoration of civil rights at issue-Section 2961.01 of Ohio's Revised Code, which restored Bost's right to vote, and Section 2967.16, which\n   <em>\n    authorized the certificate\n   </em>\n   Bost received restoring his rights to hold elected office and to serve on a jury.\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693407,463\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1333/\">\n    87 F.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, the court also looked to the text of the certificate itself, which-in addition to the two statutes-did not include a firearms restriction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693407,463\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1333/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the court's analysis\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   included an examination of the text of the statute that authorized the certificate, which in this case would include the firearm restrictions contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-906\">\n    D.C.

But if that were so, the court would not have recounted the contents of the statute authorizing that Bost's rights be restored by certificate when it purported to examine the \"source\" of that restoration; it would have only recited the text of the certificate. At the very least, the court in\n   <em>\n    Bost\n   </em>\n   appears to have assumed that when a certificate that restores a defendant's civil rights-or pardons the defendant or expunges or sets aside his or her conviction-makes no reference to restrictions on possessing a firearm, neither will the statute authorizing the certificate.

First, Aka argues that none of the purposes enumerated in \u00a7 24-906(f) of the YRA for which set-aside convictions can still be used contemplate the conviction serving as a predicate under the\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   felon-in-possession laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MTD \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 12. But the intentions of District of Columbia lawmakers are of no moment here. By enacting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20), Congress has tasked this Court with determining whether Aka's set-aside \"expressly provide[d]\" that he may not possess firearms, and it must do so by examining its source under District of Columbia law. Because the statute that authorized the set-aside does so, his conviction may nonetheless provide the predicate for a prosecution under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, Aka contends (and in light of his most recent filing, this appears to be the primary argument he has settled upon) that his 2011 conviction does not qualify as a prior felony conviction under the federal felon-in-possession statute because the YRA does not prohibit all of the conduct mentioned in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20) -namely, shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s MTD \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14-15; Def.'s Sup.
