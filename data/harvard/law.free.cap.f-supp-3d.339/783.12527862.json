Nancy is the plaintiff in case 17-CV-7144; Gretchen\n   and Samantha are the plaintiffs in case 17-CV-7148. Plaintiffs allege that defendant improperly designed an airplane that crashed in Illinois, injuring Samantha Murray and killing Steven and Mark Murray. Defendant removed both cases to this court and now moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. All plaintiffs oppose dismissal; plaintiffs Gretchen and Samantha Murray move in the alternative for transfer to Minnesota. For the following reasons, defendant's motion to dismiss is granted and plaintiffs' motion to transfer is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because defendant challenges personal jurisdiction and there has been no evidentiary hearing, disputed facts are resolved in plaintiffs' favor.\n   <em>\n    Northern Grain Marketing., LLC v.

The airplane crash\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Minnesota, defendant designed, manufactured, and assembled a four-seat, single-engine plane. Defendant sold this plane in 2001, in Minnesota, to an Illinois resident. Fourteen years later, the plane-now registered to several Texas co-owners-sat in Kewanee Municipal Airport, Illinois. It was a foggy, cloudy morning. The pilot was Steven Murray and the passengers were Mark and Samantha Murray. All were residents of Texas, but they were bound for Arkansas. Steven had told Mark and Samantha that although the autopilot had stopped working a few days before, the lack of autopilot would only make the flight a little harder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Three minutes after takeoff, the plane crashed 1\u00bd miles west of the airport into a soybean field.

First, they argue that defendant conducts many business activities in Illinois and reaps the benefits of Illinois law. Defendant, plaintiffs argue: advertises in Illinois; showcases products in Illinois; has facilities in Illinois; employs salespeople in Illinois; and derives many other benefits by targeting the market in Illinois. Even so, none of those activities relates to plaintiffs' claims of defective design.

The question, however, is not where plaintiffs were harmed, but where defendant's \"suit-related conduct\" took place.\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701990\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/277/#p284\">\n    571 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant's suit-related conduct took place not in Illinois, but in Minnesota. Even if defendant did commit a tort in Illinois, Illinois does \"not consider [its] long-arm statute separately from federal due process concerns\"-and if anything, \"due process protection under the Illinois long-arm statute may be greater than federal due process protections.\"\n   <em>\n    Russell v.
