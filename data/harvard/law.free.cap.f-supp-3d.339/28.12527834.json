After making the stop, the state troopers asked the driver and the passenger for identification. When the passenger was unable to provide an ID, the police officers asked him to step out of the car, and frisked him with his permission. Mr. Straw gave the police a false name and date of birth. The driver, whom the police also asked about the passenger's identity, gave the police a different name for him. When confronted with this conflicting information, Mr. Straw admitted that he lied about his name, and gave the officers yet another false name. The police then arrested Mr. Straw for obstructing an officer in the execution of duty under R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 11-32-1. They handcuffed him and transported him to the police barracks. At the station, the police searched Mr. Straw again, and found a gun in his sock. After running a fingerprint check, the police discovered that the passenger's real name was Marlon Straw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Straw filed a Motion to Suppress. ECF No. 21.

This Court declines to find that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that the performance resulted in actual prejudice to render Mr. Straw's assistance of counsel ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Failure to Investigate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Straw alleges that his attorney failed to make a proper investigation and that if he had not so failed there is a reasonable probability that the results would have been different. He points to three alleged failures on his counsel's\n   part-not getting a statement from his sister who was the driver of the car; not asking for evidence from ancillary devices like body or cruiser cams; and failing to heed the judge's direction during the second round of legal briefing. The Court must first determine if the attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and then decide, if so, whether the outcome would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Performance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court has no doubt that both attorneys who represented Mr. Straw consistently exercised reasonable professional judgment in their representation. The Court observed counsel's vigorous, professional, and effective representation of Mr. Straw from pressing the Motion to Suppress, through the change of plea, and to his sentencing advocacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Straw first claims that his attorney was deficient for \"failing to get a statement from one of the main witnesses to the traffic stop-the Petitioner's sister (the driver).\" ECF No. 59 at 13. The problem with Mr. Straw's assertion is that he fails to allege what his sister would have said that would have materially affected his case. There is nothing here that shows the failure to get a statement from his sister was substandard representation. In fact, it may have well been a smart legal strategy given the evidence that Mr. Straw's sister was also accused of lying to the police at the scene. Decisions about what witnesses to call or from whom to get statements are quintessentially matters of litigation strategy. The\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   court explained that judicial review of counsel's performance must be highly deferential as \"[i]t is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel's assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel's defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Straw has failed to show that his counsel's actions in this regard were unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Straw's second claim of improper investigation is that \"counsel did not examine any ancillary devices that could have established the exact time of the stop.\" ECF No. 59 at 13. The problem with this assertion as a basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is that Mr. Straw fails to offer any explanation about how this information would have helped him prevail on the merits of the suppression motion. The basis of the Court's denial of the Motion to Suppress was that Mr. Straw violated a state law against obstructing an officer by giving the officer false information about his name and date of birth. Based on his actions, the police took Mr. Straw to the state police barracks where they discovered the gun in his sock. The timing of the stop was not relevant to the outcome of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Straw (falsely) asserts that this Court \"scolded the defense counsel for not heeding his instructions and providing clarity in his brief. By failing to address the Court's concerns, the Petitioner's suppression motion was denied.\" ECF No. 59 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the end of the evidentiary portion of the hearing on the Motion to Suppress, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ...you're welcome to brief whatever you want, now that we have facts out, as it relates to anything else that has already been briefed. But the part that I continue to think has not been briefed to my satisfaction is the issue of whether the arrest of Mr. Straw for obstructing a police officer was consistent with the Fourth Amendment at that stage. I think the rest has now been laid out. I\n   think it's been well briefed. Again, if you want to supplement based on the facts; but that issue has not been briefed, and I would like that briefed, and then I'd like to have a hearing, a legal hearing on all of the issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ECF No. 28 at 141-142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the hearing involving legal argument, counsel for Mr. Straw correctly pointed out to the Court that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   there's just not a lot of Rhode Island law on the definition of obstruction. There's evidence, there's cases from the past that say that someone was arrested for obstruction, they say what the elements are, but they never actually define what obstruction entails. So I will get to that certainly. But again, I think that this motion to suppress should be granted based on those two independent legal grounds; first, the one we'll talk about having to do with the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   case and, secondly, to do with there being no probable cause or, even prior to that, reasonable suspicion that the obstruction law was violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ECF No. 39 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There is simply no basis for Mr. Straw's assertion that this Court \"scolded\" his counsel, or that his counsel did not heed the Court's directions. The Court had simply directed counsel's attention to the state charge that resulted in the police taking Mr. Straw into custody. Counsel adequately addressed the Court's concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    2. Prejudice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Even if the Court had found that counsel's representation was substandard [which it explicitly does not], Mr. Straw would still have to show \"a reasonable probability that, but for [his counsel's acts or omissions], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if counsel had done everything that Mr. Straw now alleges was deficient in his representation, the outcome would have been the same-denial of a Motion to Suppress followed by a change of plea made knowingly and voluntarily. The Court based its refusal to suppress the gun found on Mr. Straw at the police barracks on his lawful detention at the scene on a state charge of obstructing a police officer. Probable cause for this charge existed because Mr. Straw repeatedly lied and actively hid his identify form the officers, No matter raised by Mr. Straw would have changed this outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Failure to File an Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Straw alleges that he instructed his counsel after sentencing to file an appeal. But such unsupported assertion is contradicted by the sworn statement of his that Mr. Straw instructed him not to file an appeal. ECF No. 67-1 at 3. Moreover, this assertion is supported by a signed statement from Mr. Straw dated August 18, 2016, wherein he specifically \"authorizes [his counsel] not to file an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Counsel's conduct supported the proper functioning of the adversarial process such that the proceedings produced a just result. Mr. Straw received effective assistance of counsel and therefore the Court DENIES his Motion to Vacate or Set Aside His Conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
