The lawsuit arises from a recent officer election conducted by Local 101, Transport Workers Union of America AFL-CIO (\"Local 101\"). Baron Marquis, a member of the union in good standing at the time of the election, was disqualified as a candidate for president after he failed to timely file a letter of acceptance\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Local 101 confirming his nomination and intent to run. He protested his disqualification to several internal union administrative bodies before filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Following an investigation, the Secretary of Labor brought this suit, alleging that the union's decision to disqualify Marquis was an unreasonable application of a facially reasonable election rule. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to whether the union's disqualification of Marquis was the result of a \"reasonable qualification uniformly imposed,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20481\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), or whether it impermissibly restricted the candidacy pool and denied members \"democratic choice in selecting union officers,\" Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ.

The Secretary makes two primary arguments regarding the application of the letter of acceptance rule: (1) Marquis's disqualification was unreasonable because it \"served no important union purpose nor was it related to the qualifications to serve as union [p]resident,\" and (2) the decision to disqualify Marquis, rather than impose some other unspecified sanction or pursue alternative channels to ensure his compliance with the rule, was unreasonable because the committee was \"well aware of [his] strong desire to run.\" Pl.'s Mem. of Law 9, 10. Neither argument is convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, the Secretary makes too much of the fact that Local 101 does not disclose a specific purpose for either the acceptance form requirement or the decision to disqualify Marquis. Pl.'s Mem. of Law 10. As the Secretary admits, courts are not obligated to consider the purpose or interest advanced by a given qualification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20452.57\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.1. Instead, courts have found that the union's interest in setting a specific qualification is relevant where a valid and significant interest is \"the only way to justify a requirement that has a large antidemocratic effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Doyle v. Brock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1699840,4330908\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/821/778/\">\n    821 F.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 785 (D.C. Cir. 1987). As already discussed, there is nothing inherently antidemocratic about the rule at issue here; it does not fall disproportionately on challengers, and it is not particularly burdensome or complex. Furthermore, in focusing on the purpose behind the acceptance form and the decision to disqualify Marquis, the Secretary revives arguments that he has already conceded; the purpose of a qualification can be relevant to determining whether it is facially reasonable, but the Secretary already admits that the acceptance form requirement here is facially reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Mem. of Law 10 (\"Defendant derailed Complainant's candidacy over a procedural rule that served no purpose but to confirm his well-known intention to run.\"). To the extent that the\n   Secretary argues that the\n   <em>\n    sanction\n   </em>\n   of disqualification served no purpose, he provides no support for the contention that the purpose of a penalty is a relevant inquiry in the analysis of a reasonable qualification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Likewise, the Secretary cites no authority to support the argument that a sanction may be unreasonable as applied to a particular person when the rule that led to the sanction was itself reasonable. Instead, the cases upon which the Secretary relies recognize a claim based on the unreasonable application of a rule where a rule's procedural implementation and application to an entire\n   <em>\n    election\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to a specific person or candidate, was unreasonable. In\n   <em>\n    Herman v. New York Metro Area Postal Union\n   </em>\n   , the court struck down the application of a rule that required candidates to provide their social security numbers and addresses by a specific deadline. The court found that the \"challenge [was] not to the deadline itself, but to the application of the deadline, which amounts to a claim that Metro impermissibly applied a requirement that otherwise could be facially valid.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387791\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/30/636/#p642\">\n    30 F.Supp.2d at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The problem was not that the union required candidates to disclose certain personal information by a deadline, but rather that the deadline was \"not adequately disclosed\" to prospective candidates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387791\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/30/636/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because prospective candidates did not have sufficient notice of the deadline, it was unreasonable to disqualify those who failed to comply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"387791\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/30/636/#p642\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Reich v. Local 1, American Postal Workers' Union\n   </em>\n   -another case upon which the Secretary relies-the court found that a meeting attendance rule that \"precluded over ninety percent of union members from seeking office\" was unreasonable in its application because it was \"enacted less than a month before the election.\" No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Cow.%205167\">\n    93 C 5167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20WL%20110610\">\n    1994 WL 110610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 31, 1994). Those who did not meet the attendance criteria had no way to cure the defect because the rule's announcement came too late.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20WL%20110610\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In both of these cases, the union's violation rendered a rule unreasonable as applied to an entire election; the rule's unreasonableness did not depend on the circumstances of an individual candidate's communication with the union. Because the unions failed to provide advanced notice of the rules to all members,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the rules could not have been reasonable as applied to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   candidate for office during that election year. In essence, the particular qualifications challenged in\n   <em>\n    Local 1, American Postal Workers' Union\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    New York Metro Area Postal Union\n   </em>\n   were unreasonable immediately upon their announcement; the determination of their validity under the statute was not contingent on the particular candidate who would later fail to comply with the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In contrast, the Secretary argues that the union's decision to disqualify Marquis was unreasonable because of something unique to Marquis himself. He argues that it was unreasonable for Local 101 to disqualify Marquis not because Marquis and other candidates were unable to comply with the acceptance letter rule, but rather because the union \"was well aware of [Marquis's] strong desire to run.\" Pl.'s\n   Mem. of Law 10. The Secretary notes that Marquis had \"repeatedly demonstrated his clear intent to run ... throughout the election by personally picking up the petition, by personally collecting the requisite number of signatures, by personally returning the completed petitions, and ultimately (albeit belatedly) by returning the\n   <em>\n    pro forma\n   </em>\n   letter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8, 9. Yet the rule urged by the Secretary-that an otherwise reasonable qualification can be unreasonable as applied to a particular\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   based on the facts and circumstances of that person's interaction with the union-is simply not recognized in the case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Furthermore, and perhaps even more importantly, the rule urged by the Secretary would run directly afoul of the union's obligation to ensure that qualifications are not just reasonable, but also \"uniformly imposed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20481\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). As Local 101 notes, the Secretary argues that \"because the [e]lection [c]ommittee 'knew' that Mr. Marquis had a 'clear intention' to run, it should have waived an express provision of the [e]lection [r]ules.\" Def.'s Mem. of Law 11. However, the LMRDA forbids this exact type of discretionary behavior; where the application of a rule depends on the whims or instincts of a given election official, it is per se unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Local 872, Laborers Int'l Union of North America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203709055\">\n    2017 WL 3709055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (striking down the use of a literacy test as an election qualification where the election official administered the literacy test to only one candidate for office, \"claiming that he was aware the other candidates were literate from knowing them personally\").

But this is a recipe for the non-uniform imposition of a qualification. \"The Department of Labor's [r]egulations expressly distinguish between reasonable qualifications capable of uniform application and qualifications which permit subjective determinations of eligibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

In contrast, a rule that would authorize deviation from a qualification based on the subjective beliefs or awareness of union officials would violate the \"uniform\" requirement of the statute.

Ultimately, while these allegations are troubling, I agree with Local 101 that they are \"irrelevant\" to the question presented here. Def.'s Reply 4. While an allegation that the union inconsistently applied the acceptance form requirement itself would be relevant to this case, the Secretary focuses primarily on violations of entirely different rules that had no bearing on the outcome of this election, and that played no role in disqualifying Marquis as a candidate for office.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hugler v.

Pl.'s Mem. of Law 12-13. The Secretary argues that these rule inconsistencies all favored incumbents, to the disadvantage of challengers. Pl.'s Reply 6. However, it is notable that in at least one instance, Local 101 bent the rules to benefit Marquis-suggesting that these inconsistencies were not entirely one-sided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. of Facts \u00b6 22 (\"The Committee did not discount signatures [Marquis had] gathered before February 6, 2017.).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   More fundamentally, the Secretary cannot state a claim that Local 101 violated the LMRDA simply by failing to comply with its own rules. While \"[a]n allegation that a union violated its constitution and bylaws would state a claim under \u00a7 411(a)(1) 'when the variance or irregularity results in discriminatory deprivation of an individual's right to cast a meaningful vote,' \" the statute does not \"grant federal courts 'jurisdiction to enforce union constitutions and bylaws.' \"\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201867701\">\n    2001 WL 1867701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nienaber\n   </em>\n   , 652 F.2d at 1286 ).

The Secretary argues that \"[t]his inconsistent application of the rules ... favored the incumbent candidates.\" Pl.'s Mem. of Law 13. I agree that it is possible that hand-delivery of the acceptance letters may have made it easier-or more likely-for the incumbent candidates to comply with the return deadline. Still, the Secretary does not argue that Marquis was\n   <em>\n    less able\n   </em>\n   to comply with the return deadline as a result of the slight advantage his opponent received. Marquis received his letter in the mail on February 17, and did not have to return it until February 22-a full five days later. There are no allegations in the record that Marquis was out of town or otherwise unable to comply with this reasonable qualification during the time allotted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, to the extent that the Secretary implicitly argues that the manner in which the letter of acceptance is delivered to a candidate is itself part of the \"qualification\" imposed by the rule, the Secretary has not demonstrated that the manner of delivery had any potential effect on the outcome of the election.
