(\"Defendant\") mishandled a commercial printing machine belonging to Plaintiff while it was stored at Defendant's warehouse in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, resulting in damage to the printer. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-14.) Plaintiff asserts a variety of state-law claims against Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-42.) Defendant moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. (R. 30, Mot.; R. 31, Mem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is granted in part and denied in part as stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise stated. Plaintiff is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Valhalla, New York. (R. 46, Pl.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 2.) Defendant is an Illinois corporation providing warehouse services for hire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) Third-party defendant Cargo Maritime, Inc. (\"Cargo Maritime\") is a freight forwarder that arranges\n   transportation, storage, and other logistics services on behalf of its customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 49, Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 4.) As a freight forwarder, Cargo Maritime does not itself transport, store, or otherwise physically handle its customers' cargo; instead, it procures those services from motor carriers, warehousemen, and other logistics service providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2016, on behalf of Plaintiff, Cargo Maritime arranged to have one of Plaintiff's \"Graphium\" commercial printing machines transported from a trade show in Rosemont, Illinois, and placed in storage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13; R. 46, Pl.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 6.) On September 13, 2016, Cargo Maritime contacted Defendant and requested a quote to have the printer picked up, transported, and stored in Defendant's warehouse in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. (R. 49, Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 14.) The next day, September 14, 2016, Defendant responded to Cargo Maritime's quote request with a quote that included a storage fee of $1,612.40 per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) On either September 16 or 17, the printer, which weighs 27,398 pounds, was picked up from the trade show and delivered to Defendant's warehouse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16; R. 46, Pl.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant has provided warehousing services to Cargo Maritime's customers since 2012. (R. 49, Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 5.) In prior dealings with Defendant, Cargo Maritime provided a \"Due Diligence Checklist\" to Defendant which stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   It is a strict requirement and policy of Cargo Maritime, Inc. for warehouse companies when handling our cargo, to adhere to the Cargo Maritime Warehouse Due Diligence check list.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Safety comes first to Cargo Maritime * * *Please have your personnel HANDLE CARGO WITH GREAT CARE* * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Keep our cargo away from traffic and hazardous cargo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. At all times cargo must be kept in a covered facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Cargo can not be re-handled or moved around inside covered facility, unless Cargo Maritime Inc. is notified beforehand and a cargo surveyor is in attendance when doing so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   5. If any forecast of extreme environmental conditions that may potentially cause harm to our cargo; Cargo Maritime, Inc. needs to be forewarned so we can take precautionary measures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Kimberly Padovano (\"Padovano\"), Defendant's Customer Administrator who was responsible for the handling the Cargo Maritime account, understood that Defendant was required to abide by the Due Diligence Checklist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) Padovano also understood that Cargo Maritime\n   expected Defendant to adhere to the requirements in the Due Diligence Checklist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Paul Michalak (\"Michalak\"), Defendant's Vice President of Operations, also received the Due Diligence Checklist and does not recall ever telling Cargo Maritime that Defendant could not, or would not, adhere to its requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 22, 2016, Defendant issued two warehouse receipts to Cargo Maritime for the printer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; R. 46, Pl.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 7.) The front side of each warehouse receipt included the following message:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This is TO CERTIFY THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED the property listed hereon in apparent good order, except as noted herein ... SUBJECT TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY HEREIN AND ON THE REVERSE HEREOF.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (R. 46, Pl.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 8 (capitalization in original); R. 46-1, Askgaard Decl., Ex. I.) The reverse side of each warehouse receipt set forth Defendant's \"Standard Contract Terms and Conditions for Merchandise Warehousemen\" (the \"Standard Terms and Conditions\"), (R. 46, Pl.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 9.) Section 1(a) of the Standard Terms and Conditions states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   This contract and rate quotation ... must be accepted within 30 days from the proposal date by signature of depositor on the reverse side of the contract. In the absence of written acceptance, the act of tendering goods described herein for storage or other services by warehouseman within 30 days from the proposal date shall constitute such acceptance by depositor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (R. 46-1, Askgaard Decl., Ex. I; R. 50, Def.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 16.) Section 11 of the Standard Terms and Conditions addresses Defendant's liability for loss or damage to warehoused goods:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) THE WAREHOUSEMAN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR INJURY TO GOODS STORED HOWEVER CAUSED UNLESS SUCH LOSS OR INJURY RESULTED FROM THE FAILURE BY THE WAREHOUSEMAN TO EXERCISE SUCH CARE IN REGARD TO THEM AS A REASONABLY CAREFUL MAN WOULD EXERCISE UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WAREHOUSEMAN IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY THE EXERCISE OF SUCH CARE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (b) GOODS ARE NOT INSURED BY THE WAREHOUSEMAN AGAINST LOSS OR INJURY HOWEVER CAUSED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (c) THE DEPOSITOR DECLARES THAT DAMAGES ARE LIMITED TO 500 TIMES THE BASE RATE OR $0.05 PER POUND, WHICHEVER IS LESS, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH LIABILITY MAY AT THE TIME OF ACCEPTANCE OF THIS CONTRACT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 1 BE INCREASED UPON DEPOSITOR'S WRITTEN REQUEST ON PART OR ALL OF THE GOODS HEREUNDER IN WHICH EVENT AN ADDITIONAL MONTHLY CHARGE WILL BE MADE BASED UPON SUCH INCREASED VALUATION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (R. 46, Pl.'s Resp. to Facts \u00b6 10 (capitalization in original); R. 46-1, Askgaard Decl., Ex. I.) The warehouse receipts include a signature block for \"Depositor's Acceptance\" at the bottom of each page. (R. 49, Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 22.) In addition, in the cover letter accompanying the warehouse receipts, Defendant stated \"Please find the enclosed warehouse receipt covering the goods stored in our warehouse for your account. After review\n   of the receipt and if everything is order [sic], please have the receipt signed by a duly authorized person. One copy is to be retained for your files and the other returned to this office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) However, Cargo Maritime never signed the warehouse receipts issued for the printer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In early January 2017, Defendant moved the printer from inside the warehouse building to a 48-foot long van trailer that was parked at one of the building's outdoor loading docks. (R. 49, Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 27; R. 46-2, Michalak Dep. Tr. 71:6-74:4.) Defendant moved the printer because it \"had a lot of freight moving in and out\" of the warehouse, storage space inside the warehouse building was \"tight,\" and the trailer provided \"extra storage space.\" (R. 49, Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 28.) The trailer did not have any temperature controls and was left with its doors open the entire time it sat at the loading dock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) Defendant did not notify Plaintiff or Cargo Maritime that it would be moving the printer from inside the warehouse to an outdoor trailer or inquire whether storage in an outdoor trailer might damage the printer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) According to Michalak, the printer was \"only going to be in [the trailer] for a short time to rearrange and move freight in the warehouse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   By chance, Plaintiff discovered that its printer was not being stored inside the warehouse when two of its employees visited the warehouse on January 10, 2017, to view the printer and found that it was being stored in the trailer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The next day, January 11, Cargo Maritime contacted Defendant questioning why the printer was being stored in a trailer rather than inside the warehouse and asking whether the printer was still being stored outside in the trailer at that point. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Michalak responded to Cargo Maritime the same day, stating that the printer was \"moved into van trailers for short time [sic] as I re-arrange some freight in warehouse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Michalak further stated in his email \"I will send pictures of freight inside warehouse shortly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cargo Maritime responded to Michalak's email, stating \"Under no circumstances these Fujifilm machine are to be placed outside regardless if short term - due to the nature of the commodity, that's a given,\" and \"We entrusted DC to keep these machine indoors, that is what we are paying for all these months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35; R. 46-1, Askgaard Decl., Ex. K.) Later that day, Michalak responded with an email stating that the printer was now inside the warehouse and attaching a photograph showing the printer inside the warehouse. (R. 49, Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Add'l Facts \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The same day, January 11, 2017, Cargo Maritime sent a preliminary notice of claim to Defendant for damage to the printer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff claims that, as a result of being stored in the outdoor trailer, the printer was damaged by freezing and other outdoor weather conditions, resulting in a total loss of the printer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On September 15, 2017, Plaintiff filed its complaint with this Court, asserting six claims against Defendant under Illinois law\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on the damage to its printer: breach of contract (Count I); bailment (Count II); negligence (Count III); conversion\n   (Count IV); gross negligence (Count V); and \"Illinois liability\" under 810 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/7-204(a) (Count VI).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-42.) Defendant answered and filed affirmative defenses on November 16, 2017. (R. 17, Answer; R. 18, Aff. Defenses.) At the same time, Defendant filed a third-party complaint against Cargo Maritime. (R. 20, Third-party Compl.) On February 13, 2018, Cargo Maritime filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims to Defendant's third-party complaint. (R. 36, Cargo Maritime Answer.) On January 3, 2018, the Court ordered that discovery be completed by March 30, 2018. (R. 24, Min. Entry.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On February 2, 2018, Defendant filed its present motion for summary judgment. (R. 30, Mot.) Defendant makes a number of overlapping arguments as to each claim. Foremost among its arguments, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's total damages are expressly limited by the limitation of liability stated on the warehouse receipts, and that this limit applies to all of Plaintiff's claims. (R. 31, Mem. at 4-7; R. 52, Reply at 7-9 &amp; n.5.) Based on the weight of the printer, Defendant contends that its total liability in this case, if any, is limited to $1,369.90. (R. 31, Mem. at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim (Count I), Defendant contends that Plaintiff is bound by the limitation on liability found in the warehouse receipts because it is a third-party beneficiary of the warehousing contract between Defendant and Cargo Maritime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Alternatively, if Plaintiff is not a third-party beneficiary, Defendant contends that it is entitled to judgment on this claim because no contractual relationship existed between Plaintiff and Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 n.5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant advances a similar argument as to Plaintiff's bailment claim (Count II) to the extent it sounds in contract: either Defendant's liability for bailment is expressly limited by the warehouse receipts, or Defendant is entitled to judgment because Plaintiff is not in privity with Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) Alternatively, if Plaintiff's bailment claim sounds in tort, Defendant contends that it is entitled to judgment because Plaintiff does not meet the definition of a bailor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant argues that it is entitled to judgment on Plaintiff's conversion claim (Count IV) because Plaintiff did not have an absolute and unconditional right to immediate possession of the printer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) Defendant further argues that it did not wrongfully assume control, dominion, or ownership over the printer because whatever damage the printer sustained was merely inadvertent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant contends that it is entitled to judgment on Plaintiff's tort claims for negligence (Count III) and gross negligence (Count V) for two reasons: (1) as a matter of law, it exercised reasonable care with respect to the printer, and therefore did not violate the standard of care set forth in the warehouse receipts; and (2) these claims are barred by the economic loss doctrine, which bars tort claims over the subject of a contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Last, Defendant argues that it is likewise entitled to judgment on Plaintiff's statutory claim under Section 7-204(a) (Count VI) because it was not negligent as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff filed its response on May 10, 2018. (R. 47, Pl.'s Resp.) Plaintiff argues that the limitation of liability stated in the\n   warehouse receipts is not effective because Cargo Maritime never accepted the Standard Terms and Conditions by signing the receipts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 7-8.) Plaintiff argues further that even if it had accepted the Standard Terms and Conditions, Defendant would be precluded from relying on the limited-liability provision because it breached the terms of its own warehouse receipt by storing the printer in an outdoor trailer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 8-11.) Plaintiff also contends that, in any event, the limitation on liability does not apply to its conversion claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to its breach of contract and negligence claims, Plaintiff contends that a question of fact exists as to whether Defendant breached the parties' storage agreement and acted negligently by moving the printer to on outdoor trailer without Cargo Maritime's knowledge or consent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) As to its conversion claim, Plaintiff argues that Defendant is guilty of conversion because it \"exceeded its authority to possess and control the printer by moving it to an outdoor trailer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Plaintiff further argues that this constituted conversion to Defendant's \"own use\" because it \"moved the printer to the trailer in order to gain access to and make room for the storage of other customers' cargo inside the warehouse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Last, Plaintiff argues that the economic loss doctrine does not preclude its tort claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Rule 56 provides that \"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 7-8.) Plaintiff also argues that Defendant is precluded from relying on the limited-liability provision because it \"materially breached\" the terms of its own warehouse receipt by storing the printer in an outdoor trailer.

Section 7-204(b) further provides that a depositor may, \"at the time\n   of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt\" request that the warehouse's liability be increased, in which case the warehouse may charge \"increased rates ... based on an increased valuation of the goods.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"604961\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/545/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.
