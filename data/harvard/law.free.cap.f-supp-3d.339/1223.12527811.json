Plaintiff De'Leah Jenkins alleges Defendant CARCO Group, Inc. routinely violates \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) of FCRA by reporting consumers' college attendance dates and degree-conferral status that predate the report by more than seven years, including her own. Plaintiff asserts an individual FCRA claim and seeks certification of a putative class action under FCRA. She also asserts an individual negligence per se claim. Defendant seeks dismissal for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing reporting of consumer educational history does not violate \u00a7 1681c(a)(5). Because accurately reported college enrollment dates and degree-conferral status are not \"adverse information\" subject to \u00a7 1681c(a)(5)'s temporal reporting restrictions, the Court grants Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiff's individual FCRA claim, the putative class action, and Plaintiff's negligence per se claim hinge on the Court's determination of whether a consumer's accurately reported college attendance dates and degree-conferral status are \"adverse information\" under section \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) and, thus, are subject to temporal reporting restrictions. Although the Court accepts the veracity of Plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations-as it must in considering a motion to dismiss-those allegations do not plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. The Court holds, as a matter of law, that college attendance dates and degree-conferral status are not \"adverse information\" under the plain language of \u00a7 1681c(a)(5).

Plaintiff relies heavily\n   on Defendant categorizing as \"adverse\" the discrepancy between Plaintiff's self-reporting that she earned a degree and KCKCC reporting Plaintiff did not earn a degree. Because Defendant labeled the discrepancy \"adverse,\" Plaintiff concludes a violation of \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) must have occurred. Defendant's use of the label \"adverse\" does not automatically equate to a statutory violation.

Plaintiff does not dispute the accuracy of this information. The information, by its nature, is neutral and neither positive nor negative. When accurately reported, college attendance dates and degree-conferral status are not unfavorable, harmful, or contrary to the interests of a consumer relying on a CRA to produce an accurate credit report and protect her privacy. Plaintiff relies heavily on Defendant's use of the precise term \"adverse\" in reporting the discrepancy between Plaintiff's self-reported information and the information provided by KCKCC. This approach misplaces the key focus of the inquiry. The question is not whether the information Defendant reported was contrary to what Plaintiff self-reported, but whether the underlying information is inherently contrary or harmful to Plaintiff. Likewise, Defendant's own\n   characterization of the discrepancy did not transform the nature of the underlying information-Plaintiff's college attendance dates and degree-conferral status-from non-adverse to adverse for purposes of \u00a7 1681c(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The specific context of \"adverse information\" within \u00a7 1681c also supports the conclusion that its meaning under \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) is plain and unambiguous and does not include college attendance dates and degree-conferral status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p340\">\n    519 U.S. at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p340\">\n    117 S.Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that plain language analysis requires consideration of \"specific context in which that language is used\"). As noted above, in addition to \"[a]ny other adverse item of information,\" \u00a7 1681c identifies five categories of information subject to temporal reporting limitations in separately enumerated subsections: (1) bankruptcy proceedings; (2) civil suits, judgements, and arrests; (3) paid tax liens; (4) accounts sent for collection or charged to profits and loss; and (5) contact information of medical providers. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(1)-(4), (6). The final category, contact information of medical providers, addresses consumer privacy concerns. The first four categories, however, expressly prohibit CRAs from reporting information (within certain temporal limitations) that is, by its nature, harmful or unfavorable to a consumer's interests. Bankruptcy filings, tax liens, civil judgements, and unpaid collection accounts included on a consumer's credit report are inherently \"adverse.\" These items are fundamentally different from accurately reported college attendance dates and degree-conferral status, which reflect neither positively nor negatively on a consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The statute's overall context supports the same conclusion.

Many employers rely on CRAs for this service as part of their employee interview screening and background check process. If CRAs accurately report the information, this valuable service can be provided while maintaining the consumer's interests in fair and accurate reporting. Prohibiting the reporting of college attendance dates and degree-conferral status when the information predates the report by more than seven years-as Plaintiff suggests-would permit employers to verify this information only for those applicants who attended college or received a degree within the last seven years. It would also allow, and perhaps encourage, applicants whose information predated the report by seven years to falsify their information with impunity. Given the FCRA's recognition of the need to balance CRAs vital role in evaluating consumer information with consumers' expectation in accurate reporting, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's proposed interpretation-one that would both prevent CRAs from providing a valuable service and protect applicants who falsify information-yields an \"absurd result.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Federal Trade Commission Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court's interpretation of \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) is also consistent with the only apparent legal authority on the issue-three informal staff opinion letters from the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and an FTC summary report. The first FTC staff opinion letter, dated April 17, 1998, addresses whether \u00a7 1681c's temporal limits on reporting adverse information apply to verification of graduation and past employment information. FTC, Staff Opinion Letter to Lee Seham,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323743\">\n    1998 WL 34323743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Apr. 17, 1998). Referring to the dictionary definition of \"adverse,\" the FTC reasoned that only information that \"cast[s] the consumer in a negative or unfavorable light\" is within \u00a7 1681c's scope.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323743\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because college attendance and dates of employment \"do[ ] not reflect adversely upon the consumer,\" the FTC concluded that information \"is not 'adverse' information as the term is used for [ \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) ] purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323743\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FTC restated its conclusion in a second staff opinion letter a few months later in June 2018, stating that \"[t]he date that a consumer graduated from college is not an 'adverse item of information' covered by [ \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) ].\" FTC, Staff Opinion Letter to Michael Rosen,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323763\">\n    1998 WL 34323763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (June 9, 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Most persuasive is a December 1998 FTC staff opinion letter.

In this third letter, the FTC addresses whether its previous conclusion in its April 17, 1998 staff opinion letter would change if a consumer falsified her educational or employment background, rendering the information reported by the CRA \"in fact, 'adverse' to the interest of the consumer in the sense that it contradicts information provided by the applicant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323718\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FTC did not waiver in its position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   We would not change our analysis. We believe that whether information is \"adverse\" for FCRA purposes depends upon the nature of the information and not the use of the information. For example, tax liens, payment delinquencies, evictions, and similar information are clearly items of negative information that reflect adversely upon the consumer. However, dates of employment and educational data (such as dates of graduation and degrees) are neither \"positive\" nor \"negative.\" The information is neutral.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   We believe that facially neutral information should not be considered \"adverse\" information because a consumer may have misrepresented the information. To take the contrary position would prohibit a CRA from performing a valuable function for its clients-verifying employment or education data beyond seven years-without furthering any of the goals of [ \u00a7 1681c ] of the FCRA. Accordingly, we believe that a CRA may verify education information and employment dates even where the information it provides to its customers may contradict what a consumer has listed on his or her application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%2034323718\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FTC's position has not varied in recent years.

They explicitly address the precise question before the Court, set out sound reasoning for their conclusions, and are consistent. The FTC also administers the FCRA, and possesses some degree of expertise in these matters. Most importantly, the FTC's interpretation of \"adverse information\" is consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) and this Court's interpretation. Though they have limited precedential value, the FTC staff opinion letters support the Court's conclusion that college attendance dates and degree-conferral status are not \"adverse information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all of these reasons, the Court holds that the term \"adverse information\" as used within \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) is plain and unambiguous with regard to the particular dispute in this case and that accurately reported college attendance dates and degree-conferral status do not constitute \"adverse information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Absence of a Claim Under \u00a7 1681c(a)(5)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff's FCRA claim is premised on Defendant's alleged willful or knowing violation of only one provision of FCRA- \u00a7 1681c(a)(5). Having concluded that accurately reported college attendance dates and degree-conferral status do not constitute \"adverse information\" under \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) as a matter of law, Plaintiff's FCRA claim must be dismissed. Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant accurately reported her college attendance dates and degree-conferral status, thus no violation of \u00a7 1681c(a)(5) occurred, either willfully or knowingly, and Plaintiff cannot state a claim upon which relief can be granted under \u00a7 1681c(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Negligence Per Se and Putative Class Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Secondary to her FCRA claim, Plaintiff alleges common law negligence per se.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1681h(e) of FCRA preempts such claims unless \"false information [was] furnished with malice or willful intent to injure [a] consumer.\" Plaintiff concedes the information Defendant reported was accurate. Absent a claim Defendant reported \"false information,\" Plaintiff cannot avoid preemption. Regardless, Plaintiff cannot state a claim for negligence per se.
