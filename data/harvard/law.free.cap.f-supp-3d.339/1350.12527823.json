Defendant, Tropical Paradise Resorts, LLC, filed an Opposition [ECF No. 17], to which Plaintiff filed a Reply [ECF No. 19]. The Court has carefully considered the Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 1-1] 3-11\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), the parties' written submissions, the record, and applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff develops and sells software and mobile applications relating to the conversion of rewards points between separate business entities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 2). In September 2017, Plaintiff received exclusive rights to use in its software 31 patents owned by a company known as JBSHBM, LLC, and issued by the United States Patent Office. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). The patents pertain to the conversion of points across separate businesses or \"channels.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5). JBSHBM is not a named party in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant gives customers reward points to incentivize them to stay at its hotel. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). These points can be used \"across program boundaries with other programs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant also receives from its customers points that were converted across program boundaries from other reward programs. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Plaintiff asserts Defendant has accepted, received, and encouraged the use of customer points across program boundaries by using software other than Plaintiff's. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-12). In so doing, Defendant has encouraged its customers to use \"unauthorized software to convert points across program boundaries in violation of Plaintiff's exclusive rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff asserts claims against Defendant for unjust enrichment (Count I) (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-20); temporary and permanent injunctive relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count II) (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-27); conversion (Count III) (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-31); and civil theft (Count IV) (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-39), all stemming from Defendant's purportedly unauthorized use of Plaintiff's software in violation of Plaintiff's exclusive right to use JBSHBM's 31 patents (\n   <em>\n    see generally id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ). On April 12, 2018, Defendant removed the action, asserting federal jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. section 271 and 28 U.S.C. sections 1331 and 1338. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal [ECF No. 1] \u00b6 7). Defendant asserts the Court has subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff's claims \"arise under an Act of Congress relating to patents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted) ). Plaintiff now brings the Motion, contending the action properly belongs in state court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 14). Plaintiff also seeks attorneys' fees and costs from Defendant, asserting Defendant's removal was objectively unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under 28 U.S.C. section 1447(c), a federal court must remand an action that has been removed from state court if it appears the removal was improper. \"[I]n removal cases, the burden is on the party who sought removal to demonstrate that federal jurisdiction exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirkland v.

The Court thus focuses on jurisdictional facts as they existed when Defendant filed its Notice of Removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531716\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/1092/#p1095\">\n    31 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1097 n.13 (\"Jurisdictional facts are assessed on the basis of plaintiff's complaint as of the time of removal.\" (emphasis and citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its Notice of Removal, Defendant states Plaintiff's Complaint shows subject matter jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. section 1338, which grants federal district courts jurisdiction over civil actions \"aris[ing] under an Act of Congress relating to patents.\" (Notice of Removal \u00b6 9 (alteration added) ). Section 1338\"must be interpreted in tandem with the statute that grants federal question jurisdiction [ 28 U.S.C. section 1331 ] because both statutes use the term 'arising under.' \"\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada), Inc. v.

Plaintiff disagrees, insisting: (1) its state-law claims do not arise under federal patent law merely because patent issues are necessary to their resolution; and (2) the state-law claims are not completely preempted by federal patent law so as to warrant removal. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To establish subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1338, a defendant must establish either (1) \"federal patent law creates the cause of action;\" or (2) \"plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law, in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the well-pleaded claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Christianson v.

Whether Federal Patent Law Creates Plaintiff's State-Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its briefing, Defendant appears to rely exclusively on\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   's second prong as its basis for removal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Opp'n). \"Because a determination of patent infringement is a necessary element of all causes of action in the State Court Action, they arise under the patent laws and this Court has jurisdiction....\" (Notice of Removal \u00b6 15 (alteration added) ). Nevertheless, the Court addresses\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   's first prong since Defendant cites 35 U.S.C. section 271 as one of its bases for removal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 271 governs substantive claims brought under federal patent law - it does not transform Plaintiff's state law claims so as to \"create federal patent law\" under\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   's first prong.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ClearPlay, Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12). Before Plaintiff can obtain relief on any of its claims, a court will necessarily have to determine whether the licensed patents from JBSHBM are valid. If a court concludes Defendant did not infringe Plaintiff's licensed patents, Defendant cannot have deprived Plaintiff of any intellectual property right Plaintiff asserts, thereby defeating all of Plaintiff's claims.

The Eleventh Circuit reasoned the question of patent infringement was \"heavily fact-bound and situation specific,\" requiring \"a fact-specific application of rules that come from both federal and state law rather than a context-free inquiry into the meaning of a federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057193\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/833/#p841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   court also reasoned the case was not likely to control future cases because \"the highly specialized nature of patent claims and the niche market for the [devices] suggest[ed] that the resolution of th[e] issue [was] unlikely to impact any future constructions of claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057193\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/833/#p841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations added).

Just like the plaintiff's claims in\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's state-law claims arise under a licensing agreement granting exclusive rights to purportedly patented technology. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 4). Plaintiff seeks to establish that JBSHBM's patents are valid and JBSHBM conveyed exclusive rights to the patents through its licensing agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). This analysis is fact-specific and will not result in resolving a general question of patent law likely to affect future cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The claimed patented technology here is highly specialized - JBSHBM's patents construct the technology to convert points across program boundaries.

Apr. 24, 2014) (holding \"[t]he fact-specific nature of the infringement issue, the small likelihood that resolution of it would impact future cases, and the weak interest of the government in federal adjudication of these state law claims support that the federal law question is not substantial[ ]\" (alterations added; citations omitted) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant makes several arguments in an effort to distinguish\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   and avoid remand. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 11-13). According to Defendant,\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   did not present the possibility of remand to a state court, unlike here where Plaintiff is seeking remand. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   11-12). The procedural posture of the case was not relevant to the Eleventh Circuit's jurisdictional analysis and holding. The Eleventh Circuit found no subject matter jurisdiction existed under 28 U.S.C. section 1338, a threshold question before determining it had jurisdiction over the appeal based on other grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057193\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/833/#p841\">\n    720 F.3d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, too, the question is whether the Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1338.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also argues\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   does not control because\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   involved a contract dispute between a licensor and licensee over their licensee agreement, rather than a tort dispute between an exclusive licensee and a third party seeking to recover for infringement of its licensed patents. (Opp'n 13). That argument misses the point. In\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057193\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/833/#p841\">\n    720 F.3d at 841-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the issue of patent infringement was necessary but not substantial to resolve the state-law claims. The issue of patent infringement here is likewise necessary but not substantial to resolve Plaintiff's state-law claims. The contractual nature of the plaintiff's state-law claims in\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   was not the basis upon which the court reached the conclusion no subject matter jurisdiction\n   existed under 28 U.S.C. section 1338.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant also points out that\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   applied to state legal malpractice claims.

Yet the Eleventh Circuit adopted the Supreme Court's substantiality framework in\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   and concluded federal patent law was not substantial for non-malpractice state-law claims as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057193\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/833/#p841\">\n    720 F.3d at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant also argues Federal Circuit precedent, and not Eleventh Circuit precedent, governs whether federal patent law preempts state law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 12-13). The Eleventh Circuit did not analyze issues of preemption in\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   - the court held it \"did not have jurisdiction in whole or in part based on section 1338,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057193\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/833/#p841\">\n    720 F.3d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the same question presently before the Court.\n   <em>\n    MDS (Canada) Inc.\n   </em>\n   is thus binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant also relies on case law predating the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   that established the modern framework for the substantiality inquiry under\n   <em>\n    Christianson\n   </em>\n   's second prong, to argue the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state-law claims because patent issues will necessarily have to be resolved in addressing the claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Air Measurement Techs., Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13, 15). \"[T]here is a tremendously important distinction between complete (otherwise known as 'super' or 'field') preemption, on the one hand, and ordinary (otherwise known as 'defensive' or 'conflict') preemption, on the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Mannsfeld v.

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal; Opp'n.). Rather, Defendant\n   argues \"[c]onflict preemption applies here.\" (Opp'n 7 (alteration added; footnote call number omitted) ). Plaintiff contends \"the defense of ordinary preemption ... has been held to be insufficient to confer federal jurisdiction.\" (Mot. 8 (alteration added) ). Plaintiff is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Unlike field preemption, which can serve as a basis for removal, conflict preemption is an anticipated defense that may be used to defeat a plaintiff's state-law claims.
