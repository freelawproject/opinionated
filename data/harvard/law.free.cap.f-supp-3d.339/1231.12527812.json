In her capacity as HRD, therefore, for Plaintiff to have engaged in protected activity, she must have \"stepped outside\" her role of representing Defendant and either filed-or threatened to file-an action adverse to Defendant, actively assisted other employees in asserting their Title VII rights, or otherwise engaged in \"activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by [Title VII].\"\n   <em>\n    McKenzie v.

Recommending suspension of JK\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, Plaintiff claims that she engaged in protected activity under Title VII by recommending the suspension of JK to her supervisor, DeDecker. The undisputed evidence, however, shows that, in recommending the suspension of JK, Plaintiff was merely discharging her duties as HRD and never \"stepped outside\" her role so as to engage in protected activity. As HRD, Plaintiff's responsibilities included planning, organizing, and directing all aspects of Human Resources Management, ensuring compliance with company policies and legal aspects of the employee-employer relationship, and reporting questionable situations, concerns, complaints, or harassment. Doc. 41 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As part of her job, Plaintiff reported LO's complaint to DeDecker.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Plaintiff and DeDecker proceeded to discuss what, if any, corrective action needed to be taken in the wake of LO's complaint. Plaintiff recommended suspending both JK and LO during the investigation for a \"clean case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. DeDecker asked if they could suspend LO but not JK, and Plaintiff advised that hospital policy dictated they suspend the alleged harasser and that suspending only LO could expose MARH to legal action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-72; Doc. 44 \u00b6 170. DeDecker then directed Plaintiff not to suspend JK. Doc. 41 \u00b6 77. Plaintiff has not alleged that she suspended JK or otherwise defied DeDecker's directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In recommending the suspension of JK, Plaintiff did not assert any rights under Title VII and was merely discharging her everyday duties as HRD by reporting LO's complaint and advising DeDecker on compliance with hospital policy. Plaintiff never crossed the line from performing her job as HRD to asserting a right adverse to Defendant. Precedent dictates that, for a human resources manager to engage in protected activity, she must do more than simply perform her job responsibilities. Plaintiff has not shown that she engaged in protected activity by recommending JK's suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Refusing to terminate LO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, Plaintiff argues that her refusal to terminate LO following LO's sexual harassment complaint constituted protected activity. The undisputed facts show that, after Plaintiff reported LO's complaint to DeDecker, DeDecker asked Plaintiff if MARH could terminate LO's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Plaintiff advised DeDecker that MARH could not terminate Plaintiff for filing a complaint, and that she would need to investigate before determining how to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Plaintiff's investigation was ultimately inconclusive, and DeDecker again asked Plaintiff if MARH could terminate LO's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79. Plaintiff responded that she would not recommend terminating LO, due to potential legal ramifications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-81. LO was not terminated and remained employed with MARH for the duration of DeDecker's employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Again, in advising DeDecker on his termination question, Plaintiff was simply performing her duties as HRD. Moreover, the undisputed factual record shows that DeDecker merely asked\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   MARH could terminate LO. And, when Plaintiff advised that she would not recommend terminating LO, DeDecker apparently heeded her advice-LO was not terminated and, indeed, remained employed by MARH throughout the rest of DeDecker's employment. DeDecker never gave Plaintiff a directive to terminate LO. Likewise, Plaintiff never filed (or threatened to file) an action adverse to Defendant, actively assisted LO in asserting her Title VII rights, or otherwise engaged in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of protected rights. Plaintiff has not shown that she engaged in protected\n   activity in advising against the termination of LO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Refusing directive not to involve Corporate HR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, Plaintiff alleges she engaged in protected activity by refusing a directive from DeDecker not to involve Corporate HR in the sexual harassment investigation. After Plaintiff informed DeDecker that she would need to investigate LO's complaint, DeDecker instructed Plaintiff not to contact Corporate HR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. At the conclusion of her investigation, Plaintiff told DeDecker that she needed to contact Corporate HR to apprise them of the investigation because LO might call either the \"ethics hotline\" or \"corporate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. In response, DeDecker told Plaintiff to \"be careful\"-there is no evidence that DeDecker told Plaintiff not to call at this point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. Plaintiff subsequently contacted Corporate HR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89, 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff did not engage in any protected activity by contacting Corporate HR regarding the investigation because Plaintiff did not contact Corporate HR in an effort to oppose discrimination. Plaintiff contacted Corporate HR only because she expected LO to contact Corporate HR, and Plaintiff wanted Corporate HR to be aware of the investigation. And, in contacting Corporate HR, Plaintiff was simply discharging her duties as HRD by informing Corporate HR of LO's complaint and the ensuing investigation. She never crossed the line from performing her job to asserting a right adverse to Defendant. Plaintiff's third proposed basis for protected activity under Title VII likewise fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Reporting concerns regarding salary inequities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiff argues that she engaged in protected activity under Title VII by reporting concerns to DeDecker regarding salary inequities based on gender and race. The uncontroverted evidence shows that, during Plaintiff's first two weeks of employment, DeDecker directed Plaintiff to review employee compensation for any salary equity issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. During Plaintiff's review, she identified certain gender- and race-based inequities, promptly brought them to DeDecker's attention, and made recommendations to remedy the inequities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22, 24-26. Plaintiff followed up with DeDecker four to five additional times over the summer of 2014 and, although Plaintiff testified she felt DeDecker was \"annoyed\" and angry when she continued to bring up the project, DeDecker forwarded Plaintiff's proposal to his supervisor, recommended his supervisor approve the proposed salary adjustments, and thanked Plaintiff for her work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 45-46, 51-52, 54. The salary increases were ultimately implemented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Again, in investigating and reporting salary inequity issues at MARH, Plaintiff was simply discharging a responsibility of her job-one that DeDecker himself instructed her to do. Plaintiff never crossed the line from performing her job as HRD to asserting a right adverse to Defendant. She never filed, or threatened to file, an action adverse to Defendant, actively assisted employees in asserting their Title VII rights, or otherwise engaged in activities that reasonably could be perceived as directed towards the assertion of rights protected by Title VII. Plaintiff has not shown that she engaged in protected activity by reporting her concerns regarding salary inequities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Pretext\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case, summary judgment is appropriate. But, even assuming Plaintiff could establish all of the elements of her prima facie case, Plaintiff's claim fails for the additional reason that Defendant has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her termination, and Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant's\n   explanation is pretext. Defendant contends that Plaintiff was terminated due to her mishandling of, and dishonesty during, the sexual harassment investigation. In response, Plaintiff points to various inconsistencies that she claims show that Defendant's proffered reason is pretext-including DeDecker's \"changing explanations\" for his decision to terminate Plaintiff-and also takes issue with Defendant's refusal to consider evidence that Plaintiff was not lying in her report. Doc. 44 at 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The uncontroverted evidence supports Defendant's proffered reason for Plaintiff's termination, and Plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext. First, Defendant is consistent in its concerns regarding Plaintiff's investigation and the reasons for her termination. The undisputed evidence shows that DeDecker became concerned with the content of Plaintiff's report immediately upon reviewing the report. Doc. 41 \u00b6\u00b6 119-121. And when DeDecker brought the inconsistencies to Plaintiff's attention, she admitted that the report was inaccurate, and she was subsequently terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134-144, 147. Second, Defendant was entitled to rely on its business judgment in making the termination decision. Plaintiff's argument is essentially that she disagrees that the inaccuracies in her report (which, again, she concedes,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.D) justified her termination. Whether Defendant's proffered reason was fair or correct is immaterial, however, so long as Defendant honestly believed its reason and acted in good faith upon its beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Swackhammer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3510252\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/1160/#p1169\">\n    493 F.3d at 1169-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The alleged inconsistencies raised by Plaintiff are simply too minor to give rise to an inference of pretext.\n   <em>\n    Lucas v.

By failing to respond to Defendant's arguments, Plaintiff has abandoned this claim.\n   <em>\n    Hinsdale v. City of Liberal, Kan.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"239627\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/19/749/#p768\">\n    19 F.

Summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiff's Section 1981 claim is warranted on this basis alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, even if Plaintiff had not abandoned this claim, the claim still fails because Plaintiff cannot meet her initial burden to establish a prima facie case for retaliation under Section 1981. Plaintiff's conduct during her work on the pay equity project did not constitute protected activity.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.1.d. Because Plaintiff has not carried her burden of establishing a prima facie case for retaliation under Section 1981, the Court need not proceed with the remainder of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   test. However, for the reasons discussed in Part III.A.2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , even if Plaintiff had established a prima facie case, she cannot rebut Defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her termination. The Court accordingly finds that summary judgment is proper on Plaintiff's claim for retaliation in violation of Section 1981.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
