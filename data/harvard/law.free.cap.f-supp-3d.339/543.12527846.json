Hawkins and his mother, plaintiff Amber Lynn Durbin (\"Durbin\"), commenced this diversity action advancing three negligence claims against Switchback under Pennsylvania law. Before the court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This personal injury lawsuit arises from physical injuries suffered by Hawkins following a dirt bike accident at Switchback's off-road riding and racing facility in Butler, Pennsylvania. Switchback promotes and stages dirt bike races for participants of all skill levels. (Doc. 28 \u00b6 1; Doc. 32 \u00b6 2). Switchback's website articulates its waiver and consent policy as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Dirtbike/ATV riding is dangerous. Accidents, injuries, and even death can occur. Ride at your own risk! All riders must sign a waiver before they will [be] permitted to ride. Minors will be required to have parental consent. During practice, there are limited to no flaggers. Please, ride safely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Click here to download a pdf copy of the waiver (250k).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   There is no trespassing on Switchback property. Anyone caught trespassing will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   All minors that come without their legal parents they must have a NOTARIZED waiver to be able to ride. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Doc. 30-9 at 1). Switchback's track manager, Mark Brader (\"Brader\"), testified that,\n   pursuant to this policy, a minor is not be permitted to ride without a signed parental consent form and waiver. (Brader Dep. 29:5-18, 42:13-21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that it was his responsibility to ensure that minors did not misrepresent their age or otherwise engage in efforts to improperly gain access to the track. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:4-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28 \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hawkins began riding a dirt bike at the age of five or six. (Doc. 32 \u00b6 4). He learned the ins and outs of dirt bike riding from his father, who raced dirt bikes and often brought Hawkins to spectate at off-road races. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9; Hawkins Dep. 20:5-22:4 (\"Hawkins Dep.\") ). Hawkins began participating in races himself at \"a young age\" and even secured sponsorships. (Doc. 32 \u00b6 6). He testified that he was aware of the dangers of riding dirt bikes from early on in his experience, that his father instructed him to avoid jumps that \"you don't think you can handle,\" and that he wore protective gear to guard against the risk of injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Hawkins Dep. 21:20-22:21, 38:22-39:25, 133:3-12, 147:18-148:6). He acknowledges that dirt bike riding is \"a dangerous sport,\" that \"you could get hurt\" on a dirt bike, and that a fall could cause \"injury ... or even death.\" (Hawkins Dep. 25:17-26:4, 38:13-21, 39:14-25, 147:18-148:6). Despite his protective measures, Hawkins has suffered injuries in the past riding a dirt bike. (Doc. 32 \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Hawkins Dep. 38:22-39:25, 133:3-12). Hawkins had been to Switchback on three prior occasions: once as a spectator, once as pit crew member for his friend Jonathan Franjko (\"Franjko\"), and once as a rider. (Doc. 32 \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The events preceding Hawkins' accident on January 9, 2016 are disputed by the parties and not fully explored in the Rule 56 record. According to Hawkins, he arrived at Switchback with several friends and met with Brader, who asked them whether they had been to Switchback before. (Hawkins Dep. 49:5-12). Hawkins relayed that, after the group responded affirmatively, Brader told them to sign in, accepted their payment, and provided them with wristbands to attach to their helmets to indicate they had been authorized to ride. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) He denied ever being asked to present identification and did not recall being asked his age. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 133:13-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Switchback's account diverges considerably. According to Brader, Hawkins entered the indoor facility on January 9, 2016 with Franjko, who had a Switchback membership card. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brader Dep. 56:9-18). Brader did not recognize Hawkins and thought he appeared to be under the age of 18. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:19-57:2). Brader reported that he told Hawkins he needed to \"take home a waiver and fill it out\" and that he had to \"bring [the waiver] out next time and join us another day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:23-57:6). Brader does not recall Hawkins signing in on Switchback's sign-in sheet for January 9, 2016, but testified that he told Hawkins he \"could not ride\" without waiver and consent forms on file. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:12-77:1). Brader also testified that he does not know how Hawkins ultimately came to access the track on January 9, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91:12-16). It is undisputed that Durbin did not execute a parental consent form allowing Hawkins to participate in dirt bike riding at Switchback. (Doc. 28 \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 9, 2016, Hawkins somehow gained access Switchback's indoor dirt bike racing track. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28 \u00b6 13; Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   32 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13, 31). Hawkins \"attempted a jump, without enough speed,\" on one of the track's \"table top jumps,\" which caused the frame of his dirt bike to hit the ground and \"flip [the] bike and Hawkins over.\" (Doc. 32 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 31). According to Brader, it was only after this wreck that he became aware that Hawkins had accessed the track. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brader Dep. 57:4-11). Brader testified that Hawkins \"didn't look right\" and that he offered to call an ambulance. (Id. at 82:10-83:12). Franjko confirmed that Brader asked \"a couple times\" whether Hawkins wanted medical attention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franjko Dep. 58:12-59:1). Hawkins left Switchback's facility with his friends without receiving medical attention. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 28 \u00b6 17; Doc. 39 \u00b6 17). Hawkins was subsequently treated for injuries including a lacerated kidney and pancreas, trauma to his spleen, a broken hip, a concussion, and post-concussion syndrome. (Doc. 28 \u00b6 18). The accident occurred four months before Hawkins' 18th birthday. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32 \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hawkins and Durbin commenced this lawsuit on November 15, 2016, asserting one claim of negligence each and one claim of negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   together. Plaintiffs contend that Switchback violated its internal policies and its legal duty of care by failing to ensure that Hawkins, a minor, did not access its facility without parental consent. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on each of the plaintiffs' claims. The motions are fully briefed and ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Through summary adjudication, the court may dispose of those claims that do not present a \"genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and for which a jury trial would be an empty and unnecessary formality.

CONS. STAT. \u00a7 7102, and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , whether Hawkins assumed the risk of injury, negating any duty of care, by engaging in an activity which he understood to be dangerous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Duty of Care\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties offer competing perspectives of the applicable duty of care. Switchback maintains that it had no duty to protect Hawkins from risks inherent in off-road dirt bike riding. Switchback invokes the no-duty rule set forth in Pennsylvania's Comparative Negligence Act, which provides that an operator of an off-road vehicle riding area-such as Switchback-\"shall have no duty to protect riders from common, frequent, expected and nonnegligent risks inherent to the activity, including collisions with riders or objects.\" 42 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 7102(b.3)(1). Switchback avers that the possibility of falling and suffering injury while engaged in off-road riding is an inherent, expected risk of the activity, and that the no-duty rule forecloses liability in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs rejoin that the no-duty rule has no application here. They assert that this case does not concern a duty to protect patrons from the risks of off-road riding once they have accessed the track, but instead concerns Switchback's alleged negligence in allowing minors to access its facility in the first instance. Plaintiffs rely on the Armstrong County Court of Common Pleas' decision in\n   <em>\n    Emerick v.

The trouble with Emerick is that it fails to engage with or even acknowledge the no-duty rule, which became law on July 15, 2004-a mere six days before the\n   <em>\n    Emerick\n   </em>\n   decision issued. Plaintiffs posit that the lack of discussion of the new rule suggests that the court deemed it inapplicable, given that the case before the court involved policies which allowed a plaintiff to sneak onto the track rather than the conditions of the track itself. Switchback, for its part, insists that the court was either unaware of the new enactment or deemed it inapplicable because the accident at issue occurred before the statute's effective date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We cannot ascribe weight to the\n   <em>\n    Emerick\n   </em>\n   decision when it failed to engage with this transformative legislative enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court's opinion expressly states that it is grounded largely in public policy-but the state legislature six days prior explicitly and substantially transformed the Commonwealth's negligence policy as concerns tort liability for operators of off-road riding areas. In our view, the failure of the\n   <em>\n    Emerick\n   </em>\n   court to account for the no-duty rule severely diminishes its value as precedent. Nonetheless, because we determine\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   that the assumption of the risk doctrine negates any duty that Switchback may have had to protect Hawkins, we need not determine, as a matter of law, what duty of care remains for operators of off-road riding areas with respect to minors attempting to access their facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But the legislature expressly preserved assumption of the risk as a defense in two categories of activities: off-road vehicle riding,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"835548\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-d-c4th/68/299/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7102(b.3)(2), and downhill skiing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"835548\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-d-c4th/68/299/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7102(c)(2). Specifically, as pertains off-road vehicle riding areas, the Comparative Negligence Act states: \"The doctrine of knowing voluntary assumption of risk shall apply to all actions to recover damages for negligence resulting in death or injury to person or property brought against any off-road vehicle riding area operator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"835548\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-d-c4th/68/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7102(b.3)(2). The assumption of the risk doctrine operates to negate any legal duty ascribed to those plaintiffs seek to hold liable: \"to the extent the injured plaintiff proceeded in the face of a known danger, he relieved those who may have otherwise had a duty, implicitly agreeing to take care of himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Montagazzi v.

Super. Ct. 2005) ). The Comparative Negligence Act identifies \"collisions with riders or objects\" as risks inherent in off-road riding. 42 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 7102(b.3)(1). Common sense dictates that the risk of a fall or collision that does not involve another rider or object is equally inherent in the activity. Indeed, Hawkins' own experience bears this out-he testified that his accident on January 9, 2016, was not his first; that he knew from personal experience that attempting jumps carried a certain risk; and that he wore protective gear in an attempt to mitigate that risk. (Hawkins Dep. 38:22-39:25, 133:3-12, 147:24-148:6). We find that the risk of suffering serious injury when attempting a dirt bike jump is one which \"cannot be removed without altering the fundamental nature\" of dirt bike riding and is thus inherent in the activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bjorgung\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741817\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/263/#p269\">\n    550 F.3d at 268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951036\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/100/#p105\">\n    874 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   105 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We further conclude that reasonable persons could not debate whether Hawkins appreciated and knowingly assumed that risk. Hawkins was nearly 18 years old at the time of the accident and had been riding dirt bikes for more than 12 years. He was a vastly experienced rider. He was well aware that dirt bike riding carried the risk of serious injury and even death. Indeed, Hawkins acknowledged that a dirt bike presents a certain danger \"even when the bike's on the ground.\" (Hawkins Dep. 92:4-93:2). Given this unequivocal record testimony, we have little difficulty finding that this particular rider-plaintiff Kameron Hawkins-knew, appreciated, and assumed the risks attending off-road dirt bike riding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Anticipating the defense's strategy\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs contend that a minor cannot\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   assume the risk of a particular activity, again invoking Emerick, in which the Armstrong County Court of Common Pleas held that, because a minor plaintiff is incapable of entering into a contract and cannot expressly waive liability for a given activity, a minor cannot impliedly assume that same risk by his or her actions.\n   <em>\n    Emerick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"835548\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-d-c4th/68/299/\">\n    68 Pa.

In this respect, Emerick runs counter to the great weight of authority in the state courts and in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals which have held consistently that a minor is capable of assuming the risk of a dangerous activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bjorgung\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741817\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/263/#p269\">\n    550 F.3d at 268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"209832\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/310/153/\">\n    456 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   550 );\n   <em>\n    Montagazzi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289654\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/994/626/#p635\">\n    994 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   635-36 ;\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"209832\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/310/153/\">\n    456 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   550 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

He was an experienced dirt bike rider who was fully aware that attempting a jump on a dirt bike carried with it an inexorable risk of injury. And he proceeded to attempt a jump on Switchback's indoor track notwithstanding that understood risk. Switchback accordingly had no duty to protect Hawkins on January 9, 2016. We will grant summary judgment to Switchback on Hawkins' negligence claim. Because Durbin's claim for economic damages is derivative of Hawkins' individual claim, we will likewise grant summary judgment to Switchback on Durbin's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We are not unsympathetic to the serious injuries suffered by Hawkins. But the unequivocal fact remains that Hawkins-having more than a decade of experience riding on similar off-road tracks-voluntarily engaged in the dangerous sport of dirt bike riding knowing full well the risks of the activity. Switchback is not legally responsible for the injuries that Hawkins suffered at its facility. Accordingly, the court will grant summary judgment to Switchback on plaintiffs' negligence claims.
