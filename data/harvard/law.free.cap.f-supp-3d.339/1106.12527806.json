RICE, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   BEFORE THE COURT are Defendant Horning Brothers, LLC's Motion for Summary\n   Judgment (ECF No. 51); Plaintiffs-Intervenors' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 59); and State of Washington's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against Horning Brothers, LLC (ECF No. 62). These matters were heard with oral argument on September 6, 2018. The Court has reviewed the record and files herein, and is fully informed. For the reasons discussed below, Defendant Horning Brothers, LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 51) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ; Plaintiffs-Intervenors' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 59) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; and State of Washington's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against Horning Brothers, LLC (ECF No. 62) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 25, 2017, Plaintiff State of Washington filed this action against Defendants Horning Brothers, LLC and Hermilo Cruz for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) and the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD). ECF No. 1. This action concerns allegations of discriminatory hiring and segregated employment practices because of sex, sexual harassment, retaliation, and aiding and abetting others in violation of the WLAD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff asserts these claims against Horning Brothers and its supervisor, Mr. Cruz.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 15, 2017, the Court granted the Proposed Motion to Intervene for Plaintiffs-Intervenors who were employed by Horning Brothers, supervised by Mr. Cruz, and were allegedly subjected to sexual harassment, retaliation, and constructive discharge. ECF No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 18, 2018, Horning Brothers filed the instant motion for summary judgment, which Mr. Cruz joined. ECF Nos. 51; 58. Plaintiffs-Intervenors filed a motion for partial summary judgment, which the State joined. ECF Nos. 59; 65. The State also filed a motion for partial summary judgment against Horning Brothers, which Plaintiffs-Intervenors joined. ECF Nos. 62; 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following are the undisputed facts unless otherwise noted. For purposes of summary judgment, \"[i]f a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may ... consider the fact undisputed.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2). The Court acknowledges the State and Plaintiffs-Intervenors' objections to Defendants' failure to file a statement of facts in accordance with Local Rule 56.1(b). ECF Nos. 75 at 9 n.3; 78 at 3-5. The Court also considers their objections that Defendants' declarations are merely conclusory and often conflict with statements made at deposition or in sworn written discovery responses. ECF Nos. 75 at 10-11; 78 at 5-7; 102 at 6-8; 103 at 4-7. The Court notes below when factual assertions are disputed and considers any conflicting statements and declarations. The Court emphasizes that it does not consider any conclusory statements or irrelevant rhetoric involving Defendants' shock and dismay over the allegations, as these feelings are not pertinent to the issues currently before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Horning Brothers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Horning Brothers is an agricultural company in Quincy, Washington that grows a variety of field crops. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6 1; 63 at \u00b6 1; 76 at \u00b6 1; 79 at \u00b6 1. Horning Brothers is owned by Allen and Greg Horning, who operate the company along with their father, Warren Horning, and his wife, Kathy Horning, through a group of farming, land holding, and asset management companies owned by members\n   of the Horning family. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-10; 63 at \u00b6 2; 76 at \u00b6 2; 79 at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Until March 2017, Horning Brothers only grew onions, and owned and seasonally operated an onion-packing shed. ECF Nos. 51 at 3; 60 at \u00b6 3; 63 at \u00b6 3; 76 at \u00b6 3; 79 at \u00b6 3. Each packing season ran from roughly October to March. ECF Nos. 51 at 3; 60 at \u00b6 13; 63 at \u00b6 4; 76 at \u00b6 6; 79 at \u00b6 13. It is disputed whether the Horning Brothers employed 20-25 or 27-40 seasonal workers. ECF Nos. 51 at 3; 60 at \u00b6 14; 63 at \u00b6 4; 76 at \u00b6 7; 79 at \u00b6 14. Horning Brothers had eight to ten year-round employees. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6 11; 76 at \u00b6 5; 79 at \u00b6 12. The seasonal workforce spoke largely only in Spanish, but Defendants contend that approximately a third of the workers also spoke English. ECF Nos. 51 at 4; 60 at \u00b6 15; 63 at \u00b6 6; 76 at \u00b6 9; 79 at \u00b6 15. Allen, Greg, and Warren Horning do not speak Spanish. ECF Nos. 51 at 4; 60 at \u00b6 16; 63 at \u00b6 7; 76 at \u00b6 10; 79 at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Cruz\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Cruz is the Horning Brothers' foreman. ECF No. 51 at 3, 5. He worked full-time for Horning Brothers since June 2004, and Plaintiffs allege that he became the \"Onion Shed Supervisor\" in 2006 and remained in that role until March 2017. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6 18; 63 at \u00b6 8; 76 at \u00b6 11; 79 at \u00b6 18. Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Cruz was designated as the \"Direct Supervisor\" of each of the onion sorters. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6 19; 63 at \u00b6 9; 76 at \u00b6 12; 79 at \u00b6 19. They also assert that from at least 2012 to March 2017, Mr. Cruz was the only person designated as the \"Onion Shed Supervisor,\" and Allen and Greg Horning were designated as the \"Direct Supervisor[s]\" for the \"Shop\" employees and Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; 76 at \u00b6 14; 79 at \u00b6 19. Mr. Cruz's ability to speak Spanish was an important factor and the Hornings relied on him to communicate with the onion sorters. ECF Nos. 51 at 4; 60 at \u00b6 22; 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; 79 at \u00b6 22. Plaintiffs allege that Horning Brothers provided Mr. Cruz no training to be a supervisor when he became Onion Shed Supervisor. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 13; 76 at \u00b6 17; 79 at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants assert that Mr. Cruz is not a supervisor and did not have authority to hire, fire, promote, demote, discipline, or raise or reduce any employee's pay or benefits. ECF No. 51 at 5. Defendants explain that Horning Brothers had a sign-up sheet in the onion shed and workers who wanted to work the next season would write their names and phone numbers on the sheet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Allen and Greg Horning asked Mr. Cruz to call the workers on the sheet until they had commitments from enough workers to fill their staffing needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Cruz was directed to first contact those workers who had worked the previous season or seasons, as Horning Brothers assumed those workers knew the job duties and requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While Defendants deny that Mr. Cruz had the authority to hire employees, Plaintiffs-Intervenors allege that he had authority to hire seasonal onion shed employees. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 38-62; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 223-42. Plaintiffs-Intervenors also argue that Mr. Cruz had the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   authority to terminate seasonal onion shed employees, authority to affect employees work hours, and authority to assign employees' work positions in the packing shed. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 63-86; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 243-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Safety Meetings and Harassment Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Horning Brothers held periodic \"safety meetings.\" ECF Nos. 51 at 5; 63 at \u00b6 14; 76 at \u00b6 210; 79 at \u00b6 266. Plaintiffs allege the agendas show that those meetings primarily addressed employee safety and conduct rules to prevent workplace injury. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 15; 76 at \u00b6 211; 79 at \u00b6 267. Item No. 11 on the agenda stated, \"Report any threats or harassment immediately\n   to Warren, Greg, or Allen.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     HARASSMENT OR THREATS TO OTHER WORKERS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\" ECF No. 52 at 8 (Ex. B) (emphasis in original). This item was sometimes modified to include or exclude Kayla Cedergreen or Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 51 at 6; 63 at \u00b6 17; 76 at \u00b6 213; 79 at \u00b6 281. Plaintiffs emphasize that this item was the sole written or verbal material identified by Horning Brothers as the harassment or discrimination policy applicable while the onion shed was in operation. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 20; 76 at \u00b6 217; 79 at \u00b6 273. They also note that Ms. Cedergreen, who speaks some Spanish, was only on the list from October 24, 2016 to February 17, 2017, less than four months. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 224, 226; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 281, 283.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Allen or Greg Horning would read through the agenda in English and ask a bilingual employee to translate. ECF Nos. 51 at 6; 63 at \u00b6 18; 76 at \u00b6 214; 79 at \u00b6 270. Plaintiffs state that Mr. Cruz or Mr. Cruz's former brothers-in-law, Jose and Arturo Garay, would often translate. ECF Nos. 60 at \u00b6 23; 63 at \u00b6 18; 76 at \u00b6 214; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 270-71. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Cruz admits he did not interpret the safety meetings \"word-for-word\" and the Hornings had no way of knowing if the Spanish translation was accurate. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 22; 76 at \u00b6 219; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 277-78. They also assert that witness testimony confirms seasonal workers came away with vastly different understandings of what the Horning Brothers communicated at those meetings. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 23; 76 at \u00b6 220; 79 at \u00b6 279. The meeting sheets were never provided to workers in Spanish. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 24; 76 at \u00b6 221; 79 at \u00b6 279. These meetings never directly addressed sexual harassment nor retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Horning Brothers first distributed an Employee Handbook in June 2017. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 32; 76 at \u00b6 230. The handbook defines sexual harassment, contains a complaint procedure including a complaint form, promises a \"thorough\" and \"confidential\" investigation, identifies and prohibits retaliation, and is available in Spanish. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 33; 76 at \u00b6 231. The handbook was issued after the onion packing operations had permanently ceased and was not distributed to any onion sorter. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 34; 76 at \u00b6 232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Notice to Horning Brothers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants allege that in the 20 years Horning Brothers ran its onion packing operation, not a single employee ever reported an instance of sexual harassment to Greg Horning, Allen Horning, Warren Horning, Kayla Cedergreen, or Kathy Horning. ECF No. 51 at 7. Defendants state that when an employee had another kind of complaint, he or she would bring a bilingual co-worker to translate. ECF Nos. 51 at 7; 63 at \u00b6 31; 76 at \u00b6 228; 79 at \u00b6 285. Defendants also note that all the employees were generally located within a small area of the onion shed with Mr. Cruz's wife, Claudia, along with her daughter and mother. ECF No. 51 at 4. Plaintiffs-Intervenors emphasize that Claudia's mother and daughter worked only one season each. ECF No. 79 at \u00b6 329.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Yesica Cabrera Navarro testified that she complained to Warren Horning about harassment by Mr. Cruz in December 2014, using Jose Garay as an interpreter. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 35; 76 at \u00b6 233; 79 at \u00b6 286. Warren Horning testified that he remembered having a conversation \"with Jose and some lady,\" but could not recall what she was \"upset about.\" ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 37; 64-11 at 10 (Ex. 11); 76 at \u00b6 235; 79 at \u00b6 287. Yesica Cabrera Navarro testified that Warren Horning \"said that if I was comfortable working there, I could stay. And that if I wasn't, then it was my decision.\" ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 38; 64-13 at 17 (Ex. 13); 76 at \u00b6 236. She left her employment within a\n   month. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 39; 76 at \u00b6 237; 79 at \u00b6 297.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Horning Brothers allege that Warren Horning did not receive a sexual harassment complaint about Mr. Cruz from Yesica Cabrera Navarro. ECF No. 100 at 5. Horning Brothers argue that because she does not speak English, and thus she does not know if Jose Garay translated her sexual harassment claims to Warren Horning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Horning Brothers emphasize that Jose Garay denied that Yesica Cabrera Navarro complained about sexual harassment. ECF Nos. 100 at 5; 100-6 at 5 (Ex. VI). Horning Brothers emphasize that in her Separation Questionnaire, she wrote that her reason for leaving was because of back pain and she had a hard time staying late in the onion shed. ECF Nos. 100 at 6; 100-2 at 43-44 (Ex. II). Yesica Cabrera Navarro testified that she was not able to read the document as it was in English at the time she filled it out, and that she did not know what she wrote because she just wanted to leave. ECF No. 100-2 at 43-44. The night after she quit, she sent a Facebook message to Jose Garay answering his question about why she left work crying. ECF Nos. 100 at 6; 100-6 at 6-7 (Ex. VI). At his deposition, Jose Garay stated that she said \"her back was hurting and her leg, I guess. And Hermilo didn't let her take off.\" ECF No. 100-6 at 7. In the Facebook message, Yesica Cabrera Navarro referred to Mr. Cruz as the boss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Roxana Rodriguez de Alfaro filed a complaint against Horning Brothers on August 14, 2015 with the Washington State Human Rights Commission (HRC), alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and national origin. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 41; 64-27 at 2-5 (Ex. 27); 76 at \u00b6 239. Her complaint stated that she quit as a result of the harassment by Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; 64-27 at 3; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 240-42. In August 2015, Greg Horning, Allen Horning, Kathy Horning, Kayla Cedergreen, and Warren Horning received and reviewed the complaint. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 44; 64-21 at 12 (Ex. 21); 76 at \u00b6 242; 79 at \u00b6 298. On September 24, 2015, Allen Horning provided a written \"response\" statement on behalf of Horning Brothers and together with a statement by Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 45; 64-28 at 2-6 (Ex. 28); 76 at \u00b6 243; 79 at \u00b6 300. This statement identified Mr. Cruz as \"the supervisor in the onion packing shed.\" ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 47; 64-28 at 3; 76 at \u00b6 245; 79 at \u00b6 302. The response related that upon receiving the complaint, \"we immediately spoke to Hermilo 'Milo' Cruz. His statement is also included with my response. We have every reason to believe his version of events.\" ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 48; 64-28 at 3; 76 at \u00b6 246; 79 at \u00b6 303. Plaintiffs emphasize that the response does not identify any other steps the Horning Brothers took to investigate or remedy the alleged discrimination. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 49; 76 at \u00b6 247; 79 at \u00b6 304. Plaintiffs note that Horning Brothers did not provide training to Mr. Cruz or to its workforce following the receipt of the complaint nor take any other action to address the issues alleged in the complaint. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 51-56; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 249-54; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 306-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On August 2, 2016, the State served a Civil Investigation Demand on Horning Brothers, notifying it that the State was investigating it for \"sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing unfair employment practices.\" ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 57; 64-29 at 2 (Ex. 29); 76 at \u00b6 255; 79 at \u00b6 311. Besides responding, Horning Brothers took no steps to investigate or remedy the alleged sexual harassment or retaliation between August 2, 2016 and March 2017 other than to speak to Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 58; 76 at \u00b6 256; 79 at \u00b6 312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Allegations Post-Dating Notice to Horning Brothers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants assert that Mr. Cruz denies that he engaged in the acts alleged and no\n   member of the Horning family \"ever saw any hint of such behavior.\" ECF No. 51 at 8. Plaintiffs allege that the State has identified ten women who were sexually harassed by Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 65; 76 at \u00b6 263. The alleged victims are Claudia Arballo, Yasmin Cabrera, Yesica Cabrera, Socorro Diaz Silvas, Rosaura Hernandez, Zoelia Isordia, Trinidad Ortega de Lopez, Samantha Mendoza, Roxanna Rodriguez de Alfaro, and Lizeth Rubio. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 66; 76 at \u00b6 263. Nine of these women were deposed and testified to being subjected to offensive sexual comments, conduct, or touching by Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 67; 76 at \u00b6 265. Horning Brothers did not take the deposition of Zoelia Isordia, the tenth victim identified by the State. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 68; 76 at \u00b6 266. Five of the ten alleged victims testified that they experienced sexual harassment after Horning Brothers responded to the HRC complaint on September 24, 2015. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 69; 76 at \u00b6 267.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    F. March 2017 Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On February 10, 2017, the State notified Horning Brothers that it had been authorized to bring this lawsuit under Title VII and the WLAD. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 70; 76 at \u00b6 268; 79 at \u00b6 318. From March 2, 2017 to May 25, 2017, Horning Brothers conducted interviews of 20 current and former employees, including Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 71; 76 at \u00b6 269; 79 at \u00b6 319. Kayla Cedergreen and Kathy Horning took contemporaneous notes during the interviews and typed the notes up \"immediately after.\" ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 73; 76 at \u00b6 271; 79 at \u00b6 321. According to the interview notes, ten reported having witnessed, heard about, or been subjected to sexual comments or touching by Mr. Cruz during their employment with Horning Brothers, which included every one of the full-time employees who were interviewed. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 74; 76 at \u00b6 272; 79 at \u00b6 322. Plaintiffs allege that Horning Brothers did not discipline Mr. Cruz following these interviews. ECF Nos. 63 at \u00b6 75; 76 at \u00b6 273; 79 at \u00b6 323. Mr. Cruz is no longer the shed supervisor because the Hornings closed the packing shed permanently, but Mr. Cruz still works for Horning Brothers and Plaintiffs assert that he has not been disciplined in any way for inappropriate sexual conduct.

ECF Nos. 1 at \u00b6 35; 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 47-51. Horning Brothers, joined by Mr. Cruz (ECF No. 58), argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claim for sexual harassment under Title VII. ECF No. 51 at 10. Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on this claim. ECF No. 59; 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Pursuant to Title VII, a plaintiff must make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of a hostile work environment by showing that: \"(1) she was subjected to verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, (2) this conduct was unwelcome, and (3) the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Craig v.

Defendants also assert that Mr. Cruz was not a \"supervisor\" whose actions may be presumptively imputed to Horning Brothers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Defendants insist that most, if not all, of the Plaintiffs will be unable to establish that they were subjected to a hostile work environment due to sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. They contend that Plaintiffs will be unable to provide evidence that the alleged harassment by Mr. Cruz should be imputed to Horning Brothers because none of the Plaintiffs ever reported the harassment to Horning Brothers \"despite its explicit direction to all employees that they do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State responds that nine victims have testified to frequent and unwanted touching that offended or scared them, which defeats Defendants' summary judgment motion. ECF Nos. 75 at 12-13; 76 \u00b6\u00b6 18-161. The State asserts the victims testified that the harassment included unwelcome compliments, requests for phone numbers, dates, sexual pictures, and sex, as well as crude gestures, comments about sex, sexual dreams, and masturbation. ECF Nos. 75 at 13; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 27-31, 38-40, 44, 56-59, 68-71, 73, 80-81, 84-92, 96, 98, 101, 117-20, 132-34, 143, 148, 150-52. The victims also allege that Mr. Cruz touched, rubbed, and grabbed them in tight spaces on the sorting line or outside near bathrooms where he would surprise them as they exited. ECF Nos. 75 at 13; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25-26, 45, 52, 54, 61, 72, 75, 82, 97, 104, 109, 112-13, 122, 142, 153-54. The victims testified that this conduct was frequent, often occurring daily or almost daily. ECF Nos. 75 at 13; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 50, 55, 72, 80, 110, 133. They described the harassment as making them feel uncomfortable, offended, embarrassed, disgusted, humiliated, nervous, and scared. ECF Nos. 75 at 14; 76 at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 46, 52, 72, 77, 85, 96, 101, 125, 128, 131, 144. The State then argues that this evidence is more than sufficient for a reasonable juror to find objectively and subjectively offensive. ECF No. 75 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs-Intervenors assert that their testimony creates a genuine issue for trial\n   because they testified that Mr. Cruz touched their bodies, buttocks, breasts, and hips, pressed his penis into their bodies, grabbed them and kissed them. ECF Nos. 78 at 8; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33-38, 64, 66, 73, 75, 100, 105-08, 149, 153, 158, 164-65, 172, 191, 194, 200. They allege that he made sexual comments and gestures, including propositioning them for sex or romantic relationships, commenting about their bodies and appearance, and asking them out. ECF Nos. 78 at 8; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 39-45, 68-73, 76, 97-98, 101, 103-04, 109-13, 115-20, 150, 157, 161-63, 168-69, 171, 190, 193, 196-97. Plaintiffs-Intervenors also emphasize that these acts occurred frequently. ECF Nos. 78 at 9; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34, 67, 99, 115, 150, 189. Plaintiffs-Intervenors then conclude that a reasonable woman would have found Mr. Cruz's conduct created a hostile work environment. ECF No. 78 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mr. Cruz replies that the facts alleged do not objectively add up to a hostile work environment because the alleged acts are not \"hellish,\" \"nightmarish,\" or \"extreme\" conditions. ECF No. 98 at 7. Mr. Cruz argues the work environment was also not subjectively abusive because some Plaintiffs socialized with Mr. Cruz and his wife outside of work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court agrees with the State and Plaintiffs-Intervenors that the overwhelming evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to them, establishes a genuine issue of material fact. A reasonable jury could find that the alleged victims were subject to verbal and physical conduct of a sexual nature, which was unwelcome and created an abusive working environment. They provide sufficient evidence of objective hostility that a reasonable person could perceive the workplace as hostile. The Court then finds that Defendants fail to show the absence of any material fact in light of the victims' testimony of unwelcome sexual contact that made them uncomfortable, disgusted, humiliated, and scared. The Court is not persuaded by Defendants' conclusory allegations that Plaintiffs would be unable to establish a claim for sexual harassment and Mr. Cruz's argument that because some Plaintiffs socialized outside of work with Mr. Cruz and his family at a birthday party means that they are unable to establish sexual harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-10. The Court then denies Defendants' motion to dismiss the sexual harassment claim in regards to Mr. Cruz's liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Additionally, the Court is not persuaded by Defendants' argument that because Mr. Cruz has denied he committed the alleged sexual harassment, it would be improper for the Court to rule on other issues that depend on sexual harassment being established. ECF No. 73 at 4. The State asserts that it is well-settled that a district court may grant summary judgment on a claim or defense to narrow the issues for trial. ECF No. 102 at 9. The State argues that it does not matter that Defendants dispute the facts underlying the harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs-Intervenors contend that a court may determine an alleged harasser's authority regardless of whether the existence of a hostile work environment is disputed. ECF No. 103 at 2. Plaintiffs-Intervenors insist that if they prove at trial that Mr. Cruz created a hostile work environment, the previous determinations of elements of liability will ensure a more just and speedy resolution of the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. This Court agrees with Plaintiffs and finds that it may analyze each of the disputed claims and defenses without first making a decision on the alleged harassment so as to narrow the issues for trial, which is appropriate under a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Vicarious Liability of Horning Brothers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs-Intervenors respond to Defendants' summary judgment motion by arguing\n   that the undisputed facts demonstrate Horning Brothers is vicariously liable under Title VII for all of Mr. Cruz's harassment. ECF No. 78 at 11. Plaintiffs-Intervenors, joined by the State (ECF No. 65), also assert in their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment that Horning Brothers is vicariously liable as Mr. Cruz is a \"supervisor\" under Title VII. ECF No. 59 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court first addresses whether Mr. Cruz is a supervisor. The Supreme Court has determined that an \"employee is a 'supervisor' for purposes of vicarious liability under Title VII if he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Vance v. Ball State Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p424\">\n    570 U.S. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p424\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p424\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

ECF No. 59 at 6. In pre-suit interrogatories, Horning Brothers recognized Mr. Cruz \"has the authority to hire.\" ECF Nos. 59 at 7; 60 at \u00b6 38. Horning Brothers also asserted that it has \"given Hermilo Cruz the authority to hire employees during the onion packing season.\" ECF Nos. 59 at 7; 60 at \u00b6 39. Horning Brothers admitted in their answers to Plaintiffs' complaints that Mr. Cruz shared authority with the owners to determine who would be hired the following season. ECF Nos. 59 at 7; 60 at \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the hiring process for seasonal workers shows Mr. Cruz had authority to hire where interested workers signed up for employment on the \"employee sign up list.\" ECF Nos. 59 at 7; 60 at \u00b6 43; 51 at 4. Horning Brothers told Mr. Cruz how many workers to hire, and Mr. Cruz filled out those positions from those sign-up sheets. ECF Nos. 59 at 7; 60 at \u00b6 44; 51 at 4. Plaintiffs emphasize that Mr. Cruz was part of the \"final call\" in determining which workers would be rehired and ultimately controlled who would be offered employment because he made almost every hiring offer to the season onion shed employees with no review or oversight by the Hornings. ECF Nos. 59 at 7; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42, 45, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs insist that Mr. Cruz's authority to rehire former employees with little to no oversight by Horning Brothers gave him a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   authority to terminate employment. ECF Nos. 59 at 8; 60 at \u00b6 63. Plaintiffs assert that Mr. Cruz did not rehire a worker who complained about him to the Hornings or was considered a \"troublemaker.\" ECF Nos. 59 at 8; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. Employees were aware Mr. Cruz did no rehire women who complained, and they told Horning Brothers that they feared if they reported the harassment he would retaliate and not rehire them. ECF Nos. 59 at 8; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs argue that, at a minimum, the Horning Brothers effectively delegated the power to hire to Mr. Cruz because of their reliance on his substantial input and their admissions that Mr. Cruz shared authority with the owners to determine who would be hired. ECF Nos. 59 at 9; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 46-51. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   , an employer likely relies on other workers who actually interact with the affected employee, and under those circumstances \"the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the power to take tangible employment actions to the employees on whose recommendations it relies.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p424\">\n    570 U.S. at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p424\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs here then\n   contend that the Hornings relied on Mr. Cruz because they could not speak Spanish and could not recognize almost any of their seasonal employees by name or face because \"they all look alike.\" ECF No. 59 at 10-11; 60 at \u00b6 49; 61-10 at 11 (Ex. J). Whereas Mr. Cruz worked closely with the seasonal employees. ECF Nos. 59 at 11; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Cruz caused significant changes in employment status, including controlling employee hours, assigning and reassigning positions, and changing benefits. ECF No. 59 at 11. Plaintiffs emphasize that Mr. Cruz was the only person designated as the \"Onion Shed Supervisor\" in the company's employee records and submissions to the State. ECF Nos. 59 at 12; 60 at \u00b6 18. Mr. Cruz and the Hornings affirmed to the employees that Mr. Cruz was in charge of the onion shed. ECF Nos. 59 at 12; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. He had the authority to change work hours in the shed and to engage workers for additional time to clean after the usual packing shed hours, thereby actually giving more hours and wages only to certain employees. ECF Nos. 59 at 12; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 71-75. Mr. Cruz had the authority to approve or deny requests for time off. ECF Nos. 59 at 12; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 76-79. He could assign seasonal employees to positions on the packing line, including positions with the primary duty of removing rotten onions. ECF Nos. 59 at 12; 60 at \u00b6\u00b6 80-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants respond that Horning Brothers have denied that they granted Mr. Cruz supervisory authority. ECF Nos. 73 at 5; 97 at 3. Mr. Cruz has also denied that he had authority to hire, fire, promote, demote, discipline, raise, or reduce any worker's pay or benefits or set work hours. ECF Nos. 73 at 5; 74 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; 97 at 3. Defendants argue that actual or apparent authority can only come from Horning Brothers and it does not matter what Mr. Cruz or any other party says about his authority. ECF No. 73 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court finds that Mr. Cruz is a supervisor. In response to an interrogatory, Horning Brothers stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Allen, Greg, and Warren have given Hermilo Cruz the authority to hire employees during the onion packing season as needed in order to replace employees who have quit.

ECF No. 61-10 at 24 (Ex. J). Warren Horning also noted that Mr. Cruz approved requests for time off from workers in the shed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. He stated that Mr. Cruz had a role in or was responsible for disciplining sorters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.

Mr. Cruz further admitted that \"the owners and Defendants Cruz would determine who would be offered work the following season based on the needs of the company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Allen Horning's response to the HRC complaint also identified Mr. Cruz as \"the supervisor in the onion packing shed.\" ECF No. 64-28 at 3 (Ex. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants state that Allen or Greg Horning asked Mr. Cruz \"to call the workers on the sign-up sheet until they had commitments from enough workers to fill their staffing needs.\" ECF No. 51 at 4. Yet, Defendants adamantly insist that Mr. Cruz did not have the authority to hire, fire, promote, demote, discipline, or raise or reduce any employee's pay or benefits. ECF Nos. 51 at 5; 52 at \u00b6 4. In a supplemental declaration, Mr. Cruz asserts that he does not have this authority. ECF No. 74 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In light of the evidence and Defendants' own admissions, the Court is not persuaded by Defendants bare assertions that Mr. Cruz did not have supervisory authority. Defendants admit in all of their answers that Mr. Cruz is a supervisor. Even if Defendants' previous assertions of Mr. Cruz as supervisor is irrelevant, Horning Brothers still concede that Mr. Cruz had the authority to hire employees and move employees around the shed which constitutes supervisor authority under its \"specific legal meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 97 at 3. Warren Horning also admitted that Mr. Cruz hired onion sorters from the sign-up sheet list, approved requests for time off, disciplined employees, and was part of the final call to rehire employees. While Horning Brothers asserted that Mr. Cruz did not have authority to fire employees, the Court finds this one action insufficient to overcome supervisor liability when Mr. Cruz still had the authority to hire, reassign, and change employees' responsibilities. These actions constitute a tangible employment action as they are significant changes in employment status. Defendants' conclusory assertion of non-liability is insufficient. The Court finds there is no genuine dispute, and Mr. Cruz is a supervisor in light of Defendants' concessions and the overwhelming evidence in the record. The Court finds that Horning Brothers is then vicariously liable for the actions of Mr. Cruz as a supervisor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p424\">\n    570 U.S. at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698473\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/421/#p424\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     -\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants insist that they are entitled to summary judgment on their\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   defense even if Mr. Cruz is a supervisor.

ECF Nos. 62 at 17; 102 at 12-13. In August 2015, Roxana Rodriguez de Alfaro filed a detailed complaint against Horning Brothers with the HRC alleging sexual harassment by Mr. Cruz. ECF Nos. 62 at 18; 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Plaintiffs emphasize that Horning Brothers merely spoke with Mr. Cruz, but conducted no investigation, interviewed no other employees, provided not training to Mr. Cruz or other employees, made no changes to its harassment policy or to Mr. Cruz's job duties, and did not discipline Mr. Cruz in any way. ECF Nos. 62 at 18-19; 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 49-56. After the State served an investigation subpoena citing \"sexual harassment,\" Horning Brothers spoke to Mr. Cruz, but again conducted no investigation, provided no training, made no changes to its policies or Mr. Cruz's supervisory duties, and imposed no discipline. ECF Nos. 62 at 19; 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 58-64. On February 10, 2017, the Attorney General's Office advised Horning Brothers of its intent to file suit and on March 2, 2017, Horning Brothers commenced an internal inquiry. ECF Nos. 62 at 19; 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 70-72. The State notes that this inquiry occurred seventeen months after it acknowledged receipt of the HRC complaint, which is not prompt corrective action. ECF Nos. 62 at 19; 63 at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants respond that\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   and the EEOC guidelines specifically acknowledge that a small employer that regularly interacts with its employees and effectively communicates that harassment will not be tolerated need not even have a written\n   harassment policy. ECF Nos. 73 at 8; 51 at 13; 97 at 6. Additionally, Defendants argue that Roxana Rodriguez de Alfaro's complaint was made six months after she quit, which cannot make Horning Brothers liable as a matter of law for every instance of sexual harassment that allegedly occurred after that complaint. ECF No. 73 at 8. Defendants insist that because the complaint alleged sexual harassment of only one employee who quit without report it to the Hornings, they handled the complaint appropriately given the importance of confidentiality and that they heard nothing further from the HRC on this matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.

While Horning Brothers disseminated a harassment policy at its safety meetings, this policy was ineffective at communicating a prohibition of sexual harassment and an effective complaint procedure. The policy does not mention sexual harassment or a ban on retaliation, nor does the evidence show that the Hornings further clarified the policy at the meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Hornings' communication of the policy was also ineffective as Mr. Cruz often interpreted the policy to the mainly Spanish-speaking seasonal employees, but not \"word-for-word\" and it is unclear if the employees actually understood the policy. When asked if she remembered Mr. Cruz saying anything like Item No. 11, Roxana Rodriguez de Alfaro testified, \"No, I don't remember that. He didn't speak about that, only about safety, but not about harassment.\" ECF No. 64-14 at 6 (Ex. 14). Yasmin Cabrera Navarro stated, \"No, because what he said was that if any worker bothered you, you could report that person to the bosses. But I don't remember him saying if they're harassing you.\" ECF No. 64-12 at 6 (Ex. 14). Claudia Arballo also responded, \"No, I don't remember that one.... We were just told that if there was a problem or something, that the father was there and Greg and Allen and Don Hermilo.\" ECF No. 64-16 at 5 (Ex. 16). Rangel Neri stated, \"There were meetings conducted by the Hornings. At the meetings, they explained the workplace safety and behavior rules. Hermilo interpreted for them. I don't remember that they explained how one reports workplace discrimination or sexual abuse.\" ECF No. 61-28 at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Yet, Horning Brothers asserts that Socorro Diaz Silvas, Yasmin Cabrera Navarro, and Roxana Rodriguez de Alfaro were aware of reporting procedures. ECF No. 97 at 7-8. Socorro Diaz Silvas testified that \"not much was said\" about Item No. 11. ECF No. 100-1 at 10 (Ex. I). Yasmin Cabrera Navarro stated that she remembered Item No. 11, but clarified that \"we were never told, [i]f your foreman bothers you, then report it to your foreman so he can go with you to report it. I mean, there was no way to report it.\" ECF No. 100-3 at 16 (Ex. III). Roxana Rodriguez de Alfaro testified that Mr. Cruz did not speak about harassment, as discussed above. ECF No. 100-5 at 10-11 (Ex. V). This \"awareness of reporting procedures\" does not show an awareness of reporting sexual harassment, especially harassment conducted by a foreman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 97 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This testimony is persuasive in showing that reading the policy at the safety meeting was an ineffective mechanism to prevent and correct sexual harassment, even under the more accommodating standard\n   for small businesses. Many of the employees were not aware of a sexual harassment or discrimination policy and the mechanisms to report such harassment. Horning Brothers' reporting policy was also ineffective where alleged victims had to bring their own interpreter or speak to Mr. Cruz, as the Horning family did not speak Spanish.

While the complaint only involved one alleged victim who was no longer employed by Horning Brothers, the alleged harasser was still employed by Horning Brothers and Defendants are then not excused from taking prompt corrective action besides merely speaking with Mr. Cruz.

Yesica Cabrera Navarro testified that Warren Horning responded that if she was comfortable working there, she could stay, and if she was not, she could make the decision to leave. ECF Nos. 64-13 at 17 (Ex. 13); 75 at 20; 78 at 17. Mr. Cruz was present during this conversation. ECF Nos. 75 at 20; 76 at \u00b6 285; 78 at 17; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 130-32. Within days of her complaint, Mr. Cruz removed\n   Yesica Cabrera Navarro from a work station he knew was tolerable for her back, given a recent injury, and transferred her to a work station that caused her pain.

ECF No. 75 at 21. Plaintiffs-Intervenors argue that a genuine dispute of material facts exists as to whether Yesica Cabrera Navarro engaged in protected activity, such as her testimony and testimony of other employees who were aware of her complaint. ECF Nos. 78 at 18; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 53, 125-36, 182, 206, 215. Plaintiffs-Intervenors contend that the short time between her complaint, reassignment, and Mr. Cruz's verbal abuse indicate her protected activity was a motivating factor for the adverse action. ECF No. 78 at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court finds there is a material question of fact as to whether Defendants retaliated against Yesica Cabrera Navarro for reporting Mr. Cruz's alleged sexual harassment. The disputed evidence shows that she reported the sexual harassment to Warren Horning while Mr. Cruz was in the room, and was therefore aware of the complaint. Days later she was subjected to a transfer and alleged verbal abuse, likely constituting an adverse employment action. This short amount of time and Mr. Cruz's knowledge of the complaint likely creates a causal link. The Court is not persuaded by Defendants' argument that not a single Plaintiff reported sexual harassment when Yesica Cabrera Navarro asserts that she made a complaint in December 2014 and Warren Horning recalls having a conversation with Jose Garay and a female employee. ECF No. 64-11 at 10 (Ex. 11). While Horning Brothers argue that Yesica Cabrera Navarro complained about pain and not getting time off, this conflicting testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact and summary judgment is not appropriate. The Court finds there is a genuine issue of material fact whether Yesica Cabrera Navarro complained to Warren Horning and whether Mr. Cruz's actions constitute an adverse action because of this complaint.

Merely because Defendants assert that they have never terminated an employee does not preclude constructive discharge, as Plaintiffs-Intervenors may have felt compelled to leave due to their treatment. The Court is not persuaded that no Plaintiff complained about sexual harassment, as previously discussed Yesica Cabrera Navarro possibly complained to Warren Horning and Roxana Rodriguez de Alfaro filed an HRC complaint. While Horning Brothers deny that Yesica Cabrera Navarro reported sexual harassment, the conflicting testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact. The disputed evidence creates a material issue of fact as to whether these Plaintiffs-Intervenors suffered intolerable working conditions where a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign in light of the testimony regarding unwanted touching and comments.

Yet, the Supreme Court has held that in the punitive damages context, \"an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the employer's 'good faith efforts to comply with Title VII.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kolstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248163\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/526/#p535\">\n    527 U.S. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248163\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/526/#p535\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Here, Defendants contend that given the utter lack of evidence that Horning Brothers was aware of the sexual harassment or that any of their employment practices were illegal under federal law, Plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages must be dismissed. ECF Nos. 51 at 21; 97 at 11. The State responds that Defendants did not take seriously and immediately address complaints of harassment, and took no corrective action after receiving at least three separate notices of harassment. ECF No. 75 at 25. The Horning Brothers allowed Mr. Cruz's harassment to continue unchecked. ECF No. 75 at 25. Plaintiffs-Intervenors also respond that they have established the essential elements for intentional discrimination claims, creating a basis for punitive damages. ECF No. 78 at 21. Plaintiffs-Intervenors emphasize that the Horning Brothers were on notice of Mr. Cruz's sexual harassment as early as August 2015 and took no corrective action. ECF No. 78 at 21; 79 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 286-317. They insist that Defendants have no defense to punitive damages because Horning Brothers did not implement an anti-discrimination policy in good faith and failed to remedy Mr. Cruz's harassment. ECF No. 78 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Court determines that Plaintiffs may assert a claim for punitive damages under Title VII. As previously discussed, it is possible that Horning Brothers was aware of the alleged sexual harassment because of the three complaints. Horning Brothers failed to address and investigate the complaints, as previously discussed. Plaintiffs establish that there is a material question of fact as to whether Horning Brothers knew that it discriminated in the face of the perceived risk that its actions violate federal law. Plaintiffs show that Horning Brothers may have not made a good faith effort to comply with Title VII because they did not investigate or seek to remedy these claims of sexual harassment, and made no changes to their harassment policy or Mr. Cruz's supervisory position. Plaintiffs create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Horning Brothers were malicious or recklessly indifferent to Mr. Cruz's noticed and alleged sexual harassment when they failed to take any action besides speaking with Mr. Cruz regarding the HRC complaint. Defendants fail to show a good faith effort to comply with Title VII and it is then a question of fact as to whether they are vicariously liable for punitive damages in regards to Mr. Cruz's actions. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants' request for\n   summary judgment on Plaintiffs' punitive damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Plaintiffs' Motions for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Court has already discussed and granted Plaintiffs-Intervenors' requests for summary judgment on their vicarious liability claim under Title VII by finding Mr. Cruz a supervisor, their strict liability WLAD claim as Mr. Cruz constitutes a manager, and that\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   does not bar their WLAD strict liability claim. The Court then grants Plaintiffs-Intervenors' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. ECF No. 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Court has also already granted the State's request for summary judgment on Defendants'\n   <em>\n    Ellerth\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher\n   </em>\n   defense and the State's only remaining argument is that Horning Brothers is liable for any harassment occurring after it received actual notice of a sexual harassment complaint from the HRC. ECF No. 62 at 20. The State argues that the Court should, at a minimum, grant summary judgment on the issue of employer liability for all harassment occurring after September 24, 2015, when Horning Brothers received the HRC complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248163\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/526/#p535\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Court has already found that Horning Brothers is liable for Mr. Cruz's actions as a supervisor, the Court need not address whether Horning Brothers would also have company liability, even though it is likely that this liability would also attach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-25. The Court then finds that as Horning Brothers is already liable for Mr. Cruz's actions, the Court need not address this further claim for liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   1.
