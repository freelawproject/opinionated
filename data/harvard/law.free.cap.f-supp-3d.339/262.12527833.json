Following that recall, New GM recalled millions of other vehicles, some for ignition switch-related defects and some for other defects. In this litigation, Plaintiffs seek recovery on behalf of a broad putative class of GM car owners and lessors whose vehicles were subject to those recalls, arguing that they have been harmed by, among other things, a drop in their vehicles' value due to the ignition switch defect and other defects. Their operative complaint - the Fifth Amended Consolidated Complaint or \"5ACC\" (Docket No. 4838) - exceeds 1700 pages and 7400 paragraphs, and includes claims relating to the ignition-switch defect and various other alleged defects under state law brought by named Plaintiffs in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In conjunction with the parties, the Court decided early on not to entertain a motion to dismiss all of the Plaintiffs' economic loss claims at once - given, among other things, the number and scope of those claims; the possibility that the litigation would be materially affected by parallel proceedings in (and arising out of) bankruptcy court; and the likelihood that the parties could ultimately agree upon how the Court's rulings as to some state law claims would apply to others, saving the need for the parties to brief and the Court to decide the same issues in fifty-one different jurisdictions. In an Opinion and Order filed on July 15, 2016, with respect to the then-operative Third Amended Consolidated Complaint (\"TACC\"), the Court ruled on the validity of Plaintiffs' claims in eight jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gen. Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-MD-2543 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203920353\">\n    2016 WL 3920353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *36 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    TACC Op.\n   </em>\n   \"). A little less than one year later, the Court issued another Opinion and Order (later modified), with respect to the then-operative Fourth Amended Consolidated Complaint (\"FACC\"), addressing the validity of Plaintiffs' claims in another eight jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gen. Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273646\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/372/#p423\">\n    257 F.Supp.3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    FACC Op.\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <em>\n    modified on reconsideration\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-MC-2543 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203443623\">\n    2017 WL 3443623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    FACC Supp. Op.\n   </em>\n   \"). Plaintiffs later filed the Fifth Amended Consolidated Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In MDL Order No. 131, entered on August 30, 2017, the Court directed the parties to \"meet and confer regarding the application of the Court's prior motion to dismiss opinions on the issues of (i) unjust enrichment, (ii) incidental damages, and (iii) manifest defect\" to the jurisdictions that had not been the subject of prior rulings by the Court - a total of thirty-five jurisdictions for the issues of unjust enrichment and manifest defect and forty-seven jurisdictions for the issue of incidental damages. (Docket No. 4499, \u00b6 4). That process yielded agreement, and a stipulation (Docket No. 5099 (\"Parties' Stipulation\") ), with respect to application of the Court's prior opinions to some issues in some of the remaining jurisdictions - albeit many fewer issues in many fewer jurisdictions than the Court had hoped. Thereafter, the parties submitted lengthy\n   briefs addressing the disputes that remained: (1) whether \"manifest defect\" is required for Plaintiffs to recover for their economic losses\n   <em>\n    under the laws of twenty-seven jurisdictions\n   </em>\n   ; (2) whether Plaintiffs can recover damages for their \"lost time\" (for example, time lost in repairing their vehicles)\n   <em>\n    under the laws of forty-seven jurisdictions\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) whether the existence of a contract or an adequate legal remedy bars Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims\n   <em>\n    under the laws of ten jurisdictions.\n   </em>\n   (Docket Nos. 5098, 5101, 5191, 5192).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this Opinion and Order, the Court resolves those disputes - no easy task given the sheer number of issues and jurisdictions in dispute, the fact that the relevant law in many of jurisdictions is unsettled or in conflict, and because \"subtle differences in state law can dictate different results for plaintiffs in different jurisdictions.\"\n   <em>\n    TACC Op.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203920353\">\n    2016 WL 3920353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *18. Nevertheless, for the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that manifestation is not required for any of claims and jurisdictions that remain in dispute; that, in all but a few of the jurisdictions that remain in dispute, Plaintiffs cannot recover for lost \"free\" or \"personal\" time, but can recover for lost time in the form of lost earnings or wages; and that Plaintiffs in most of the jurisdictions in dispute cannot bring unjust enrichment claims where the subject matter is covered by a valid and enforceable contract or there is an adequate remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In applying the law of a state, the pronouncement of the state's highest court \"is to be accepted by federal courts as defining state law.\"\n   <em>\n    West v.

When faced with an unsettled question of state statutory interpretation, a federal court should consider \"the statutory language, pertinent legislative history, the statutory scheme set in historical context, how the statute can be woven into the state law with the least distortion of the total fabric, state decisional law, and federal cases which construe the state statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Bensmiller v.

The Court will address each of those issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Manifestation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Putative class actions \"alleging neither personal injury nor property damages, but economic loss stemming from purchase of a product\" with an unmanifested defect have become increasingly common in the automotive, pharmaceutical, and other industries. 1 McLaughlin on Class Actions \u00a7 5:56 (14th ed.). In its previous Opinions, the Court resolved the question of whether Plaintiffs could pursue economic loss claims for defects if those defects never manifested themselves under the laws of sixteen jurisdictions. In its Opinion resolving New GM's motion to dismiss the Fourth Amended Consolidated Complaint, the Court also signaled its agreement with a prominent treatise that the \"majority view is that there is no legally cognizable injury in a product defect case, regardless of whether the claim is for fraud, violation of consumer protection statutes, breach of warranty, or any other theory, unless the alleged defect has manifested itself in the product used by the claimant.\"\n   <em>\n    FACC Op.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273646\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/372/#p423\">\n    257 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   423 (citing 1 McLaughlin on Class Actions \u00a7 5:56 ). But neither this Court's nor the treatise's conclusion was based on a comprehensive analysis of the law of the remaining states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Having now engaged in such an analysis of the law in twenty-seven states, covering three different kinds of claims (statutory consumer protection, common-law fraud, and implied warranty), the Court can no longer say with confidence that, across the states, the \"majority view\" is that manifestation is required to state claims for fraud, violations of consumer protection statutes, and breaches of warranty. Indeed, for every disputed claim in every disputed state, the Court concludes that manifestation is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is due in part to the Court's determination that, in the absence of state law to the contrary, there is no legal or logical ground to bar Plaintiffs' recovery if they can prove that they suffered economic loss. If Plaintiffs paid\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   for their cars and can prove that their cars are now worth\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   minus\n   <em>\n    y\n   </em>\n   as the result of the alleged defects, it is arbitrary to prevent them from recovering the difference between\n   <em>\n    x\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    y\n   </em>\n   simply because the defect did not manifest itself in property damage or personal injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steven R. Swanson,\n   <em>\n    The Citadel\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Survives a Naval Bombardment: A Policy Analysis of the Economic Loss Doctrine\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Citadel\n   </em>\n   \"), 12 TUL. MAR. L.J. 135, 140 (1987) (\"If the product is not worth what it was rep[r]esented to be, the purchaser has been harmed to the extent of the decrease in value.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the Court's view, the courts that have adopted a manifestation requirement often do so as a proxy for proof of actual defect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briehl v. Gen. Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11628865\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/172/623/#p626\">\n    172 F.3d 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626 (8th Cir. 1999) (\"The Plaintiffs do not allege that the [brake system] is incapable of stopping the vehicles or that [the brake system] has violated any national safety standards.\"). But while manifestation may be helpful in proving the presence of a defect, it does not follow that recovery for economic loss should turn on whether the defect also caused property or personal damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Swanson,\n   <em>\n    Citadel\n   </em>\n   , 12 TUL. MAR. L.J. at 141. It has also been suggested that, without manifestation, damages for economic loss are too speculative or that consumers did in fact get the benefit of their bargain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moin A. Yahya,\n   <em>\n    Can I Sue Without Being Injured?: Why the Benefit of the Bargain Theory for Product Liability Is Bad Law and Bad Economics\n   </em>\n   , 3 GEO. J.L. &amp; PUB. POL'Y 83, 114 (2005) (casting doubt on the\n   reliability of economic analysis and questioning whether consumers fundamentally alter their view of a product on the knowledge that there is some chance of harm); Sheila B. Scheuerman,\n   <em>\n    Against Liability for Private Risk-Exposure\n   </em>\n   , 35 HARV. J.L. &amp; PUB. POL'Y 681, 706 (2012) (\"[C]ourts reason that if the product has so far worked as promised, then consumers have received the benefit of their bargain.\"). But there is no reason to think that the calculation of economic damages is any more reliable when a defect happens also to have caused personal or property damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Swanson,\n   <em>\n    Citadel\n   </em>\n   , 12 TUL. MAR. L.J. at 171. And if a plaintiff can demonstrate that public knowledge of a defect\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   cause the value of her vehicle to drop, and that her vehicle is consequently worth less than what she had bargained for, she has demonstrated that she lost the benefit of her bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In the final analysis, Plaintiffs may not be able to prove that their vehicles contained defects and that those defects actually caused them economic losses. But Plaintiffs allege the existence of defects and that, through expert analyses, they can demonstrate economic losses. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 5ACC \u00b6\u00b6 397, 827-67). At this stage of the proceedings, the Court accepts the truth of those allegations and assertions, and - absent state law to the contrary - will not impose a manifestation requirement as a proxy for evidence to support them. With that in mind, the Court proceeds state by state and addresses whether manifestation is required in each substantive area: statutory consumer protection, common-law fraud, and implied warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    1. State Consumer Protection Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court begins with Plaintiffs' claims under state consumer protection laws. For convenience, the Court divides the applicable states into two categories: first, those that have broad remedial statutes and for which neither New GM nor the Court has found case law suggesting that the state would require manifestation; and, second, those that require a showing of \"actual damages.\" The Court will address each category in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Broad Remedial Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, eight states in dispute have consumer protection statutes that courts have held are remedial nature or must be liberally construed and for which neither New GM nor the Court has found case law suggesting that the state would require manifestation.

Thus, in a case involving an automobile sold as \"new\" even though it had been in a collision, the West Virginia Supreme Court affirmed a jury verdict for fraud where \"the jury was presented with expert testimony on the difference in value of the automobile if it had been in a collision versus if it had not been damaged.\"\n   <em>\n    Horan v.

In arguing that manifestation is required, New GM cites\n   <em>\n    Belville I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Belville II\n   </em>\n   , in which the Southern District of West Virginia dismissed diminished value claims due to a vehicle's acceleration defect because \"only two of the twenty Plaintiffs named in the Complaint allege they actually experienced a sudden unintended acceleration, and neither of those Plaintiffs alleges they suffered any personal injuries or property damage as a result of those events.\"\n   <em>\n    Belville I\n   </em>\n   , 13 F.Supp.3d at 535 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belville II\n   </em>\n   , 60 F.Supp.3d at 699-700. The\n   <em>\n    Belville\n   </em>\n   Court, however, did not actually address how West Virginia courts would treat common-law fraud: The plaintiffs brought common-law fraud claims under the laws of Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Virginia - but\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   under the law of West Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belville I\n   </em>\n   , 13 F.Supp.3d at 531 n.2. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Belville\n   </em>\n   Court did not analyze\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   state decisional law in dismissing the plaintiffs' fraud claims.\n   <em>\n    Belville II\n   </em>\n   , 60 F.Supp.3d at 699-700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Implied Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Finally, the Court turns to Plaintiffs' implied warranty claims. This Court previously rejected New GM's argument that manifestation was required for an implied warranty claim under Michigan law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FACC Op.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273646\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/372/#p423\">\n    257 F.Supp.3d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court based that decision on the fact that the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\"), which has been adopted by Michigan, \" 'expressly provides' that a claim for the breach of an implied warranty 'accrues when the breach occurs' and that 'there is no requirement that [p]laintiffs demonstrate any injury to their person or property as a result of the breach, but only that they purchased an unmerchantable product.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273646\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/372/#p423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Bridgestone\\Firestone, Inc.

In the absence of contrary authority, that decision compels the Court to reject New GM's manifestation argument in any state that has adopted the UCC provision that \"[a] cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Alaska%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2045.02.725\">\n    Alaska Stat. \u00a7 45.02.725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the UCC provides for benefit-of-the-bargain damages, which, in the case of implied warranty as for fraud, is compelling evidence that manifestation is not required absent contrary authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   New GM points instead to the Court's prior conclusion that manifestation is required for an implied warranty claim under Pennsylvania law. (New GM Br. 24-25). That conclusion was based in part on the fact that a plaintiff must prove that the product was \"defective\" to make out the last two elements of an implied warranty claim in Pennsylvania: \"a causal connection between the defendant's breach and the plaintiff's injury,\" and \"the extent of loss proximately caused by the defendant's breach.\"\n   <em>\n    FACC Op.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273646\" index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/372/#p423\">\n    257 F.Supp.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Significantly, however, Pennsylvania's implied warranty statute does not follow the relevant UCC provisions discussed above. Moreover, the Court found Pennsylvania case law that clearly suggested a manifestation requirement for implied warranty claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273646\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/372/#p423\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Zwiercan v.

In arguing for a manifestation requirement, New GM once again cites the\n   <em>\n    Belville\n   </em>\n   cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belville I\n   </em>\n   , 13 F.Supp.3d at 542 ;\n   <em>\n    Belville II\n   </em>\n   , 60 F.Supp.3d at 700. As with common-law fraud, however, the\n   <em>\n    Belville\n   </em>\n   court did not specifically analyze West Virginia law in concluding that the state required manifestation for an implied warranty claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belville I\n   </em>\n   , 13 F.Supp.3d at 535 (citing a number of federal court opinions, including\n   <em>\n    Briehl\n   </em>\n   , and a few state court opinions - but only from Maryland, New York, California, and Alabama - to hold that warranty claims under the laws of West Virginia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin would all require manifestation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Lost Time\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Court turns next to the issue of whether, under the laws of forty-seven different states, Plaintiffs can recover \"loss of time\" damages for their consumer protection, common-law fraud, and breach of implied warranty claims. Traditionally, damages for \"loss of time\" have been synonymous with \"some loss of advantages, benefits, or revenues that might have been produced by the profitable use and employment of such time.\" 25 C.J.S. Damages \u00a7 52. In other words, recovery for lost time has been connected to loss of earnings, wages, or other income, turning on whether one has lost time that one might otherwise have used to one's profit. New GM concedes that in nearly every state, Plaintiffs may recover for \"lost time\" understood as lost earnings or income. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   New GM Br. 35 (\"[D]ozens of state court decisions are buttressed by federal court opinions holding that lost time is not recoverable unless, at a minimum, the plaintiff proves a direct loss of income.\") ). But Plaintiffs define lost time more broadly and seek recovery not only for lost earnings or income, but also for lost\n   <em>\n    free\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   time. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 5ACC, \u00b6 1219 (alleging that Plaintiffs \"had to spend their time and money to bring their Defective Vehicles in for repair\"); New GM Br. 30 (noting that Plaintiffs' expert alleges damages based on \"loss of income (or loss of free time)\" and that \"obtaining the repair\" prevented plaintiffs \"from another desired activity\" (quoting E. Manuel Report \u00b6\u00b6 27, 63) ) ). New GM insists that recovery for lost free or personal time is not recognized in any of the forty-seven states at issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   New GM Br. 30-31). Plaintiffs contend that, drawing all inferences in their favor, their requests for lost-time damages \"cannot now be dismissed as a matter of law.\" (Docket No. 5192 (\"Pls.' Resp.\"), at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   On the whole, New GM has the better of the argument. The Court finds that, as a matter of law, the overwhelming majority of states adhere to the view that lost-time damages are the equivalent of lost earnings or income. Indeed, \"loss of time\" appears to be something of a term of art: Courts often use the term without defining it, suggesting a broadly recognized and well-established meaning. Put another way, most states do not treat lost personal time as a compensable form of injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leonard E. Gross,\n   <em>\n    Time and Tide Wait for No Man: Should Lost Personal Time Be Compensable?\n   </em>\n   , 33 RUTGERS L.J. 683, 684-85 (2002) (noting that historically courts have been \"loath to award damages for lost personal time in breach of contract cases and in cases involving tortious interference with personal property\"). The unwillingness to award damages for lost personal time may in part be a legacy of an era when personal time was not valued as highly as it is today,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 684, but the role of a federal court sitting in diversity is to determine what state law is, not to change it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Moreover, public policy counsels against compensating for lost personal time. Some courts have suggested, for example, that awarding compensation for lost time on the theory that \"time is money\" invites litigation and prioritizes less-worthy claims over the more worthy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleef v. Goodman Mfg. Co., L.P.\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:15-CV-00176 (BSM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204512200\">\n    2015 WL 4512200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D.

Thus, to say that damages for lost time are recoverable in a products liability action makes no sense, and it is not commercially practicable.\");\n   <em>\n    see also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cargill, Inc. v.

But we doubt that damages would be recoverable against the negligent driver in favor of truckers or contract carriers who suffered provable losses because of the delay or to the wage earner who was forced to 'clock in' an hour late.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   In many instances, Plaintiffs argue that a state would award damages for lost free time based on authority from the state holding that plaintiffs may recover incidental, actual, or consequential damages. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 5101 (\"Pls.' Br.\"), at 52 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gyldenvand v.

But that argument begs the question whether a state has recognized lost personal time as a compensable form of damages. Put another way, the authorities upon which Plaintiffs rely do not discuss, let alone answer, the question of whether lost free time falls within the scope of legally cognizable incidental, actual, or consequential damages that may be recovered. In fact, in at least some of the jurisdictions at issue, the law allows for the recovery of incidental or consequential damages, such as loss of earnings, yet courts have nevertheless held that that lost personal time is not compensable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hannaford Bros.

It follows, as a matter of both logic and law, that a state's recognition of incidental, actual, or consequential damages, by itself, does not support a holding that the state recognizes lost free time as compensable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The Court begins with those states that have limited recovery for lost-time damages to lost earnings or their equivalent. Then, the Court turns to whether a person may recover for time lost from performing unpaid household work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the Court considers the few states where, often as a result of consumer protection statutes that provide for statutory damages and do not limit recovery to \"loss of money or property,\" Plaintiffs may recover under a more expansive definition of lost time for at least some of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Lost Time as Lost Earnings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   As noted, the Court begins with states that have limited recovery for lost-time damages to lost earnings or income. Where a state has never considered lost personal time to be compensable, and the Court finds no reason to do otherwise, the Court concludes that the narrow construction of lost time applies across all substantive areas of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Court need not and does not generally differentiate between lost-time damages in the context of statutory consumer protection, common-law fraud, or implied warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Based on the Court's research, forty-one of the contested states limit lost time damages to lost income or earnings. The following is a list of those states along with relevant authority demonstrating that the state's courts have traditionally treated lost time as lost income. Where the Court does not cite or discuss case law suggesting that a plaintiff may recover for lost\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   time (as opposed to lost time from work or the pecuniary equivalent), the Court has found no such case law.

Of these states, Oklahoma appears to be the most permissive, as there is authority indicating that a plaintiff may recover for lost free time under both the state's consumer protection statute and at common law. In the other five states, damages for lost free time do not appear to be available with respect to Plaintiffs' common-law claims of fraud and implied warranty; but there is authority supporting such damages under the states' consumer-protection statutes.

Strictly speaking, however, the question presented in\n   <em>\n    Tibbetts\n   </em>\n   was whether the plaintiffs, who prevailed at trial but were awarded zero damages, were entitled to attorney's fees; thus, the court did not have occasion to survey the full range of damages available under the Oklahoma CPA. Notably, the court assumed without deciding that plaintiffs were correct in arguing (in reliance on\n   <em>\n    Brashears\n   </em>\n   ) \"that monetary damages may be awarded in a private [Oklahoma CPA] case for things such as loss of time, inconvenience, and travel and telephone expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096438\" index=\"886\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/77/1042/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1050 n.10.

The case law on damages under the Utah CSPA is sparse, but the Utah Court of Appeals engaged in a thorough analysis of the statutory language and concluded that the statute's provision of \"$2,000\" for a \"loss\" in violation of the Utah CSPA was \"essentially a civil penalty in the amount of $2000 where the consumer's actual damages may otherwise be de minimis, speculative, or too difficult to prove, but where the consumer can show that a loss has been suffered as a result of a violation of the [Utah CSPA].\"\n   <em>\n    Andreason v.

Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   The final issue addressed by the parties is whether Plaintiffs may bring\n   claims for unjust enrichment. As it did with respect to the jurisdictions at issue in the earlier motions to dismiss, New GM raises two kinds of arguments with respect to those claims: first, that a plaintiff may not maintain an unjust enrichment claim where there exists a valid contract (such as a warranty) and, second, that a plaintiff may not maintain an unjust enrichment claim where there is an adequate remedy at law, whether it sounds in contract, fraud, or tort. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   New GM Br. 49-55). Notably, Plaintiffs concede that they are barred from bringing unjust enrichment claims in the majority of remaining states. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Parties' Stipulation). Thus, \"only\" ten states remain in dispute: Arizona, Connecticut, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, West Virginia. The Court concludes that New GM's arguments are largely right. First, in nine out of the ten states (all but Connecticut), a plaintiff may plead \"unjust enrichment\" in the alternative only where the validity or enforceability of a contract is in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   And second, in seven out of the ten states (all but Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island), a plaintiff may not maintain an unjust enrichment claim if he or she has an adequate remedy at law.

Second, for all but six of the jurisdictions in dispute, the Court finds that Plaintiffs may recover lost-time damages where \"lost time\" is understood as lost earnings or its equivalent, but not where \"lost time\" is understood as \"lost personal time.\" In Colorado, New York, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, however, Plaintiffs may also recover lost personal time under the states' consumer protection statutes, and in Oklahoma, Plaintiffs may recover lost personal time for all claims. Finally, in every one of the ten still-disputed jurisdictions other than Connecticut, a plaintiff may plead unjust enrichment in the alternative only where the validity or enforceability of a contract is in question, and in seven out of the ten jurisdictions (all but Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island), a plaintiff may not maintain an unjust enrichment claim if he or she has an adequate remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   Attached as Exhibit A is a chart summarizing the Court's conclusions of law for all jurisdictions.
