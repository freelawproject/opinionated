For the reasons set forth below, the Motion for Judgment on\n   the Pleadings is granted in part and denied in part, and the Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in August 2015, naming the United States, President Barack Obama, and the heads of numerous executive agencies (collectively, \"federal defendants\") as defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that federal defendants have known for more than fifty years that carbon dioxide (\"CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   \") produced by the industrial scale burning of fossil fuels was \"causing global warming and dangerous climate change, and that continuing to bum fossil fuels would destabilize the climate system on which present and future generations of our nation depend for their wellbeing and survival.\" First Am. Compl. \u00b6 1. Plaintiffs further allege that federal defendants have long \"known of the unusually dangerous risks of harm to human life, liberty, and property that would be caused by continued fossil fuel burning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Plaintiffs assert that, rather than responding to this knowledge by \"implement[ing] a rational course of effective action to phase out carbon pollution,\" federal defendants \"have continued to permit, authorize, and subsidize fossil fuel extraction, development, consumption and exportation[,]\" thereby \"deliberately allow[ing] atmospheric CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   concentrations to escalate to levels unprecedented in human history[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that federal defendants' policy on fossil fuels deprives plaintiffs of life, liberty, and property without due process of law; impermissibly discriminates against \"young citizens, who will disproportionately experience the destabilized climate system in our country[;]\" and fails to live up to federal defendants' obligations to hold certain essential natural resources in trust for the benefit of all citizens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, asserting that there is \"an extremely limited amount of time to preserve a habitable climate system for our country\" before \"the warming of our nation will become locked in or rendered increasingly severe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2015, federal defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). (doc. 27) Federal defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue; that plaintiffs' public trust claims failed as a matter of law because the public trust doctrine does not apply to the federal government; that plaintiffs' equal protection claims could not proceed because plaintiffs are not members of a protected class and the government's energy and climate policies have a rational basis; and that plaintiffs' due process claims were deficient because they had not alleged violation of a fundamental right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also in November 2015, three national trade organizations-the National Association of Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute, and American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers (collectively, \"intervenor-defendants\")-moved to intervene under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a) and dismiss the complaint. (doc. 14 &amp; 19) Like federal defendants, intervenor-defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. Intervenor defendants also argued that plaintiffs had failed to identify a cognizable cause of action and that dismissal was required because the\n   case presented non-justiciable political questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2016, Magistrate Judge Coffin granted intervenor-defendants' motion to intervene.\n   <em>\n    Juliana v.

Those admissions and federal defendants' other filings make clear that plaintiffs and federal defendants agree on the following contentions: climate change is happening, is caused in significant part by humans, specifically human induced fossil fuel combustion, and poses a \"monumental\" danger to Americans' health and welfare.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juliana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271893\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/1224/#p1276\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1234 n.3 (quoting federal defendants' objections to Judge Coffin's F &amp; R recommending denial of the motions to dismiss).

(doc. 120 &amp; 122) That same day, federal defendants sought a stay of proceedings pending this Court's resolution of the motion to certify for interlocutory appeal and the Ninth Circuit's resolution of that proposed appeal. (doc. 121) In April 2017, Judge Coffin denied the request for a stay. (doc. 137) In May 2017, Judge Coffin issued his F &amp; R recommending that the Court deny the motions to certify. (doc. 146) Federal defendants and intervenor-defendants filed objections, and in June 2017, the Court adopted Judge Coffin's F &amp; R and declined to certify the opinion and order for interlocutory appeal.\n   <em>\n    Juliana v.

(doc. 182)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In June 2017, federal defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit, seeking an order directing this Court to dismiss the case. (doc. 177) Federal defendants asked the Ninth Circuit to stay all proceedings in this Court pending resolution of that petition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202483705\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In July 2017, the Ninth Circuit granted the request for a stay and ordered plaintiffs to file a response to the petition for writ of mandamus.

(doc. 195) In that motion, they seek to dismiss President Trump as a party and to obtain dismissal of the entire lawsuit on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Additionally, federal defendants argue that plaintiffs' requested relief is barred by the separation of powers. Federal defendants also moved for a protective order, seeking a stay of all discovery on the theory that discovery in this case is barred by the APA. (doc. 196) Specifically, federal defendants sought a stay of discovery pending the resolution of the motion for a protective order, the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and a not-yet-filed motion for summary judgment. On May 22, 2018, federal defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. (doc. 207) In that motion, they seek a judgment as a matter of law in their favor, arguing that (1) there are no genuine issues of material fact; (2) plaintiffs lack Article III standing to sue; (3) plaintiffs have failed to assert a valid cause of action\n   under the APA; (4) plaintiffs' claims violate separation of powers principles; (5) plaintiffs have no due process right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life; and (6) the federal government has no obligations under the public trust doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Meanwhile, the Solicitor General was considering seeking Supreme Court review of the Ninth Circuit's opinion denying mandamus relief. The presumptive deadline to file a petition for writ of certiorari to review that opinion was June 5, 2018. On May 24, 2018, the Solicitor General sought to extend the time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari to July 5, 2018. That request was docketed in\n   <em>\n    United States v. U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon\n   </em>\n   , Supreme Court No. 17A1304. Justice Kennedy granted the extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 25, 2018, Judge Coffin denied federal defendants' motion for a protective order and a stay. (doc. 212) On June 1, 2018, federal defendants filed objections to Judge Coffin's denial of the protective order and requested a stay of discovery pending resolution of those objections. (doc. 215 &amp; 216) On June 14, 2018, the Court denied that request for a stay by minute order. (doc. 238)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 25, 2018, federal defendants sought a second extension of the deadline for filing a petition for writ of certiorari. Justice Kennedy granted that request and extended the deadline to August 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 29, 2018, the Court affirmed Judge Coffin's denial of federal defendants' request to stay all discovery. (doc. 300) On July 5, 2018, federal defendants sought review of that decision through a second petition for writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit. In separate filings, federal defendants asked this Court and the Ninth Circuit to stay all discovery and trial pending the Ninth Circuit's resolution of that petition. On July 16, 2018, the Ninth Circuit denied the request for a stay. On July 17, 2018, the Court denied the request for a stay. (doc. 324) That same day, the Solicitor General petitioned Justice Kennedy for a stay of proceedings pending the Ninth Circuit's resolution of the mandamus petition. That request was docketed at\n   <em>\n    United States v. U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon\n   </em>\n   , Supreme Court No. 18A65. In his application for a stay, the Solicitor General suggested to Justice Kennedy that he could construe the stay application as a petition for writ of mandamus directing this Court to dismiss the lawsuit or as a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's first mandamus decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 18, 2018, the parties appeared for oral argument before this Court on the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 20, 2018, the Ninth Circuit denied federal defendants' second mandamus petition, holding that federal defendants had not met the standard to qualify for mandamus relief.\n   <em>\n    In re United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517570,12517571\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1101/\">\n    895 F.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1104-05 (9th Cir. 2018).

Alternatively, he suggested that Justice Kennedy could construe the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's second mandamus decision. On July 30, 2018, Justice Kennedy referred the application for a stay to the entire Supreme Court.

Many of the\n   issues raised in these motions are interrelated. Given the nature of the arguments presented, it is more efficient and likely to avoid confusion to deal with all of the pending issues in a single opinion and order. Thus, the Court addresses each motion in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Federal defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings rests on four grounds, two of which they raise for the first time in their 12(c) motion and two of which the Court has already considered and ruled upon. First, federal defendants move to dismiss President Trump as a defendant, arguing that he is not essential to effective relief and his presence in the lawsuit violates the separation of powers. Second, federal defendants seek dismissal of the lawsuit in its entirety, on the theory that the APA governs all challenges to federal agency action and plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the APA. Third, federal defendants invite the Court to reconsider all aspects of its opinion and order denying their November 2016 motion to dismiss and urge dismissal of the lawsuit on the grounds raised in that motion. Finally, echoing arguments raised two years ago by intervenor-defendants, federal defendants contend that dismissal of this action is required because the Court cannot redress plaintiffs' injuries without violating the separation of powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss President Trump as a Defendant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Federal defendants first move to dismiss President Trump as a defendant. The Ninth Circuit declined to address federal defendants' argument on that point in its denial of the 2017 mandamus petition because defendants had not first raised the issue in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516240\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/830/#p833\">\n    884 F.3d at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"First, to the extent the defendants argue that the President himself has been named as a party unnecessarily and that defending this litigation would unreasonably burden him, this argument is premature because the defendants never moved in the district court to dismiss the President as a party.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At oral argument, the parties reported that plaintiffs were willing to stipulate to the dismissal of the President without prejudice. Federal defendants rejected that offer and request dismissal with prejudice. In the absence of a stipulation, the Court must address both whether dismissal is warranted and, if it is, whether that dismissal should be with or without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Federal defendants assert that it would violate separation of powers principles for\n   this Court to issue an injunction or declaration against President Trump in connection with his official duties.

The inquiry is not into the President's action or inaction in relationship to the injuries complained of, but rather into the relief requested, and whether or not equitable remedies involving the President himself are essential to that relief. As adopted in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Franklin's\n   </em>\n   rule on when the President is an appropriate defendant is best understood as a strain of the canon of constitutional avoidance: because granting equitable relief against the President of the United States raises serious constitutional questions, dismissal of the President as a defendant is appropriate whenever it appears likely that the plaintiffs' injuries can be redressed through relief against another defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs' opposition to dismissing President Trump boils down to a general assertion that complete relief may be unavailable without the President as a defendant. They argue that further development of the factual record is necessary to determine whether injunctive or declaratory relief is available against President Trump and whether plaintiffs' injuries are redressable in the absence of such relief. The Court is not persuaded. This lawsuit is, at its heart, a challenge to the environmental and energy policies of the federal government as expressed through the action (or inaction) of federal agencies. Because the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit have spoken so clearly about the separation of powers concerns inherent in awarding equitable relief against a sitting president, the burden is on plaintiffs to explain with specificity why relief against President Trump is essential to redressing their injuries. They have failed to carry that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In an attempt to demonstrate why President Trump is necessary to effective equitable relief, plaintiffs cite a number of specific presidential actions in their Amended Complaint and briefs. For example, plaintiffs cite:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 An Executive Order in which President Trump directed a rollback of the Clean Power Plan by rescinding the moratorium on coal mining on federal lands and six other Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating emissions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 An Executive Order in which President Trump ordered the expedition of environmental reviews and approvals for infrastructure projects;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 An Executive Order in which President Trump ordered a review of the \"Waters of the United States\" Rule; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 Presidential memoranda encouraging approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The problem with those examples is that it is not enough, under\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , to show that the President was involved in the challenged action; plaintiffs must show that effective relief is\n   <em>\n    unavailable\n   </em>\n   unless it is awarded against the President. Like the\n   \"travel ban\" challenged in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , each of the foregoing orders and memoranda included express directives to be carried out by other governmental officials.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Exec.

But that case law does not support the conclusion that plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed; it simply underscores that plaintiffs' claims are not APA claims. Plaintiffs do not contend that any single agency action is causing their asserted injuries-nor could they, given the complex chain of causation involved in climate change. They seek review of\n   <em>\n    aggregate action\n   </em>\n   by\n   <em>\n    multiple agencies\n   </em>\n   , something the APA's judicial review provisions do not address. The APA does not govern plaintiffs' claims. As a result, plaintiffs' failure to state a claim under the APA is not a ground for dismissal of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss on Separation of Powers Grounds &amp; Request to Reconsider the November 2016 Denial of the Government's 12(b)(6) Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, federal defendants raise a set of arguments on which this Court already has ruled.

Second and more specifically, federal defendants argue that any claim brought outside the APA's framework is foreclosed by the separation of powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court acknowledges now, as it did in 2016, that the allocation of power among the branches of government is a critical consideration in this case and reiterate that, \"[s]hould plaintiffs prevail on the merits, this Court would no doubt be compelled to exercise great care to avoid separation-of-powers problems in crafting a remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Juliana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271893\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/1224/#p1276\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d at 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court recognizes that there are limits to the power of the judicial branch, as demonstrated by the Court's determination that President Trump is not a proper defendant in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   This is the first time that federal defendants have highlighted separation of powers concerns; they did not raise that argument, except in passing, in their 12(b)(6) motion. But former defendant-intervenors raised and fully briefed separation-of-powers arguments in the section of their motion to dismiss addressing the political question doctrine. Although this is the first time federal defendants are raising a political question challenge, their brief on the subject largely reiterates arguments considered and rejected in the opinion and order on the motion to dismiss. And obviously, the invitation to reconsider the November 2016 order and opinion necessarily implicates issues on which this Court has already ruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In order to determine how to address federal defendants' attempt to re-raise these issues, the Court begins by considering the application of the law of the case doctrine.

Namely, federal defendants reiterate their contention that plaintiffs lack Article III standing because their injuries are not concrete and particularized; the harms alleged by plaintiffs are not fairly traceably to federal defendants; and plaintiffs' claims are not redressable by this Court. Federal defendants also argue that plaintiffs have failed to adequately state a claim under the APA and that plaintiffs' claims would violate separation of powers principles. Federal defendants further argue, as they did in their previous motion to dismiss, that there is no fundamental right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life; that plaintiffs cannot establish a state-created danger claim; and that the public trust doctrine does not apply to the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In response, plaintiffs proffer the declarations of the named plaintiffs as well as declarations from eighteen expert witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that genuine issues of material fact exist as to standing, separation of powers, and their due process and public trust claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Many of these arguments raised in the present motion are substantially similar to those raised in federal defendants' and the former defendant-intervenors' motions to dismiss. However, federal defendants correctly note that the standard for this Court in reviewing a motion for summary judgment is different than the standard which was applied in the previous order.

The Court could find that there is no violation of plaintiffs' rights; that plaintiffs fail to meet one or more of the requirements of standing; or, after the full development of the factual record, that the requested remedies would indeed violate the separation of powers doctrine. As has been noted before, even should plaintiffs prevail at trial, the Court, in fashioning an appropriate remedy, need not micro-manage federal agencies or make policy judgments that the Constitution leaves to other branches.

It is now pretty clearly agreed that the CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   content will rise 25 [percent] by 2000.
