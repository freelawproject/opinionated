MOMACHA opposes the motion on the grounds that\n   MoMA has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims or a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, and that the balance of hardships tilts in MOMACHA's favor. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Museum of Modern Art (\"Museum\") was founded in 1929.

Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Museum argues that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims for trademark infringement, unfair competition, and trademark dilution. To succeed on a claim for trademark infringement, a plaintiff \"must prove that its mark is entitled to protection and, even more important, that the defendant's use of its own mark will likely cause confusion with plaintiff's mark.\"\n   <em>\n    Gruner + Jahr USA Publ'g v.

As a result, some MOMACHA consumers on social media have assumed that MOMACHA is affiliated with the Museum, demonstrating that consumers recognize the Museum's mark and associate similar marks with the Museum. Therefore, the Museum's exclusive use of its mark for a significant length of time, its advertising in numerous publications, its unsolicited press coverage, and MOMACHA's attempt to copy the Museum's mark all support the finding that the mark has acquired secondary meaning in the public mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   MOMACHA's argument that the Museum's mark is not distinctive because others have adopted similar marks both within and outside the art industry (Defs.' Mem. at 4-6) fails. The Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami's mark \"MoCA\" and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's mark \"SFMOMA\" not only appear and sound different from the Museum's mark \"MoMA,\" but are also located in different cities. This significantly lessens the likelihood of confusion. MOMACHA, in contrast, is a caf\u00e9 and art gallery located in the same city as the Museum, MoMA QNS, MoMA PS1, and the MoMA Design Stores, resulting in a greater likelihood of consumer confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   MOMACHA argues that third-party uses of the mark \"MOMA\" in connection with sales of shoes and wine further demonstrates that the Museum's mark lacks distinctiveness in the market. However, shoes and wine are so remote from the products offered by the Museum and MOMACHA that there is little need for the Museum to attack those uses in order to protect the value of its distinctive mark, and this argument is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v.

MOMACHA's original mark is highly similar in appearance to the Museum's mark. It uses the\n   same black and white coloring. It capitalizes both \"M\"s in its name. It employs a similar bold font resembling Franklin Gothic and the Museum's proprietary font. The image of the overlay of the Museum's proprietary font on top of MOMACHA's old logo demonstrates that the two fonts are almost exactly the same. Baker Decl. \u00b6 29. MOMACHA's display of its original logo on coffee cups both horizontally and vertically greatly resembles the Museum's mark and the manner in which it is displayed on the Museum's building. Although the capitalization in \"MoMaCha\" is slightly different from that of \"MoMA\"-the \"a\" in \"MoMaCha\" is lowercase-the unique alternating capitalization of the first three letters is nonetheless likely to confuse the public, especially if those letters are in the same bold font and in the same black-and-white coloring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   MOMACHA's old mark is presented in the marketplace in a manner that is likely to cause consumer confusion. The names of the Museum's other satellite locations (MoMA Design Stores, MoMA QNS, and MoMA PS1) all begin with the letters \"MoMA,\" followed by certain identifying letters or numbers. They are also all located in New York City. As a result, the public might mistakenly assume that \"MoMaCha\" is another one of the Museum's satellite locations in New York City due to MOMACHA's unique name and mark. That MOMACHA is a caf\u00e9 rather than a large museum is unlikely to dispel confusion, as not all of the Museum's locations are museums or museum-grade facilities, such as the MoMA Design Stores. MOMACHA's old mark is thus highly similar to the Museum's mark both in appearance and in the way it is presented in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   MOMACHA's new logo is not highly similar in appearance to the Museum's logo, as the new logo uses a significantly different font, and capitalizes all of the letters in \"MOMACHA.\" The Museum argues that MOMACHA's new logo is still similar because it continues to emphasize each syllable of \"MOMACHA\" by separating \"MO,\" \"MA,\" and \"CHA,\" into three different lines. Pl.'s Mem. at 6. The Museum argues that the mark is thus merely \"MoMA\" combined with the added descriptive element \"cha,\" meaning tea in Mandarin.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5626329\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/945/547/#p552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   MOMACHA counters that its name is based on the combination of the two words \"more\" and \"matcha,\" not \"MoMA\" and \"cha.\" Cahan Decl. \u00b6 6. Neither party's argument is compelling, as the mark is not separated into two lines \"MOMA\" and \"CHA,\" nor is it separated into \"MO\" and \"MACHA.\" The separation of syllables into three lines alone is insufficient to make a finding that MOMACHA's new logo looks or sounds similar to the Museum's mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MOMACHA's new logo still has some similarities to the Museum's marks in appearance, meaning, and as presented in the marketplace, however. First, the dominant features (strong block letters in black-and-white coloring) remain the same. Second, although the change eliminates the \"MoM\" capitalization similarity, the capitalization of \"CHA\" creates another similarity with some of the Museum's satellite locations. MoMA QNS and MoMA PS1, for example, both consist of the letters \"MoMA\" followed by three characters with all of its letters capitalized. It would thus not be unreasonable for someone to believe that \"MOMACHA\" is another one of the Museum's satellite locations, despite the capitalized \"O\" and lack of a space between \"MOMA\" and \"CHA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Overall, MOMACHA's old logo is highly similar in appearance to the Museum's logo, but the new logo is somewhat less so. However, MOMACHA still continues to display its old logo on its cups and social media accounts. Levitt Reply Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A. Consumers are thus likely to believe, despite the display of a different logo in most other areas of the caf\u00e9, that MOMACHA is still affiliated with the Museum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   MOMACHA argues that the marks are not confusingly similar in the way that they are presented to the public because MOMACHA now disclaims any affiliation with the Museum at numerous points throughout the customer experience.

As previously discussed, MOMACHA's use of its mark creates a likelihood of consumer confusion, which leads to the presumption of irreparable harm. If MOMACHA is not enjoined, consumers will continue to be confused when they see MOMACHA's advertising, press coverage, retail products, and social media accounts, especially because MOMACHA continues to use its old logo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Even though MOMACHA's goods and services are not necessarily inferior to those of the Museum, this confusion will nonetheless tarnish the Museum's reputation and goodwill. One particular example is the social media post of a MOMACHA beverage infused with cannabidiol (\"CBD\"), a cannabis compound, and decorated with foam art in the shape of a marijuana leaf. Levitt Decl. Ex. L. One person commented in response that the drink looked like a \"[g]reat excuse\" to visit MoMA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924867\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/137/#p144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Other confused viewers may similarly hope that the Museum now sells CBD-infused beverages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Another instance is the email the Museum received from an attorney representing an artist whose work was allegedly misappropriated by MOMACHA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924867\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/137/#p144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924867\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/137/#p144\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex.

The attorney found the logos to be so similar that he needed the Museum's confirmation that the Museum was not affiliated with MOMACHA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924867\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/137/#p144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Museum's reputation in the art industry would be significantly damaged if the public started to believe that the Museum misappropriates artists' work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The confusion between the Museum and MOMACHA will take away the Museum's\n   \"ability to control its reputation and the services offered under its name and mark.\"\n   <em>\n    New York City Triathlon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3947718\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/704/305/#p336\">\n    704 F.Supp.2d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   This harm is not calculable and cannot be remedied by monetary damages. Therefore, absent injunctive relief, the Museum will suffer irreparable harm to its brand and goodwill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Serious Questions on the Merits and Balance of Hardships\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Because the Museum has shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement, unfair competition, and trademark dilution claims, the Museum has sufficiently demonstrated serious questions on the merits to make them fair grounds for litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Without a preliminary injunction against MOMACHA, the Museum will suffer irreparable and unquantifiable harm to its reputation and goodwill, as discussed above. If MOMACHA is enjoined, MOMACHA's hardships will consist of the economic costs of changing its name and logo on its website, promotional materials, caf\u00e9 items, and social media platforms. Although MOMACHA argues that this burden would be substantial (Defs.' Mem. at 20), this economic burden is quantifiable and compensable, unlike the harm that the Museum would suffer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warner-Lambert Co. v. Northside Dev. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452772\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/3/#p8\">\n    86 F.3d 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (2d Cir. 1996) (noting that plaintiff's loss of consumer goodwill is unquantifiable and that defendant's \"loss of profits\" could be later compensated);\n   <em>\n    Diesel Props S.R.L. v. Greystone Business Credit II LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-CV-9580 (HB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20594773\">\n    2008 WL 594773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2008) (finding that plaintiffs' unquantifiable injuries outweigh defendants' quantifiable injuries). Furthermore, MOMACHA has already shown that it is willing and able to alter its logo and the appearance of its name when it changed its logo in April of 2018 (Cahan Decl. \u00b6 11) and when its co-owner stated an intention to change MOMACHA's logo on a seasonal basis (Levitt Reply Decl. Ex. B). Accordingly, the balance of hardships tips in favor of the Museum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Because the Museum has demonstrated irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation, and that the balance of hardships tilts in its favor, the Museum is entitled to a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Museum's motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 7) is granted and Defendants are enjoined from using, displaying, or promoting the MOMA or MOMACHA marks, and the https://momacha.com/ domain name, during the pendency of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   So ordered.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
