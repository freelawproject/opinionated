ECF No. 45. Defendants responded in opposition. ECF No. 46. Plaintiffs filed a reply. ECF No. 47. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part and denied in part. Additionally,\n   the Court certifies Plaintiffs' proposed class under Fed. R. Civ.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, citizens of the City of Bedford, Ohio, filed this lawsuit against Defendants City of Bedford, Ohio (\"City\" or \"Bedford\"), Rob Brown, and Richard Hickman, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for Bedford's allegedly unconstitutional enforcement of the Point of Sale and Rental Inspection Ordinances. ECF No. 21. Bedford's Point of Sale Inspection Ordinance required homeowners to obtain a Certificate of Inspection (\"Certificate\") before selling their homes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID#: 180. A Certificate, valid for twelve months, was issued after a building official inspected \"all structures or premises used for dwelling purposes and all secondary or accessory structures to determine whether such structures or premises conform[ed] to the provisions of th[e] code.\" ECF No. 1-3 at PageID#: 25. On inspection, the building official could enter the property at any reasonable time and inspect areas including basements, bathrooms, staircases, doors, windows, electrical equipment, roofing, siding, concrete walk and driveways, among others. ECF No. 21 at PageID#: 181. Obtaining the Certificate required homeowners to apply for and consent to a warrantless inspection of the home and to pay of an inspection fee ranging from $50 to $200. ECF No. 45 at PageID#: 398. If the home did not pass inspection, the homeowner was required to perform repairs or, if sold before repairs were complete, the new owner would deposit money in escrow to pay for repairs. ECF No. 1-3 at PageID#: 26. Homeowners that violated the ordinance or refused an inspection were guilty of a misdemeanor and could be fined and imprisoned. ECF No. 21 at PageID#: 182.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Similarly, Bedford's Rental Inspection Ordinance required landlords to schedule a warrantless inspection of their rental units every two years or each time a new tenant arrived. ECF No. 21 at PageID#: 202. A landlord was to obtain a Certificate in order to lease his property to a tenant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Landlords paid an inspection fee ranging from $20 to $50 per unit, and failure to comply could result in criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After filing its initial complaint, Plaintiffs moved the Court to enter a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction. ECF No. 4. Prior to the hearing, the Court granted the parties' Joint Motion for an Order Granting Preliminary Injunction as to the Fifth and Sixth Prayers for Relief enumerated in Plaintiffs' May 4, 2016 Verified Complaint. ECF No. 11 at PageID#: 74. That Order temporarily enjoined Defendants from enforcing the warrantless searches and from criminally prosecuting Plaintiffs based on the City's Point of Sale Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court also ordered that Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 4) be converted to and treated as a Motion for Permanent Injunction. ECF No. 11 at PageID#: 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The City subsequently amended its Point of Sale Inspection Ordinance by including an administrative warrant process for home inspections and removing any criminal penalties for failure to consent to an inspection. ECF No. 17-1. The Court therefore denied Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief (ECF No. 4) as moot. ECF No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 30, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which included claims for class-wide relief with respect to the Rental Inspection Ordinance. ECF No. 21. Plaintiffs contend that the warrantless search policy under the Rental Inspection Ordinance was essentially identical to the warrantless search policy under the already-enjoined\n   Point of Sale Inspection Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID#: 191, \u00b6 114. Following a hearing on Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, held on February 14, 2017, Defendants agreed to amend the Rental Inspection Ordinance and not to enforce it in the meantime. February 14, 2017,\n   <em>\n    Minutes of Proceedings\n   </em>\n   . On March 10, 2017, Defendants certified that the City had amended its ordinance to include an administrative warrant provision and eliminate criminal penalties, and they submitted a copy of the amended ordinance to the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 31; 31-1. The Court later denied Plaintiffs' modified Oral Motion for Temporary Restraining Order as moot. ECF No. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 17, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification. ECF No. 27. The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion and certified the following two classes under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) 1 and (b)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Subclass A:\n   </strong>\n   All individuals and businesses that have (1) been subjected to Point of Sale Inspections between September 10, 2014 and January 30, 2017; and (2) paid Point of Sale Inspection fees to the City of Bedford in conjunction with the aforesaid inspection(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Subclass B:\n   </strong>\n   All individuals and businesses that have (1) been subjected to rental inspections between September 10, 2014 and February 14, 2017; and (2) paid Rental Inspection fees to the City of Bedford in conjunction with the aforesaid inspection(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ECF No. 35 at PageID#: 367.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Now, pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' Partial Motion for Summary Judgment on the First, Second, Fourth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Prayers for Relief in the First Amended Complaint. ECF No. 45. Those Prayers for Relief ask the Court to do the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) Declare that the City of Bedford's Point of Sale Inspection Requirements and Rental Inspection Requirements, as they existed on May 4, 2016, authorizing warrantless searches without probable cause, are unconstitutional, both facially and as applied to Plaintiffs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) Declare that provisions of the original Point of Sale Inspection Requirements and current Rental Inspection Requirements wholly reliant upon the unconstitutional search, including but not limited to the monetary extraction for inspections and the permit requirement, violated Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) Declare that through the imposition of monetary assessments on Plaintiffs and others, precipitated by the City's desire to fund the costs of the Point of Sale Inspection Requirements and Rental Inspection Requirements, Defendant City of Bedford has been and continues to be unjustly enriched;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (9) Mandate the return of Point of Sale Inspection and Rental Inspection fees paid by Plaintiffs and others to Defendant City of Bedford; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (13) Reimburse Plaintiffs for amounts they have paid to the City of Bedford in inspection fees related to unconstitutional inspections....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ECF No. 21 at PageID#: 199-200; ECF No. 45 at PageID#: 391.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The moving party is not required to file affidavits or other similar materials negating a claim on which its opponent bears the burden of proof, so long as the movant relies upon the absence of the essential element in the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Under the Rental Inspection Ordinance, by contrast, the homeowner (landlord) and the occupant (tenant) of the inspected house are not the same person. Whether the Rental Inspection Ordinance as it existed on May 4, 2016, was unconstitutional depends in part on who, as between landlord and tenant, enjoys the protection of the Fourth Amendment and to what degree each of them enjoys it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Again, all agree that inspections under the Rental Inspection Ordinance took place without any kind of administrative warrant procedure.

Cases in Which the Rental Unit Was Occupied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In cases in which the rental unit under inspection was occupied, however, the question remains: Did a tenant's voluntary consent validate the City's warrantless inspection of the rental unit? In\n   <em>\n    Camara\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the \"searches when authorized and conducted without a warrant procedure lack the traditional safeguards which the Fourth Amendment guarantees.\" 387 U.S. at 534,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338823\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/523/#p528\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 46 at PageID#: 493.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It may be the case that, when a rental unit is occupied by a tenant, the landlord's privacy interest is subordinated to the tenant's. To be sure, a tenant is ordinarily entitled to invite whomever she pleases to join her in her rental unit, including a City building inspector, with or without her landlord's approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Rental Inspection Ordinance, however, gave no occasion for the City to interact with tenants at all. The City's policy under the Ordinance, however, insisted that \"you [the landlord] must make the necessary arrangements with the tenant to open their suite to the inspector....\" ECF No. 21 at PageID#: 204. It also insisted, \"The code requires you, as the owner, to make the proper application each and every December for a new Certificate of Occupancy for each rental unit on a site.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338823\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/523/#p528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, in its response to interrogatories, the City indicated that no property owner, during the whole time the Rental Inspection Ordinance was implemented in Bedford, had failed to comply with the inspection requirement. ECF No. 45-1 at PageID#: 421 (Interrogatory # 8). Given that it was the property owner's obligation to arrange an inspection and no property owner ever failed to comply, the Court perceives no grounds for a reasonable jury to find that the City ever interacted directly with a tenant to obtain her consent to inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Instead, the Rental Inspection Ordinance placed the burden to consent to inspection squarely on the landlord. The tenant played no role in giving consent to inspection. As in cases in which the rental units were unoccupied, the only parties to the transaction were the property owner and the City. And as discussed in the context of the Point of Sale Inspection Ordinance, a property owner's \"consent\" to inspection of his property in the face of criminal penalty cannot be deemed voluntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camara\n   </em>\n   , 387 U.S. at 533,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338823\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/523/#p528\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under the Ordinance, rental unit inspections were to be performed whether the units were occupied or not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 21 at PageID#: 204 (\"[Y]ou [the property owner] are required to call for a rental inspection whenever there is a change in tenant, or a 2-year period, which ever is more frequent.\").
