(\"Align\") filed four separate suits against Defendants 3Shape A/S and 3Shape Inc. (together, \"3Shape\" or \"Defendants\") on November 14, 2017. On February 2, 2018, 3Shape moved to dismiss the complaints in Civil Action Nos. 17-1646-LPS-CJB and 17-1647-LPS-CJB (the \"Complaints\") for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), based on its contention that Align failed to plausibly allege direct, indirect, and willful infringement of all asserted patents and that certain of the asserted patents are not directed to patent-eligible subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(D.I. 1 at \u00b6 28; D.I. 25 at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 14, 2017, Align filed four actions against 3Shape in this District.

No. 17-1646-LPS-CJB D.I. 22 at 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Align also filed two complaints with the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\"), involving 11 of the 26 patents also at issue here. The ITC instituted investigations as to those 11 patents on December 14, 2017. (C.A. No. 17-1646-LPS-CJB D.I. 15 at 1) The 11 patents involved in the ITC proceedings include all but one of the patents at issue in C.A.

No. 17-1649-LPS-CJB (the '074 patent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3Shape moved to stay all four District Court actions pending the ITC investigations. All of the patents subject to the ITC investigations were subject to a mandatory stay; Align stipulated on January 23, 2018 to a stay of both C.A. Nos. 17-1648-LPS-CJB and 17-1649-LPS-CJB as to all claims, pending resolution of the ITC investigations. (C.A. No. 17-1648-LPS-CJB D.I. 19; C.A.

(C.A. No. 17-1646-LPS-CJB D.I. 21; C.A. No. 17-1647-LPS-CJB D.I. 21) 3Shape's motions further sought to dismiss patent infringement claims as to some of the asserted patents on the grounds that they claim ineligible subject matter under Section 101. Specifically, this portion of 3Shape's motions is directed to the '873 and '065 patents in C.A. No. 17-1646-LPS-CJB and the '850 and '149 patents in C.A.

(D.I. 25 at 18-19) As described in the specifications, a dental implant, such as a crown, is placed on a tooth that has been ground down to a stump. The border between that tooth's \"unground\" portion and the \"ground\" portion is called a \"finish line.\" ( '873 patent, col. 5:17-24) A good fit between the implant and the stump, along the finish line, is important to prevent infections and tooth decay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:17-28) In order to ensure a good fit for the implant, a practitioner will create a model of the stump and surrounding intraoral area. To ensure a good scan of the finish line, the practitioner will wipe away blood and saliva from the stump and, \"[i]n some instances, ... insert a cord around the [stump] between the [stump] and the patient's gum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 5:40-45) This cord holds the gum down so that the entire finish line is exposed for the first scan, however the gum \"revert[s] back to its natural position, and in many cases collapse[s] back over the finish line, after a brief period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 5:45-49)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   A problem with prior art approaches is that additional scans taken after the first set of intraoral scans could degrade the quality of the finish line in the model. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 2:30-39) These additional scans were taken to ensure that the implant would fit inside the patient's mouth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 5:64-66) However, the scans could also capture parts of the stump area captured by the first intraoral scans. When this happened, prior approaches would average the data received depicting the stump area with the first images of the stump area, which would \"degrade the quality of the first tooth in the 3D model.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 2:34-39) The degradation in quality could cause the finish line, as depicted in the 3D model, to lack definition and make it impossible \"to properly determine the finish line, and thus the margin of a restoration [i.e., the fit between the stump and the implant] may not be properly designed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:22-28) Claim 1 of the '873 patent purportedly improved on these approaches \"by automatically locking the images of the clean stump such that subsequent scans that may capture the unclean stump are ignored during the creation of the model.\" (D.I. 25 at 19) (citing '873 patent, cols. 5:66-6:3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   3Shape contends that Align's asserted improvement over prior approaches is not captured in the claim language.

A system of fabricating a dental template to position a plurality of objects on a patient's teeth, the system comprising a computer comprising storage media comprising a program that, when executed, causes the computer to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   receive digitized teeth of at least at least two of the patient's teeth;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   scale the digitized teeth to provide scaled digital teeth;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   add virtual objects to locations on the digitized teeth or the scaled or the scaled digital teeth, wherein the virtual objects are placed on one or more of the digitized teeth or the scaled digital teeth;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   superimpose the scaled digital teeth over the digitized teeth; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   output fabrication data for fabricating a template to locate the orthodontic objects on the patient's teeth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   ( '149 patent, cl. 13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Step One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   3Shape argues that claim 13 of the '149 patent is directed to the abstract idea of providing, generating, or outputting \"a pattern of data.\" (D.I. 22 at 18-19) 3Shape adds that \"fabricating a dental template\" is only alluded to \"in the preamble and as an intended use of the data 'output' by the claimed computer software of asserted claim 13.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19) The Court agrees with Align that claim 13 is directed to an improvement over prior approaches to indirect bonding techniques for orthodontic brackets. (D.I. 25 at 22)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The patent explains that orthodontists use brackets bonded to a patient's teeth that, over time, exert enough force to move the position of the teeth. ( '149 patent, col. 1:19-30) Direct bonding of brackets entails placing adhesive on the base of\n   the bracket and placing that bracket on the patient's tooth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:29-32) This process has several shortcomings, including that it is difficult to optimally place a bracket \"on severely crowded teeth\" or \"the treatment provider may have difficulty seeing the precise position of the bracket relative to the tooth surface\" for posterior teeth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:36-42) One method that overcomes several of these shortcomings is \"indirect bonding,\" in which an impression of a patient's teeth is taken and a plaster model is made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:50-54) Brackets are then temporarily bonded to the plaster model and thereafter a \"transfer tray is ...made by placing matrix material [such as heated plastic sheet matrix material] over both the model and the brackets on the model.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:56-59) The material \"then assume[s] a configuration that precisely matches the shape of the replica teeth of the stone... model with the brackets in the desired position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:59-62) The temporary adhesive is then removed, permanent adhesive is added to the base of each bracket, \"and the tray with the embedded brackets [is] then placed over matching portions of the patient's dental arches.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 1:63-67) Once the adhesive hardens, the matrix material is removed and the brackets are left in place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 2:5-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Problems associated with indirect bonding include that \"brackets may become dislodged during the removal of the matrix from the dental arches.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 2:7-10) But the '149 patent purports to be an advance over this prior approach because the template created by the claimed system and methods \"may not necessarily contain the bracket as with traditional indirect bonding [ ] templates, but rather[ ] directs the user as to the precise location where the bracket should be placed based on geometric fit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 2:57-60;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 25 at 22) This eliminates the potential that the brackets may become dislodged during the removal of the template.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   At step one, the Court must determine whether the claims \"focus on a specific means or method that improves the relevant technology.\"\n   <em>\n    Apple Inc. v. Ameranth, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142328\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1229/#p1241\">\n    842 F.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RecogniCorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277199\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1322/#p1327\">\n    855 F.3d at 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here the relevant technology consisted of templates that, in some instances, could dislodge orthodontic brackets during their removal from the patient's mouth. Claim 13 of the '149 patent purports to fix this problem by disclosing a method for creating a template that could guide the placement of the brackets without the brackets necessarily being contained within the template does not rebut this point. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 29 at 13-14) 3Shape has not, therefore, persuaded the Court that the claim is directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As 3Shape has not met its burden at step one, it is not necessary to address step two, and 3Shape's motion will be denied as to the '149 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
