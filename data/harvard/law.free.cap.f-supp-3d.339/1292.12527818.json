This case is before the Court on the Respondents['] Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (Doc. 11). On August 20, 2018, the assigned United States Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation (Doc. 37) recommending that the Court deny Respondents' motion. No party has filed an objection to the Report and Recommendation, and the time in which to do so has passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; Fed.

Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court has considered the contrary authority from outside the Eleventh Circuit, but concludes that the Magistrate Judge's reasoning is correct. Thus, the issue of whether the six month deadline to file a\n   limitation action has been met does not implicate the Court's subject matter jurisdiction, but instead can be raised as an affirmative defense and litigated as such.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1.

The Trans allege that, on July 2, 2016, Mrs. Tran rented the boat from Definitive Marine (doing business as Welaka Charters), and the family boated to Salt Springs. Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10. They allege that, as the boy jumped into the water, one of his fingers became lodged in a gate on the boat and was partially amputated. Doc. 1 \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Trans sued the boat owners in state court on June 8, 2017, alleging strict liability and negligence.\n   <em>\n    Son Tran &amp; Lisa Tran, individually and as parents and natural guardians of A.T., a minor child\n   </em>\n   , 2017-215-CA-53 (Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Putnam County, Florida). Doc. 32-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The boat owners filed this action on August 2, 2017. Doc. 1. With the complaint, they filed an affidavit of a marine surveyor who opined the boat was worth $5,000 on July 3, 2016, and $6,500 on July 27, 2017 (following improvements). Doc. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under Supplemental Rule F of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions and Local Admiralty Rule 7.06, this Court enjoined the state action and ordered the boat owners to notify anyone claiming damages related to the accident to file claims with this Court by October 2, 2017. Docs. 3, 4. An insurance company timely filed a claim for $105,110.32 for the boy's treatment. Doc. 8. The Trans timely filed the current motion to dismiss and exhibits and an answer and counterclaims for strict liability and negligence. Docs. 11, 12, 13. The Court entered a case management and scheduling order, Doc. 22, but, upon request of the boat owners and the Trans, vacated the order and stayed discovery pending a decision on the motion to dismiss, Docs. 27, 28. The Court informed the parties that, if the motion to dismiss is denied, the Court would direct them to file an amended case management report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The boat owners and the Trans reached an impasse at a mediation on January 19, 2018.

Doc. 11 at 5-11. The Trans provide eight exhibits: (1) the July 14, 2016, letter, Doc. 11-1; (2) a certified receipt for that letter, Doc. 11-2; (3) a July 22, 2016, letter from Definitive Marine's insurance carrier, Doc. 11-3; (4) a July 25, 2016, letter from the insurance carrier's adjuster, Doc. 11-4; (5) the July 26, 2016, letter, Doc. 11-5; (6) a certified receipt and UPS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   tracking information for that letter, Doc. 11-6; (7) an August 2, 2016, letter from the insurance carrier, Doc. 11-7; and (8) an affidavit from Daron Murrell concerning asserted incriminating statements a manager of Welaka Charters made the day after the accident, Doc. 11-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trans contend that the deadline in \u00a7 30511(a) and Supplemental Rule F(1) is jurisdictional and, therefore, the Court may consider the exhibits to decide the motion. Doc. 11 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss, the boat owners did not contest that the deadline in \u00a7 30511(a) is jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 17. Rather, they contended they timely filed the complaint because the first sufficient written notice of the claims was a February 3, 2017, letter from the Trans' counsel to the boat owners' counsel and the insurance adjustor. Doc. 17 at 3-12. They provide that letter as their only exhibit. Doc. 17-1. They argue the Court should not consider Murrell's affidavit because he omits that it is based on personal knowledge and discusses only an asserted conversation, which is not written notice. Doc. 17 at 8 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At oral argument to discuss whether the deadline in \u00a7 30511(a) is jurisdictional, the boat owners for the first time contended it is not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Asked if there was any objection to converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment to allow the Court to consider evidence outside the pleadings in the event \u00a7 30511(a) is not jurisdictional, both sides objected. The Trans objected because they did not want the Court to view the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the boat owners under the standard for summary judgment in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. The boat owners objected because they wanted discovery before any summary-judgment ruling, including to depose Murrell and ask him about his statements in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the Trans' supplemental brief, they reassert that \u00a7 30511(a) is jurisdictional, Doc. 33 at 4-8, reassert that the complaint is untimely, Doc. 33 at 8-20, and provide four exhibits not previously in the record: (1) an August 2, 2016, letter from the Trans' counsel to the insurance adjuster, Doc. 33-1 at 11; (2) a second August 2, 2016, letter from the Trans' counsel to the insurance adjuster, Doc. 33-1 at 12-13; (3) an August 25, 2016, letter from the Trans' counsel to the insurance adjuster, Doc. 33-1 at 14; and (4) an October 18, 2016, letter and email from the boat owners' counsel to the Trans' counsel, Doc. 33-1 at 15-16. To distinguish an adverse case, they also provide documents from that case. Doc. 33-1 at 20-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the boat owners' supplemental memorandum, they contend \u00a7 30511(a) is not jurisdictional, Doc. 33 at 5-8, reassert that the complaint is timely, Doc. 33 at 8-11, for the first time contend that if the earlier correspondence provided sufficient written notice of the claims, the Court should equitably toll the deadline based on lack of responsiveness by the Trans' counsel, Doc. 33 at 12-14, and provide two exhibits not\n   previously in the record: (1) the complaint against them filed in the state action, Doc. 32-1; and (2) their notice of stay filed in that state action, Doc. 32-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Indeed, Congress amended the Limitation Act to further cut down the right of a shipowner to limit his liability.... Paying close attention to the context and history of the Act leads to the conclusion that it is jurisdictional and provides no equitable tolling.\" Doc. 33 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   There are at least three problems with their argument. First, Congress added the 6-month deadline not to \"cut down the right of a shipowner\" but to drive shipowners to bring limitation actions posthaste instead of waiting until judgment on liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"397738\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/247/604/#p606\">\n    247 F.2d at 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, even if the purpose were to \"cut down the right of a shipowner,\" that would not be a reason to hold the deadline is jurisdictional; as the Supreme Court has explained, a condition should not be \"ranked as jurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed Elsevier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446768,3582065\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/154/\">\n    559 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   169 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446768,3582065\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/154/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the argument incorrectly assumes equitable tolling is necessarily available if the deadline is nonjurisdictional. As the Supreme Court has observed, it has \"reserved whether mandatory claim-processing rules may be subject to equitable exceptions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamer\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 18 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Neither party suggests, and the record would not support, that \u00a7 1333(1) is an inappropriate foundation for this action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840584\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/1543/#p1546\">\n    29 F.3d at 1546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]roducts liability actions involving pleasure craft in navigation fall within the admiralty jurisdiction.\").
