Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2016. (Dkt. 6 at 15). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since January 1, 2012, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of: a possible nonverbal learning disorder; slight vision problem(s); seasonal allergies; enlarged prostate; diabetes ; obesity ; and some substance abuse were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listing 12.00, paragraphs B and C, in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels, as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1529\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 416.929, and SSR 96-4p, with the following nonexertional limitations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Plaintiff] could understand, remember, and carry out instructions for routine, repetitive type tasks, commensurate with unskilled work; he could sustain attention and concentration for at least two hour segments in an eight hour day.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of laundry worker, warehouse worker, packer, cleaner, assembler, and machine tender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

The Court has considered each of these arguments and, for the reasons discussed below, finds them without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Weighing of Dr. Hurley's Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because Plaintiff's claim was filed before March 27, 2017, the ALJ was\n   required to apply the treating physician rule, under which a treating physician's opinion is entitled to \"controlling weight\" when it is \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

In making this determination, the ALJ explained that \"[t]o the extent ... the assessment prevents working [it] is inconsistent with Dr. Hurley's treatment notes, that indicated no overt concern, ongoing conservative treatment medication management and counseling therapy, and many unremarkable status findings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court finds no error in this conclusion by the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is appropriate for an ALJ to accord limited weight to an opinion where it is \"inconsistent with [the source's] examination findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Glena v.

In this case, Dr. Hurley's RFC findings were markedly more extreme than his impressions of Plaintiff throughout their treatment relationship, as the ALJ correctly found. The ALJ cited specifically to three exhibits in the record (Ex. 3F, 6F, and 8F), containing medical records from Dr. Hurley. The ALJ also discussed statements and opinions of Dr. Hurley, noting that at Plaintiff's initial evaluation in September 2015, his \"cognition appeared impaired.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, 260). The ALJ found that Dr. Hurley's statement in this response was at odds with his assessments at later examinations, where findings were mostly normal, with only continued medication management advised. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). For example, in October 2015, Dr. Hurley found that Plaintiff's speech was normal, thought processes were logical, judgment was good, and concentration was fair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 246). Further, in December 2015, Dr. Hurley found Plaintiff to be behave appropriately, have normal speech, and logical thoughts. Plaintiff's judgment was good, his memory was intact, and his concentration was good. His insight was good, and he felt his Celexa was helpful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 241-44). In January 2016, Plaintiff's speech was normal, and his thought processes were logical. Plaintiff had good judgment, his memory was intact, and his concentration and insight were good. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 236-37). Finally, in March 2016, Plaintiff's speech was normal, his thought processes were logical, he had good judgment, his memory was intact, and his concentration was fair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 231). The ALJ also noted that Plaintiff's neuropsychological testing referred by Dr. Hurley and conducted by Michael P. Santa Maria, Ph.D., did not reveal any work-precluding cognitive limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 264-71). The results of that examination showed deficiency in mathematical skills and non-verbal abilities, but \"adequate cognitive capacity to handle various competitive roles....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The ALJ further explained that the extreme findings in Dr. Hurley's questionnaire \"appear to be sympathetic to the claimant's financial concerns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Notably, in the outline of Plaintiff's medical treatment, the ALJ noted several occasions on which Plaintiff discussed his financial situation with Dr. Hurley and others, including a statement by Plaintiff that he was ambivalent about returning to work because it could \"sabotage\" his ability to secure SSD benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff highlights several portions of the ALJ's analysis of Dr. Hurley's opinion as problematic. (Dkt. 9-1 at 13-15). However, these items do not amount to any error on the part of the ALJ, but rather show only Plaintiff's disagreement with the ALJ's assessment. As explained above, the ALJ's analysis for Dr. Hurley's opinion as to Plaintiff's RFC was comprehensive, thorough, and reasonable. For this reason, the ALJ's assigning limited weight to Dr. Hurley's opinion is reasonable and, as detailed\n   by Plaintiff's medical records, is supported by more than a mere scintilla of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Assessment of Plaintiff's RFC\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff's second argument is that the ALJ's determination as to the Plaintiff's RFC is unsupported by the evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In deciding a disability claim, an ALJ is tasked with \"weigh[ing] all of the evidence available to make an RFC finding that [is] consistent with the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta v.

The ALJ examined Plaintiff's testimony and treatment record in detail. (Dkt. 6 at 18-23). In arriving at the RFC, the ALJ considered several medical opinions, including those of Drs. Ransom, Kleinerman, Santa Maria, and Hurley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23). Plaintiff visited Christine Ransom, Ph.D., in October 2014, for a consultative psychological evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223). Dr. Ransom noted that Plaintiff was cooperative and socially appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 224). Dr. Ransom found that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   can follow and understand simple directions and instructions, perform simple tasks independently, maintain attention and concentration for simple tasks, maintain a simple regular schedule and learn simple new tasks. He will have mild difficulty performing complex tasks, relate adequately with others and appropriately deal with stress due to major depressive disorder currently mild, unspecified anxiety disorder currently mild.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The results of the evaluation are consistent with mild psychiatric conditions which will not significantly interfere with the claimant's ability to function on a daily basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 225. In November 2014, Dr. Kleinerman, a state agency medical consultant, reviewed Dr. Ransom's report and opined that Plaintiff did not have a severe mental impairment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 227. Dr. Kleinerman found that Plaintiff's affect/mood was mildly irritable, but that Plaintiff's attention and memory were intact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Kleinerman also noted that Plaintiff does chores, drives, and manages finances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In April 2016, Plaintiff visited Dr. Santa Maria for an evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 264-71). Dr. Santa Maria noted that Plaintiff required redirection to stay focused during the examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266). Plaintiff's cognitive abilities were rated in the \"high normal\" range, and Plaintiff demonstrated a \"high normal\" ability to follow multi-step verbal instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 268). In Dr. Santa Maria's opinion, Plaintiff demonstrated \"adequate cognitive capacity to handle various competitive work roles though not necessarily work roles with strong demands on mathematics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thereafter, in August 2016, Plaintiff saw Angela Mason, LMSW, therapist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273-74). Ms. Mason noted that Plaintiff faced struggles in managing his depression and in initiating change in his life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273). Ms. Mason further noted that Plaintiff was engaged during sessions, and demonstrated tangential thought process, at\n   times difficult to redirect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ noted that Ms. Mason's opinions were considered in the RFC for a range of unskilled work and some limitations on social functioning, which would not preclude working. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, the ALJ considered the opinion of Dr. Hurley, as detailed above at Section II(A). Although Dr. Hurley's mental functional capacity assessment found Plaintiff deficient in several areas (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 323-27), as noted by the ALJ, the assessment conflicted with Dr. Hurley's earlier assessments of Plaintiff, which were somewhat unremarkable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23). In summarizing these records and opinions, the ALJ found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Due to reported depression and anxiety and some nonverbal learning disorder mention ... the claimant could perform a range of unskilled routine repetitive work. He could sustain attention and concentration for two-hour segments. Due to reported social difficulties, he could tolerate at least brief and superficial contact with others.

The trier of fact has the duty to resolve that conflict.\"). As summarized above, the ALJ carefully considered and relied upon the opinions of each of these sources, including the opinions of Drs. Ransom, Kleinerman, and Hurley, in assessing Plaintiff's RFC. The ALJ also assigned weight to each medical opinion, and articulated good reasons for not giving particular opinions controlling weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corsi v.

The Court's review of the record, particularly the opinions highlighted above, demonstrates that the ALJ's RFC assessment is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff contends that it was inappropriate for the ALJ to consider Plaintiff's ability to perform certain activities as evidence that Plaintiff is not as limited as he alleges. (Dkt. 9-1 at 17). The ALJ cited to Plaintiff's testimony that \"[h]e lives alone, and maintains independent functioning. He is able to care for himself, manage money, and drive a car; socialize with family and friends; watch television and listen to the radio; and complete household tasks daily. Such activities appear to be consistent with a range of unskilled work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's testimony from the January 19, 2017 hearing, and finds that testimony was accurately summarized by the ALJ. Although Plaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to take into account Plaintiff's testimony that he experienced frustrations when engaging in everyday activities, this statement is inaccurate; indeed, in assessing Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ considered the following from Plaintiff's \"extensive\" testimony: he was terminated from past jobs, due to employment issues; he \"talks over\" people; one employer was not satisfied with Plaintiff's handling of telephone calls; he did not understand some procedures as well as he did in the past; he did not get along well with people, due to the symptoms of his impairments; and he continued to have symptoms such as lack of energy, not feeling\n   well, and not feeling happy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). The ALJ also noted that Plaintiff does not appear to have any physical limitations in performing work (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20), a fact that Plaintiff himself testified to at his hearing (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35). \"An ALJ has discretion to resolve conflicts in the record, including with reference to a claimant's reported activities of daily living....\"\n   <em>\n    Perozzi v.
