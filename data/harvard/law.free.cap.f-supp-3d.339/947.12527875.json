Drozd, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the court on defendants' motions to dismiss portions of relator's second amended complaint (\"SAC\"). (Doc. Nos. 77, 78.) A hearing on those motions was held on May 1, 2018. Attorneys Wilmer J. Harris and Stephanie Yu appeared on behalf of relator Nicolle O'Neill. Assistant United States Attorney Vincente Tennerelli appeared on behalf of party in interest United States of America. Attorneys W. Scott Cameron and Bradley Lingo appeared on behalf of defendant PST Services LLC (\"PST\"). Attorney Jason Gonzalez appeared on behalf of all other defendants (the \"Somnia defendants\"). Having reviewed the parties' briefing and heard oral argument, and for the reasons that follow, defendants' motions to dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 19, 2015, relator filed her complaint under seal, alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), the California False Claims Act (\"CFCA\"), retaliation, violation of California's Health and Labor Code, whistleblower retaliation, wrongful termination, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. (Doc. No. 1.) On November 21, 2016, the United States notified the court that it was declining to intervene in this action. (Doc. No. 16.) On November 30, 2016, the State of California did the same. (Doc. No. 17.) On December 16, 2016, the court ordered the complaint be unsealed and served on defendants by relator. (Doc. No. 18.) The first amended complaint was filed on July 7, 2017. (Doc. No. 41 (\"FAC\").) On August 21, 2017, defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss the FAC. (Doc. Nos. 45, 48.) After the court dismissed certain parts of the FAC (Doc. No. 70), relator filed its SAC on February 28, 2018. (Doc. No. 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The factual allegations of the SAC are nearly identical to those of the FAC, and were summarized in a prior order of this court. (Doc. No. 70.) As relevant here, under the Medicare Claims Processing Manual (the \"Manual\") issued by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), there are four ways in which anesthesia services are provided and billed, based on the level of involvement by a Medical Doctor of Anesthesiology\n   (\"MDA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) First, the service is coded as \"AA\" if the anesthesia services are performed personally by an anesthesiologist. (Doc. No. 49-3 at 124.) Second, services are coded as \"QK\", \"QX\", or \"QY\" when the services are medically directed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124, 175). Third, services are coded as Medical Supervision, denoted by code \"AD,\" where the physician is supervising more than four concurrent anesthesia procedures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124.) Finally, and of particular relevance here, the \"QZ\" code may be used to indicate \"CRNA service: Without medical direction by a physician.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120, 175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Relator brings a total of eight claims in this action. The pending motions to dismiss seek dismissal of counts one, two, and three of the SAC to the extent they concern defendants' alleged misuse of the QZ code. (Doc. No. 77-1 at 5; Doc. No. 78-1 at 5.) Defendant PST also moves to dismiss any FCA causes of action against it to the extent they involve submission of claims prior to March 3, 2014. (Doc. No. 77-1 at 5.) On April 17, 2018, relator filed oppositions to those motions. (Doc. Nos. 80, 81). Replies were filed on April 24, 2018. (Doc. Nos. 82, 83). On April 26, 2018, the United States filed its statement of interest. (Doc. No. 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The purpose of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    N.

The court found that this theory failed to state a claim for relief because relator failed to properly allege that any such violation, even if proven, was material. (Doc. No. 70 at 15-16.) In the SAC, relator alleges two new theories of liability. First, relator alleges that when defendants used the QZ code, they falsely \"made an express representation to the government that a CRNA, alone and without any supervision by an anesthesiologist, performed the services in question.\" (SAC at \u00b6 66.) Second, relator now alleges that defendants \"submitted demands for payment that contained false implied certifications that they had complied with the TEFRA [the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act] regulations applicable to their billing decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69.) Relator identifies these theories as being based upon express and implied false certifications, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC at \u00b6\u00b6 66, 69.)

Defendants contend in their motions to dismiss that this theory fails to state a claim because it does not plausibly allege that any of the representations with respect to the QZ modifier were false.

The parties therefore have devoted a great deal of their briefing to arguing the circumstances under which the QZ code may or may not be used under the Manual. Relator contends in the SAC that anesthesia services may be coded as QZ if, and only if, \"there is no MDA involved and the services are performed by a CRNA.\" (SAC at \u00b6 35.) Thus, relator alleges that use of the QZ modifier constitutes \"an express representation to the government that a CRNA,\n   <em>\n    alone and without any supervision by an anesthesiologist\n   </em>\n   , performed the services in question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66 (emphasis added).) If an anesthesiologist did provide supervision, and the QZ code was still used, relator asserts that this would give rise to FCA liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants vigorously dispute this characterization. Specifically, defendants contest the notion that a CRNA must operate\n   independently and without supervision from an anesthesiologist in order for the QZ code to be employed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 78-1 at 13 (\"There is simply no support, either in the SAC or in the regulations, for Relator's bald assertion that the QZ modifier can only be used if a CRNA works entirely alone and without any form of supervision.\").) Instead, defendants direct the court's attention to the definition contained in the Manual, which states that the QZ code may be used for \"CRNA Service: Without medical direction by a physician.\" (Doc. No. 49-3 at 175.) As discussed above, medical direction is a term of art appearing within the Manual, and there are precise requirements that providers must meet in order to code a service as medically directed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20414.46\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 414.46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(i), 415.110. Defendants claim that under the terms of the Manual, the only restriction on use of the QZ code is that it may not be used to indicate CRNA service that was medically directed. In all other instances, defendants argue that using the QZ code is permissible under the plain language of the regulations. Stated differently, defendants contend the QZ code functions as something of a catch-all provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties have not directed the court to any prior cases interpreting this particular set of regulations, leaving the court only with the Manual itself and the parties' arguments for guidance. Nonetheless, having examined the Manual, the court finds that defendants' interpretation of the scope of the QZ code is more persuasive. Relator has not provided any legal authority stating that the QZ code may\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be used in the absence of supervision by an anesthesiologist, and such a reading is not apparent from the text of the Manual. To the contrary, the most natural reading of the Manual is that unless the service was medically directed, the QZ code may be employed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Manual states only that the QZ code is to be used where CRNAs provide anesthesia services \"without medical direction by a physician.\" (Doc. No. 49-3 at 175.) That language does not suggest that CRNAs must operate independently in order to use the QZ code-it merely states that the QZ code may not be used if all of the requirements for medical direction have been satisfied. Outside of that scenario, use of the QZ code does not appear to be prohibited by any rule or regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This interpretation is bolstered by other regulations promulgated by CMS. For instance, CMS regulations provide that in order for an anesthesiologist to bill for \"personally performed\" services, the physician must \"perform[ ] the entire anesthesia service alone.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20414.46\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(i). CMS did not include a corresponding provision in the regulations governing CRNA billing, although it could have done so, for instance by stating that the QZ code may be used when the CRNA \"performs the entire anesthesia service alone.\" The fact that such language is absent from the regulations governing use of the QZ code indicates that that CRNAs are not required to operate independently in order for the QZ code to be employed. Consequently, use of the QZ code was not false\n   or misleading simply because a CRNA performed the service with supervision. Defendants' motions to dismiss the QZ code claims based on relator's express certification theory will therefore be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Implied False Certification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Relator also attempts to state a claim based on an implied false certification theory. In this regard, the SAC alleges, \"[d]efendants submitted demands for payment that contained false implied certifications that they had complied with the TEFRA regulations applicable to their billing decision.\" (SAC at \u00b6 69.) Defendants also move to dismiss the claim based on this theory to the extent it concerns the QZ code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It is unclear from the face of the SAC which TEFRA regulations relator is referring to in advancing this claim. However, at the hearing on defendants' motions to dismiss, relator's counsel clarified that relator is alleging violations of \"all seven\" TEFRA regulations. (Doc. No. 88 at 19:23-25.) The court interprets this statement as referring to the seven requirements that must be met in order to code an anesthesiology procedure as medically directed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20414.46\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 414.46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(i), 415.110. However, these regulations appear to have little relation to the QZ code, instead relating only to billing for medical direction. As the court understands the regulatory scheme at issue here, the only conceivable relationship between those seven TEFRA regulations and the QZ code relates to the matters discussed above-namely, that the QZ code cannot be used if all seven requirements for medical direction are satisfied. Both parties appear to agree that doing so could potentially give rise to FCA liability. However, at oral argument, relator's counsel confirmed that the SAC contains no allegations that the QZ code was used in instances where the requirements for medical direction were all satisfied. (Doc. No. 88 at 5:10-16.) Absent such an allegation, the court concludes that a violation of any of the seven TEFRA regulations, even if proven, would have no bearing on defendants' use of the QZ code. Accordingly, defendants' motions to dismiss relator's first, second, and third causes of action to the extent they are based on the alleged use of the QZ code will be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Dismissal Premised on Alleged False Claims Prior to March 3, 2014\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant PST next argues that all of relator's claims brought against it should be dismissed to the extent they are based on alleged false claims submitted prior to March 3, 2014. Defendant PST points out that none of the allegations prior to that date alleges any involvement by defendant PST. Relator does not oppose this argument on its merits. Indeed, the SAC specifically alleges that on or about March 3, 2014, \"PAS/Somnia engaged PST Services ... to handle their billing and to 'fix' the problems that were becoming too obvious and overwhelming to manage.\" (SAC at \u00b6 95.) Thus, on the face of the SAC, PST is alleged to have had no involvement in any of the billing or coding allegations until that date. Instead, relator requests that the court deny the motion because the\n   court has implicitly rejected this argument in its prior order or, alternatively, because defendant PST failed to raise it in its first motion to dismiss and should be precluded from doing so now. (Doc. No. 81 at 15-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In its first motion to dismiss, defendant PST did not specifically argue for dismissal on this basis, although it could have done so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 45.) Nonetheless, as discussed above, the court does not find that defendant PST is precluded from advancing the argument now for the first time. Moreover, the court finds that defendant PST's argument is well taken given the SAC's explicit allegation that PST was not involved in any of the alleged coding and billing improprieties until March 3, 2014. (SAC at \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.) Accordingly, the court will grant defendant PST's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the court addresses relator's request that if the court grants the pending motions to dismiss, that it also grant further leave to amend the SAC. (Doc. No. 80 at 25.) \"A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within: (A) 21 days after serving it or (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\" Fed.

At oral argument, relator's counsel confirmed that the SAC contains no factual allegation that the QZ code was used even though all seven of the requirements for medical direction were met. Under the analysis set forth above, that factual scenario would appear to be the only instance in which employment of the QZ code to indicate CRNA service could plausibly give rise to liability under the FCA as a matter of law. Relator's counsel also confirmed at the hearing that the SAC contains no allegations of any FCA or CFCA violations by defendant PST prior to March 3, 2014, and did not suggest that relator could make any such allegations in good faith. The court also\n   notes that relator has already been given multiple opportunities to amend her complaint, and that this case remains at the pleading stage despite having been filed more than three years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Under these circumstances, the court finds that granting further leave to amend would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonin v.

The court previously dismissed the claims at issue here in its prior order. (Doc. No. 70 at 23.) Having now done so for a second time, the court is convinced that relator cannot adequately allege an FCA or CFCA claim based upon alleged misuse of the QZ code, nor can it allege any such claims against defendant PST with respect to claims submitted prior to March 3, 2014. Therefore, the granting of further leave to amend is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For these reasons,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   1.
