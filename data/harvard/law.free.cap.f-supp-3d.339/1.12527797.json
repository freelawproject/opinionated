The EA considered alternatives to leasing, including \"no action\" type alternatives,\n   and engaged in American Indian Religious Freedom Act consultation with the Blackfeet Tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (FS-HC-014404).

In May 1988, ARCO requested a suspension of the lease while BLM was considering applications for permits to drill (\"APD\") on other leases in the Badger-Two area, including the leases owned by Fina Oil (subsequently acquired by Solenex LLP) and Chevron,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   6/1/88 DOI Letter to ARCO, J.A.

Vol. I at 106-07 (FS002148-2149). The BLM and Forest Service later withdrew approval to seek further review of traditional practices in the Badger-Two area, but then approved the Fina and Chevron APDs again in 1993.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1/15/93 BLM Letter to Fina Approving APD with Conditions, J.A.

On September 21, 2015, the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation (\"ACHP\") recommended that the Departments of Interior and Agriculture cancel the Solenex lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ACHP Comments, J.A. Vol. VI at 8 (FS006590). Then on March 17, 2016, BLM disapproved Solenex's APD and cancelled its lease, claiming that the initial NEPA and NHPA analyses upon which its leasing decision was based were inadequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late 2016, a Moncrief employee received a phone call informing it that its lease would likely be cancelled as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Answer \u00b6 56; Email Messages, J.A. Vol. 1 at 32 (BLM-M000665). Moncrief's attorneys sent a letter to Interior on November 23, 2016, requesting that the lease not be cancelled and also requesting a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/23/16 WPD&amp;N Letter, J.A. Vol. 1 at 84-85 (BLM-M000801-802). Interior\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   responded to Moncrief's request for a hearing, but sent a letter decision administratively cancelling the Moncrief Lease on January 6, 2017, in the waning days of the Obama administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1/6/17 Letter to Moncrief, J.A. Vol. 1 at 36-48 (BLM-M000670-682).

Vol. 1 at 83 (BLM-M00800). Moncrief filed suit against Interior and BLM in this court on April 5, 2017.

NHPA, or other statutes, warrants\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser protection. Defs.' Mot. at 20. But that argument is entirely circular! Defendants cannot at once argue that a violation of NEPA and NHPA renders a lease \"subject to cancellation\" under its regulations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203108.3\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3108.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and\n   at the same time deprive plaintiff of the the exception in those same regulations prohibiting cancellation \"to the extent that such an action adversely affects the title or interest of a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   purchaser.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203108.4\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3108.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is too clever by half. Neither a literal, nor a logical, reading of the agency's regulations could support such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff Moncrief easily qualifies for bona fide purchaser status because he tendered valuable consideration to his predecessor-in-interest, ARCO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moncrief Decl. [Dkt. # 19-2] \u00b6 2. There is no evidence that he did not acquire his interest in good faith. And as for notice, notice of continued suspensions while an EIS was conducted on APDs on\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   leases is hardly notice that his lease was void for the reasons already outlined above. Indeed, Moncrief's predecessor, ARCO, requested the suspension on the understanding that it would \"terminate upon completion of the Environmental Impact Statement for [the] pending application[s].\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   6/1/88 DOI Letter to ARCO, J.A. Vol. I at 68 (BLM-M000746); Pl.'s Mot. at 11. And the suggestion of voidness is further rebutted by Interior's failure to cancel the lease to remedy the supposed violation for more than thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because I find a violation of the APA on the grounds above, I need not reach Moncrief's additional arguments that the Secretary's cancellation violated his due process rights and was time barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, I find that federal defendants' decision to cancel the Moncrief lease was arbitrary and capricious. Thus, for all of the reasons outlined in this Opinion, plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 19] is GRANTED, defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 21] and defendant-intervenor's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 24] are DENIED, and this case is remanded to the Department of Interior with the order that the Moncrief lease be REINSTATED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Also before this court is a challenge to the Secretary's cancellation of the lease previously held by plaintiff Solenex LLC.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Solenex LLC v.
