It retains the constitutional power to decide whether charged conduct is serious \"enough\" to be considered a felony. If found guilty of a federal felony,\n   Congress long ago decided to bar federal felons from possessing firearms. Encouraged by recently successful challenges to this lifetime ban based on district courts' analysis of the seriousness of certain state crimes, a presently law-abiding businessman convicted of a federal criminal conspiracy felony over thirteen years ago now asks us to declare Congress' ban on his firearm possession unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. Unlike the state convictions at issue in other cases, there can be no dispute Congress defined his criminal conspiracy conduct as \"serious\" - Congress declared his conduct is a felony. He is barred from possessing a firearm. We lack the authority to ignore Congress' definition because of rehabilitation after an offense occurring over a decade ago or because the felon's involvement in the conspiracy may have been minimal. Those arguments are for sentencing. We decline the businessman's request to ignore Congress' felony definition given the Supreme Court's recognition of the constitutional propriety of banning firearms from federal felons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The United States moves to dismiss Mr. Tripodi's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States argues Congress defined his conspiracy\n   conviction as a serious criminal offense and disqualified him from exercising the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. Mr. Tripodi argues his non-violent felony conviction is aged, the court sentenced him to probation instead of jail time, and he played only a minor role in the conspiracy. He disagrees with Congress' view of the seriousness of his crime. Unlike ambiguity in understanding whether a certain conviction under state law is a serious offense warranting the statutory disqualification as now challenged in a variety of contexts described below, we are today addressing Congress' clear intent defining Mr. Tripodi's conduct as serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To properly situate the parties' arguments, we first survey relevant authority addressing Second Amendment challenges after the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

In the years since, our Court of Appeals clarified the standard we apply when reviewing Second Amendment as-applied challenges when reviewing precedent state crime convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In doing so, our Court of Appeals interpreted\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   as setting out \"exceptions to the right to bear arms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second Amendment, our Court of Appeals continued, \"affords no protection for the possession of dangerous and unusual weapons, possession by felons and the mentally ill, and the carrying of weapons in certain sensitive places.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals continued, \"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   suggests, and many of our sister circuits have held, a felony conviction disqualifies an individual from asserting\" his or her Second Amendment right \"for defense of hearth and home ... even if a felon arguably possesses just as strong an interest in defending himself and his home as any law-abiding individual.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Marzzarella's challenge did not fall clearly within the Supreme Court's list of exceptions to the Second Amendment. Our Court of Appeals, however, nevertheless announced a two-pronged approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   This approach requires we \"ask whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment's guarantee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the challenged law does not burden conduct protected by the Second Amendment, \"our inquiry is complete,\" but if it does burden protected conduct, we apply means-end scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Court of Appeals concluded it \"c[ould] [not] be certain that the possession of unmarked firearms in the home is\n   excluded from the right to bear arms\" but concluded the statute would in any event satisfy means-end scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court applied intermediate scrutiny but held \u00a7 922(k) would pass muster under even strict scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A year after\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   , our Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mr. Tripodi fails to allege a plausible claim under the Second Amendment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The United States argues Mr. Tripodi's Second Amendment claim fails at step one of the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   analysis because this court convicted him of a serious crime and he is categorically disqualified from exercising rights under the Second Amendment. Mr. Tripodi argues he is a peaceful, rehabilitated member of society and he had a nominal role in the conspiracy; under\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , he contends, we must restore his Second Amendment right to bear arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Tripodi's emphasis on\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   is not persuasive today. The predicate offenses at issue in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   were state law crimes labeled by Pennsylvania and Maryland as misdemeanors, despite their potential punishments of at least least two years in prison. Our Court of Appeals thus endeavored to discern whether the crimes were nonetheless sufficiently serious, despite their misdemeanor label. Judge Ambro addressed the relevance of this distinction in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , emphasizing a legislature's choice to call a crime a misdemeanor carries \"an indication of non-seriousness that is lacking when it opts instead to use the felony label.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , Judge Ambro instructed, should be read as \"limited to the cases before [our Court of Appeals], which involve[d] state-law misdemeanants bringing as-applied Second Amendment challenges to \u00a7 922(g)(1).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Tripodi's predicate offense, by contrast, carries no such indicia of non-seriousness. Congress chose to punish conspiracy in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as a Class E federal felony offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, each of the offenses Mr. Tripodi conspired to commit are also felonies. In these circumstances, Mr. Tripodi's burden is \"extraordinarily high-and perhaps even insurmountable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   He committed an offense defined by the sovereign as serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently studied dispositive evidence of seriousness in the sovereign's decision to label the predicate offense a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States urges we do the same. We need not answer this question today, because Mr. Tripodi does not satisfy his high burden of distinguishing himself from other felons historically excluded from the right to bear arms. Mr. Tripodi alleges his felony conspiracy conviction is aged, for a non-violent offense, and he has since led a peaceful and productive life. These considerations, however, are irrelevant to our analysis. Our Court of Appeals cautions \"the passage of time or evidence of rehabilitation\" are irrelevant to the question of whether Mr. Tripodi committed a serious crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, \"[t]he category of 'unvirtuous citizens' \" excluded from Second Amendment\n   protection is \"broader than violent criminals; it covers any person who has committed a serious criminal offense, violent or nonviolent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We are left with Mr. Tripodi's remaining argument: his \"nominal\" role in the conspiracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   We first do not accept Mr. Tripodi's assumption we assess seriousness in relation to the other members of the conspiracy. Mr. Tripodi cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Collado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   a sentencing appeal, for support. Our Second Amendment doctrine, however, focuses on the seriousness of the particular offense at issue. But to the extent we consider it, we have no basis to describe Mr. Tripodi's role in the conspiracy as \"nominal.\" He admitted to purchasing over $15,000 in goods purchased on credit cards stolen from individuals throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey, serving as a demand-side buyer in a large-scale theft ring with numerous victims. Even if we confined our analysis solely to the elements of the offense, we would reach the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We find support for our analysis in Judge McHugh's recent well-reasoned opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Irving\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Irving argued his predicate state law conviction to tampering with public records with an intent to defraud is not sufficiently serious to ban gun possession under\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth classified Mr. Irving's predicate offense \"as a third-degree felony punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like Mr. Tripodi, \"a single, non-violent felony conviction\" subjected Mr. Irving to \u00a7 922(g)(1)'s firearm ban.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also like Mr. Tripodi, the court sentenced Mr. Irving to two years' probation with no jail time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Judge McHugh rejected Mr. Irving's Second Amendment challenge after surveying and applying\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   's fractured analysis. Like Judge McHugh, we find persuasive, even if not dispositive, the sovereign's felony label, indicating seriousness confirmed by both the elements of the conspiracy offense and the specific conduct underlying it. Judge McHugh concluded \"little weight should be placed on the leniency of [Mr. Irving's] prior sentencing court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Mr. Tripodi has no subsequent criminal history, his crime, like Mr. Irving's, had many victims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Tripodi's federal felony conviction bars him from possessing a firearm. Congress has defined his conduct as serious.
