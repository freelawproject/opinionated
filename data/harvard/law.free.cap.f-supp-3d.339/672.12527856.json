Rasor, and Eric J. Weiss's motion to reconsider and revise the July 16, 2018, Order imposing sanctions [ECF No. 363], ECF No. 383. The Court has been advised, having reviewed the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law. For the reasons stated below, the Court denies the motion for reconsideration and assesses attorney fees and costs against all Defendants, the Cavitch law firm, and three individual Cavitch Attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 24, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on attorney fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   August 24, 2018,\n   <em>\n    Minutes of Proceedings\n   </em>\n   . Parties filed briefs in support of their positions before (ECF Nos. 367, 372, 377, 402, 421) and after (ECF Nos. 425, 426, 428, 430, 432) the hearing. All Interested Parties and all but three Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were represented at the hearing, and all represented parties made their positions known to the Court. For the reasons that follow, the Court awards attorney fees and costs to Plaintiff KCI in the following amounts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As against all Defendants:\n   <em>\n    $2,464,313.55\n   </em>\n   (accounting for $2,349,346.50 in reasonable attorney fees and $114,967.05 in costs);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As against the Cavitch Law Firm:\n   <em>\n    $365,200.67\n   </em>\n   (accounting for $354,419.00 in reasonable attorney fees and $10,781.67 in costs);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As against Attorney Atsou:\n   <em>\n    $365,200.67\n   </em>\n   (accounting for $354,419.00 in reasonable attorney fees and $10,781.67 in costs); and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As against Attorney Rasor:\n   <em>\n    $365,200.67\n   </em>\n   (accounting for $354,419.00 in reasonable attorney fees and $10,781.67 in costs);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As against Attorney Weiss: $290,488.30 (accounting for $282,600.25 in reasonable attorney fees and $7,888.05 in costs);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   All amounts are joint and several among Defendants, the Cavitch firm, and the Cavitch Attorneys. KCI is entitled to recover no more than $2,464,313.55, plus post-judgment interest, collectively from Defendants and Interested Parties in satisfaction of this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 29, 2018, the Court entered default judgment against Ryan Tennebar, Colin Tennebar, Healthcare Essentials, LLC, Healthcare Essentials, Inc., Healthcare Essentials Medical Devices, LLC, RT Acquisition, Inc., Abel Cortez, Daniel Rader, and Anthony Estrada (\"Defendants\"). ECF No. 360. Shortly thereafter, the Court granted KCI's motion for sanctions against law firm Cavitch Familo &amp; Durkin Co., LPA (\"Cavitch\"), and three individual Cavitch Attorneys Komlavi Atsou, Michael R. Rasor, and Eric J. Weiss (\"Cavitch Attorneys\"). ECF No. 363. In several orders issued in the lead-up to the evidentiary hearing, the Court made clear that, during that hearing, it would not entertain arguments concerning the underlying facts of the misconduct or whether such conduct merited sanctions in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 392, 410, 411. Instead, evidence and arguments were limited narrowly to \"amounts to be paid\" in reasonable attorney fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 363 at PageID#: 6674 n.2. Although it was not discussed at the evidentiary hearing, the Cavitch Attorneys' motion for reconsideration has been fully briefed. ECF Nos. 383; 401; 418. Accordingly, this Order addresses both the motion for reconsideration (ECF No. 383) and the amounts in attorney fees and costs owed by Defendants and Interested Parties to KCI as a result of the default judgment (ECF No. 360) and Order imposing sanctions (ECF No. 363).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Without revisiting every instance of Cavitch and its attorneys' misconduct, it is instructive to summarize. In the Order imposing sanctions, the Court ruled that Cavitch and its attorneys engaged in discovery abuses under Rules 26(g) and 37(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by their:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) misrepresentations made to the Court and KCI during in-person hearings regarding Defendants' prior document discovery productions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) direct assistance in the creation of fabricated and inaccurate \"evidence\" produced to KCI in response to Orders from the Court requiring production;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) actual knowledge of additional false and misleading documents produced in discovery prior to its withdrawal as counsel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) withdrawing [as] counsel in this case without disclosing any of [their] improprieties and without correcting prior, false document productions and false statements to the Court and KCI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ECF No. 363 at PageID#: 6678-79. The Cavitch Attorneys were also sanctioned under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because their false assertions, fabricated evidence, and failure to correct the record unreasonably multiplied proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 363 at PageID#: 6692.

All agree that Benesch's hourly rates are reasonable. Defendants, however, join Cavitch's arguments that the number of billed hours is not reasonable. ECF No. 425;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 430 at PageID#: 7934-36. In its post-hearing brief, Cavitch expressed skepticism that, \"[a]midst a mass of Benesch invoices that total over $2.3 million, [KCI's expert] could not, and did not find one dollar of charges to be excessive.\" ECF No. 430 at PageID#: 7934 n.1.

And because Defendants are mandatorily liable for reasonable attorney fees and costs under RICO, the Court rules that all Defendants are liable to KCI for the entire amount billed by Benesch during this litigation. Over and above the damages assessment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 438), Defendants are liable to KCI for $2,464,313.55 in litigation expenses (that is, $2,349,346.50 in attorney fees and $114,967.05 in costs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , post-judgment interest must be awarded on the entire money judgment, which includes the sum of damages and attorney fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Associated Gen.

First, they argue they were denied due process because they were not timely notified that KCI sought sanctions against them, and as a result they had no meaningful opportunity to defend themselves. ECF No. 383-1 at PageID#: 7353-57. Second, they argue sanctions were inappropriate because the Order imposing sanctions was based on Benesch's \"false and inaccurate statements\" and other errant evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7404698\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/854/1403/#p1408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID#: 7352-53. The Court addresses each argument in turn. Neither argument is well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The thrust of the Cavitch Attorneys' first argument is that, even though\n   <em>\n    the Cavitch firm\n   </em>\n   was on notice of its potential exposure to sanctions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the three individual Cavitch Attorneys were never notified that\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   were also exposed individually until reading KCI's reply brief in support of sanctions (ECF No. 346), by which point the briefing window had closed. ECF No. 383-1 at PageID#: 7355.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This contention is belied by the record and common sense. The Cavitch Attorneys were first put on notice of their exposure to individualized sanctions in May 2015, when Magistrate Judge Baughman ordered them to discuss with their clients \"the possibility and consequences of joint and several liability of the attorneys and parties for monetary sanctions....\" ECF No. 56 at PageID#: 685. Magistrate Judge Baughman warned the individual Cavitch Attorneys about sanctions again in January 2016: \"[The Cavitch Attorneys] are signing under Rule 11 that they have given you everything that exists that they know of....They are going to have to answer for it.\" ECF No. 111 at PageID#: 1882. In the months before KCI filed its Omnibus Motion for Sanctions (ECF No. 333), the Cavitch Attorneys (as individuals) twice articulated awareness of their exposure to sanctions and their willingness to defend themselves or let the Cavitch firm defend them. ECF No. 318 (\"Now comes Cavitch, Familo &amp; Durkin Co., LPA and its attorneys, Eric J. Weiss, Michael Rasor, and Komlavi Atsou....Cavitch submits this brief and remains ready to defend and discredit the accusations lodged against Cavitch and its attorneys.\"); ECF No. 329 (same). Both briefs were signed by Attorneys Weiss, Atsou, and Rasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When KCI filed its Omnibus Motion for Sanctions (ECF No. 333), there was no suggestion or indication that Cavitch and the Cavitch Attorneys would be separately represented. KCI's motion made explicit references to the misconduct of individual attorneys, and it quoted Magistrate Judge Baughman's warnings to the Cavitch Attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 333-1 at PageID#: 5927. Attached to Cavitch's opposition (ECF No. 341) were affidavits individually sworn and signed by Attorneys Weiss, Atsou, and Rasor (ECF Nos. 341-15; 341-16; 341-17). The Attorneys not only had an opportunity to be heard they were heard through affidavits submitted in their defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Cavitch Attorneys plainly were on notice that KCI's pursuit of sanctions against Cavitch included a pursuit of sanctions against them as individuals. But even if they had not demonstrated their actual awareness of misconduct allegations and\n   the possible consequences, the Court would infer it using common sense. Although courts routinely sanction law firms under Rules 26(g) and 37(b), those rules speak of sanctions against\n   <em>\n    attorneys\n   </em>\n   , not firms. The Court has located no precedent in which a court has awarded sanctions against a law firm based on its attorneys' misconduct without also sanctioning the attorneys themselves.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for its part, applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to attorneys as individuals, not to law firms.\n   <em>\n    BDT Prods., Inc. v.

It would be profoundly unusual for the individual Cavitch Attorneys to be excluded from KCI's motion for sanctions, particularly given the past warnings from two judicial officers and the specific allegations of their misconduct in KCI's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In a similar vein, the Cavitch Attorneys argue that they were denied due process because the Court did not hold an evidentiary hearing to assess whether their conduct was sanctionable. ECF No. 383-1 at PageID#: 7354-56. The November 9, 2017, show cause hearing, which preceded KCI's Omnibus Motion for Sanctions by eight days, was not held for the purpose of evaluating attorney misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 331 at PageID#: 5727 (Cavitch and its attorneys' willingness to defend themselves was \"not an issue...at this hearing\").

ECF No. 421. In March 2015, Attorneys Atsou and Rasor represented to Magistrate Judge Baughman that they had complied with KCI's discovery requests that they had produced complete and accurate invoices and inventory spreadsheets and identified all of the VACs in their possession. ECF No. 363 at PageID#: 6675; ECF No. 49 at PageID#: 365-70. Those representations, supported by an affidavit the Attorneys prepared and submitted to the Court, were untrue. ECF No. 363 at PageID#: 6683. According to KCI, if the parties and the Court had had the benefit of honest, non-fraudulent production, all manner of inculpatory material from Ryan Tennebar's hard drive inevitably would have led the Court to enter a preliminary injunction which, KCI argues, would have led immediately to a finding of damages liability on all counts in turn. Instead, Magistrate Judge Baughman denied the motion for a preliminary injunction based on Cavitch and its attorneys' insistence that all relevant discovery had been produced. ECF No. 426 at PageID#: 7858.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   KCI's alternative argument (based on an April 1, 2016, midpoint) relies on similar logic.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/#p1184\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID#: 7857.

ECF No. 341 at PageID#: 6178. The Cavitch Attorneys uncovered a trove of Ryan Tennebar's emails, revealing that (1) Defendants were undoubtedly liable on KCI's claims and (2) Defendants and Cavitch's conduct during discovery had been fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 333-1 at PageID#: 5922-23; ECF No. 363 at PageID#: 6683-93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   After they were discharged by their clients in early April 2016, the Cavitch Attorneys moved to withdraw as counsel.

ECF No. 136. But the Cavitch Attorneys did not take that\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   opportunity to alert the Court that it had been defrauded, nor did they take the opportunity to correct the record as to their prior misrepresentations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 233 at PageID#: 4222; ECF No. 363 at PageID#: 6676 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Before their withdrawal as counsel, the Cavitch Attorneys did not produce any information from the newly-uncovered Jurinnov hard drive (that is, the material on Ryan Tennebar's computer).

In its primary argument, KCI suggests that a preliminary injunction order would have all but ended the case. But the Court eventually did enter a preliminary injunction against Defendants on June 29, 2016, ECF No. 161, but the Court did not find KCI liable for damages until two years later. ECF No. 360. In its alternative argument, KCI suggests that production of the Jurinnov hard drive would have all but ended the case. But KCI eventually did obtain the Jurinnov hard drive on October 6, 2016, ECF No. 253, and yet, litigation persisted. Even after the Court entered a preliminary injunction and KCI obtained the Jurinnov hard drive, KCI spent roughly eighteen months filing motions and building a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 359 (KCI's final motion prior to default judgment [ECF No. 360] filed on March 30, 2018).

Cavitch's expert acknowledged on cross-examination that \"virtually all\" of the billing entries she marked as relevant featured the name \"Cavitch,\" the word \"sanctions,\" or the term \"show cause.\" August 24, 2018,\n   <em>\n    Evidentiary Hearing\n   </em>\n   .

No matter how resolute Defendants' resistance to produce discovery, such frauds on the Court could only have been conducted and facilitated by attorneys. And, of course, the Cavitch Attorneys' failure to satisfy their duty of candor to the Court, itself the but-for cause of countless motions, hearings, and orders in this case, is a class of misconduct uniquely pertinent to attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio R.

On October 6, 2016, more than eight months later, KCI finally gained access to all the information the Cavitch Attorneys had long before insisted they had already produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Between January 25, 2016, and October 6, 2016, the docket featured such events as motions to quash subpoenas, motions to compel compliance, a motion and a hearing on a preliminary injunction (later amended, then modified again), a motion to dismiss\n   for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, a motion for judgment on the pleadings, an emergency motion to show cause (itself accompanied by thirteen docket entries including briefs, orders, and a hearing), a contempt order, lawyer depositions, and another motion to show cause (accompanied by eight docket entries of its own), among other disputes. That roughly eight-month period of whiplash litigation concluded with several orders ensuring that KCI had access to physical and digital evidence that the Cavitch Attorneys insisted long before they had already produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 254, 260, 263.

Cavitch's argument on this point reduces to a recitation of\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   's holding: Sanction awards, when they involve attorney fees and costs, should be allocated between Defendants and their attorneys to the extent that each one caused their opponents to incur fees and costs in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 430 at PageID#: 7947-51.

It is, of course, also true that Defendants' own discovery abuses (or at least, Ryan and Colin Tennebar's discovery abuses) were the but-for cause of that amount and more. They filed false affidavits, refused to produce relevant communications and documents, fabricated invoices and inventory spreadsheets, destroyed digital and physical evidence, and intimidated at least two witnesses.

Even with obstreperous clients, they had a clear duty to produce relevant information in discovery, to be truthful to the Court, to correct the record when they were untruthful or discovered they had been mistaken, and to apprise the Court of their clients' and their own discovery violations. Nor does any of the above disturb the but-for chain of causation between the Cavitch Attorneys' misconduct and KCI's incurrence of fees and costs. Had the Cavitch Attorneys satisfied their discovery obligations or other ethical obligations, the Court would have been able to step in to prevent the litigation from needless protraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Because Defendants' own discovery behavior was equally harmful to KCI, however, Cavitch and its attorneys should not bear the full cost of the misconduct. \" Rule 37 identifies attorneys...overseeing [ ] discovery as possible subjects of sanctions along with their clients and vests the trial court with broad discretion to apportion fault between them....\"\n   <em>\n    Devaney v.
