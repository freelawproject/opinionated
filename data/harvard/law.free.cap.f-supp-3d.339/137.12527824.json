On August 8, 2018, Respondent removed this action to federal court by filing a notice of removal. (Dkt. 1). Presently before the Court is Plaintiff's motion to remand. (Dkt. 3). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's verified petition and the documents submitted for the instant motion to\n   remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 3; Dkt. 10; Dkt. 11; Dkt. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff is a company that gives merchant cash advances to small businesses. (Dkt. 10 at 3). One of those businesses was a grocery store owned by the Judgment Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). On October 11, 2017, the New York State Supreme Court entered two judgments in favor of Plaintiff against the Judgment Debtors-one in the amount of $37,167.16, and the other in the amount of $46,280.61. (Dkt. 3-2 at \u00b6 5). The Judgment Debtors retained Respondent in November 2017, to settle Plaintiff's judgment against them and to manage their debt payments. (Dkt. 12 at \u00b6 4). Respondent provides debt resolution restructuring and negotiation services to small businesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 11-1 at 41). While the record is not clear as to how Respondent's business operates, the record reveals the following: clients transfer funds monthly to an escrow account Respondent maintains for each client (Dkt. 11-1 at 41; Dkt. 11-2 at 4; Dkt. 11-3 at 5-6), and the clients maintain control over the funds (Dkt. 12 at \u00b6 11); however, Respondent withdraws any fees owed to it directly from the accounts (Dkt. 11-3 at 5-6). It is unclear how much control Respondent otherwise maintains over the client funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondent first reached out to Plaintiff in January of 2018, and over the course of the next several months repeatedly attempted to negotiate the terms of the Judgment Debtors' debts to Plaintiff. (Dkt. 11-1 at 5). On April 6, 2018, Plaintiff served Respondent with a subpoena in an attempt to locate funds that could be used to satisfy the judgments it had obtained in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Respondent failed to reply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff alleges the Judgment Debtors fraudulently transferred funds to Respondent \"as part of a scheme to hinder, delay, and defraud [Plaintiff] from recovering on its judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 16, 2018, Plaintiff commenced a post-judgment special proceeding under New York Civil Practice Law &amp; Rules (\"CPLR\") 5225 and 5227 against the Judgment Debtors and Respondent in New York state court to pursue its enforcement remedies. (Dkt. 3-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13). The state court set a hearing on the matter for August 9, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). On August 8, 2018, the evening before the hearing on the post-judgment special proceeding, Respondent\n   filed a notice of removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant motion to remand to state court on August 15, 2018. (Dkt. 3). Respondent replied to the motion on September 5, 2018 (Dkt. 10), and Plaintiff submitted its response on September 12, 2018 (Dkt. 17). Plaintiff contends that the matter currently before the Court is an ancillary proceeding not subject to removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 3 at 5-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) authorizes federal courts to remand a case \"on the basis of any defect in removal procedure\" or because \"the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    LaFarge Coppee v.
