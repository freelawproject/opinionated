(Lewis &amp; Clark) sued Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff Carstensen Contracting, Inc. (Carstensen) in South Dakota state court alleging breach of contract. Carstensen removed the case to this Court and filed a third-party action against Third-Party Defendant Ameron Water Transmission Group, LLC (Ameron). Ameron filed a Motion to Transfer Venue to the District of Minnesota under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Doc. 13, which Lewis &amp; Clark opposed, Doc. 16.

Facts Pertinent to Motion to Transfer\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lewis &amp; Clark's breach of contract action, commenced under South Dakota law by serving a Summons on Carstensen on May 17, 2018, concerns part of a massive multistate treated water pipeline system (the System) to bring potable water from the Missouri River to communities in eastern South Dakota, southwest Minnesota, and northwest Iowa. Doc. 1 at 1; Doc. 10 at \u00b6 7. The System started in 2003, and, when complete, the System will span over 330 miles of total pipeline. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 13. The System is funded by federal, state, and local monies. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 15. The State of Minnesota has already funded $5.45 million to the System. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lewis &amp; Clark contracted with Carstensen to install approximately ten miles of pipeline for the System, roughly between Magnolia and Adrian, Minnesota (the Project). Doc. 10 at \u00b6 6. Specifically, the contract calls for Carstensen to install twenty-inch diameter steel pipe with a polyurethane exterior coating exhibiting a minimum adhesion strength of 1,750 pounds per square inch (psi) post-installation and 2,500 psi pre-installation. Doc. 1-1 at 5. The contract between Lewis &amp; Clark and Carstensen provides that the governing law will be \"the state in which the Project is located.\" Doc. 10-1 at \u00b6 17.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To perform the contract with Lewis &amp; Clark, Carstensen issued a Purchase Order to Ameron to supply the pipes for the Project. Doc. 10-2. The Purchase Order contains detailed specifications for the ordered pipes. Doc. 10-2. Additionally, the Purchase Order states that \"[Carstensen] and [Ameron] hereby submit to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Minnesota.\" Doc. 10-2 at \u00b6 17 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The pipes supplied by Ameron and installed by Carstensen allegedly did not meet the agreed to specifications, and Lewis &amp; Clark believes that about nine of the ten miles of pipes must be replaced. Doc. 16 at 2. On March 28, 2018, the Project engineer, Banner Associates, notified Carstensen that the pipes were being rejected because of defective coating. Doc. 17-3. Carstensen maintains that the alleged failure of the pipes to meet the coating specifications is due to manufacturing problems in Mexico encountered by Ameron. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 17, 2018, Carstensen received an email from Lewis &amp; Clark that stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Carstensen and AMERON have long said they will \"make Lewis &amp; Clark whole ....\" Be assured we will have no choice but to vigorously pursue every legal avenue possible to ensure that happens .... At the end of the day, if this must proceed to court, it will be a simple case from L &amp; C's perspective: it is undisputed L &amp; C did not get what it paid for and a local jury (including the taxpayers who paid the original bill) will be eager to make sure L &amp; C collects every dime it is entitled to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Doc. 10-3 at 3. Carstensen forwarded this email to Ameron, advising Ameron that \"[Lewis &amp; Clark is] growing very impatient with us .... I [l]ook forward to Ameron[']s response ....\" Doc. 10-3 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After receiving this email, Ameron, according to Lewis &amp; Clark, \"went dark for a month.\" Doc. 16 at 7. On May 15, 2018, Carstensen received Ameron's draft Complaint for Declaratory Relief against Carstensen, Lewis &amp; Clark, Rustnot Corrosion Control Services, Inc. (Rustnot), and William Spickelmire (Spickelmire).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 26 at 5; Doc. 11 at 1.

On May 21, 2018, Lewis &amp; Clark served counsel for Carstensen with a copy of its Complaint alleging breach of contract. Doc. 1-1 at 2-4. Lewis &amp; Clark seeks to recover: (a) the expense to remove and replace the defective pipe; (b) liquidated damages totaling $1,350/day from November 17, 2017, to the date the project is substantially complete; and (c) consequential damages. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ameron's motion to transfer argues that the factors analyzed under \u00a7 1404(a) justify transfer to the District of Minnesota. Lewis &amp; Clark responds that its choice of venue in South Dakota is proper under the \"first-filed rule,\" but Ameron questions whether Lewis &amp; Clark's action deserves any deference as being first-filed. Whether a suit is first-filed or whether transfer is justified under \u00a7 1404(a) are separate questions with separate analyses.\n   <em>\n    Zimmer Enters., Inc. v.

Lewis &amp; Clark is a South Dakota corporation with its principal place of business in Tea, South Dakota, which is very close to Sioux Falls. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 3. Carstensen is a Minnesota corporation with its principal place of business in Pipestone, Minnesota, which is in southwestern Minnesota. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 10. The Sioux Falls federal courthouse is about a forty-five-minute drive from Pipestone, but the nearest District of Minnesota courthouse in downtown Minneapolis is about a four-hour drive from Pipestone. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 10. Carstensen made known at the hearing that it opposes transfer of venue because litigation in the District of Minnesota is less convenient to it. Doc. 40. Ameron is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Doc. 40. Neither the District of South Dakota nor the District of Minnesota is a particularly convenient forum for Ameron, although there are substantially more flights into the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport than into Sioux Falls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, the convenience of the witnesses likewise seems to weigh in favor of retaining venue in the District of South Dakota. \"The party seeking the transfer must identify, typically by affidavit, the key witnesses to be called, state their residence, and provide at least a general summary of what their testimony will cover.\"\n   <em>\n    Hylland v. Flaum\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:16-CV-04060-RAL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206901267\">\n    2016 WL 6901267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D.S.D. Nov. 22, 2016) (quoting 15 Charles Alan Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3851 (4th ed.) ). Ameron has not done so, but has stated, \"Carstensen's employees who worked on the project ... are in [Minnesota].\" Doc. 13 at 7. However, Ameron did not identify which Carstensen's employees would be witnesses at trial or what their testimony would be, Doc. 13 at 7, and Carstensen itself views the District of South Dakota as more convenient to its employees, Doc. 40. Banner Associates, the Project engineer, is headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and many of the Lewis &amp; Clark affiliated witnesses are in or near Sioux Falls. Doc. 17 at \u00b6 6; Doc. 17-3. Other witnesses, such as those from Ameron and Rustnot, appear to\n   be located outside of either South Dakota or Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Third, the accessibility to records and documents does not militate for transfer. Lewis &amp; Clark's records are in South Dakota, Banner Associates' records are in South Dakota, Carstensen's records are in Pipestone within the state of Minnesota but geographically far closer to the Sioux Falls federal courthouse than any Minnesota federal courthouse, and Ameron and other potential witness records appear to be located outside of Minnesota or South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Fourth, the location where the conduct complained of occurred-here the location of the Project-is in Minnesota, albeit in the southwest corner of Minnesota. The Project is located between Magnolia and Adrian, Minnesota. Doc. 10 at \u00b6 6. Magnolia is in Rock County and Adrian is in Nobles County, Minnesota, which both are in the division of the District of Minnesota where cases are heard in Minneapolis. However, Magnolia is within 40 miles of the courthouse for the Southern Division of the District of South Dakota in Sioux Falls and is some 200 miles from the federal courthouse in Minneapolis. Adrian, in turn, is about 50 miles from Sioux Falls and about 190 miles from the Minneapolis federal courthouse. Therefore, when considering convenience, the location of the Project actually weighs against transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Only the fifth convenience factor-the application of each state's forum law-weighs in favor of transfer. Minnesota law governs the contract dispute between Lewis &amp; Clark and Carstensen, as well as the Purchase Order between Carstensen and Ameron. Doc. 13 at 3; Doc. 10-1 at \u00b6 17.05. The presence of a choice-of-law clause is a relevant factor for the Court to consider, but it is not dispositive.\n   <em>\n    ComputerUser.com, Inc. v. Tech. Publ'ns, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. Civ. 02-832(MJDJGL),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201634119\">\n    2002 WL 1634119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D. Minn. July 20, 2002). Here, although the contract contains a Minnesota choice-of-law clause, there appear to be no particularly complicated or unique issues of state law that must be resolved. Although the fifth convenience factor favors venue in Minnesota, the other four convenience factors weigh in favor of venue remaining in the District of South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Interest of Justice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Section 1404(a) directs courts to consider the \"interest of justice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Ameron contends that the interest of justice requires this case to be transferred to Minnesota because \"[t]he purchase order between Ameron and Carstensen contains a Minnesota forum selection clause.\" Doc. 10-2 at \u00b6 17.

The clause explicitly states that jurisdiction is \"nonexclusive\" making the clause permissive and thus does not exclude jurisdiction or venue in South Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

The parties have not provided a great amount of information about anticipated litigation costs, but shifting the forum to Minnesota would make the litigation costlier for Lewis &amp; Clark, a South Dakota corporation headquartered near Sioux Falls, and Carstensen, a Pipestone, Minnesota, business located within an hour of Sioux Falls yet about four hours from the Minneapolis federal courthouse. Ameron's other argument about judicial economy is addressed under the\n   <em>\n    Terra International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   factors below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ameron claims that Lewis &amp; Clark was \"looking to South Dakota as a more favorable forum[ ] and threatened Carstensen that [ ] they were intending to use their local advantage to deprive Defendants of a fair trial.\" Doc. 13 at 11. Carstensen, however, does not join in seeking transfer of venue and thus appears not to share Ameron's concern about a parochial federal jury pool in the Southern Division of the District of South Dakota. Lewis &amp; Clark's email stated, \"a local jury (including taxpayers who paid the original bill) will be eager to make sure L &amp; C collects every dime it is entitled to,\" Doc. 10-3 at 3, leaving it ambiguous as to whether Lewis &amp; Clark was referring to taxpayers in South Dakota or Minnesota. After all, the State of Minnesota already has funded $5.45 million to the System. Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6 15. Therefore, the \"advantage\" Ameron fears is present in both South Dakota and Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Terra International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   commented that a district court had \"meticulously analyzed\" the interest of justice under \u00a7 1404(a) by considering seven factors: \"(1) judicial economy, (2) the plaintiff's choice of forum, (3) the comparative costs to the parties of litigating in each forum, (4) each party's ability to enforce a judgment, (5) obstacles to a fair trial, (6) conflict of law issues, and (7) the advantages of having a local court determine questions of local law.\"\n   <em>\n    Terra Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199980\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/688/\">\n    119 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consideration of those seven factors ultimately presents a mixed picture of whether the interest of justice favors venue in South Dakota or Minnesota federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, judicial economy favors having the case in a single court where Lewis &amp; Clark can litigate its claim that Carstensen breached the Project contract, where Carstensen can defend and present its claim that any breach stemmed from substandard polyurethane coating on pipe supplied by Ameron, and where Ameron can present its claim that it performed or that specifications for the piping done by Rustnot were improper or invalid. Carstensen is raising no issue of personal jurisdiction over it in South Dakota. Ameron, by contrast, recently filed a motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction over it in South Dakota, Doc. 38, which Lewis &amp; Clark believes Ameron has waived, Doc. 40. Personal jurisdiction over Ameron in Minnesota is not an issue because Ameron consented to jurisdiction in the District of Minnesota under the Purchase Order. Thus, judicial economy may militate in favor of transfer, unless Ameron has waived a personal jurisdiction defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, the plaintiff's choice of forum is generally given considerable deference.\n   <em>\n    Terra Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199980\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/688/\">\n    119 F.3d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This deference is \"based on an assumption that the plaintiff's choice will be a convenient one.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Apple, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3921155\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/909/#p912\">\n    602 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   913 (citing\n   <em>\n    Piper Aircraft Co. v.

This factor favors venue remaining in South Dakota. Third, as discussed above, the comparative costs of litigation likely favor retention of the case in the District of South Dakota. Fourth, each party's ability to enforce a judgment is not much of a factor here, as any judgment against Ameron would have to be transferred to a different state anyway for collection, and this case and the Second Action are both in federal district courts where the process for transfer of judgment for collection would be the same. Fifth, there appear to be no obstacles to a fair trial in either the District of South Dakota or the District of Minnesota. Sixth and seventh, as discussed above, Minnesota law governs all aspects of this case. Thus, there are no particular choice-of-law concerns, but there is some, albeit limited here, interest in having a court in Minnesota decide disputed issues of Minnesota law. There is very little difference in general contract law between Minnesota and South Dakota, so there likely will not be much by way of disputed issues of local law, other than what might relate to Ameron's position that the pipe specifications are invalid because Rustnot and Spickelmire did not have licensure in Minnesota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In short, the\n   <em>\n    Terra International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   interest of justice factors present a mixed picture of whether venue is better in South Dakota or Minnesota federal court. Judicial economy may or may not be served by transfer to Minnesota, and there is some small advantage to having a Minnesota federal court adjudicating Minnesota law. However, Lewis &amp; Clark is entitled to its choice of the forum state of South Dakota, Carstensen (the defendant Lewis &amp; Clark sued) prefers federal court in South Dakota as a venue, and litigation in Sioux Falls on balance probably costs the parties less than litigation in Minneapolis federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Considering all factors relating to the convenience of witnesses and parties in the interest of justice, no combination of the factors in this case outweigh Lewis &amp; Clark's interest in having South Dakota as the forum for this dispute. Neither the convenience of the parties and witnesses nor the interests of justice weigh in favor of transfer. Ameron has not carried its burden of showing that the balance of the \u00a7 1404(a) factors favor transferring this case or that the court should depart from the first-filed rule.

Ameron at the hearing recognized that this provision of the contract should be read as its consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the District of Minnesota.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Rustnot, through its employee, Spickelmire, prepared portions of the contract and bidding documents related to corrosion protection of the pipe for Lewis &amp; Clark. Doc. 10 at \u00b6 12; Doc. 10-1 at 4. Rustnot apparently is headquartered in Boise, Idaho.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Under South Dakota state procedure, a civil suit is deemed commenced upon service of a summons.
