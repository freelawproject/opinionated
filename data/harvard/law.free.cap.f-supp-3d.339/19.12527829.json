Sometimes removing references to the other defendants will make the statement incoherent, other times it can create the false impression that defendant acted alone. To combat these problems courts have tried replacing the name of the other defendant with a letter or symbol (\" 'Z' and I robbed the store\"), indicating that another person was involved but not implicating the defendant by name. Even this procedure has risks, as it may still highlight the fact that another person was involved, and the context can make it obvious that codefendant is that person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   WRIGHT &amp; LEIPOLD ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 224.

The case at hand aligns with the latter distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Only two defendants, Jedi and Britto-Paulino, are charged in the above-captioned case. After careful in camera review of Britto-Paulino's statements, the court finds that Jedi's participation in the incriminating acts is heavily ingrained in Britto-Paulino's statements. Redacting references to Jedi in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   thus proves challenging to the point of impracticality. Even if all references to Jedi are neutralized, a jury could still reasonably infer that Jedi is the second person the statements refer to.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503401\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/185/#p196\">\n    523 U.S. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503401\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/185/#p196\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Vega Molina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972284\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/511/#p520\">\n    407 F.3d at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
