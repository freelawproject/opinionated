Mr. Reeder, as part of his effort to become a State Trooper, enrolled in ISP's 74th class, which ran from July 21, 2014 to December 23, 2014. Deposition of Zachary Parker, Dkt. No. 37-1 (\"Parker Dep.\") at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Academy curriculum consists of 929 hours of required training, which includes physical training and classroom-based training in criminal justice, administrative, and police-related subjects. Deposition of Superintendent Carter, Dkt. Nos. 37-2 and 44 (\"Carter Dep.\") at 99; Deposition of Sargent Russell Garrison, Dkt. Nos. 37-4 and 44 (\"Garrison Dep.\") Ex. 3. The ISP regards the physical training component as \"not something that [one] can simply observe\"; rather, active participation is required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that vein, the ISP retains authority to dismiss from the Academy recruits who fail to satisfy the minimum physical standards set forth by the Indiana Law Enforcement Training Academy (\"ILEA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carter Dep. at 90; Garrison\n   Dep.

Ex. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The essential skills required of a State Trooper trainee are set forth by statute and by the 74th Recruit Academy Policy and Procedures Manual. Garrison Dep. Ex. 11. A recruit must complete rigorous physical training and pass substantive coursework selected by the Superintendent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n    Ind.

The ISP contracts with a third party provider to supply recruits with all meals, and the menus reflect a limited choice of options. Deposition of Major Charles Sorrells, Dkt. Nos. 37-2 and 44 (\"Sorrells Dep.\") at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Superintendent Carter is vested with sole authority to determine recruits' eligibility to graduate from the Academy. Carter Dep. at 101. Upon successful completion of the ISP Academy course, recruits are eligible to apply for State Trooper positions located in various Indiana counties. Recruits are also required to participate in post-graduation training under the instruction of a Field Training Officer (\"FTO\"). Garrison Dep. at 105. The duration of this final stage of training is fourteen weeks, which allows a recruit to obtain capstone training and experience from a veteran trooper. Sorrells Dep. at 117.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiff's Attendance at the Academy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Reeder enrolled in and began attending the ISP Academy in July 2014. Within a few months, during his fifteenth and sixteenth weeks, he began experiencing significant back pain. Deposition of Dillon Reeder, Dkt. No. 37-3 and 44 (\"Reeder Dep.\") at 26, 28, 30. A few weeks following the onset of his back pain during the Academy's eighteenth week, he sought medical treatment on November 7, 2014 at Indiana University Hospital in Martinsville, Indiana, and was diagnosed with having uncontrolled Type 1 diabetes. Dr. Thomas Lahr, M.D. admitted him to St. Francis Hospital to undergo glucose reduction and insulin treatment in an effort to stabilize his condition. As a result, he missed four days of classroom-based training offered that week. Reeder Dep. at 24. Mr. Reeder testified that at the time of his diagnosis he had lost over fifty pounds from the first day he enrolled in the Academy. Reeder Dep. at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Mr. Reeder, Major Sorrells, the Academy's Human Resources officer, visited him at Indiana University Hospital in Martinsville on November 9, 2014, and again at St. Francis Hospital on November 10 and 12, 2014. Reeder Dep. at 29-30. Mr. Reeder testified that Major Sorrells informed him that a recording was being made of the classroom sessions during his hospitalization which would allow him to catch up with the missed presentations upon his return.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to his release from St. Francis Hospital on November 10, 2014, Mr. Reeder's physician provided him with guidelines and recommendations for meals and warned him against engaging in strenuous exercise which could negatively affect his blood sugar levels. Reeder Dep. at 38. Mr.\n   Reeder was advised to request that the Academy make available to him an appropriate meal plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Reeder testified that Major Sorrells was present during this discussion with the discharging physician.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Reeder maintains that Major Sorrells informed him that he had satisfied most of the requirements for becoming a State Trooper, needing only at that point to \"log classroom hours\" following his return to the Academy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He recalls that Major Sorrells promised to arrange for an appropriate meal plan for him at the Academy and to assist him in securing a post-graduation job in the county closest to Mr. Reeder's hometown to allow him to continue his medical appointments.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 33. Major Sorrells, however, denies having had any specific discussions with Mr. Reeder regarding accommodations following his return to the Academy. Sorrells Dep. at 115-16. In any event, the ISP stresses that only the Superintendent, not Major Sorrells or anyone else, has the authority to determine whether and when a recruit has satisfied the Academy's graduation requirements. Carter Dep. at 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 16, 2014, one day prior to Mr. Reeder's return to the Academy, Gary Midla, D.O., Mr. Reeder's family physician, cleared Mr. Reeder to return to the classroom but issued a written report to the ISP notifying ISP that Mr. Reeder was \"not yet able to tolerate the rigors of the physical part of his training.\" Garrison Dep. Ex. 9. When Mr. Reeder returned to the Academy on November 17, 2014, he did so with the expectation that he would receive any and all required accommodations necessitated by his medical condition. Reeder Dep. at 96, 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Reeder asserts that for the most part his dietary needs were not met; only on a handful of occasions during the first few days after his return to the Academy were his meals properly adjusted. Reeder Dep. at 41-43, 61. The ISP explains that it did its best to accommodate Mr. Reeder's dietary needs, given its contractual relationship with the third party food service provider. Defendant's Answers to Plaintiff's Interrogatories, Dkt. 37-7 (\"Defendant's Answers\") at 3. During mealtimes, Mr. Reeder reported that he personally assumed responsibility for his meals by limiting his intake to foods lower in carbohydrates and substituting other fare with specially made turkey sandwiches. Reeder Dep. at 36, 38-39. On his first day back at the Academy, the ISP permitted Mr. Reeder to access snacks between meals, which had been delivered by his mother. ISP also allowed Mr. Reeder unrestricted access to refrigerated beverages. Defendant's Answers at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Reeder sought to be excused from his physical training courses (Reeder Dep. at 96) but his instructors were unable to accommodate this request. He engaged as much as he could, even while wearing his TDU. Reeder Dep. at 39. However, Mr. Reeder found this activity to be too rigorous for him. Reeder Dep. at 45. On November 21, 2014, Dr. Lahr, Mr. Reeder's family physician, sent a letter to the ISP similar to the one provided by Dr. Midla advising that Mr. Reeder still \"should not be involved in any physical activity.\" Garrison Dep. Ex. 10. This letter was received and read by Major Sorrells. Sorrells Dep. at 32. Nonetheless, Mr. Reeder was required to continue strenuous training, which produced episodes of significant exhaustion for him. Reeder Dep. at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There is no dispute between the parties regarding the fact that any required accommodations to training procedures by the Academy are made on a case-by-case basis. Sorrells Dep. at 94. However, there is a dispute as to whether recruits were on occasion permitted to observe, as opposed to directly participate in, a training activity, a practice Mr. Reeder refers to as \"red-tagging.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Reeder Dep. at 39. Mr. Reeder maintains that the practice of \"red-tagging\" occurred from time to time, though ISP staff apparently remained unaware of its use. Sorrells Dep. at 110-11. To make this point, Mr. Reeder identified certain other recruits who had suffered injuries and were excused from physical training for short periods of time (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one week). In such cases, the recruits were given a \"red tag\" to show they were under restrictions until they were physically able to return to training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reeder Dep. at 61-62. One recruit who had suffered a broken shoulder and was excused from training during the final two or three weeks of Academy training was still permitted to graduate subject to his completion of the missed training. Garrison Dep. at 43; Defendant's Supplemental Answers, Dkt. No. 44 at 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The ISP made various accommodations for Mr. Reeder following his diabetes diagnosis. He was allowed to carry equipment with him for monitoring his blood sugar levels and to notify his instructors if he needed modifications of the physical training. He was allowed to return to his dorm to rest as needed, at his discretion. Defendant's Answers at 3. On certain occasions, he was excused altogether from engaging in training exercises when he was unable to complete them. He was also excused from Evasive Vehicle Operations (\"EVO\") training on an occasion when he did not feel well (Reeder Dep. at 49). Another time, Mr. Reeder was escorted back to his dorm without having completed an exercise called \"night fire.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reeder Dep. at 53-55. Once, his instructor exempted him from an exercise called \"one on one hitman\" since he had previously completed \"two on one hitman.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n    at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At some point, it became clear that Mr. Reeder would be unable to complete all the requirements necessary in order to graduate as a member of the 74th Academy. This determination was reflected in ISP records. Carter Dep. at 101. In December 2014, prior to the recruits' participation in the Quickening Field Scenarios, a strenuous, three-day off-site training exercise in Jennings County referred to as \"the Quickening,\" Mr. Reeder was deemed unqualified to participate. Carter Dep. at 102-03, 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Reeder's Fitness-for-Duty Report and Removal from the Academy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to the Quickening, Mr. Reeder was ordered by the ISP to undergo a Fitness-for-Duty evaluation, which examination and report were completed by Dr. Steven Moffatt, M.D. on December 9, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reeder\n   Dep. at 63. This evaluation was to determine whether Mr. Reeder's medical condition might prevent him from performing the essential functions of a State Trooper position. Moffatt Dep. at 10. Based on the examination, the evaluations by Doctors Midla and Lahr, Dr. Moffatt prepared the following report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Dillion Reeder is a 23 year old Trooper cadet currently in the Academy who presented with substantial weight loss in November 2014 of approximately 42 pounds during the Academy. He was noted to have severe exhaustion and was taken to the emergency room and found to have a blood sugar of over 1200...He was hospitalized for 4 days undergoing glucose reduction and the institution of insulin to control his diabetes Type 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Additionally, while hospitalized he was found to have renal insufficiency secondary to his diabetes crisis...His renal functions have returned to their normal measurements without any significant proteinuria. He has done well with regard to monitoring his blood sugars every 2 hours and providing those to his endocrinologist, Dr. Waddle, who has provided him adjustments in his insulin. He is additionally on a sliding scale regular insulin adjustment. He has no other complications associated with his diabetes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Reeder understands that this disease is his responsibility with regard to his treatment and that he is to be compliant with regard to his insulin dosage. It is also anticipated that in the near term approximately 4-8 weeks he will undergo an insulin pump placement for greater, more accurate control of his diabetes with an anticipation to be released to unrestricted activity. However at this point in time due to his continued episodes of exhaustion, it is recommended that he not be placed in any strenuous physical activity until further insulin adjustment is provided regulating his glucose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   It should also be mentioned that the potential for death due to his initial diagnosis of diabetes with a blood sugar of over 1200 was a significant potential at presentation; however he at this point in time has returned back to normal functioning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In conclusion, Dillon is status post new diagnosis of Type 1 insulindiabetes currently being regulated with insulin and is anticipated to have an insulin pump within the next 4-8 weeks. He has done well with regard to compliance and has undergone nutrition counseling. Prognosis is reasonably good for a return to unrestricted activity in approximately 4-8 weeks after implementation of the insulin\n   pump. It should be noted that I should review his medical condition prior to return to unrestricted duty as a Trooper in approximately 4-8 weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Carter Dep. Ex. 9. Superintendent Carter received this report on December 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On that same day, December 10, 2014, Mr. Reeder was summoned to Superintendent Carter's office (Carter Dep. at 108) where he was informed by Superintendent Carter as follows: \"I regret to inform you that you will not graduate with your class. We realize that you are just too sick to continue.\" Reeder Dep. at 67. Although Superintendent Carter testified that he thought highly of Mr. Reeder, he believed that Mr. Reeder posed a risk of harm to himself. Carter Dep. at 76, 84, 104 (Reeder was \"exactly the kind of guy [the ISP] would want\"), 105 (Mr. Reeder had \"a tremendous amount of character\" and \"a tremendous amount of drive\"). Superintendent Carter's judgment was based on \"the totality of over 20 weeks of training\" and the total picture of [Mr. Reeder's training status]\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he had not been able to fully participate in training). Superintendent Carter told Mr. Reeder that he did not think Reeder could perform the Quickening exercise nor did he believe that due to the restrictions on Mr. Reeder's physical activity throughout the remaining duration of the Academy, any accommodation(s) could have been made that would allow Mr. Reeder to continue on as a recruit to a successful completion of the program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n    at 102, 105, 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Reeder insisted to Superintendent Carter that he believed he could complete the Quickening and begged to be allowed to finish, offering to \"sign anything saying if anything happens to [him], it's [Reeder's] fault.\" Reeder Dep. at 68. Superintendent Carter responded that he thought it unwise and could not bear to have \"on his conscience\" some worse problems befalling Mr. Reeder.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, Superintendent Carter felt compelled to order the removal of Mr. Reeder from the Academy. Carter Dep. at 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Reeder understood that if he refused to resign from the Academy, he would be terminated (Reeder Dep. at 68), which is exactly what happened: Mr. Reeder refused to resign and was removed from the 74th ISP Academy on December 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Defendant's Offer of an Alternative Post and a Position in the 75th Academy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Following Mr. Reeder's departure from the Academy, the ISP offered to employ him as a dispatcher, which offer Mr. Reeder declined. Reeder Dep. at 76-77. Thereafter, the ISP offered to hold a spot for Mr. Reeder in the Academy the following year, in the 75th Academy. Reeder Dep. at 76-77. Mr. Reeder initially accepted this offer, apparently after having spoken with Major Sorrells who recommended that Mr. Reeder focus on getting healthy and return to the 75th Academy class. Reeder Dep. at 75-77. Though Mr. Reeder satisfied all the entry requirements for the 75th Academy class and did not believe he would require any restrictions on his physical activity in order to participate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78), he did believe that he would require a special dietary plan (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 106), and ISP made those arrangements. Deposition of Troy Torrence, Dkt. No. 37-6 (\"Torrence Dep.\") at 2. On the date of his check-in when Mr. Reeder arrived at the Academy, he inquired about the possibility of his taking a \"refresher course\" in lieu of repeating the Academy curriculum. The ISP informed him that such a \"refresher course\" was not an available option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At some point Mr. Reeder apparently learned that Major Sorrells once referred to him as an \"unlucky cocksucker.\" Garrison Dep. at 104-06. Major Sorrells denies making this comment. Sorrells Dep. at 29. Additionally, Mr. Reeder reports that he\n   learned that Major Sorrells and others had expressed concerns that, if he became a State Trooper, the ISP would have \"somebody else on the department that they were paying for the next 25 years that couldn't do the job.\" Garrison Dep. at 85. This was an uncomplimentary reference to a former recruit and current ISP employee, Rex Caldwell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2010-11-2-14\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether anyone with the ISP admits to actually making this statement, we have not been told.

This \"failure to accommodate\" cause of action derives from the statute's provision that the definition of discrimination includes: \"not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the\n   business of the [employer].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bultemeyer v.

The ISP says he was not. Mr. Reeder says he was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The purpose and goal of the Academy is to train recruits to serve in law enforcement positions including in the Indiana State Police. Indiana State Troopers are required to perform physically demanding, even rigorous tasks in connection with the prevention and detection of criminal activity. Trooper trainees must also show a capacity to perform tasks involving the same level of rigor as a full-fledged Trooper. Recruits are required to complete a course of study and training selected by the ISP Superintendent. These requirements are consistent with similar standards recognized and approved by the Seventh Circuit in other cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodrigo v.

Ultimately, despite treatment, his diabetes impeded his ability to complete the required training in the following categories: Firearms, Emergency Vehicle Operations, Defensive Tactics, Physical Training, Quickening Field Scenarios, Spanish for Law Enforcement, Burglary, ARIDE, Field Command, Field Training Program, Crash Investigations, Writing Police Reports, Situational Awareness; Mechanics of Arrest, and Point Control. Garrison Dep. at Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mr. Reeder contends that despite his failure to accomplish the required training in these areas, he was able to perform all of the essential functions of a State Trooper trainee in accordance with the assessments of certain ISP instructors and officials, other than Superintendent Carter. He argues that having successfully passed all Academy courses and conformed to ISP's physical standard for a successful trainee, he was eligible for graduation. Plaintiff's Response Brief, Dkt. No. 46 (\"Pl.'s Resp.\") at 17, 22. Mr. Reeder cites the statements and experiences of other recruits to the effect that that certain elements of the training which he admittedly did not complete were not required as prerequisites for graduation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18, 22, 24-28. Mr. Reeder maintains that if further training were required in order for him to graduate, the ISP had a duty to undertake reasonable accommodations, such as a tailored meal plan appropriate for a diabetic, the suspension of strenuous physical training, and the installation of an insulin pump. These steps, he maintains, would have allowed him to finish the course at the Academy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The ISP rejoins that the uncontroverted evidence makes clear that Mr. Reeder was not a qualified individual entitled to ADA protections, that no reasonable accommodation would have permitted him to continue as part of the 74th Academy class and complete the program, and that the two employment-related options ISP offered to him to continue his relationship with the ISP were reasonable accommodations, which in both circumstances he chose to reject. Def.'s Resp. at 11-16; Defendant's Reply Br., Dkt. No. 50 at 1-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Our review of the record discloses no evidence to support a finding that Mr. Reeder was a qualified individual within the meaning of the ADA. He was permitted by his physicians to return to the Academy following his release from the hospital, but it soon became readily apparent that he was \"not able to tolerate the rigors of the physical part of his training\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 5), with or without accommodations. Following Mr. Reeder's return to the Academy, ISP was advised that Mr. Reeder's doctor's restriction on physical activity must extend through the remainder of the Academy training term and, though his prognosis was \"reasonably good,\" meaning he would likely respond to appropriate treatment and behavior modifications, there was no guarantee that he would ever be able to return to unrestricted activity (Carter Dep. Ex. 9). Mr. Reeder concedes this fact. Pl.'s Br. at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, Mr. Reeder fully admits that he failed to complete the entirety of the educational program necessary to become a State Trooper. Mr. Reeder, relying on Major Sorrells' and Commander Garrison's opinions, maintains that he had demonstrated sufficient physical proficiency to graduate. These opinions do not carry the day here, because, as all agree, only the Superintendent has the authority to determine whether and when a recruit had or would be able to satisfy the Academy's standards and graduation requirements,\n   and he did not share the view of Sorrells and Garrison with regard to Mr. Reeder's eligibility to graduate. Carter Dep. at 101; Garrison Dep. at 50-51 (explaining that he (Garrison) did not have the authority to waive training for individual recruits); Sorrells Dep. at 8 (explaining that he (Sorrells), who works in Human Resources, does not oversee Academy training matters).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The ISP asserts that it was unaware of any accommodation that would have allowed Mr. Reeder to continue to train and complete the course during the 74th Academy, given the seriousness of his condition that was newly-diagnosed at the time. Defendant's Brief in Support of Summary Judgment, Dkt. No. 38 at 9; Def.'s Resp. at 15. In fact, Mr. Reeder has been unable to demonstrate that any reasonable accommodation would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of a State Trooper trainee. He points to his encouraging, positive discussions with Major Sorrells during his hospitalization (Pl.'s Resp. at 20), but complains that the ISP shirked its obligation under the ADA when, upon his return to the Academy, it \"immediately breached its agreement of accommodation by refusing to provide the appropriate diabetic meals and continued to require Reeder to strenuously train.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. It is not clear that proving \"appropriate diabetic meals\" would have been enough to overcome his physical limitations relating to exertion levels. Nor is it clear that the dietary adjustments that were made were inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The ISP persuasively argues that Major Sorrells and Academy instructors were attempting in good faith to find workable accommodations to deal with Mr. Reeder's restrictions from all strenuous physical activity. As Major Sorrells explained, Mr. Reeder's restrictions from strenuous physical activity was for \"a period of time to see if he was going to heal or not, sufficiently, to continue on.\" Sorrells Dep. at 66. The ISP's efforts to work with Mr. Reeder to accommodate his physical restrictions prior to determining that no accommodation proved workable did not foreclose or preempt a final decision by Superintendent Carter or otherwise undermine the legitimacy of its final conclusion that Mr. Reeder was not a qualified individual under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    Sieberns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910533\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/1019/#p1021\">\n    125 F.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[e]mployers should not be discouraged from doing more than the ADA requires even if the extra effort that perhaps raises an applicant's expectations does not work out.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vande Zande v.

To the extent Mr. Reeder's request for a diet that was appropriate for a diabetic and that would have allowed him to complete the Academy would have been a reasonable accommodation but was withheld from him, the ISP's actions do not demonstrate such a failure. In fact, the evidence discloses dietary modifications for an initial period of time after Mr. Reeder's return to the Academy. Thereafter, Mr. Reeder apparently was able to self-regulate\n   his diet on his own by arranging to receive turkey sandwiches from the food service providers, snacks as he personally arranged for, and unlimited access to supplies of water. Dr. Moffatt's or Dr. Lahr's opinions that the provision of such a diet would likely ameliorate Mr. Reeder's circumstances in the short term did not address the restrictions they recommended on his strenuous physical activity for long enough to allow his body begin to recover and his systems normalize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Reeder's request that the ISP provide him with an insulin pump was also not a reasonable accommodation. Had Mr. Reeder arranged for the installation of an insulin pump, the procedure apparently would have required a waiting period of several weeks, which time would have extended past the Academy term. Any demand by him that the ISP either acquire this medical device for him or wait until it could be installed before he returned to the Academy and could graduate from that program was not a reasonable request for accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We conclude that the ISP met its obligations under the ADA to engage with Mr. Reeder in an attempt to identify and implement a reasonable accommodation.\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

Following Mr. Reeder's removal from the Academy's 74th class due to his inability to complete the required training, ISP offered Mr. Reeder a desk job as a civilian dispatcher and, when Mr. Reeder rejected the offer, the ISP offered Mr. Reeder a position in the Academy class scheduled to commence the following year. Though Mr. Reeder initially accepted the ISP's offer to participate in the 75th Academy class, he ultimately rejected that as well. Significantly, Mr. Reeder indicates that he did not believe he needed any physical accommodations for the 75th Academy, though he did request dietary accommodations, which ISP agreed to do. Torrence Dep. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The ISP describes both offers extended to Mr. Reeder as reasonable accommodations: the dispatch position was consistent with Mr. Reeder's immediate restriction on strenuous physical activity and allowed him to remain within ISP's employ (this is noteworthy because the Academy sessions extended over only a limited period of time annually). Similarly, his inclusion in the 75th Academy was also a reasonable accommodation because it allowed Mr. Reeder another opportunity to become an Indiana State Trooper, following his recovery from the physical activity restriction. These options remained on the table until Mr. Reeder rejected them.\n   <em>\n    Gile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7643179\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/95/492/#p499\">\n    95 F.3d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mr. Reeder views these options as unreasonable. Pl.'s Resp. at 31. The dispatcher job was neither a \"transfer\" nor a \"reassignment\" as required by the ADA because it is a civilian position, rather than a law enforcement position. Inclusion in the ensuing year's Academy was not a reasonable accommodation because the course would not begin until six months\n   later, following his departure.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

Discriminatory Removal Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Reeder asserts as a secondary claim that his removal from the 74th Academy class amounted to disability-based discrimination. In order to prove a case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the following elements: that he suffers from a disability as defined by law; that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job in question, with or without a reasonable accommodation; that he has suffered an adverse employment action as a result of his disability; and that similarly situated employees without a disability were treated more favorably.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Even if Mr. Reeder were able to establish that he was a qualified individual, which claim we have rejected,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , his discrimination claim would fail for lack of any comparators who are factually similar to Mr. Reeder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Reeder represents that ISP \"has consistently made significant accommodations\" for other recruits who fell ill or who were injured in a way that precluded participation in physical activity. Pl.'s Resp. at 27. He points to circumstances of some of those recruits with whom he became familiar in his class at the Academy. According to Mr. Reeder, \"ISP had the ability and the capacity\" to make physical training-related accommodations as shown with other recruits, and its failure to do so in his case was an act of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-29.

Because Dr. Moffatt's deposition was taken after the deadline for fact witnesses set by the amended Case Management Plan for fact witnesses, the ISP moves to exclude Dr. Moffatt's testimony.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt.

Dr. Moffatt's deposition was taken fifteen days after the deadline and thus violated schedule set out in the the Case Management Plan. We regard this as a technical violation: the period of delay was not substantial, no prejudice has flowed from it and there is no evidence of intentionality or bad faith on the part of Mr. Reeder. Dr. Moffatt's deposition testimony may remain as part of the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Rex Caldwell was a State Trooper trainee who was diagnosed with a brain tumor while enrolled in the Academy; he was unable to work as a Trooper but was given a job in the quartermaster charged with distributing ISP gear.
