(\"FEC\") and NRG Energy (collectively, the \"Energy Defendants\") ask the Court to dismiss all claims in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint against them because they do not own or operate the power stations at issue in this action, and under Pennsylvania law, a parent corporation is not liable for the conduct of its subsidiaries. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant FEC's motion for summary judgment and will grant/deny NRG Energy's motion for summary judgment. In addition, the Court will grant Plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint for the purpose of adding proper party defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, who are owners and/or residents of private property in LaBelle and Luzerne Townships, instituted this class action to assert claims arising out of alleged environmental contamination and polluting of their property and persons by coal ash emanating from the LaBelle Refuse Site (\"LaBelle Site\"), which is owned and operated by Defendant Matt Canestrale Contracting, Inc.

Citing legal precedent holding that a parent corporation is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries merely based on its ownership of the subsidiary, FEC submits that it cannot be held liable for conduct that was allegedly committed at and by the power stations owned by its wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, FEC notes that while precedent does exist which holds a parent corporation liable for the conduct of its subsidiary, such liability has only been imposed on the parent corporation where the parent corporation dominates a subsidiary to such a degree that the subsidiary is a mere instrumentality of the parent or amounts to a sham corporation. FEC argues that such is not the case here, as Plaintiffs have not alleged, nor could they allege, any facts that would support a claim that AE Supply's corporate existence should be disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs submit that FEC's overly simplified factual statements and legal arguments ignore the complex factual history of mergers and acquisitions, coal ash contract negotiations, contracts for the disposal of the coal ash at issue in this litigation, and how FEC held itself out to the public as owner/operator of the former Mitchell and Hatfield's Ferry power stations at the relevant times. Moreover, Plaintiffs submit that the actual operations and control exercised by FEC over its subsidiaries make it the de facto owner and operator of the power stations at issue during the relevant times, making it legally liable for the coal ash at issue.

Accordingly, the Court finds no merit to Plaintiffs' conclusory, undeveloped argument that FEC is the successor by\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   merger with Allegheny Power.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Liability Based on FEC's Alleged Role as the Contracting Party w/ Canestrale for 2012 CCB Beneficial Use Agreement &amp; 2013 Amendment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that FEC is liable to them because it directly negotiated and entered into a contract that extended the former Allegheny Power 1999 Beneficial Use Agreement for the disposal of the CCBs giving rise to this lawsuit, and therefore, there is no need to pierce any corporate veil as FEC is potentially liable in its own right. Notwithstanding the utter lack of development of this argument, the summary judgment record belies Plaintiffs' argument. Plaintiffs' own documents show that the original beneficial use agreement was executed on 4/21/99 between Allegheny Power and Canestrale, well prior to AE's merger with a subsidiary of FEC on 2/25/11. After the merger, in 2012, Kalan and Luecken, employees of FESC, exchanged several emails with counsel for Canestrale in an\n   effort to reach an agreement on the terms of a new CCB Beneficial Use Agreement. On 10/15/12, the new CCB Beneficial Use Agreement was entered into between FESC, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates, specifically AE Supply and FirstEnergy Generation Corp. The subsequent amendment to the 2012 Beneficial Use Agreement on 1/18/13 was signed by Charles Lasky of FESC. Moreover, both AE Supply and FESC are separately existing subsidiaries of FEC. Thus, the summary judgment record does not support Plaintiffs' undeveloped, conclusory argument that FEC directly negotiated and entered into the 2012 CCB Beneficial Use Agreement and the 2013 amendment to that Agreement. Indeed, the record supports the opposite conclusion. Accordingly, the Court cannot find that FEC may be potentially liable to Plaintiffs based on their unsupported and conclusory argument that FEC directly negotiated and entered into the 2012 CCB Beneficial Use Agreement and the 2013 amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Whether FEC is the\n     <em>\n      de facto\n     </em>\n     Owner/Operator of the Power Stations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that when a subsidiary is not a separate and independent corporation, but rather, is the alter ego of the parent company, or if the subsidiary is the agent for the parent in a specific transaction, liability may be imposed on the parent corporation. Here Plaintiff contends that sufficient evidence exists to show that AE Supply is merely the alter ego of FEC, or at the very least, shows that issues of fact exist precluding summary judgment on this issue. In support of its argument, Plaintiffs point to the following factors: (1) Because FEC is the sole member of AE Supply, an LLC, FEC controls it, and as the sole general partner, FEC is liable for AE Supply's debts; (2) FEC and AE Supply act as a single entity for federal and state income tax purposes; (3) FEC made the decision to close the two power stations; (4) FEC compensated the unemployed workers of the two power plants; (5) FEC negotiated contracts on behalf of AE Supply; (6) FEC derives its income from AE Supply; (7) FEC lends money to AE Supply at below market rates; and (8) FEC holds itself out to the SEC and the public as the owner and operator of the two power stations. Thus, Plaintiffs submit that this evidence is sufficient to hold FEC liable for the actions of AE Supply and defeat summary judgment or, at the very least, they should be allowed leave to amend their complaint to add several subsidiaries of FEC as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In essence, Plaintiffs are seeking to pierce the corporate veil through the alter ego theory-\" 'where the individual or corporate owner controls the corporation to be pierced and the controlling owner is to be held liable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lieberman v.

However, the excerpted statements merely describe typical parent-subsidiary relationships and report events involving AE Supply that may affect FEC's bottom line. For example, Plaintiffs offer as proof that FEC closely controls its subsidiaries, the statements \"FirstEnergy actively participates ... and otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability standards implemented and enforced by the RFC[,]\" and \"FE's primary source of cash for continuing operations as a holding company is cash from the operations of its subsidiaries.\" (ECF No. 84 at 4 (citing Ex.

As the glossary of terms in the annual report makes clear, \"FirstEnergy,\" means \"FirstEnergy Corp., together with its consolidated subsidiaries[.]\" 2011 SEC 10-K Report, Glossary of Terms, at i (ECF No. 84-6 at 3).

First, Plaintiffs point to the following statement in the 2011 SEC 10-K Report: \"FirstEnergy controls the following generation sources as of January 31, 2012, shown in the table below ...\" (which lists the Hatfield's Ferry and Mitchell plants). Again, the use of the term \"FirstEnergy\" is nothing more than a consolidation by description of AE Supply's efforts with that of its parent, FEC. In addition, Plaintiffs point to statements in the SEC 8-K Report dated 7/8/13\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 7/9/13 Press Release\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' Ex. G, ECF No. 84-7) to show that FEC made the decision to de-activate the Hatfield's Ferry and Mitchell plants as the owner and operator of the plants and compensated the unemployed workers at those plants. In essence, Plaintiffs are asking the Court to conclude, merely from the announcement of plant closings, that FEC is the owner/operator of the plants. This is a leap the Court is not willing to make, especially where there is a dearth of evidence establishing alter ego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, the reference to \"FirstEnergy\" throughout the press release does not provide evidence that FEC and not AE Supply owns and operates the power plants. The Court rejected this type of evidence in its discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 535-36 regarding the statements contained in the 2011 SEC 10-K Annual Report. Significant to this case, courts have rejected a plaintiff's attempt to rely on a press release in which the parent company consolidated its subsidiary's actions with its own.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacQueen v.

In\n   <em>\n    MacQueen\n   </em>\n   , the parent company stated in a press release that it \"designs and constructs\" aircraft carriers for the Navy but, in actuality, its subsidiary was actually the company that built the carriers. The court found that \"a statement like this in an SEC filing-in which a parent corporation is in some way consolidating by description its subsidiary's efforts and its own-is not atypical, and certainly does not suggest that, via fraud or its equivalent, the parent corporation has become indistinguishable from the subsidiary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206809811\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5677031\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/602/538/#p570\">\n    602 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   570-71 ) (other citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, it is not uncommon for a parent corporation to exercise some control over, or be involved in, major decisions regarding the business of its subsidiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman v.

The newspaper articles merely quote and/or incorporate the information in FEC's press release and in no way constitute a separate statement made by FEC or any of its authorized representatives. Thus, Plaintiffs' reliance on the newspaper articles fails to meet their burden of proof for the same reasons delineated above as to the Press Release itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In summary, Plaintiffs' arguments and evidence fail to establish any of the factors delineated by the courts as indicative of alter ego, or raise material questions of fact on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court\n   notes that Plaintiffs were afforded an opportunity to conduct discovery to obtain information to satisfy their burden of proof on this issue, but failed to proffer any evidence to satisfy their burden of proof. Accordingly, the Court finds that based on the record evidence, no reasonable jury could find that FEC owns and operates the Hatfield Ferry and Mitchell Power Plants, and that Defendant FEC is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     NRG Energy's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   NRG Energy argues that it is undisputed that the Elrama Power Plant is owned by NRG Power Midwest LP, a wholly-owned, separately managed, indirect subsidiary of GenOn Energy, Inc. which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG Energy. However, NRG Energy submits that the relationship of NRG Energy and NRG Power Midwest LP as parent and subsidiary, respectively, is insufficient to place liability upon NRG Energy for the actions of NRG Power Midwest LP. NRG Energy further argues that Plaintiffs have failed to produce any evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence, to support a finding that NRG Power Midwest LP is the alter ego of NRG Energy, and thus, have failed to pierce the corporate veil. Accordingly, NRG Energy requests that summary judgment be entered in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs raise substantially the same arguments as those raised in opposition to FEC's motion for summary judgment. Essentially, Plaintiffs submit that they need not pierce the corporate veil because NRG Energy succeeds by merger to former entities that actually contracted for the dumping of the coal dust and would be liable if they continued to exist. In addition, Plaintiffs contend that NRG Energy is directly liable because its predecessor, Reliant, negotiated and participated in the execution of an extension of the agreement with Canestrale that extended the prior contract until the Elrama Power Plant was closed. Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that to the extent piercing the corporate veil is necessary, the evidence establishes at least a factual issue as to NRG Energy's control of NRG Power Midwest, a \"non-corporation of which NRG is the ultimate controlling member[.]\" Pls.' Br. in Opp'n at 2 (ECF No. 86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   With regard to Plaintiffs' first argument, it is almost identical to the one they raised in opposition to FEC's summary judgment motion-Plaintiffs make the conclusory, unsupported, undeveloped argument that \"there can be no issue that NRG is the successor by\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   merger with Orion Power/Reliant Energy/GenOn Power.\" This argument fails for the same reasons discussed above with regard to FEC in Section III.A.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 532-34. Moreover, as NRG Energy points out, Plaintiffs' conclusory allegation-that there was a \"\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   merger\" between GenOn and NRG-is factually incorrect. The evidence shows that NRG Energy acquired GenOn Energy, Inc. as a subsidiary, which still exists today as a separate entity. Kranz Decl. at \u00b6 8 and Ex. (Corporate Organizational Chart) attached thereto (ECF No. 74-2); NRG Energy's Stmt. of Mat. Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 16 (ECF No. 73); GenOn 2012 SEC 10-K Annual Report, Ex. H to Pls.' Resp. (ECF No. 85-8). As such, GenOn Energy, Inc. was never\n   merged into NRG Energy, and therefore, NRG Energy is not GenOn Energy, Inc.'s successor, but its parent. Thus, any claims against GenOn Energy, Inc. cannot be attributed to its parent based merely on their parent-subsidiary relationship.\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    524 U.S. at 61, 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108190\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/471/#p484\">\n    247 F.3d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument is similarly deficient. Plaintiffs contend that NRG Energy is liable in its own right because Reliant, a direct predecessor of NRG Energy, directly negotiated and entered into a contract with Canestrale in 2007 that extended the 2002 agreement for the deposit of coal ash from the Elrama Power Plant for an additional three years. Plaintiffs also rely on emails exchanged between employees of Reliant Energy regarding the approval of the contract extension, approvals written on Reliant Energy letterhead, and the naming of Reliant Energy as a party to the agreement. Plaintiffs contend that this evidence creates an issue of fact as to the involvement of Reliant Energy (NRG Energy's predecessor) in the negotiation, direction, authorization, control and oversight of the coal ash disposal. However, Plaintiffs fail to explain how any of this evidence makes NRG Energy the successor to Reliant Energy, and thus liable to Plaintiffs. In addition, Plaintiffs' argument is based on the incorrect factual assertion that Reliant is a direct predecessor of NRG Energy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   It appears that GenOn Energy, Inc., not NRG Energy, is the successor to Reliant Energy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRG 2010 SEC 10-K Annual Report at 4, Ex. F to Pls.' Resp. (ECF No. 85-6 at 29). GenOn Energy, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG Energy. It is well settled that a parent corporation cannot be held liable for the actions of its subsidiary.\n   <em>\n    BestFoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    524 U.S. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108190\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/471/#p484\">\n    247 F.3d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"mere ownership of a subsidiary does not justify the imposition of liability on the parent.\"). As Plaintiffs offer nothing more than mere ownership to ascribe liability to NRG Energy, their argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Moreover, the evidence here does not establish that NRG Energy owned or operated the Elrama Power Plant. Rather, the evidence shows that Reliant Energy owned and operated the Elrama Power Station from at least 2002 until approximately 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LaBelle Landfill and Ash Management Agreement, Ex. J to Pls.' Resp. (ECF No. 85-10 at 3). After GenOn Energy, Inc. acquired Reliant Energy, GenOn Energy, Inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiary, GenOn Power Midwest LP became the owner and operator of the Elrama Power Plant and was the owner when the merger occurred with Plus Merger Corporation on December 14, 2012. GenOn Power Midwest LP remained the owner until May 28, 2013, at which time it was renamed NRG Power Midwest LP, and NRG Power Midwest LP has owned the Elrama Power Plant since May 28, 2013. Thus, the undisputed evidence clearly shows that NRG Energy never owned or operated the Elrama Power Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that because NRG Power Midwest LP is not a corporation, NRG Energy is the controlling member of NRG Power Midwest LP, based on the theory that NRG Energy is the party that ultimately controls NRG Power Midwest GP, LLC, which is the sole general partner and the controlling member of NRG Power Midwest LP, and therefore, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, NRG Energy should be viewed as controlling NRG Power Midwest LP. As such, Plaintiffs contend that NRG Energy is liable for the debts of NRG Power Midwest LP. In support, Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    In re Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6105245\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/74/315/#p319\">\n    74 B.R. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 319 (Bankr.

Moreover, even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, their argument fails as a matter of law. Plaintiffs' reliance on\n   <em>\n    In re Malone\n   </em>\n   is misplaced as it is inapposite here. Although Plaintiffs have provided a pinpoint cite, they do not state the holding or proposition for which they cite that case. It appears the only relevant language on page 319 of that opinion is the following: \"As a rule, general partners are personally liable for partnership debts.\" However, that does not help Plaintiffs in this case-assuming, as Plaintiffs contend, that NRG Power Midwest GP, LLC is the sole general partner of NRG Power Midwest LP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   that would make NRG Power Midwest GP LLC responsible for NRG Power Midwest LP's debts, but the quoted language from\n   <em>\n    In re Malone\n   </em>\n   does not support holding NRG Energy liable for NRG Power Midwest LP's debts. NRG Energy's mere ownership of GenOn Energy, Inc., a subsidiary, which in turn owns NRG Power Midwest LP, will not impose liability on NRG Energy for the debts of NRG Power Midwest LP.\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108190\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/471/#p484\">\n    247 F.3d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs have failed to produce any evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence, that NRG Power Midwest LP is the alter ego of NRG Energy. Rather, to show that NRG Energy controls NRG Power Midwest LP such that NRG Power Midwest LP is the alter ego of NRG Energy, Plaintiffs point to: (1) a statement in the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2012 SEC 10-K Annual Report that \"GenOn deactivated the following coal-fired units ...: Elrama units 1-3 (290 MW) June 2012 ... [,]\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2012 SEC 10-K at 92 (ECF No. 85-8 at 96); (2) a note in the GenOn 2012 SEC 10-K indicating that in May 2012, GenOn filed an RMR rate schedule governing Elrama unit 4 with the FERC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2012 SEC 10-K at 141 (ECF No. 85-8 at 145); (3) the GenOn 2012 SEC 10-K Annual Report shows NRG Energy, Inc. as the parent of GenOn Energy, Inc.; (4) Reliant negotiated contracts on behalf of Orion Energy Midwest, LP; and (5) GenOn held itself out to the SEC and the public as the owner and operator of the Elrama Power Plant. However, Plaintiffs' proffered evidence does not even come close to showing that NRG Power Midwest LP was the alter ego of NRG Energy. The factors to be considered in determining whether to pierce the corporate veil include undercapitalization, failure to adhere to corporate formalities, substantial intermingling of corporate and personal affairs, and the use of the corporate form to perpetuate a fraud.\n   <em>\n    Lumax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"461484,11335101\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/669/893/\">\n    669 A.2d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs' proffered evidence does not address any of these factors. Therefore, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could not find that NRG Power Midwest LP was \"an artifice and a sham to execute illegitimate purposes and [an] abuse of the corporate fiction and immunity that it carries.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaplan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515757\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/1503/#p1520\">\n    19 F.3d at 1521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In summary, Plaintiffs' arguments and evidence has failed to establish (1) that NRG Energy is the successor by merger and therefore directly liable to Plaintiffs, (2) that NRG Energy is the owner of the Elrama Power Plant, or (2) any of the factors delineated by the courts as indicative of alter ego, or raise material questions\n   of fact on this issue. Plaintiffs were afforded an opportunity to conduct discovery to obtain information needed to satisfy their burden of proof on whether NRG Energy is a proper party defendant, yet failed to avail themselves of that opportunity. Accordingly, the Court finds that based on the record evidence, no reasonable jury could find that NRG Energy owns and/or operated the Elrama Power Plant, and the Defendant NRG Energy is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Leave to Amend the Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs suggest, in the alternative, that the proper solution would be to allow them to amend their Complaint, leaving FEC and NRG Energy as defendants, and to add as defendants, AE Supply, including several other entities that may be in the process of concluding a recent bankruptcy proceeding, including but not limited to Allegheny Energy Service Co. and FirstEnergy Generation, LLC, NRG Power Midwest, as well as several other entities that are in the process of concluding a bankruptcy proceeding, including GenOn Energy, Inc. Leave to amend will be granted as far as adding new defendants, but any such amendment may not name either FEC or NRC Energy as defendants, for the reasons set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court will grant FEC's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF N. 58), as well as NRG's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 72). An appropriate order will follow.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Mr. Arcuri further states that he serves as counsel to FEC and its subsidiaries.

In addition, paragraphs 1 through 4 refer to an exhibit that is not provided; and paragraph 6 refers generally to SEC 10-K Report of GenOn Energy, Inc., without identifying the exhibit letter, and the exhibit (H) contains 268 pages. Paragraphs 11, 18, and 20 are not supported by affidavit or other evidence. Paragraphs 12, 19, and 21 state conclusions not facts. The statement in Paragraph 13 is not supported by the cited exhibit. Paragraphs 14 through 16 cite to the GenOn Energy, Inc. 2010 SEC 10-K Report in Exhibit F, without any pinpoint citation, but Exhibit F does not contain the GenOn Energy, Inc. SEC 10-K Report-that document is located in Exhibit H, and contains 231 pages. Although paragraph 22 also cites to Exhibit H with no pinpoint citation, it is similar to NRG Energy's statement of facts.
