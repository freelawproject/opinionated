(Dkt. 15). The Indictment alleges that Defendant engaged in this unlawful activity on November 29, 2017, and the Government apparently intends to rely at trial upon the results of a search warrant executed on that date at 37 Texas Avenue in Buffalo, New York. The Government contends that it recovered the following when it executed the search warrant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (1) 15.65 grams of heroin, (2) 11.99 grams of cocaine, (3) $73,743 U.S. currency concealed inside a vacuum cleaner and within a drop ceiling between the bedrooms, (4) a Glock 22, .40 caliber firearm bearing serial number AZM814 loaded with a magazine containing 10 rounds of ammunition and hidden on a windowsill behind plastic sheeting, (5) a high-capacity magazine for a .40 caliber firearm hiding on a nearby windowsill, and (6) drug paraphernalia including a scale, sandwich bags, and a cutting agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Dkt. 40 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court referred all pre-trial matters to United States Magistrate Judge Jeremiah J. McCarthy pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) and (B). (Dkt. 17). Defendant filed pretrial motions on June 4, 2018, and sought to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant signed by Acting New York State Supreme Court Justice Richard C. Kloch, Sr., on November 28, 2017. (Dkt. 24). On August 2, 2018, Judge McCarthy issued a Report and Recommendation, recommending denial of Defendant's motion to suppress. (Dkt. 34). Judge McCarthy's decision also was issued as an Order denying without prejudice Defendant's motion to produce the recordings of the controlled purchases used to support the search warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By Text Order dated August 13, 2018, this Court granted Defendant's request for\n   an extension of time to August 30, 2018, to file objections to the Report and Recommendation. (Dkt. 36). Defendant's counsel timely filed Objections to the Report and Recommendation on August 30, 2018. (Dkt. 37). The Objections argued that the warrant lacked sufficient probable cause because the search warrant application failed to set forth \"any indicia of any reliability of the confidential informant,\" there was no proof that law enforcement reviewed the recordings of the controlled purchases by the confidential informant, and only one of the purchases occurred at the 37 Texas Street residence. (Dkt. 37 at 2). The Objections also argued that Judge McCarthy mistakenly failed to order the Government to turn over the recordings of the controlled purchases, which served as part of the basis for the search warrant application. (Dkt. 37 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Defendant filed his counseled Objections, this Court issued a Text Order setting the Government's response deadline as September 13, 2018, and scheduling oral argument for September 25, 2018. (Dkt. 38). Then, on September 5, 2018, an unsigned document was filed by defense counsel entitled \"Objections to Report, Recommendation and Order Supplemental by Defendant\" reflecting further objections to Judge McCarthy's decision, apparently prepared by Defendant on a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   basis. (Dkt. 39). Defendant's untimely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filing contends, in sum and substance, that because the search warrant was authorized by a New York State judge, this Court should evaluate probable cause utilizing the\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government filed its response in opposition to Defendant's Objections on September 7, 2018 (Dkt. 40), and oral argument was held on September 25, 2018, at which time the Court reserved decision. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's Objections are overruled and the Report, Recommendation and Order is adopted in its entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

MOTION TO SUPPRESS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court has conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the Report and Recommendation concerning Defendant's motion to suppress, as well as the filings previously made in connection with that motion, and based on that review, the Court agrees with Judge McCarthy that Defendant's motion to suppress should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the \"Affidavit For A Search Warrant\" sworn to November 28, 2017, by Niagara County Sheriff's Investigator Kevin M. Smith and Niagara County Sheriff's Deputy Nathan Shumaker, and submitted to Acting Supreme Court Justice Kloch, set forth the following relevant facts: (1) The officers observed a black Audi Q7 bearing license plate HMG3737 (\"the Audi\") at 37 Texas Avenue during the day and evening hours (Dkt. 40-1 at 4, \u00b6 A); (2) Defendant was listed as a complainant in a burglary report occurring at that location a year earlier-in or around November 2016 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); (3) During October 2017, a Confidential Informant (\"CI\") engaged in two separate controlled and recorded purchases of heroin inside the Audi, where Defendant was specifically observed by the law enforcement officers operating the Audi. The purchases occurred in the Cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo, with the latter purchase occurring where there was constant surveillance of the Audi as it departed from 37 Texas Avenue and ultimately met up with the CI (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, \u00b6\u00b6 B &amp; C); and (4) During November 2017, the CI engaged in a controlled and recorded purchase at 37 Texas Avenue of heroin that the CI stated was obtained from Defendant (\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00b6 F). The Affidavit also makes reference to two other controlled purchases during October and November 2017, although Defendant is not expressly referenced as having been observed during those buys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6\u00b6 D &amp; E (referencing observations of a \"black male\" with the CI and also indicating that the CI identified the drugs as having been purchased from Defendant) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Judge McCarthy determined that, under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    462 U.S. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), probable cause supported issuance of the search warrant. (Dkt. 34 at 4). Although the search warrant affidavit did not address whether the CI had provided reliable information in the past, the controlled purchases observed by law enforcement independently corroborated the CI's information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Report and Recommendation did not place particular importance on Investigator Smith's and Deputy Shumaker's failure to specifically identify Defendant during two of the controlled purchases (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 40-1 at 5, \u00b6\u00b6 D &amp; E), since there were two other controlled buys where the officers stated they specifically observed Defendant operating the Audi (Dkt. 34 at 5). Moreover, even though there was no observation by law enforcement of Defendant at the 37\n   Texas Street address during the controlled purchase in November 2017 (Dkt. 40-1 at 6, \u00b6 F), other corroborating information supported the reliability of the CI's information that he had purchased the drugs from Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34 at 6). Moreover, the Court agrees with the position articulated by the Government during oral argument, that for purposes of the probable cause analysis related to the search of the residence, it is largely irrelevant who engaged in the hand-to-hand sale with the CI inside the house since law enforcement knew that the CI purchased drugs inside the house-a house where a vehicle operated by Defendant during prior controlled purchases was observed parked during the day and nighttime hours. That satisfies the probable cause standard under\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, for the reasons set forth more fully in the Report and Recommendation, this Court agrees that probable cause supported issuance of the search warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCOVERY RELATED TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Judge McCarthy's non-dispositive ruling denying without prejudice the motion for discovery of the CI's identity and recordings of the controlled buys referenced in the search warrant application is neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law. The Government \"is not generally required to disclose the identity of confidential informants,\" and a defendant seeking disclosure must establish that \"he will be deprived of his right to a fair trial\" without the information.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2669620\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/420/142/#p143\">\n    420 F.Supp.2d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143 (W.D.N.Y. 2006) (affirming magistrate judge's decision to deny disclosure of confidential informant where government represented that it did not intend to rely at trial on proof of transactions involving informant serving as basis for search warrant). Moreover, as discussed in the Report and Recommendation, probable cause supported issuance of the search warrant without consideration of the substance of the recordings. (Dkt. 34 at 6-7). Accordingly,\n   this Court affirms Judge McCarthy's denial without prejudice of Defendant's motion for the disclosure of the CI's identity and the recordings. Of course, if the controlled purchases become relevant for purposes of the trial, then the analysis of Defendant's right to the information will change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based upon this Court's\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, for the reasons set forth above and for the reasons set forth more fully in the Report and Recommendation (Dkt. 34), Defendant's suppression motion (Dkt. 24) is denied.
