Briggs alleged Temple discriminated against her because of her age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"),\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n   29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n  </extracted-citation>\n  <em>\n   et seq.\n  </em>\n  and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\"PHRA\"),\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n   43 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 951\n  </extracted-citation>\n  <em>\n   et seq.\n  </em>\n  , and because of her gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n  <em>\n   et seq.\n  </em>\n  and the PHRA. (\n  <em>\n   See generally\n  </em>\n  Compl.) Additionally, Briggs claimed that Temple subjected her to a hostile work environment and retaliated against her for complaining of age and gender discrimination in the workplace. (\n  <em>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n  )\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  The case was tried before a jury for four days, from July 16, 2018, through July 19, 2018. The jury returned a verdict in Briggs' favor on five claims: (1) age discrimination in connection with the termination of employment; (2) retaliation in the\n  form of termination for complaining of age discrimination; (3) age-based hostile work environment; (4) retaliatory hostile work environment for complaining of age discrimination; and (5) retaliatory hostile work environment for complaining of gender discrimination. (\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Verdict Form, Doc. No. 58.) The jury awarded back pay in the amount of $250,000 and $350,000 in compensatory damages. (\n  <em>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n  ) The jury also found that Temple's actions regarding the age-based claims were willful, therefore, the back pay award was doubled as liquidated damages under the ADEA. (\n  <em>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n  ) Accordingly, the total verdict was $850,000. (\n  <em>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n  )\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  Presently before the Court are the Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial or, in the Alternative, for a Remittitur filed by Temple (Doc.

CONCLUSION...523\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Briggs began working for Temple in February 2001 as an Editorial Assistant in the Center for Neurovirology and Cancer Biology. In 2005, she became an Executive Assistant to Interim Dean Allen Nicholson of the College of Science and Technology. At trial, Briggs presented a report prepared by or for Temple's Human Resources Department that explained the reasons Briggs was selected for this position: \"The candidate was selected based on her outstanding communication skills both verbal and written. Her previous work experience in developing and writing grant applications, providing editorial assistance, customer service skills, prior university experience, and education made her the best qualified candidate.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 1, at 2.) Over the next five years, Briggs would\n   work for not only Dean Nicholson, but Dean Keya Sadeghipour, Dean Hai-Lung Dai, and Vice Dean George Palladino. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 22:9-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Briggs Begins Working as an Executive Assistant for Dr. Jie Wu\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In October 2009, Briggs became the Executive Assistant to then-Chair of the Department of Computer Information Services (\"CIS\"), Dr. Jie Wu (\"Wu\"). At this time, Briggs also indirectly reported to Greg Wacker (\"Wacker\"), former Director of Finance and Administration and current Assistant Dean of Finance and Administration. As an Executive Assistant to Wu, Briggs provided administrative support and performed a variety of functions, including directing all ongoing and special projects, developing programs and systems to manage daily activities, and planning and coordinating events. The essential functions of her job also included serving as a liaison for Wu and representatives of other Temple administrative and academic offices, as well as working with a wide array of Temple constituents while ensuring the administrative operation of the CIS department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Despite testimony that, during her eight years of employment at Temple prior to 2009, Briggs had never been written up for any reason, been given any written discipline or suspension, nor ever been placed on any sort of performance improvement plan, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:24-23:13), Briggs testified that Wu would raise his voice at her and yell degrading things at her in public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:25-30:13 (\"There were times when he would come out and yell at me in the front office. I-on two separate occasions-I remember him looking at me and saying, what are you, stupid. And then another time when he said, can't you speak English. And I was-you know, I just don't know how to respond to those kinds of comments.\").) Briggs further testified that this conduct caused her embarrassment and that she feared him when he treated her in this way. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:11-29:24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Wu Makes Age-Related Comment to Briggs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   During trial, the jury heard testimony from Briggs that, on November 9, 2011, Wu, who was born in China and had lived there until the late 1980s, discovered that Briggs' birthday was the following day. He asked Briggs how old she was turning, and Briggs responded that she was turning fifty-seven. Wu responded, \"You know, in China women are put out to pasture by your age.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:1-13.) Embarrassed, Briggs replied to Wu, in essence, \"With all due respect, we're in America and not in China.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:17-25.) Within an hour, Briggs was called into a meeting with Wacker where he informed her that Wu claimed that she had been unprofessional to him and that she was going to be written up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:13-17.) Briggs explained Wu's remark that had prompted her comment, but Wacker said it did not matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:15-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   07/16/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 7:2-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During his own testimony, Wu admitted that, at the time, he knew Briggs was in her 50s, but denied ever saying such a phrase. However, he admitted having discussed \"cultural differences\" between the United States and China with Briggs. (07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 61:13-62:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Briggs received her first written warning for the November 9, 2011 incident. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 3.) However, neither Wu nor Wacker could explain to the jury what the exact motivation was for this discipline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   07/16/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 55:9-56:1 (Wacker); 07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 65:5-14 (Wu).) Wu testified that he never reviewed any documentation regarding the November 9 incident and resulting discipline. (07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 65:13-20.) Likewise, Wacker testified that, although he\n   never reviewed any documentation regarding this incident, he was certain that the discipline was not a result of Briggs' comments to Wu on November 9. (07/16/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 56:13-19.) When asked about any supporting documentation, Wacker testified that either his assistant, Drew DiMeo (\"DiMeo\"), or Human Resources Director Dierdre Walton (\"Walton\") would have it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During her own testimony, however, Walton contradicted Wacker, stating that the discipline was indeed related to Briggs' \"blowout between her and Dr. Wu,\" but that she had never received any supporting emails or documentation concerning the incident from Wu or Wacker. (07/17/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 116:9-12, 119:17-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Briggs Makes a Complaint to Temple's Equal Opportunity Compliance Office\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After receiving her warning, Briggs contacted Walton directly to explain her story and make a complaint about Wu's comments regarding women in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121:12-122:6.) Walton testified that it was clear that \"Briggs had a problem with the comment\" and \"was offended by it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122:1, 9.) As a result, Walton instructed Wacker to \"look into\" the incident by conducting an investigation into Wu's comment to Briggs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127:3-12.) Accordingly, Wacker discussed Briggs' complaint with Wu and other potential witnesses in the office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127:15-128:23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Additionally, Briggs complained directly to Wacker about Wu's comments. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 33:25-34:6.) Wacker suggested that Briggs discuss her complaints with Sandra Foehl (\"Foehl\"), Temple's Director of the Equal Opportunity Compliance Office (\"EOC\"). (07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 7:2-6.) Though Wacker testified that he did not believe Briggs to be making a complaint of age or gender discrimination, he still referred her to Foehl because she handled such personnel complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:7-8:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On July 25, 2012, Briggs emailed Foehl to set up a meeting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Trial Ex. 5, at 2.) At that meeting, Briggs informed Foehl that she felt she was being discriminated against, feared retaliation from Wu and Wacker, and described Wu's comment regarding women in China. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 38:9-16; 07/18/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 4:22-5:4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Trial Ex. 4 (notes taken by Foehl during meeting with Briggs outlining issues with Wu).) Foehl informed Briggs that she could file a formal complaint of discrimination; however, Briggs admitted that she was scared to do so. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 4 (\"File age discrimination complaint? I'm scared.\").) However, Briggs did request that Foehl bring this issue up with the new Interim Dean, Michael Klein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On August 2, 2012, Briggs sent Foehl a follow-up email regarding her complaints-primarily asking for a synopsis of the complaint Foehl would send to Dean Klein and again reiterating her trepidation with making the \"complaint.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 5, at 1.) After receiving Briggs' follow-up email, Foehl emailed Walton and another member of the Human Resources Department, Eric Brunner, to solicit information about Briggs. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 6 (\"Do either of you have some history with Ruth Briggs in the College of Science and Technology, especially since her assignment to [CIS]? If so, will you share?\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On September 9, 2012, Briggs again followed-up with Foehl. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 7.) Again, Briggs referenced Wu's comment and further complained that she was being underpaid compared to her male colleagues and that her job responsibilities were being taken from her and given to a student-worker, Hailey King (\"King\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Foehl provided Briggs with information regarding how to further\n   inquire about her compensation and opportunities available to file additional complaints of unlawful discrimination to government compliance agencies. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 8.) Foehl also requested more information regarding specific instances of bullying, threats, and expressions of age bias by Wu and Wacker in order to proceed further with her complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unsatisfied by the lack of progress with Foehl, Briggs emailed Rhonda Brown (\"Brown\"), the Vice President of the Diversity Department. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 7.) In her email, Briggs explained that she was unaware if Foehl had ever filed her complaint or what issues the complaint addressed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Briggs Continues to Complain about Disparate Treatment at Temple\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Briggs further testified that she was being bullied and harassed by Wu. In early 2013, Briggs raised concerns to Foehl and Brown. In a February 7, 2013 email to Brown, Briggs said, \"I am so bullied and harassed all day. Two people in the Dean's office tell me that I can find another job. That can't be right.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 10.) Brown responded by telling Briggs to address these issues with Foehl. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, Briggs sent another email to Foehl on February 8, 2013, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Sandy,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I am so bullied and harassed all day. Everyday [sic] morning, I must meet with my direct supervisor and Greg Wahker's [sic] assistant, Drew DiMeo for \"staff meetings\" to discuss my failure to comply with a directive that prohibits any work activity that has not been approved by my supervisor, all of which are related to performing daily functions in the office ... such as answering questions from students or visitors to our building. The threat of discipline for assisting a visitor or responding to a request from another office does not seem to have any actions of wrong doing, rather fulfilling a \"customer service\" expectation for the university.\n   <em>\n    No other staff member is required to meet daily for a dose of public humiliation and my request to move the meetings to a private location was flat out denied\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   When I asked for clarification on an assignment, it is reported to the dean's office as a challenge to his authority. If he can have a someone [sic] there to protect his interests, there is more than an element of unfairness. It is beginning to feel like psychological abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   If my only resource to address this problem is through HR, this is unacceptable. Can I contact a mediator?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 9 (emphasis added).) Foehl responded that this was an issue for Human Resources and that Briggs should contact Walton. Foehl then forwarded Briggs' email to Walton with a note saying that she did not believe there was a claim of unlawful discrimination or harassment, but that Walton should let her know if Briggs raised an EOC complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In or around the same time, Briggs contacted Cameron Etezady (\"Etezady\"), University Counsel. Briggs informed Etezady that she was being discriminated against on the basis of her age and gender, and that she feared retaliation from Wu. (Pl.'s Trial Exs. 12-14.) Etezady directed Briggs back to Foehl. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 12.) Briggs replied to Etezady, explaining that she was being given the run-around and had already talked to Foehl to no avail. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 13.) Etezady then placed Briggs in contact with another member of the University Counsel's office, Fay Trachtenberg (\"Trachtenberg\"). (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 14.) However, Trachtenberg merely told Briggs to contact Walton. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 57:11-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Briggs Receives Second Discipline for Failing to Book Itinerary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In March 2013, Briggs received her second written discipline, which, this time, was accompanied by a three-day unpaid suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:24-58:4.) According to Briggs' testimony at trial, she was working with Assistant Chair Eugene Kwatny (\"Kwatny\") on the hiring committee for the department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:7-12.) Briggs was responsible for arranging faculty candidates to come to Philadelphia to interview by booking their travel, lodging, and food arrangements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After exchanging proposed itineraries with one particular candidate, Briggs informed Kwatny that there was some difficulty scheduling the candidate's trip. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:13-59:3.) Kwatny told Briggs to tell the candidate that he should proceed with booking his own travel arrangements and that Temple would reimburse him afterwards. However, Briggs admitted that she never followed up with the candidate and that he never came to Temple for his interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For this mistake, Briggs received a three-day unpaid suspension from Wu, which was the only time he had ever issued such a punishment. (07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 79:12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In an April 8, 2013 email to Walton, Briggs explained that she believed the punishment was overly harsh and highlighted what she perceived to be \"different standards for performance and productivity.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17.) Briggs also provided certain mitigating factors, which included an increase in her workload because another coworker was on leave, causing her to have more responsibilities than normal with no help. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Briggs pointed to the fact that she took ownership of the mistake and had tried to make it right to show that she was not negligent or careless. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 77:8-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On August 6, 2013, Briggs again emailed University Counsel Etezady because she continued to feel singled out by Wu and DiMeo. Etezady referred her again to Walton and Trachtenberg. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Briggs Receives Third Discipline for Arriving Late to Work\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Briggs received another disciplinary notice from Wu in February 2014. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 78:3-17.) In this instance, Briggs had overslept for work by three hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Upon realizing that she was late, Briggs attempted to reach Judy Lennon, the department secretary, and Wu. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After being unable to do so, she informed a student-worker to let either of them know that she would be arriving at work shortly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Briggs testified that she worked late that day to make up for the lost time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79:19-21.) Briggs also disputed testimony provided by Wu that she was late multiple times a week. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20951\">\n    at 79:22-80:7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"I feel that that's another way to ... assassinate my character with-there's no documentation, either.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 80:24-25 (\"Q: Every week, she was late?

Q: Where is the documentation of that? A: There is no documentation.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The jury also heard testimony from Briggs and Wu that, around the same time that Briggs was late, King, who was considerably younger than Briggs, did not show up to work for three straight days. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 81:15-82:2; 07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 82:3-83:21.) King never called into work to tell anyone where she was, but nevertheless, King received no written discipline. (07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 83:20-24.) Wu testified that King was shown leniency due to a hurricane that had left her without power for three days and\n   Temple without power for one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83:15-17; 83:25-84:2.) However, Wu was unable to specify which hurricane had occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     Briggs Has Phone Intake with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Continues to Raise Concerns with Administration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As a result of this latest discipline, Briggs emailed Walton on February 22, 2014, to express her exasperation with the alleged retaliation she was facing. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 33.) She claimed she was \"battered emotionally, insulted, ignore[d], yelled at in front peers, and [made into] the department scapegoat.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She further complained that no one in the department or human resources was taking her complaints seriously. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On February 25, 2014, Briggs, frustrated from the lack of help from Walton, contacted Foehl and informed her that she had conducted a phone intake with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 34; 07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 88:9-89:3.) Foehl forwarded Briggs' email to Walton. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 35.) On March 13, 2014, Briggs wrote again to Walton that she felt singled out, was being pushed out of Temple by her supervisors, and that Temple's actions were in violation of state and federal law. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 37, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Briggs' rate of emails increased and, on March 23, 2014, she emailed Walton to explain what she believed to be a concerted effort to get rid of her. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 38, at 3.) In this email, Briggs detailed an account of the student-worker she had contacted the day she was late and who had personally informed Wu of when Briggs would be arriving. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Briggs also wrote that the essential functions of her job had been diminished to \"elementary clerical functions\" and her responsibilities given to the younger King. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) She explained the toll this had taken on her personal and professional life, but also asked that Walton keep this communication confidential, as she feared further retaliation from Wu, Wacker, and DiMeo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In this email, Briggs also raised concerns about a more recent incident that had occurred the previous Friday. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) According to Briggs' email, she was supposed to input a travel reimbursement into Temple's reimbursement system, Concur, on behalf of Wu. However, she was unable to access the appropriate accounts in the system because she had not yet been granted the appropriate access by the IT department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 99:3-11.) Briggs went on to explain that, after raising this issue to DiMeo and asking him to look into her account access, DiMeo accused her of lying and manufacturing screenshots that showed she had no access. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 38, at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Walton discussed the issues raised in the email with Wacker and DiMeo. (07/18/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 41:12-22; 42:5-8.) On March 24, 2014, Walton provided responses to Briggs' \"serious allegations.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 38, at 2.) With respect to Briggs' February tardiness, Walton dismissed Briggs' efforts to contact Wu, writing that Briggs failed to follow the appropriate procedure by talking to a student-worker and not emailing Wu directly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because of this, Wu requested that Briggs be disciplined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"This discipline is not a false report\n   unless any of the facts ... stated above are incorrect.\").) As to Briggs' Concur incident, Walton wrote that the Account Payable Department confirmed that DiMeo had updated the permissions the prior Monday. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Briggs scheduled a meeting with Foehl on April 1, 2014 to discuss the discrimination she was facing at Temple. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 89:24-90:7.) Briggs informed DiMeo that she was going to speak to Foehl about Wu's treatment of her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91:4-13.) Briggs testified that DiMeo responded, \"Dr. Wu knows what's going on, and ... it's got to stop.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, despite DiMeo's remark, during Briggs' meeting with Foehl on April 1, 2014, Foehl testified that Briggs asked her about conducting an investigation into her complaints of age and gender discrimination. (07/18/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 31:9-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    H.\n    <em>\n     Briggs is Terminated from Temple\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Immediately after Briggs' meeting with Foehl, Briggs met with Wacker at his request. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 91:16-25.) Walton was also in the meeting with Briggs and Wacker. Briggs was then given a termination notice stating that she was being terminated for \"Negligence/Carelessness\" and \"Disruptive or Disorderly Conduct.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 45 (\"Effective the end of the day today, your employment at Temple University is being terminated.\").) According to testimony provided by Wacker and Wu, the termination decision was made together by Wu and Walton. (07/16/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 44:2-14 (Wacker); 07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 68:11 (Wu).) However, according to Walton and Temple's interrogatory responses, the decision was made by Wacker and Wu. (07/18/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 20:16-17; Pl.'s Trial Ex. 62, at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The termination letter noted two incidents that led to Briggs' termination: (1) the above mentioned failure to complete the Concur invoice; and (2) booking a hotel reservation for a high-profile visitor on the wrong dates. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 45; 07/16/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 35:25-36:9, 36:17-37:1.) Regarding the second reason, Wacker testified at trial that Briggs was to book a reservation for a visitor of Wu's at the Conwell Inn. Temple prefers to have visiting guests stay at the Conwell Inn because it is on or close to Temple's campus. However, because Briggs booked the wrong dates, she had to scramble to find him accommodations at the Doubletree Hotel in Center City, Philadelphia. (07/16/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 36:17-37:1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Trial Ex. 45.) Briggs testified that she changed the reservation dates at the request of Wu. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 93:7-94:5.) According to Briggs, she had to change the dates from what she originally booked by shifting the stay by one day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:12-23.) However, upon realizing there was a miscommunication, she was able to arrange for lodging that night at a hotel in Center City, Philadelphia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Two days after receiving her termination notice, Briggs sent an email stating that she would resign in lieu of termination. However, it is undisputed that had she decided not to resign, Briggs would have been terminated involuntarily. (07/16/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 61:12-22; 07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 44:1-4; 07/18/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 54:8-10 (\"Her staying there was not an option.\").) Briggs was ultimately replaced by an employee, Marilyn Grandshaw, who is currently forty-six years old.

That is, Briggs produced sufficient evidence supporting an inference that her age had a \"determinative influence\" on Temple's decision; she did not merely show that her age was a factor motivating Temple's decisions. \"The\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case and pretext inquiries often overlap.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567732\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/358/#p368\">\n    527 F.3d at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, \"evidence supporting the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case is often helpful in the pretext stage, and nothing about the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   formula requires [the Court] to ration the evidence between one stage or the other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567732\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/358/#p368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Briggs relies on the evidence set forth above in support of her satisfaction of the fourth prong of the prima facie case, as well as numerous other facts set forth below, that could lead a reasonable jury to find that she established pretext. For instance, Briggs focuses on the termination letter handed to her on April 1, 2014, which sets forth the following two alleged incidents that resulted in her receipt of C-level discipline and termination: (1) her alleged intentional failure to submit Dr. Wu's travel reimbursements; and (2) her alleged failure to book a hotel for a speaker for the correct nights. (Pl.'s Br. Opp'n 36.) Regarding the travel reimbursement issue, Briggs argues that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   [she] testified that one of her job duties as an Executive Assistant had been to submit her supervisor's travel expenses. She would utilize Defendant's internal system, called Concur, after she was given access and permission to allocate the expenses to a particular grant number. On March 20, 2014, at 3:53pm, Dr. Wu sent an email to Drew DiMeo stating that Defendant had not yet administratively inputted Dr. Wu's grant number into his account. At 3:56pm that same day, Mr. DiMeo emailed Plaintiff, telling her to submit the travel reimbursement into the system by 5:00pm that day. At 5:27pm that day, Plaintiff sent Mr. DiMeo a lengthy email explaining that she still did not have access to the grant number in the system, and therefore she did not have the requisite \"permission\" on the computer to submit the report. Plaintiff further identified what she believed was the technical issue within the system that denied her the access she needed to complete the project. Mr. DiMeo did not respond to Plaintiff's last email. Plaintiff stayed at work, however, and attempted to remedy the problem herself but she was unable to do so without the required computer access.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendant argued at trial that Plaintiff did in fact have the required access, and instead intentionally failed to submit the expense report on Dr. Wu's behalf. Defendant's argument fell flat, as it was unable to produce any credible testimony on what occurred or any documents in support of its position (except for Defendant's Trial Exhibit 71, which is consistent with Plaintiff's position that she was unable to access the account through no fault of her own). HR Director Walton could not explain whether she did or did not receive any documentation showing that Plaintiff did in fact have access to the account that night. And Dr. Wu testified that Mr. DiMeo obtained written documentation and that he has even seen it, but no such document was ever presented to the jury. Defendant did not call Mr. DiMeo as a witness in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37 (citations omitted).) Thus, Briggs asserts, and we agree, that the jury had ample evidence on this issue to conclude that Temple's stated reason for terminating her employment cannot be believed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Also, we note that Temple's lack of evidence, which includes documentation that was testified to, but never presented, and its decision not to have DiMeo testify, amounted to a weak defense\n   concerning the issue at hand that the jury may have also taken into account in reaching its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Regarding Briggs' alleged failure to book a hotel room for the correct nights, she testified that \"Dr. Wu himself asked her to change the reservations, and she followed his instructions appropriately\" and \"Dr. Wu testified that he does not even recall this incident at all-even though it's specifically delineated in the termination letter and Dr. Wu was an individual who made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38 (citing 07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 93:16-23; 07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 91:23-92:7).) Thus, Briggs again asserts, and we agree, that the jury had ample evidence on this issue to conclude that Temple's stated reason for terminating her employment cannot be believed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In further support of her claim that Temple's stated reasons for her termination were pure pretext, Briggs also argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Plaintiff highlighted Defendant's policies which state that two (2) C-level disciplines in one (1) year will result in termination. Plaintiff received her first-ever C-level discipline on March 26, 2013. Then, almost exactly one-year to the day, Defendant issued Plaintiff another C-level discipline for the two (2) alleged incidents set forth above. Plaintiff argued that this is not a coincidence-Defendant wanted Plaintiff out, and dug up anything they could on Plaintiff as the one-year mark was approaching so that the termination would appear to be non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory. Defendant denied this, of course. However, the jury did not believe Defendant that its articulated reasons were the real reasons and found in favor of Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38 (citations omitted).) Briggs goes on to argue that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Moreover, the jury saw and heard evidence that the previous disciplines given to Plaintiff during her tenure under Dr. Wu were entirely unwarranted and pretextual. For example, not one witness for Defendant could explain a non-retaliatory reason for why Plaintiff was given a written discipline on November 9, 2011, the day Dr. Wu stated to Plaintiff that women her age in China are \"put out to pasture\" and Plaintiff responded in opposition, \"With all due respect, we're in America and not in China.\" Additionally, the jury heard that Dr. Wu issued Plaintiff a written discipline for oversleeping on one (1) occasion by three (3) hours, but her substantially younger co-worker, Ms. King, was not given any discipline for not calling out or showing up to work for three (3)\n   <em>\n    days\n   </em>\n   straight. Finally, despite Dr. Wu's testimony that Plaintiff made \"hundreds\" of mistakes, there was simply no evidence to back up that assertion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Additionally, Briggs summarized evidence of Temple's age-based discrimination and animus against her as follows\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   1. On November 9, 2011, Dr. Wu approached Plaintiff, who was turning fifty-seven (57) years old the next day, and asked her how old she was going to be.

Acknowledging that it is Briggs' burden to prove that Temple's stated reasons for her termination\n   were pretext, we also note that the trial record, and specifically, Temple's defense, failed to present a solid reason as to why many of the events unfolded as they did. For instance, regarding Wu's travel expenses, Briggs testified that she did not have access to the account and provided a supporting email stating as such. Temple asserted that she, in fact, did have access, but it did not proffer any proof of such access. Even though Wu testified that DiMeo obtained written documentation showing that Briggs had access, such documentation was never presented and DiMeo was never called to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding Briggs' alleged failure to book a hotel for the correct nights, the only record evidence we have is Briggs' testimony that she appropriately followed Wu's instructions to change the reservations and Wu's testimony that he does not recall the incident. Of course, it is within the jury's province to assess the credibility of both Briggs and Wu regrading this critical issue of the travel arrangements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Giving every fair and reasonable inference to Briggs, a reasonable jury could conclude that, based on the above, Temple's decision to terminate Briggs' employment was a pretext for unlawful age discrimination. Thus, it was appropriately left to the factfinder to decide what happened, why, and whether unlawful age discrimination was a \"but for\" reason for Temple's action. Here, Briggs adduced sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that Temple's legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination were pretextual and that age was a \"but for\" cause of the adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Retaliation for Complaints Regarding Age Discrimination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Temple also moves for judgment as a matter of law on Briggs' claim of retaliation under the ADEA and PHRA. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must prove \"(1) [that she engaged in] protected employee activity; (2) an adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.

Second, Temple once again argues that Briggs did not suffer an adverse employment action.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And lastly, it states that, even if Briggs has established a prima facie case of retaliation, Temple rebutted any inference of discrimination by providing legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.)

Law Supp. 20.) Conversely, Briggs points to numerous instances in the record, including Temple's sworn and verified responses to interrogatories, where Briggs complained of discrimination to various individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Despite Temple's assertion at this stage of the proceedings that Briggs' complaints to Etezady and Foehl constitute the only protected activity in this case, its responses to interrogatories clearly indicate there were other instances of protected activity. Significantly, Walton verified Temple's interrogatory responses and provided as follows: \"In 2013 and 2014, Briggs raised her claims of discrimination with Deirdre Walton, Temple University, Department of Labor and Employee Relations. Ms. Walton found no merit to Briggs' claims.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 62, at 7-8.) In addition to Foehl, Etezady, and Walton, Temple also responded that Briggs raised her complaints of discrimination to Rhonda Brown and Fay Trachtenberg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Temple's argument that the only instances of protected activity are Briggs' complaints to Foehl and Etezady is clearly belied by its own interrogatory responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Turning to the specific evidence adduced at trial, we believe there were ample complaints of age discrimination that constitute protected activity, including complaints made to the decision-makers who ultimately decided to terminate Briggs' employment. For instance, when Wu made the comment to Briggs that, in China, women her age are put out to pasture, Briggs responded immediately and stated, \"Well, with all due respect, we're in American right now.\" (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   31:13-16.) Just one hour later, Briggs was summoned to Wacker's office and was given discipline for being unprofessional to Wu. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:3-20.) At that meeting, Briggs explained what Wu said, indicating that Wacker was aware of Wu's discriminatory comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:4-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Later on, Briggs complained to Walton about Wu's comment. (07/17/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 121:12-122:1.) Walton then directed Wacker to look into the situation, who in turn spoke with Wu about the comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122:2-6, 128:11-23.) Walton testified that Wu would have known that Briggs complained about his comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128:11-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Briggs also testified about responses DiMeo and Wacker made when Briggs informed them she was speaking with Foehl about workplace issues. When Briggs told DiMeo about how she was speaking with Foehl about Wu's treatment, DiMeo responded, \"Dr. Wu knows what's going on, and I'm - you know, and it's got to stop.\" (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 91:4-13.) Similarly, Wacker threatened Briggs, stating \"Dr. Wu knows what you're doing and if you want your job, you better cut it out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Moreover, as we explained above, Walton verified Temple's responses to interrogatories and provided that Briggs made complaints of discrimination to her in 2013 and 2014. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 62 at 7-8.) Significantly, Briggs emailed Foehl on February 25, 2014, stating that she \"plan[ned] to file an EEOC complaint internally and ha[d] already had a phone intake with the EEOC.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 34; 07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 89:2-3.) Foehl then forwarded Briggs' email to Walton. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 35.) Briggs also emailed Walton directly, stating she was being subjected to \"unfair labor practices and discrimination, both of which violate federal and state laws.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 37, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Contrary to Temple's assertion, we believe that Briggs' direct opposition to Wu's comment, and her complaints of discrimination to Walton and Wacker (among others), qualify as protected activity because Briggs specifically complained of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886713\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/181/#p193\">\n    776 F.3d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Adverse Employment Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   As before regarding Briggs' disparate treatment claim under the ADEA, Temple once again argues that Briggs' prima facie case of retaliation fails because she did not suffer an adverse employment action. For the reasons set forth above, Briggs clearly presented a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that she suffered an adverse employment action by being terminated by Temple. Thus, the adverse employment action prong of her prima facie case was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Temple next argues it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because \"there was no causal connection between Ms. Briggs['] complaints and the end of her employment.\" (Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 21.) Specifically, Temple asserts that Briggs' claim of retaliation fails as a matter of law because the decision-makers, Wu, Walton, and Wacker, had no knowledge of Briggs complaining of discrimination.

As to the temporal proximity, the jury saw Temple's responses to interrogatories, which provided that Walton was aware of Briggs' complaints of discrimination in 2013 and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Trial Ex. 62 at 7-8.) Indeed, Foehl forwarded Briggs' February 25, 2014 email to Walton, where Briggs wrote that she already had a phone intake with the EEOC and planned to file an internal EEOC complaint. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 34; 07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 89:2-3.) Briggs was terminated on April 1, 2014. Therefore, just one month after Walton was aware that Briggs was initiating action with the EEOC, Walton, Wacker, and Wu decided to terminate Briggs' employment. Accordingly, we believe there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action was \"unusually suggestive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The trial evidence was also sufficient for the jury to conclude that the record, as a whole, created an inference of retaliation. As we explained above, Wu, Wacker, and Walton were all aware that Briggs had complained about Wu's discriminatory comment. When Briggs told DiMeo and Wacker about how she was complaining to Foehl, both responded in a similar fashion. DiMeo told Briggs that Wu knew about her complaints and that \"it's got to stop.\" (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 91:4-13.) Wacker responded even more harshly, stating that \"Dr. Wu knows what you're doing and if you want your job, you better cut it out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) We conclude that this evidence alone established an inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that Briggs adduced sufficient evidence at trial to establish her prima facie case of retaliation under the ADEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Pretext\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Temple alternatively argues that even if Briggs established her prima facie case of retaliation, judgment as a matter of law should, nevertheless, be granted because she failed to rebut Temple's legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for her termination. Temple relies on the same legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the retaliation claim as it did in Briggs' age discrimination claim. (Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 21 (\"For the same reasons Ms. Briggs lacks evidence that Temple's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason was a pretext for her age discrimination claim, ... she also lacks evidence that the reason was a pretext for retaliation.\") );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Section III-A-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   As discussed above, we believe that Briggs adduced sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find Temple's legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination were pretextual and that age was a \"but for\" cause of the adverse employment action.

The same conclusion follows if the predicate act combines with other factors to produce the result, so long as the other factors alone would not have done so-if, so to speak, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Thus, if poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple diseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those diseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without the incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   This but-for requirement is part of the common understanding of cause. Consider a baseball game in which the visiting team's leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of the first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a score of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English language and familiar with the American pastime would agree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is so because it is natural to say that one event is the outcome or consequence of another when the former would not have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point that the victory also resulted from a host of other necessary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach's decision to put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league's decision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little sense to say that an event resulted from or was the outcome of some earlier action if the action merely played a nonessential contributing role in producing the event. If the visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than 1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page that the victory resulted from the leadoff batter's early, non-dispositive home run.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701986\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/204/\">\n    571 U.S. at 211-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Temple highlights the baseball example in\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   to show that despite a host of necessary and contributing causes (skillful pitching, the coach's decision to put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league's decision to schedule the\n   game), there was only one \"but-for\" cause of victory (the home run). (Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 31-32.) Temple construes this to mean that there can only ever be one \"but-for\" cause.

With two outs, the home team batter hits a long, fly ball over the wall. However, the outfielder is able to reach over the wall and catch the ball for the final out of the game. Clearly, this scenario creates two \"but-for\" causes for the visiting team's victory: if not for the lead-off home run, the game would have been tied and gone to extra innings following the outfielder's final out in the ninth inning and; if not for the outfielder's over-the-wall catch, the home team would have won the game 4 to 1. The victory would not have occurred, but-for the lead-off home run and the outfielder's catch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701986\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/204/\">\n    571 U.S. at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t is natural to say that one event is the outcome or consequence of another when the former would not have occurred but for the latter.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Therefore, it is entirely consistent with\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   to state that Briggs was terminated by Temple because of her age and because of her complaints about discriminatory conduct.\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   rejected the \"mixed-motive\" theory applied to Title VII claims, where impermissible factors, along with permissible factors, merely had to be motivating the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658005\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/167/#p176\">\n    557 U.S. at 173, 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658005\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/167/#p176\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, it asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   This conduct does not rise to the level of a hostile work environment because (1) the alleged harassment was not severe or pervasive; (2) an objectively, reasonable person would not have been affected detrimentally by the incidents Ms. Briggs testified to; and (3) the evidentiary record demonstrates that Ms. Briggs was not subjectively offended by the supposed conduct. Finally, Ms. Briggs offered no evidence linking the infrequent and sporadic comments about her performance deficiencies and a single alleged comment about women in China being \"put out to pasture\" at 55 to any discriminatory animus based on her age or any other characteristic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Briggs argues that the record is replete with evidence of Temple's severe or pervasive conduct towards her and how the conduct detrimentally affected her or any reasonable person in her shoes. (Pl.'s Br. Opp'n 26.) In support of her argument, Briggs relies on her evidence of Temple's age-based discrimination and animus towards her in support of her age-based discrimination claims, and set forth the following evidence of Temple's severe or pervasive conduct towards her, and its detrimental effect on her, without limitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   1.

Wu's conduct, and the treatment by Temple's HR, EOC, and legal department, towards Briggs could be viewed by a reasonable juror as sufficiently \"severe or pervasive\" to support a hostile work environment claim. The \"severe or pervasive\" standard requires conduct that is sufficient \"to alter the conditions of [the employee's] employment and create an abusive working environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Moody v.

Looking at the totality of the circumstances, including Wu's comment about putting older women out to pasture and the overall treatment presented by Briggs that she received from Temple until she was handed the April 1, 2014 letter, and viewing such circumstances in her favor, there was adequate evidence for the jury to find a sufficiently hostile or abusive environment that could be considered humiliating, which unreasonably interfered with her work performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   As we previously noted, simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) are insufficient to sustain a hostile work environment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271389\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/424/#p438\">\n    218 F.Supp.3d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, after assessing the totality of the circumstances as proffered by Briggs, the case that she presented at trial did not just deal with offhand comments or isolated incidents. It involved conduct, as well as apparent failures to take effective measures regarding some of Briggs' complaints, that were never adequately explained by Temple, which could be viewed as permeating her workplace with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult so as to have altered the conditions of her employment and created an abusive environment in which to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Also, Briggs' account provided a sufficient basis from which a reasonable juror could infer that Temple's conduct detrimentally affected her and would have affected a reasonable person in similar circumstances. Briggs' testimony, and documentary evidence, listed above clearly showed that she subjectively perceived the environment to be abusive. In light of Wu's comment and what transpired with Briggs' employment, a reasonable person in Briggs' position would have experienced it to be so severe as to effect a change in the terms and conditions of her employment.

Specifically, Temple states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   Ms. Briggs' retaliatory hostile work environment claim is premised upon the same conduct that purportedly supports her hostile work environment claims. For the same reasons articulated in [the age-based hostile work environment discussion], supra, the conduct about which Ms. Briggs testified was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively or subjectively hostile work environment, retaliatory or otherwise, and therefore, she did not prove her retaliatory hostile work environment claim. Likewise, Ms. Briggs' retaliatory hostile work environment fails as a matter of law because, for the same reasons articulated in [the age-based retaliation discussion],\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Briggs failed to demonstrate a causal link between her protected activity and the supposed harassment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Since we have found that the jury's verdict regarding Briggs' hostile work environment claim is supported by the evidence, and in light of the fact that we similarly reached the same conclusion concerning her retaliation claim, we reject Temple's argument. Based on our previous analysis of Briggs' hostile work environment and retaliation claims, we find that the jury had a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for Briggs on her retaliatory hostile work environment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Back Pay and Front Pay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   In its Motion, Temple argues that it is entitled to a new trial on the jury's award of $250,000 in back pay damages. (Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 33-35.) Temple argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Briggs properly mitigated her damages after becoming a home healthcare aide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) Relatedly, Temple claims that the Court's \"failure to provide adequate instructions on applicable limitations to back pay damages,\" namely, refusing \"Temple's counsel ... permission to read back testimony concerning Ms. Briggs' failure to mitigate her damages,\" resulted in the unsupported damages award. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Temple argues that, even if the jury ignored Briggs' failure to mitigate, it still miscalculated the award amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) Finally,\n   since the legal authority and arguments made by both parties in support of, and in opposition to, this motion are substantially similar, if not altogether directly repeated, in their arguments in opposition and in support, respectively, to Briggs' Motion for Front Pay, we will consider the issue of back pay and front pay together here.

Importantly, Temple accepts that Briggs adequately mitigated her damages during the twenty-eight months following her termination from Temple until August 2016 by including that time period in its calculation of Briggs' back pay and a lack of argument attacking Briggs' efforts to mitigate her damages during that initial twenty-eight-month period. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 35; Def.'s Resp. Opp'n 2-3 (arguing failure to mitigate began after August 2016);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem.

Therefore, Temple argues that Briggs still had a duty to continue to search for a substantially equivalent position because she \"did not secure her home healthcare job as 'interim employment,' \" but rather \"she took the job as permanent employment.\" (Def.'s Surreply Br. 2-3 (arguing that Briggs' \"admission that she stopped looking for any other work once she secured employment ... confirms that she took the job as permanent employment\").) By way of further explaining its argument, Temple concedes that \"had Ms. Briggs taken the home healthcare aide job as\n   <em>\n    temporary or 'interim'\n   </em>\n   employment while continuing to search for\n   <em>\n    suitable, permanent\n   </em>\n   employment, then the argument that she was not required to search for more lucrative interim work would be more appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.1 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   However, Temple's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Tubari\n   </em>\n   is misguided.

Temple arrives at this figure by considering Briggs' base salary of $50,000 pro-rated for the twenty-eight months she was unemployed-$116,666-plus her pro-rated base salary minus her wages as a home healthcare aide of $22,000 per year during the twenty-three months between her August 2016 start date and trial-$53,666.

In fact, a break-down of Briggs' benefits was provided by Temple in its response to Briggs' interrogatories. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 62, at 11-12.) According to Temple's response, Temple paid $1,334.66 per month for health insurance; $28.25 per month for dental insurance; $1.15 per month for life insurance; and $17.09 per month to Briggs' 403(b) Defined Contribution Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The sum of these benefits is $16,573.80 per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Incorporating this benefit amount into Temple's above calculation, the resulting figure equals $247,769.24.

Pro-rated\n   over twenty-eight months equals $159,171.48 and over twenty-three months-less Briggs' $22,000 per year salary as a home healthcare aide-equals $88,597.76. The resulting total is Briggs' back pay award. Therefore, the jury's award of $250,000 in back pay damages is well within reason of the evidence provided at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Court did not Err in Answering a Question Submitted by the Jury during Deliberations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Temple makes a related argument that we failed to \"provide adequate instructions on applicable limitations to back pay damages.\" (Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 33.) This issue arises from a question that was submitted to the Court by the jury after deliberations began. The question was: \"[H]ow do we calculate lost wages?\" (07/19/2018, Trial Tr. 90:14-15.) The jury explained that it had not heard the relevant wage numbers outside of closing arguments and had only seen them on the screen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:24-25, 91:3-5.) After hearing arguments from both Temple and Briggs, as well as an off-the-record discussion between counsel for the parties, Briggs' counsel ultimately read back the following testimony to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   [BRIGGS' COUNSEL] QUESTION: And while you were working at Temple, what was your annual salary?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   [BRIGGS] ANSWER: From $50,000 with benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   QUESTION: And at the $10.70 that you are-that you've been making in total, how much have you made working as a home healthcare aide for two years?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   ANSWER: It's about 22,000 a year, so two-it's been two years now, so forty-four.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:5-13.) The Court then confirmed that this response had adequately answered the jury's question. After deliberations resumed, Temple asked the Court to consider providing the jury with testimony \"where Ms. Briggs said that she stopped looking for a job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:21-23.) However, we believed that we had given the jury what they had asked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:25-93:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Temple argues that this violated the common law \"rule of completeness,\" as codified in Federal Rule of Evidence 106, and allowed Briggs' counsel to read \"one-sided\" testimony that unfairly prejudiced the jury.

Law Supp. 34.) The testimony requested by Temple did not pertain to the question posed by the jury. The jury's question concerned the calculation of lost\n   wages. The testimony read back included references to Briggs' compensation and years working as a home healthcare aide. The testimony Temple wished to include pertained directly to Temple's burden of establishing that Briggs failed to mitigate her damages. (Def.'s Resp. Opp'n 3 (\"Ms. Briggs'\n   <em>\n    admitted\n   </em>\n   failure to mitigate her damages, which resulted in a willful loss of the difference in wages she earns as a home healthcare aide and the wages she earned as a Temple employee.\" (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The jury's question did not concern whether Briggs had mitigated her damages.

We just saw it on the screen at one point.\").) Because the jury did not ask about Briggs' duty to mitigate, we must assume that they understood the relevant jury instruction provided at charging:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   If you award back pay, you are instructed to deduct from the back pay a figure, whatever wages Ms. Briggs has obtained from other employment during that period.....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   You are further instructed that Ms. Briggs has a duty to mitigate her damages. That is, she has-she is required to make reasonable effort[s] under the circumstances to reduce her damages. And it's Temple University's burden to prove that Ms. Briggs has failed to mitigate. So if Temple University persuades you by a preponderance of the evidence that Ms. Briggs failed to obtain substantially equivalent job opportunities that were reasonably available to her, you must reduce the amount of damages by the amount of wages that Ms. Briggs reasonably could have earned if she had obtained those opportunities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   For these reasons, a new trial is not warranted.

The calculation is based on her current age of sixty-three, a salary rate of $51,651.12 per year, plus her entitled yearly benefits equaling $16,573.80, less her current salary as a home healthcare aide of $22,000 per year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    An Award of Front Pay Is Supported by the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   The front pay calculation of $60,670.20 is based on Briggs' motion requesting a front pay award equal to ten years of lost wages.

We will first consider Temple's second argument because, if there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find willfulness, then the Court necessarily did not err in charging the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   In this case, Question 10 of the Verdict Form asked whether Temple \"engaged in willful misconduct by intentionally discriminating against [Briggs] because of age\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   retaliating against her because of her complaint of age discrimination?\" (Verdict Form, Doc. No. 58 (emphasis added).) As to retaliation, Temple's sole argument is that it could not have retaliated against Briggs because the decision-makers, Walton, Wacker, and Wu, had no knowledge that Briggs complained of harassment and discrimination during her employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 28.) Without the decision-makers' knowledge of the complaints, Temple claims it could not have retaliated against Briggs (let alone willfully) for complaining of discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   We believe there was sufficient evidence presented at trial for the jury to conclude that Temple acted willfully in retaliating against Briggs for her complaints of age discrimination. Indeed, the trial evidence belies Temple's contention that Walton, Wacker, and Wu did not know about Brigg's complaints of age discrimination. For instance, just one hour after Wu commented that \"in China, we put women out to pasture at 55,\" (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 31:12-13), Briggs was called into Wacker's office and was given discipline for being unprofessional to Wu, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:3-20). At the meeting with Wacker, Briggs specifically told him what Wu had said to her about women being \"put out to pasture at 55.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:4-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Briggs also complained directly to Walton about Wu's comment. (07/17/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 121:12-122:1.) Walton testified that Briggs told her the story of what Wu said and that Briggs was offended by it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Walton then directed Wacker to look into the situation, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127:7-12), who in\n   turn spoke with Wu about the comment, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122:2-6). In fact, Walton testified that Wu would have known that Briggs made a complaint about the comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128:11-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   The above testimony clearly establishes that all of the decision-makers in Briggs' termination from Temple had knowledge of her complaints of age discrimination. However, what proves fatal to Temple's argument is that Walton,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , knew that Briggs had a phone intake with the EEOC and planned to file an EEOC compliant just over one month before her termination. On February 25, 2014, Briggs informed Foehl via email that she \"plan[ned] to file an EEOC complaint internally and ha[d] already had a phone intake with the EEOC.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 34; 07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 89:2-3.) Foehl forwarded Briggs' email to Walton. (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 35.) Therefore, just over one month prior to Briggs' termination, Walton had direct knowledge that Briggs had a phone intake with the EEOC and was planning on filing an internal EEOC complaint due to the allegations of discriminatory conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Temple's consistent assertion that the decision-makers regarding Briggs' termination (in particular, Walton) did not know of her complaints of age discrimination is also somewhat unsettling. As we noted above, Briggs directly complained of Wu's discriminatory comment to Walton and Wacker. Walton even verified Temple's responses to Briggs' interrogatories, which provided that \"[i]n 2013 and 2014, Briggs raised her complaints of discrimination with Deirdre Walton, Temple University, Department of Labor and Employee Relations. Ms. Walton found no merit to Briggs' claims.\" (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 62 at 7-8.) Despite Briggs complaining of Wu's comment to Walton immediately after it was made, and Temple admitting in its sworn interrogatories that Briggs complained of discrimination to Walton in 2013 and 2014, the jury heard Walton take the witness stand and testify that in 2013 and 2014, Briggs did not complain of discrimination to her. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 108:15-18.) In a similar fashion, Wu testified he did not know of Briggs' complaints about age and gender discrimination and retaliation until only this past year. (07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 100:1-22.) Wu testified this way even though Walton testified that every time Briggs made a complaint about Wu, Walton would have Wacker and DiMeo look into it. (07/18/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 57:22-25 (\"So every time [Briggs] made a complaint to me in regards to how she thought she was being treated, I talked with Greg Wacker. Greg Wacker and both Drew [DiMeo] looked into those situations.\"); Pl.'s Trial Ex. 40 (\"Every time you have reached out to me I have talked with you and looked into your complaints and concerns.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   As indicated, Walton, Wacker, and Wu were the decision-makers in terminating Briggs' employment at Temple. The jury heard testimony and saw documentary evidence showing consistent complaints from Briggs about age discrimination from the very day Wu made the comment until her termination. Moreover, the jury was entitled to believe Temple acted willfully after hearing numerous contradictions from Temple's witnesses. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Temple's actions, at the very least, constituted reckless disregard when it terminated Briggs' employment after her complaints of age discrimination and, in particular, her phone intake with the EEOC and plan to file an internal EEOC complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Other courts have sustained the jury's finding of willfulness in retaliatory conduct in violation of the ADEA.

On the subject of liquidated damages during the charge, Temple's counsel simply stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n   Your Honor, liquidated damages are only recoverable under the ADEA; they're not recoverable under Title VII, they're not recoverable for a harassment claim. The jury needs to be keenly aware that, if they find for the plaintiff on a claim,\n   <em>\n    other than her age claim\n   </em>\n   , they are not to award liquidated damages.\n   <em>\n    That is only if they find for the plaintiff on an age claim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:17-23 (emphasis added).)

Law Supp. 37.) Second, Temple\n   argues that if the Court does not grant judgment for Temple, then a remittitur of the jury's award of compensatory damages is appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   As to Temple's first argument, we believe there was sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the jury's award of $350,000 in compensatory damages. The evidence at trial not only included Briggs' testimony about emotional distress, but the jury also saw documentary evidence in the form of emails Briggs sent that clearly warranted pain and suffering damages. In emails to numerous individuals during her employment at Temple, Briggs stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   \u2022 \"I am so bullied and harassed all day.... It is beginning to feel like\n   <em>\n    psychological abuse\n   </em>\n   .

Of course, I fear the financial disaster that I will face when I have to rent [sic] and utilities to pay on May 1st, but I miss the only community I have had since my children left home, the Temple undergrads and grad students and an incredible group of inspiring faculty members.\n   <em>\n    A wave of grief has pulled me under the surf and it's hard to breathe\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 46 (emphasis added).) A few weeks later, Briggs emailed the following to Foehl:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-296\">\n   My prospects to find full-time employment with a similar salary, health insurance and contributions to my retirement account are slim. My two sons and I will lose health insurance on April 30th and the rent must come from my retirement account, for which the penalty will be substantial to my current and future financial status. My\n   <em>\n    distress\n   </em>\n   is not unreasonable, especially when my termination resulted because the standards to which I was held were unfair and unequal. I hope that you will consider this as you move to investigate my complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   (Pl.'s Trial Ex. 53 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Briggs also presented credible testimony at trial about her emotional state. For\n   instance, as a result of losing her employment at Temple, her retirement fund has gone from $100,000 to $5,000; she could not put up a Christmas tree or buy her grandchildren Christmas gifts; she was forced to find subsidized housing; and she is now on food stamps. (07/17/2018 AM, Trial Tr. 118:2-23; 122:13-23; 123:13-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   While an award of $350,000 may appear to be at the larger range of compensatory damages in an employment discrimination case, it is important to remember that \"[t]here is 'no legal yardstick by which to measure accurately' reasonable compensation for pain and suffering.\"\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338757\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/930/194/#p199\">\n    930 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   199 (citing\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

We believe the above-cited documentary and testimonial evidence shows actual injury sufficient for Briggs to sustain an award of pain and suffering damages. The emails she sent to various individuals at Temple and testimony at trial clearly show her damaged emotional state, in which she described,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , like she was drowning, being pulled under a wave of grief, having no confidence, being battered emotionally, and being afraid to go to work. She even stated that her work environment was beginning to feel like psychological abuse. After her employment with Temple ended, she testified her retirement savings went from $100,000 to $5,000 and that she was not able to afford Christmas presents for her grandchildren, eliciting an emotional response during the trial. In sum, we do not believe medical evidence or corroborating testimony was necessary for Briggs to sustain her award of compensatory damages, and we will deny Temple's motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Temple alternatively moves the Court to remit the jury's award of compensatory damages, citing\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   in support.

Briggs, on the other hand, presented not only trial testimony of her emotional distress (particularly her inability to buy her grandchildren Christmas presents, going on food stamps, and losing her retirement savings), but she also presented countless contemporaneous emails to numerous individuals at Temple evidencing her damaged emotional state. Therefore, we do not believe the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   is comparable to Briggs, and the court's remittitur in that case is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   , who presented expert witnesses and family and friends to corroborate her testimony that she suffered emotional distress while working at the defendant, Briggs was the sole witness to testify as to her emotional distress. \"However, neither medical evidence nor corroborating testimony is necessarily required in order to support an award of mental anguish damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Moussa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9053250\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/289/639/#p665\">\n    289 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   665 (citing\n   <em>\n    Blackshear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684006\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/417/#p430\">\n    15 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   430 ).

Prior to trial, the parties agreed to bifurcate the trial on punitive damages. (07/16/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 3:13-4:21.) The jury would first determine whether punitive damages should be assessed and, if so, then a second phase of the trial would begin where the jury would determine the amount of punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While Briggs raises an interesting argument on the jury's finding of willfulness under the ADEA to mean there should have been a jury instruction and a corresponding question on the Verdict Form about punitive damages under Title VII, we believe her argument is waived because she failed to object to the absence of such an instruction during the charging conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Briggs' motion for a new trial is centered on the Court's failure to charge the jury on the issue of punitive damages. (Pl.'s Mot. Mem. Law Supp. Punitive Damages 7-8.) However, as we explained above regarding Temple's failure to object to the Court's jury instruction on willfulness under the ADEA, \"[a] party who objects to an instruction ... must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(1). A party who does not state its objection to the inclusion or exclusion of a jury instruction and the specific grounds for the objection waives any subsequent argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lesende v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 49 at 11 (Proposed Jury Instructions); Doc. No. 46, Question 11 (Proposed Verdict Form).) However, during the charging conference the issue of punitive damages was raised, but Briggs' counsel failed to object, let alone with any specificity, to the Court's intention not to charge on punitive damages. (07/18/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 73:18-25.) The following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-310\">\n   [BRIGGS' COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.

(07/19/2018, Trial Tr. 3:2-8:18.) Once again, Briggs' counsel failed to raise any objection to the absence of a question on the\n   verdict form on the issue of liability for punitive damages. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535585\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/750/#p759\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   As indicated above, Briggs' counsel failed to object to the absence of a jury instruction on punitive damages or the absence of such a question on the verdict form. Like Temple waived its argument on the Court's jury instruction on willfulness under the ADEA, Briggs similarly waived her argument as to the absence of a jury instruction on punitive damages under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Witnesses that could corroborate Temple's theory appeared to be unprepared and testified solely within the framework of Briggs' case-in-chief, leaving the trial without a strong presentation of a comprehensive defense, which not only impacted trial, but has also impacted our consideration of Temple's arguments regarding judgment as a matter of law. Inexplicably, Temple did not call a single witness, opting instead to play a brief video deposition segment. Specifically, Temple did not call DiMeo, who played a significant role in the facts of this lawsuit. Based on the testimony given by each witness viewed cumulatively, a reasonable jury could conclude that such testimony supported Briggs' claim that Temple's stated reasons for her termination were pretextual.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-328\">\n    Temple points out that\n    <em>\n     Milillo v. Thomas Jefferson Univ. Hosp.\n    </em>\n    is a case handled by Briggs' counsel. Temple cites this case for the proposition that age must be\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    but-for cause, not merely\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    but-for cause. (Def.'s Mem. Law Supp. 32.) However, neither the opinion nor the briefing address a scenario involving multiple \"but-for\" causes, thus making it harder to apply it to the case at hand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-329\">\n    On the verdict sheet, we included an instruction that the jury should skip questions concerning retaliation following an affirmative finding of age discrimination. We included the instruction after hearing arguments from the parties at the charging conference. (07/18/2018 PM, Trial Tr. 64:14-68:14.) Because the jury ignored the instruction and answered each question, Temple argues that the answers are inconsistent and entitles it to a new trial. However, after further review of the applicable caselaw, we believe that we erred in including that instruction. As we describe above, we believe it is not legally incompatible to have multiple but-for causes. Nevertheless, even though the jury ignored the verdict sheet instruction and answered each question, we believe it is a harmless error that does not warrant a new trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Montgomery Cty. v.

Under federal law, when the defendant \"has more than 500 employees in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year,\" the amount of compensatory damages available to a plaintiff is capped at $300,000.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715271\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/604/962/#p966\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1981a(b)(3)(D).
