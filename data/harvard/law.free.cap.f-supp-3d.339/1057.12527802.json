At trial, the government intends to present cellular-phone records obtained by court order in February 2017 under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), which required only an application with \"specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that ... the records ... are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wright moved to suppress those records, arguing that their acquisition should have required a warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Magistrate Judge Ferenbach denied the motion in April of this year because courts in this state and district had consistently held that the SCA's specific-and-articulable-facts standard applied to such records, and the investigator's application satisfied it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wright objects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States Supreme Court held this summer in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

But because the government obtained Wright's cellular records pre-\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   and in reasonable reliance\n   on the order issued under the SCA, I conclude that the good-faith exception to the warrant requirement spares this evidence from exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Brian Wright and a handful of co-defendants are charged with interference with commerce by robbery, brandishing a firearm, and conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery for the January 3, 2017, armed robbery of a Jared's The Gallery of Jewelry store, and the January 13, 2017, armed robbery of an MJ Christensen Jewelers store-both in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the course of investigating these robberies, FBI Special Agent Christopher McPeak applied to a Nevada state court judge under the SCA for an order directing T-Mobile USA to provide the January 2017 cell phone records for Wright's phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge found \"specific and articulable facts sufficient to form a reasonable belief that the information sought [wa]s relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation pursuant to the authority of ...\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et. al.,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Leon\n   </em>\n   saves Wright's records from suppression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wright replies that the good-faith exception does not apply\n   because McPeak's application lacked facts necessary to satisfy the SCA, and he suggests baldly that McPeak and the prosecution have it out for him, so they are \"fabricating evidence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the material change in the law since the magistrate judge's order, I review these suppression issues de novo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The premise of the magistrate judge's order denying Wright's motion to suppress is that cellular phone records in the hands of a third party were not protected by the Fourth Amendment, so the law did not require a warrant to obtain them-just a court order under the SCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   But\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   changed the analysis that must be applied to Wright's arguments. In it, the High Court held that \"an order issued under Section 2703(d) of the [Stored Communications] Act is not a permissible mechanism for accessing historical cell-site records,\" so law enforcement must \"get a warrant\" to compel \"a wireless carrier to turn\" them over.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Post-\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , there is no question that law enforcement needs a warrant to get historical cell-site records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But the confirmation of a Fourth Amendment privacy interest in cellular-phone data does not mean that all such records obtained pre-\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   automatically must be excluded from trial. The exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy and not \"a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not \"designed to 'redress the injury' occasioned by an unconstitutional search.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, its \"sole purpose ... is to deter future Fourth Amendment violations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield 'meaningful' deterrence, and culpable enough to be 'worth the price paid by the justice system.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Where suppression fails to yield 'appreciable deterrence,' exclusion is 'clearly unwarranted.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Davis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the exclusionary rule's deterrent purpose is not fostered when evidence is \"obtained during a search conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the Court\n   considered whether a gun found during the search of a car should have been suppressed. Though the search comported with then-existing precedent, the Supreme Court revised the rule for searching an automobile incident to a recent occupant's arrest while Davis's appeal was pending, and the search was unconstitutional under the new test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   When considering whether that constitutional error necessitated suppression, the Court reasoned that the \"absence of police culpability\" meant that the only thing deterred by excluding the gun would be \"conscientious police work,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that \"is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary rule seeks to foster.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   So the\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   court extended the good-faith exception and held that \"[e]vidence obtained during a search conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is not subject to the exclusionary rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circumstances under which Wright's cellular-phone records were obtained dictate that the good-faith exception saves this evidence from the harsh effects of the exclusionary rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   McPeak applied to a state-court judge under the SCA for an order directing T-Mobile to release the records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   That judge concluded that the information in McPeak's application met the SCA's specific-and-articulable-facts standard and issued the order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   That order was issued 16 months before\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   and less than a year after the Nevada\n   Supreme Court held that \"that the 'specific and articulable facts' standard under \u00a7 2703(d) is sufficient to obtain historical cell phone information because a defendant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in business records made, kept, and owned by his or her cell phone provider.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, the binding-and fresh-appellate precedent in the jurisdiction that issued the SCA order for Wright's cellular-phone records expressly authorized the procedure that McPeak utilized. To apply the exclusionary rule here would \"penalize the officer for the appellate judges' error.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   And the thinness of the information in McPeak's application for the order directing T-Mobile to produce Wright's cellular-phone information is no obstacle to my conclusion that the good-faith exception saves that evidence from suppression. Under the SCA, \"law enforcement need[ed] only show that the cell-site evidence might be pertinent to an ongoing investigation-a 'gigantic' departure from the probable cause rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   McPeak made that showing with his factual summary of the connection between DeAndre Brown and the phone number known as Wright's \"before, during, and after the January 13th robbery at the M.J. Christensen Diamond Center.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although that showing \"falls well short of the probable cause required for a warrant,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   it was the showing required by binding precedent at the time Wright's records were obtained, and McPeak and the issuing judge reasonably relied on that precedent. The good-faith exception thus protects these records from exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Wright's\n   <strong>\n    objections [ECF No. 184] are OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   and Wright's Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained from February 9, 2017, Court Order\n   <strong>\n    [ECF No. 131] is DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Taylor v.
