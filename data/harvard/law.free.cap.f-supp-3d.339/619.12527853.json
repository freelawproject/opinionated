Having determined that such jurisdiction exists, and, having determined that Kentucky law does not reverse preempt the\n   Federal Arbitration Act, the Liquidator asks this Court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction. However, no \"exceptional circumstances\" exist in this case where such abstention would be appropriate. For the foregoing reasons, CGI's Motion to Compel Arbitration is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and the Liquidator's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Kentucky Health Cooperative (KYHC) sought approval from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer health plans to Kentucky citizens in 2011 and 2012. Shortly thereafter, KYHC contracted with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc., whereby CGI would provide administrative services as an independent contractor for KYHC. [R. 71-1.] This Administrative Services Agreement included a section where parties agreed to arbitrate claims and disputes arising under or relating to the Agreement. [R. 9-2 at 27-28.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Similarly, KYHC contracted with Milliman, Inc., for Milliman to perform actuary and consulting services to KYHC [\n   <em>\n    Milliman, Inc., v. Roof\n   </em>\n   , 3:18-cv-000012-GFVT, R. 1-2], and around the same time, KYHC contracted with Beam Partners, LLC, for Beam to provide management and support services to KYHC [\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-cv-00004-GFVT; R. 4-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   KYHC issued its initial health plan policy on January 1, 2014, but by late 2015, KYHC was insolvent and placed into rehabilitation by Franklin Circuit Court in Franklin County, Kentucky. [R. 9-1 at 3.] Pursuant to KRS \u00a7 304.33-010\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Franklin Circuit Court placed KYHC into liquidation on January 15, 2016, and appointed H. Brian Maynard, Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, as the Liquidator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jeff Gaither and David Hurt were appointed as Special Deputy Liquidators. Pursuant to the Liquidation Order,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Liquidator and the Special Deputy Liquidators are hereby authorized to deal with the property, business, and affairs of KYHC and KYHC's estate, and in any necessary forum, to sue or defend for KYHC, or for the benefit of KYHC's policyholders, creditors, or shareholders in the courts and tribunal, agencies or arbitration panels of this states and other states, or in any applicable federal court in the Liquidator's name as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, in his capacity as Liquidator, or a Special deputy in his capacity as Special Deputy Liquidator, or in the name of KYHC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [R. 34-6 at 9.] Since that time, Nancy G. Atkins has replaced H. Brian Maynard as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, and thus also as the Liquidator. See KRS \u00a7 304.33-200. Donald Roof was also appointed as a Deputy Litigator for KYHC on August 14, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Milliman, Inc., v. Roof\n   </em>\n   , 3:18-cv-00012-GFVT, R. 1 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 13, 2016, the Liquidator sued CGI in Franklin Circuit Court for breach of contract and negligence. [R. 71-1 at 2.] The Liquidator refused to honor the arbitration clause, so CGI removed that claim to this Court and filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration. Id. These actions were consolidated here. [R. 8.] Six months later, the Liquidator sued Beam Partners and Terry Shilling, along with Janie Miller,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joseph E. Smith,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Officers and Board of Directors of KYHC, and CGI for similar breach of contract and tort claims. [\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-cv-00004-GFVT; R. 4-4.] The Liquidator again refused to arbitrate, and CGI removed that action to this Court. [\n   <em>\n    Jeff Gaither, Deputy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liquidator of Kentucky Health Cooperative, Inc. v. Beam Partners, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00094-GFVT, R. 1.] Beam Partners then filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration. [\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-cv-00004-GFVT; R. 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this case, the Liquidator sought remand to Franklin Circuit Court. KYHC is a Kentucky non-profit corporation with a principal place of business in Kentucky, while CGI is a business incorporated in Delaware with a principal place of business in Virginia. [R. 1 at 1.] The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, under a traditional analysis of diversity jurisdiction, this Court has requisite authority and subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). However, the Liquidator sought remand for reverse preemption. [R. 49 at 3-4.] Early in 2017, this Court determined that federal diversity jurisdiction was not reverse preempted by application of the Kentucky Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Law (IRLL) through the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Liquidator's Motion to Remand was denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, in\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Beam\n   </em>\n   , the Liquidator sought remand for the contract and tort action. In\n   <em>\n    Gaither\n   </em>\n   , however, there was not complete diversity, as both plaintiffs and several defendants were residents of Kentucky. [\n   <em>\n    Jeff Gaither, Deputy Liquidator of Kentucky Health Cooperative, Inc. v. Beam Partners, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00094-GFVT, R. 44 at 6.] Ultimately, this Court declined to sever the claims against the nondiverse parties and remanded for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After these developments, this Court denied CGI's Motion to Compel Arbitration without prejudice and directed the parties to re-brief the issue based on the significantly altered procedural posture, as\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Beam\n   </em>\n   had now been remanded but\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , had not. [R. 63.] Instead, CGI appealed the Court's Order to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. [R. 67.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 9, 2018, the Sixth Circuit vacated this Court's Order denying CGI's Motion to Compel Arbitration and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n    724 F. App'x 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018). The Court of Appeals reviewed only this Court's denial of the Motion to Compel Arbitration and did not review any decision involving abstention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n    at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Circuit Court determined that denial of the Motion to Compel Arbitration was not proper insofar as it was based on reverse preemption under Kentucky's IRLL.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n    at 390-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the case had been removed from state court and this Court had denied remand, the purposes served by the exclusive jurisdiction provision of the IRLL did not apply, and state interests could not trump federal interests in the disposition of the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   CGI subsequently filed a renewed motion to compel arbitration [R. 71] and the Liquidator filed a renewed motion to dismiss [R. 73].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While removing the issue of reverse preemption from this case, the Sixth Circuit did not resolve the other pending issues, nor did the Sixth Circuit resolve the issue of reverse preemption in Beam v. Atkins or in Milliman v. Roof. The parties appeared before this Court on July 23, 2018, for oral argument. [R. 87.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As an initial matter, the Liquidator challenges this Court's ability to\n   hear this action by claiming the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine bars jurisdiction. [R. 73 at 7.] The doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction states, \"If two suits are in rem or quasi in rem, so that the court must have possession or some control over the property in order to grant the relief sought, the jurisdiction of one court must yield to that of the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Cartwright v. Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070092\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/752/#p761\">\n    751 F.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (6th Cir. 2014.) This Court must assess \"whether the doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction applies at the time of filing, and not any time thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevalier v. Estate of Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346283\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/789/#p803\">\n    803 F.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803 (6th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    In rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction involves or determines \"the status of a thing, and therefore the rights of persons generally with respect to that thing.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Conversely,\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction involves or determines \"the personal rights and obligations of the parties\" and is \"brought against a person rather than a property.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). \"A normal action brought by one person against another for breach of contract is a common example of an action\n   <em>\n    in personam.\n   </em>\n   \" R.H. Graveson, Conflict of Laws, 98 (7th ed. 1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   If the Liquidator is successful in its tort claims against CGI, the Liquidator will likely be able to collect monetary damages from CGI, thus increasing the amount of assets that can be distributed among its creditors. However, the Liquidator has not provided sufficient case law to convince the Court that this results in an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action governed by the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine. The cases cited by the Liquidator involve creditors suing the insolvent company, whereas in the tort action here, the insolvent company is the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gillis v. Keystone Mut. Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1182480\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/172/826/\">\n    172 F.2d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1949) ;\n   <em>\n    Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. Inc. v. Geeslin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"621272\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/530/154/\">\n    530 F.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1976). By the Liquidator's logic, all suits brought by an insolvent company would need to be heard by the court of liquidation simply because those suits could increase assets available for distribution during liquidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court is not convinced. This is a petition to compel arbitration for a tort claim involving a breach of contract. A favorable result in this matter does not affect the distribution of the liquidated assets held in Franklin Circuit Court. Nor does the Court need to have jurisdiction over the assets to resolve this matter. Thus, the Court finds that the doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Liquidator also challenges the Court's power to hear this matter, claiming that CGI has not complied with Kentucky's requirements for pursuing arbitration, and this Court cannot grant or deny relief without CGI fully complying with Kentucky's arbitration requirements. [R. 73 at 13.] Under the IRLL, no party may institute an action against the liquidator without approval of the court. KRS \u00a7 304.33-270(1). However, the Federal Arbitration Act does not require parties to comply with state requirements before seeking a petition from federal court for arbitration. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Requiring CGI to comply with the IRLL before petitioning this Court assumes that the IRLL reverse preempts the Federal Arbitration Act in this case, which the Sixth Circuit has already rejected.

[R. 9-2 at 25.] Under Kentucky law, the Liquidator argues, post-liquidation arbitration is barred by the IRLL. [R. 73 at 31-32.] The Court is not persuaded. The Liquidator does not point to, and the Court cannot find, a provision in the IRLL expressly banning arbitration proceedings. The Court does not question that the parties expected and intended for Kentucky and the IRLL to govern the Agreement.

Further, no language in the Agreement and no evidence provided by the parties display an intent to exclude breach of contract claims from the arbitration requirement. However, the Liquidator also claims that the Court cannot compel arbitration of the preferential transfer claims. The Liquidator compares this matter to several wrongful death actions, claiming that only the Liquidator, not KYHC, can bring a preferential transfer claim, similar to how only the estate of a deceased, not the deceased himself, can bring a wrongful death action.\n   <em>\n    Richmond Health Facilities v.

The Liquidator is correct, the estate of a deceased person cannot bring a wrongful death claim because the essence of that suit is the wrongful loss of a loved one.

[R. 73 at 18.] While the subject of arbitration does not foreclose abstention under\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   , the parallel cases of\n   <em>\n    Preferred Care of Delaware\n   </em>\n   both turned on the same legal question: if, under the alternative dispute resolution agreement, VanArsdale had to arbitrate his claims against Preferred Care.\n   <em>\n    Preferred Care\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12392978\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/676/388/#p393\">\n    676 F.

Beam\n   </em>\n   , the initial question involves the enforceability of the arbitration clause. This finding, however, does not end the analysis. When actions are parallel, the Court must then balance eight separate factors to determine whether abstention would be appropriate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) whether the state court has assumed jurisdiction over any res or property; (2) whether the federal forum is less convenient to the parties; (3) avoidance of piecemeal litigation; ...

(6) the adequacy of the state court action to protect the federal plaintiff's rights ... (7) the relative progress of the state and federal proceedings ... and (8) the presence or absence of concurrent jurisdiction....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Romine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669459\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/337/#p339\">\n    160 F.3d at 340-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These factors are not a checklist, but rather considerations for the Court when using its discretion to abstain in a matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, the Court has already determined that this action does not involve res or property. The res involved in the liquidation proceedings in Franklin Circuit Court are not at issue in this case. Additionally, the federal forum is located less than a quarter of a mile from the state forum, providing no more or less convenience to the parties. Furthermore, the state court action would not adequately protect Beam Partners' rights, given that Kentucky precedent is dictated by\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Young\n   </em>\n   , which allows for reverse preemption of the FAA and denial of Beam Partners' petition for arbitration. Thus, the first, second, and sixth factors squarely oppose abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Factors three, four, and seven relate to the parallel proceeding in state court. Here, there is no danger of piecemeal litigation. While similar, the contracts involved in\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Beam\n   </em>\n   are all different, and all include different provisions and protections. Resolving the contract dispute between the Liquidator and CGI does not impact the resolution of other disputes and brings no danger of disparate judgments. Again, arbitration in this matter does not affect the liquidation proceedings and the policy holders. Thus, because there is no danger of piecemeal litigation, the third factor does not encourage abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   While Franklin Circuit Court first obtained jurisdiction, the primary focus of the litigation in the parallel proceeding has concerned the liability of Janie Miller and Joseph Smith, neither of which are a party to this matter in federal court. [R. 73 at 22.] This Court has spent the last two years hearing oral arguments and conducting briefing on this specific arbitration issue, while the parties provide no indication that the Franklin Circuit Court has begun to consider it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669459\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/337/#p339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So, while factor four favors abstention, the time spent debating this issue in federal court far exceeds the\n   time devoted to this issue in state court, and factor seven strongly weighs against abstention. Factors five and eight relate to the jurisdiction and choices of law in both forums. Both forums have concurrent jurisdiction, and both courts could rule on the enforceability of arbitration. The issues relating to contract law and the IRLL are matters of Kentucky law, while the questions involving the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the FAA are matters of federal law. The Franklin Circuit Court could certainly rule on this issue, but so can this Court. Such factors do not clearly support abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Without the \"clearest of justifications\" that abstention is proper, the Court has a duty to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Congress.\n   <em>\n    RSM Richter, Inc. v.

After weighing all eight factors, only factor four suggests abstention is appropriate, while several other factors strongly oppose abstention. Accordingly, the Court finds that the narrow exception to jurisdiction provided by Colorado River abstention does not apply to this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    E\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, having determined that the Liquidator's claims are subject to arbitration, this matter must be stayed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the Court will stay the pending state court proceedings against CGI. Pursuant to the Anti-Injunction Act, \"[a] court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202283\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As has been found by many other Courts in this district confronting the identical situation, an injunction is proper in these circumstances because it is \"necessary to protect or effectuate [this Court's] judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Great Earth Companies, Inc. v.
