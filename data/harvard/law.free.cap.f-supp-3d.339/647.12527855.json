Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case presents the question of whether police violate the Fourth Amendment when they enter and search a hotel room without a warrant based on information that a consenting-age female teenager is in the hotel room with an older man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 27, 2017, officers from the Southfield Police Department (\"SPD\") entered Defendant's hotel room in responding to a report that a 16-year-old girl (\"MV-1 [Minor Victim-1]\") was in the room with Defendant, a 45-year-old man. The officers knocked on the door several times, but no one answered. Using a key provided to them by the hotel's front desk clerk, the officers entered the room. They found the Defendant and MV-1 inside and seized electronic devices containing evidence of child pornography that now forms the basis for the underlying charges in this action. Defendant moves to suppress the evidence and the government opposes the motion. For the reasons outlined below, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At around 3:00 a.m. in the morning on August 27, 2016, parents of 16-year-old \"MV-1\" called 911 to inform officers that they received information their daughter was at the Marvin's Garden Inn in Southfield, Michigan. (\"Marvin's Garden\" or \"the hotel\"). Although MV-1 had told her parents that she would be spending the night at a friend's house, the parents told police that their daughter had posted a social media message indicating she was actually at the hotel with a 45-to-50 year old man from Indiana named \"Robert.\" Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   MV-1's parents had never heard of\n   \"Robert\" and did not know who he was. According to the government, Marvin's Garden Inn is a hotel \"well-known to the officers for sex trafficking, drugs, and violence.\" Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Four Southfield Police Officers met MV-1's parents in the hotel parking lot. Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 41; Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 62, 64. Believing MV-1 was with an unknown older man from Indiana, police officers observed an orange Chevrolet HHR that was parked in the hotel parking lot, which had an Indiana license plate. After running the license plate in their database, the officers learned that the vehicle belonged to the Defendant, Robert Donald Gordon-a white, 45-year-old male from Logansport, Indiana. Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 64. Based on that information, the officers talked to the hotel clerk and learned that Gordon had checked into room # 103 earlier that afternoon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Using their steel batons, Officers knocked on the door for \"five to ten minutes\" but no one answered. Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 41. The officers did not knock quietly, but loudly struck the hotel room's steel front door and the room's glass window with their batons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 64. They yelled \"Southfield Police\" and \"Open the door.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Getting no answer, the officers went back to the front desk, asked for a room key, and waited for the arrival of their Sergeant. After the Sergeant arrived, they returned to the room and again used their batons to pound on the door while they announced \"Police,\" and \"Open the door\" for a few minutes. When no one answered, they used the key to enter Defendant's room. The officers encountered Defendant sitting on the bed. In response to the officers' questioning, Defendant informed the officers that MV-1 was in the bathroom. Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 42. The officers found and escorted MV-1 out of Defendant's hotel room.\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 65. As the officers escorted MV-1 out of the room, MV-1 asked one of the officers to retrieve her boots, as she was barefoot. While kneeling down beside the bed with his flashlight, one of the officers noticed a photograph sticking out of MV-1's bag, showing her posing naked with Defendant, who was also nude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the officers did not arrest Defendant at that time, they did provide him with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 65. Defendant told SPD that he wanted to \"cooperate 100 percent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He allegedly gave law enforcement permission to search the room and all of his belongings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of the search of the room, the officers seized a number of items including a pink and white Samsung phone, a black Samsung phone, a Sony video camera, an iPad tablet, and 3 photographs of MV-1 and the Defendant. Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 42. Defendant provided the passcode to his phone and admitted that the electronic devices probably had naked pictures of MV-1 that she sent to him. Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 66. Officers took the devices and obtained a search warrant the following day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of the search of Defendant's devices, police found several videos of MV-1 and Defendant engaged in sexual acts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was later arrested and charged in a seven-count indictment alleging four counts of production of child pornography, one count of coercion and enticement of a minor, one count of interstate travel with the intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor, and one count of\n   possession of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 37. Defendant subsequently filed this motion to suppress, challenging the officers' entry and subsequent search of his hotel room and electronic devices, which Defendant argues violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

According to the government, SPD was responding to a \"threat of danger, and the safety of a child\"-a situation that required \"immediate government action.\" Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 70. The government highlights the fact that MV-1's parents called 911 and that the \"police knew 'Robert' had taken MV-1, without parental permission, to this motel.\" Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 77. In its brief, the government further argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Particularly when [Defendant] refused to answer the door, and officers heard rustling inside, they had an even greater concern that: (1) this child was in immediate danger; (2) Defendant may be destroying any type of evidence of criminal activity; or (3) Defendant may be planning an escape. The last thing officers would be expected to do in this situation is walk away shrugging their shoulders because no one answered the door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Unfortunately for this argument, the testimony at the suppression hearing did not corroborate the government's claims regarding the sound of rustling, or any other sounds or sights suggesting destruction of evidence, escape of the suspect, or immediate danger to MV-1. Officer Christopher Clark and Sergeant Peter Simerley-two SPD officers who responded to the hotel on the night in question-testified that they did not hear anything from inside the room when they knocked on the door. When asked by the government \"when you were knocking on the door and announcing that the [SPD] were there did you hear anything inside the room?\" Officer Clark testified, \"No, I did not.\" On cross examination, Officer Clark testified that he heard \"nothing whatsoever\" when knocking on defendant's hotel room door for about five minutes. Similarly, Sergeant Simerley was asked on cross examination, \"But with the knocking and the yelling\n   '[SPD]' you heard no movement in that room, right?\" he stated, \"I did not, no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When questioned what evidence showed that anyone was in danger, Sergeant Simerley stated, \"Well, I believe the silence, the lack of occupants not responding to our knocks at the door, for me was-at least lent potential to something may have happened in the room, yes, sir.\" When Officer Clark was asked to justify why he was primarily concerned with the well-being of MV-1, he responded, \"Because [MV-1's] parents were deathly afraid of what could happen to her and we just-we don't know, you know. She's a juvenile with another-with an older individual that the parents don't know about and they were scared for her safety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The government also argues that the Marvin's Garden Inn is a \"seedy motel\" that is \"widely known to host drug activity and commercial sex trafficking activity.\" Dkt. 17, Pg. IDs 72, 77. Officer Clark testified that Marvin's Garden was not a nice hotel and that he had been dispatched there before for \"prostitution, domestics, loud noise, loud parties, [and] evictions.\" Similarly, Sergeant Simerley, when asked about the kinds of calls he had answered at the hotel, responded, \"Drug, prostitution, crimes of violence are the typical.\" The government points to these characteristics to bolster its argument that exigent circumstances justified the officers' warrantless entry into Defendant's hotel room based on a \"need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury\" according to\n   <em>\n    Brigham City\n   </em>\n   and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To summarize, the government contends that the following evidence presented at the hearing is sufficient to establish exigent circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 The SPD officers were aware that Marvin's Garden Inn had prior reports of sex trafficking, drug trafficking, domestic disturbances, and violence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 The officers knocked loudly, using their steel batons, in two separate attempts to get someone to open the hotel room door, but no one answered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 The parents of MV-1 did not know for certain where MV-1 was, did not know who Robert-the 45-year-old man from Indiana-was, and were extremely concerned for their daughter's safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 The officers wished to conduct a \"welfare check\" to investigate whether MV-1 was in the room and whether she was safe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In response to this evidence, Defendant points to the following facts in support of his position that exigent circumstances did not exist:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 The information from Snapchat did not suggest that MV-1 was being held against her will or that she was being harmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 The possibility that MV-1 was engaged in sexual contact with an older adult male, because she was then sixteen years old and able to consent to sexual contact under Michigan law, did not give rise to probable cause of criminal activity and is not recognized by the law as conduct as presenting a threat of serious injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 The officers did not see or hear anything after they knocked on the hotel room door that suggested destruction of evidence, flight, or dangerous or harmful conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 The officers did not run a criminal history check on Defendant after checking his license plates, so they had no information suggesting he had engaged in criminal conduct in the past.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Considering the evidence adduced at the hearing, none of it demonstrates the kinds of circumstances found to be exigent under Supreme Court or Sixth Circuit precedent. There is no proof of 1) hot pursuit of a fleeing felon, 2) imminent destruction of evidence, 3) the need to prevent a suspect's escape, or 4) a risk of danger to the police or others, as required in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295800\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/497/#p503\">\n    354 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   503 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   , the officers must have \"an objectively reasonable basis for believing ... that a person within [the house] is in need of immediate aid.\"\n   <em>\n    Fisher,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    558 U.S. at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639144\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/45/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).

But the pertinent question is whether the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that MV-1 was seriously injured, threatened with serious injury, or in immediate need of emergency assistance. Is a 16-year-old unemancipated minor female \"threatened with serious injury\" or \"in immediate need of emergency assistance\" when there is reason to believe she is in a hotel room at 3:30 in the morning with a 45-year-old man from Indiana who is unknown to her parents?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While no parent could fail to recognize and legitimately fear the potential for psychological, emotional, or even possibly physical harm these circumstances pose to a teenage daughter-even one who is just barely above the lawful age to give consent-the test the Court must apply is not whether there is a possibility of such harm but rather whether the evidence provided an objectively reasonable basis for the officers to conclude a person was seriously injured, threatened with serious injury, or in immediate need of emergency assistance. Only these imminent dangers are sufficient to permit the police to enter premises without a warrant. There is no evidence on this record of serious injury, a threat of serious injury, or an immediate need of emergency assistance. Consequently, the entry cannot be justified under the emergency aid exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Was the Warrantless Entry Justified Under the Community Caretaking Exception?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The government also argues that the community caretaking doctrine or exception justifies the officers' warrantless entry into Defendant's hotel room. Highlighting that the \"ultimate touchtone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness,\" the government argues that SPD's warrantless\n   entry into Defendant's hotel room was undertaken as part of their community caretaking duties, and was therefore justified.

This argument is not well taken for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As an initial matter, the government advances competing reasons for the officers' warrantless entry into Defendant's hotel room. On the one hand, the government argues that the entry was only to check on the well-being of MV-1 and to conduct a wellness check. On the other hand, the government argues that the officers' entry was motivated in part by their\n   concern that MV-1 was in immediate danger and that the Defendant was destroying evidence or attempting to escape.

Importantly, the community caretaker exception does not apply unless the officers' actions in question are \"totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute\" or if they are taken with any traditional law enforcement purpose.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cady,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341150\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/433/\">\n    413 U.S. at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341150\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/433/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295800\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/497/#p503\">\n    354 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   508 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To the first prong, the immediate\n   need for government action, the government argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Even more serious than the officers in\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   , SPD was responding to not a nuisance, but a threat of danger, and the safety of a child. The situation required \"immediate government action\"; that is, after meeting MV-1's frightened parents in the motel parking lot, verifying that \"Robert\" from Indiana was in room # 103, and banging on the door, only to hear rustling inside the dark room, no choice remained but to be swift in their actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 70. As discussed above, the record does not support a claim that the officers heard noises that would suggest activity of any kind inside the room. First, as stated, there was no \"rustling.\" No evidence was presented that anyone was injured, threatened to be injured or in need of medical treatment. While the government asserts there was a \"need for immediate action,\" the evidence demonstrated only a concern to find out whether MV-1 was in the room and what her condition was. This is not the same as a need to respond to an imminent and ongoing harm, which is what\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   say must be shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Second, the possibility that MV-1 was in the room engaging in consensual sexual activity with a 45-year-old man-however panic-inducing to her parents and concerning to law enforcement officials such a prospect may understandably be-is not a situation that the law treats as creating an objectively reasonable basis to believe that MV-1 was in danger, \"subject to a threat of danger,\" or in immediate need of protection from harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the difference for purposes of applying the test in\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   is that the nuisance of loud noise was immediate, serious, demonstrable and ongoing, while the fears of the parents and concerns of the officers-though completely understandable-were not supported by any objectively reasonable basis that \"real immediate and serious consequences would certainly occur\" in the absence of immediate action. In short, it was not clear that \"no choice remained but\" to execute a warrantless entry into Defendant's room.\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   concerned an \"immediate, ongoing, and highly objectionable nuisance\" while here there was no proof of an ongoing injury or immediately harmful conduct. Thus, the facts of this case fail to establish the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Rohrig's\n   </em>\n   modified exigent circumstances test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Regarding the second prong, whether the governmental interest at stake is sufficiently compelling to justify a warrantless entry, the government argues that SPD has an interest in \"assisting parents whose minor children have gone missing with a middle aged man who is at a motel known for sex trafficking. These parents (and SPD) could not possibly know if this man was armed, dangerous, mentally ill, a sex trafficker, a drug dealer, or any host of things.\" Dkt. 17, Pg. IDs 70-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   explained that Supreme Court precedent instructs the weight of a government interest should be measured in part by the severity of the offense being investigated.\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652676\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1506/#p1519\">\n    98 F.3d at 1521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the government espouses somewhat contradictory positions. On the one hand, the government maintains the officers were conducting a welfare check, meaning that they were not investigating criminal activity when they entered Defendant's hotel room without a warrant. On the other hand, they assert a strong government interest arising from an arguably severe criminal offense, that Defendant may have been armed, dangerous, mentally ill, a sex trafficker, a drug dealer, or \"any host of thing.\" Dkt. 17 Pg. IDs 70-71. While such a possibility existed, the record evinces no facts supporting a reasonable or probable belief that such criminal activity was taking place. The officers might have gathered more evidence about any potential threat by running a criminal history check on Defendant, but Officer Clark testified that he did not do so after obtaining the Defendant's identity from his license plate. But the mere fact that the hotel was known to the police as a location where prostitution, drug trafficking, or violent crime had been discovered in the past does not permit a reasonable inference that Defendant was then engaged in such activity. The weight of the government's interest, based on the evidence, arises from the legitimate interests of MV-1's parents and the officers in ascertaining her location and determining whether she was safe. The question is whether this interest justifies a warrantless entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   test also suggests that the need for a strong governmental interest (such as a serious criminal offense) diminishes \"as one moves away from traditional law enforcement functions\" and towards functions classified as community caretaking functions.\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652676\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/98/1506/#p1519\">\n    98 F.3d at 1521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the governmental interest in immediately abating an ongoing nuisance by quelling a loud and disruptive noise in a residential neighborhood was sufficiently compelling to meet the second prong. There, the court had already found the facts sufficient to meet the first prong of the test: the need to take immediate action. While the\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   court recognized that the governmental interest factor was weaker where the offense was a noise ordinance, it found that there was less of a need for a strong governmental interest when the police are carrying out their community care taking function and the need for immediate action was manifest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   , where the nuisance was ongoing and plainly evident, the circumstances confronted by the SPD did not support a reasonable conclusion that MV-1 was facing immediate harm. Because MV-1 was lawfully able to consent to sexual relations, evidence of her presence in a hotel room with a man-in and of itself-is insufficient to establish a threat of immediate harm. Even if the officers were acting solely as community caretakers, there must be a public safety concern that presents an immediate threat. No \"community caretaking\" function is implicated where the police seek to perform a welfare check on a minor who the officers have no articulable reason to believe is in danger or subject to illegal or illicit sexual behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250622\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/785/1004/#p1041\">\n    785 F.Supp.2d at 1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   test requires weighing the governmental interest against Defendant's interest in maintaining the privacy of his home, and considering whether Defendant's conduct somehow diminished the reasonable expectation of privacy he would normally enjoy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The government suggests that because Defendant was in a hotel room rather than his residence, he was subject to a lesser degree of Fourth Amendment protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Dkt. 17, Pg.

This position is unsustainable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276610\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1012/#p1018\">\n    858 F.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Fourth Amendment's full complement of protections also applies to hotel rooms.\") (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On the question of whether the Defendant's conduct somehow diminished the reasonableness of his expectation of privacy, the government contends that it was \"certainly reasonably foreseeable that law enforcement will probably intrude on one's privacy where, as here, they knock loudly and announce their presence for close to fifteen minutes, knowing someone is likely inside with a child-without parental permission-and is refusing to answer the door.\" Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 71. This argument misreads\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   , because the question is whether the\n   <em>\n    Defendant's conduct\n   </em>\n   is such that it diminishes his reasonable expectation of privacy-as when one blares a sound-system at full-blast in a crowded neighborhood in the middle of the night. The question is not whether one might reasonably expect the police to bust in after they have been knocking for 15 minutes (and that person wishes not to be discovered because he may be doing something illegal). One does not engage in conduct diminishing one's reasonable expectation of privacy by failing to answer the door when the police knock and seek admittance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v. King\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that when a law enforcement officer without a search warrant knocks on a door, he or she does \"no more than any private citizen might do [and] whether the person who knocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak is a police officer or a private citizen, the occupant has no obligation to open the door or to speak.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    563 U.S. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5911971,12458997\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/452/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The government may be correct that in today's world it is reasonably foreseeable that one's privacy might be intruded upon if the police knock repeatedly and an occupant fails to answer. But that is more a commentary on current public expectations regarding police behavior than it is a proper statement of Fourth Amendment law. The people have a right to be \"secure in ... their houses ... against unreasonable searches.\" U.S. Const. amend IV. This fundamental guarantee of liberty supports a different understanding of what is \"reasonably foreseeable\" regarding privacy than what the government argues: citizens should be justified in expecting that the police will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   normally enter their homes without search warrants, even if they knock repeatedly and no one answers. The Court will not countenance the view that Defendant somehow invited the intrusion by failing to answer the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To summarize, in applying the\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   test, 1) there was no showing of any need for immediate action, such as any proof of harm or emergency; 2) the interest served in conducting a welfare check was not shown to be sufficiently important to overcome the presumption that a warrant is required to search a residence; and 3) the privacy interest in a residence is not outweighed by the government's interest in performing a welfare check (when there is no evidence of imminent danger) and the Defendant did nothing to diminish his expectation of privacy. The\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   exigent circumstances test does not justify a warrantless entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Rohrig\n    </em>\n    Has Limited Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   in this case is inappropriate for two additional reasons. First, to the extent the government argues\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the community caretaker exception may permit a warrantless search of a home, that argument is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   expanded the breadth of the exigent circumstances doctrine; it did not hold that the community caretaking exception applies to searches of homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Although the court referenced the community caretaking doctrine, it did so as part of crafting a modified exigent circumstance test with narrow application. In\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   , police officers were acting within the scope of their community caretaker duties and not investigating a crime, and this fact affected how the Court balanced the governmental interest against the need for a warrantless entry, but the exception that permitted the entry was an expanded exigent circumstances test, not the community caretaker exception. To the extent the government reads\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   as establishing an independent community caretaking exception that allows the warrantless entry into a home, this reading is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Rohrig\n   </em>\n   was intended as a narrow, fact-specific holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   We wish to emphasize the fact-specific nature of [our] holding. By this decision, we do not mean to fashion a broad 'nuisance abatement' exception to the general rule that warrantless entries into private homes are presumptively unreasonable.

Officer Clark showed the picture to Sergeant Simerley, who then gave Defendant\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and asked Gordon for consent to search the hotel room.

Sergeant Simerley also testified that Defendant provided the access codes to his iPhone and iPad after being asked for them by Officer Hendricks.

While Sergeant Simerley spoke with Defendant, at least one officer (Clark) moved about inside the hotel room: to the bathroom to get MV-1 and beside and underneath the bed to retrieve MV-1's boots.

To the contrary, the officers here took purposeful and independent actions: they deliberately chose to enter Defendant's private hotel room without a warrant and in a scenario lacking exigent circumstances that would justify a warrantless entry. Instead, the officers relied upon their duties as \"community caretakers\" and entered Defendant's room to conduct a \"welfare check\" to address the concerns of parents who believed that their minor (but consenting-age) daughter was with an older man they did not know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The record also supports the conclusion that the officers' conduct is sufficiently culpable to warrant suppression. While the government relies heavily on the community caretaker doctrine, the Sixth Circuit has not found that doctrine to provide an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement in these circumstances. Moreover, the government has failed to show that any of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement for exigent circumstances justified the entry in this case. In both respects,\n   and critically so, the government has failed to show that there existed an immediate need for the officers to execute a warrantless entry. There was no evidence of harm, threat of harm, injury requiring medical attention, danger, emergency, or ongoing public nuisance. Furthermore, for purposes of the community caretaker doctrine, the record shows that the officers were motivated to enter Defendant's hotel room in part based on a presumption that criminal activity may be going on inside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295800\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/497/#p503\">\n    354 F.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining actions taken as community caretakers must be totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute). Thus, the officers' acts are sufficiently culpable because a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that the warrantless entry executed in this case was illegal in light of all the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p141\">\n    555 U.S. at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p141\">\n    129 S.Ct. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Upon careful review of this record, the Court concludes that the officers' conduct was deliberate enough that applying the exclusionary rule will act as a deterrent. It is difficult to say with quite as much certainty that the officers' culpability was so significant that the price paid by the justice system in excluding the evidence is worth the gain from such deterrence. The price of losing evidence of alleged child pornography manufacturing is a high one, and the officers' culpability in proceeding without a warrant is somewhat mitigated by their good intentions in seeking to assist concerned parents. However, the Court must measure that cost against the inestimable value of maintaining a society that honors the Fourth Amendment. Weighing these factors, exclusion is the proper remedy in light of the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the warrantless entry into Defendant's hotel room violated his Fourth Amendment rights and that the taint of that unlawful entry had not dissipated when Defendant allegedly consented the search of his hotel room.

It is not clear that governing law in the Fifth Circuit extends\n    <em>\n     Cady\n    </em>\n    to homes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    While the parties in\n    <em>\n     Washington\n    </em>\n    did not appear to make the argument that the community caretaking exception can\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    apply to justify a warrantless entry or search of a home, the Sixth Circuit's holding suggests that, absent some sort of exigent circumstance-of which there was none in that case-the community caretaking exception could not justify a warrantless entry or search of a home.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537532\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/1026/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    As will be discussed below,\n    <em>\n     Rohrig\n    </em>\n    ultimately approves a warrantless search of a home under the exigent circumstances exception, rather than the community caretaking exception. However,\n    <em>\n     Rohrig\n    </em>\n    does reference the significance of the community caretaking function, and it is discussed by the government for that reason, so its impact will be discussed under this section.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    <em>\n     Rohrig\n    </em>\n    thus reflects the court fashioning a three-prong modified exigent circumstances test, reflecting an analysis of whether: 1) immediate government action is required, 2) the government interest at stake, if any, is sufficiently important to justify a warrantless entry, and 3) the citizen's conduct somehow diminished his or her normal reasonable expectation of privacy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    In addressing this question, it is worth considering what else the police could have done. There were several alternatives. First, they could have investigated further to determine whether the situation required immediate action. If they were dealing with a person who was \"dangerous, mentally ill, a sex trafficker, a drug dealer, or any host of things,\" as suggested by the government, a criminal history report might have revealed that. Second, if the officers had facts suggesting evidence of a crime would be in the room, they could have attempted to obtain a warrant. (To the extent the officers believed they could not get a warrant, the entry and search becomes more questionable.) Third, the officers could have persistently continued to knock on Defendant's door until either he or MV-1 answered it. Or, they could have had MV-1's parents knock on the door, and call for her to come out. Fourth, the officers could have continued calling MV-1's cell phone, or had her parents continue to call her while positioned outside of Defendant's hotel room. The sound of a ringing cell phone would have confirmed whether MV-1 was there. Finally, the officers could have simply parked a squad car next to Defendant's car and waited for Defendant or MV-1 to exit the room. These options do not offer the visceral satisfaction and swift certainty of entering the room suddenly with the pass-key, but neither do they run afoul of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
