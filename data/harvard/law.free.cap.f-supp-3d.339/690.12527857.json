Pending before the Court is the United States' Motion for Summary Judgment on the Issue of Standing (Doc. 50) and the Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 52) filed by claimant Samson Primm. For the reasons that follow, the government's motion\n   is GRANTED, and claimant's cross-motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The defendant currencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Claimant has a long criminal history relating to drugs. In March of 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") began investigating him for drug trafficking and money laundering offenses. The DEA received information that claimant was scheduled for one-way air travel from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Cleveland, Ohio, on March 20, 2016. A DEA special agent observed him leaving the airport on this date. The DEA then requested assistance from the Lorain Police Department (\"LPD\"). An LPD officer conducted a traffic stop of claimant's vehicle for a window tint violation. After speaking with claimant, the officer requested that a K-9 officer respond to the scene. The K-9 officer and his K-9 partner, Garp, arrived while the warning citation for the window tint violation was being written. Upon being deployed, Garp provided a positive alert for a narcotic odor. Following the alert, four bags were removed from the vehicle. Garp alerted to a suitcase and backpack where stacks of money were found. In total, $99,500 in U.S. currency was recovered. Claimant claimed to have won the money at the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 17, 2016, an Ohio State Highway Patrol (\"OSHP\") sergeant paced claimant's vehicle traveling at 85 miles per hour on the highway. A K-9 trooper initiated a traffic stop. When he spoke with claimant, he smelled marijuana from inside the vehicle. He then retrieved his K-9 partner, who provided a positive alert for controlled substances. Two OSHP officers then conducted a search of the vehicle, locating a jar that contained marijuana in the center console. They also found several bundles of U.S. currency inside the vehicle and two suitcases in the back hatch that also contained currency. In total, $107,900 was located in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to a state search warrant, law enforcement authorities, including members of the DEA and local law enforcement, executed a search of claimant's residence on August 18, 2016. The officers observed jars containing marijuana in the residence. After testing and confirming the presence of marijuana, the investigators stopped the search and obtained a state narcotics search warrant. The narcotics search warrant named a number of items to be searched and seized, including marijuana, narcotic drugs, money, and weapons. Among other things, officers seized $57,999 in U.S. currency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The forfeiture action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The government filed this forfeiture action on October 3, 2016, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6), alleging that the defendant currency (the $99,500, $107,900, and $57,999 in U.S. currency seized by law enforcement) constitutes proceeds from illegal drug trafficking, was furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for illegal drugs, and/or was used or intended to be used to facilitate illegal drug trafficking activities. Notice of the forfeiture action was served on claimant's counsel, and warrants taking custody of the seized funds were executed by the U.S. Marshal Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its verified complaint, the government alleges that, between January of 2014 and August of 2016, claimant lost approximately $59,500 while gambling at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. It also\n   alleges that claimant did not file Ohio personal income tax returns for the years 2012, 2013, and 2015, and that his 2014 Ohio personal income tax return claimed a federal adjusted gross income of $37,410. Finally, it alleges that from January of 2014 to April of 2016, claimant made a number of large expenditures on airline tickets, hotels, cars, rental cars, sporting events, high-end retail stores across the country, nightclubs, and restaurants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Claimant filed a verified claim swearing that he was the \"sole and absolute owner of the monies\" and \"was in exclusive possession of these monies when they were seized.\" His separate answer claims sole ownership and exclusive possession of the currency but then denies all of the government's pertinent allegations regarding the seizure of the money, including that the currency was taken from his possession and that he won the money while gambling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The government moved to strike both claims because they raised only bald assertions of ownership. It argued that such assertions were insufficient to meet the statutory requirements of Rule G of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure's Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Civil Forfeiture Actions (the \"Supplemental Rules\"). This Court granted the motion to strike, and the claimants appealed. Relying on its decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. $31,000 in U.S. Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264681\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/342/\">\n    872 F.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2017), the Sixth Circuit reversed. In\n   <em>\n    $31,000 in U.S. Currency\n   </em>\n   , the court decided, as an issue of first impression in this circuit, that \"[a]t the pleading stage, a verified claim of ownership is sufficient to satisfy Article III [standing requirements] and the procedural requirements of Rule G.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264681\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/342/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264681\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/342/\">\n    at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Discovery on remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On remand, this Court held a case management conference on January 11, 2018, and set a discovery deadline of May 15, 2018, and a dispositive motion deadline of June 15, 2018. The government served special interrogatories and requests for production of documents to claimant's counsel on January 25, 2018. The discovery sought information about the nature of claimant's interest in the defendant currencies, the source of the defendant currencies, and claimant's legitimate sources of income, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Claimant did not respond to the discovery requests. Instead, he filed an \"Opposition to Government's First Set of Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the opposition, he implied that he was not required to respond to the requests until the government survives his motion to suppress and proves that the defendant currencies are subject to forfeiture. He also attached an affidavit stating that he was asserting his Fifth Amendment right in response to the requests but that also implied he was reserving the right to supplement his responses after the Court ruled on his motion to suppress and determined forfeitability of the seized property. This Court entered an order on March 9, 2018, explaining that the law did not support claimant's assertion that he can wait to respond to discovery in this way and that discovery would proceed as scheduled. Because it was not clear if claimant was asserting a blanket Fifth Amendment privilege to the discovery requests, the Court ordered the claimant to clarify whether he was doing so or if he intended to respond to the outstanding requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his response to the Court's order, claimant stated that he would respond to any question that would not tend to incriminate him. He ended his brief, however, by once again suggesting that he did not need to respond to any discovery until after the government proves that the currency at issue was lawfully seized and is forfeitable. He did not file any responses to the government's discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government then filed a motion to compel claimant's responses to the outstanding discovery. The Court granted the motion on April 20, 2018, holding that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applied to the government's discovery requests and that no authority existed for claimant's position that he did not have to respond to the requests until after the government proved that the property was lawfully seized and forfeitable. The Court ordered claimant to respond to the requests by April 27, 2018, and noted that he could assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to the requests if he wished to do so. Once again, claimant did not file any responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government next moved to strike claimant's claim and answer for failing to respond to its discovery requests, relying on the discovery sanctions available under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Claimant filed an opposition in which he stated that he had all along asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege in response \"to all questions put to him, and, [that] he will continue to do so. To be sure, he has also asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege with reference to his being compelled to produce any documents.\" (Doc. 42, at 1). Because claimant had finally made clear that he was asserting the Fifth Amendment in response to all discovery, the Court denied the government's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The government thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment on the merits. Later, it filed an unopposed motion for leave to file a second motion for summary judgment on the issue of standing. This Court granted the motion for leave. The government's motion on standing, which claimant opposes, is now before the Court. Claimant has also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, which the government opposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Summary Judgment is appropriate when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The verified claim must \"identify the specific property claimed,\" \"identify the claimant and state the claimant's interest in the property,\" and \"be signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury.\" Supp. R. G(5)(a)(i). Supplemental Rule G(6)(a) allows the government to serve special interrogatories seeking information related to the claimant's identity and relationship to the defendant currency. The purpose of the rule is \"to permit the government to file limited interrogatories at any time after the claim is filed to gather information that bears on the claimant's standing.\" Supp. R.

The motion \"may be presented as a motion for judgment on the pleadings or as a motion to determine after a hearing or by summary judgment whether the claimant can carry the burden of establishing standing by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Supp. R. G(8)(c)(ii)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As in any case, standing is a threshold matter in an in rem civil forfeiture proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. $8,440,190.00 in U.S. Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051234\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/49/#p57\">\n    719 F.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (1st Cir. 2013).
