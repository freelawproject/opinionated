Drake on Attachment \u00a7 566; <em>Thompson v. Taylor </em>13 Me. 420; <em>Stone v. Dean </em>5 N. H. 502; <em>Parker v. Guillow </em>10 N. H. 103; the garnishee\u2019s disclosure is conclusive as to his indebtedness to the principal defendant and as to the latter\u2019s property in his hands: <em>Hackley v. Kanitz </em>39 Mich. 398 ; <em>Sexton v. Amos </em>39 Mich. 695 ; <em>Tabor v. Van Vranken </em>39 Mich. 193 ; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>not on every question which may arise between himself and the plaintiff, because provision is made for a trial of these matters: Comp. L. \u00a7 6448; <em>Maynards v. Cornwell </em>3 Mich. 309; and in this trial the principal defendant has a right to intervene for the\u2019 purpose of protecting his rights: <em>Wilson v. Bartholomew </em>45 Mich. 41.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-4\"><em>George H. Lothrop </em>for garnishee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOc\">In garnishment suits in justices\u2019 courts the answer of the garnishee, when pertinent, must be taken as true, and no judgment can be rendered against the garnishee beyond his admitted liability: <em>Newell v. Blair </em>7 Mich. 103; <em>Wellover v. Soule </em>30 Mich. 482; and if he pays to the plaintiff any money to which the plaintiff has not a strict right under the statute, the garnishment proceedings are no bar to a recovery of the same money by the principal defendant: <em>Hebel v. Amazon Ins. Co. </em>33 Mich. 401.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b375-5\">Campbell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtV0\">Plaintiff recovered before a justice a joint judgment against four defendants, and garnished the present defendant. An answer was put in admitting indebtedness in small amounts to a part of the defendants, each individually, but no joint indebtedness to any portion or to all of them. It also relied on their being householders.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In the circuit court, to which the garnishee case was appealed, a-judgment was rendered against the present defendant for the excess of the money due by the garnishee beyond the statutory allowance to each defendant as a householder. Plaintiff brings error, claiming that he should have had judgment for the aggregate.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">As we have found nothing in the statute which allows garnishee proceedings to reach property or debts belonging to only a part of the principal defendants, and as it is manifestly required by the statute that the defendant or defendants in the principal suit shall be the person or persons in whose right the garnishee plaintiff is allowed to prosecute the garnishee defendants, there is in our opinion no foundation for this complaint. These proceedings are purely statutory, and cannot be extended by construction. It never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>was designed, by means of these proceedings, to make further proceedings necessary to determine the relative rights of various defendants, who might be entitled to contribution from their co-defendants for an excess of property taken beyond their shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The plaintiff has no reason to complain of the judgment, and as defendant has not apj&gt;ealed, it must be affirmed with costs against plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
