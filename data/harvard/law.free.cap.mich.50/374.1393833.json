Otis </em>11 Mich. 213; where there was a written order which contained within itself a description of a mill for which the order was given, the time when the mill was to be delivered, the price of the mill, and the length of time the mill might be held for trial, parol evidence was admissible to show what the contract was: <em>Phelps v. Whitaker </em>37 Mich. 72, 77.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b391-8\">Campbell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amg\">Plaintiff sued the decedent -for the alleged conversion in May, 1880, of seven cases of oil of peppermint. The oil was left with O\u2019Connor in two parcels, \u2014 three cases in July, 1877, and four in September, 1877. The former was receipted for as received \u201cto be accounted for at New York prices, less commission.\u201d The latter was a simple receipt, and did not show any purpose or condition. It is agreed that it was known the oil was to be sent to New York and sold. It is disputed whether it was sent on plaintiff\u2019s account, or whether O\u2019Connor was the only person with whose conduct plaintiff was concerned. The oil was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>actually sent to the New York firm of Horner &amp; Quitting, who seem to have failed afterwards, and the oil was left in the hands of some receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In 1879 plaintiff sued O\u2019Connor in assumpsit, alleging the transaction to have been a sale. Being defeated in this action he made a demand in May, 1880, and now sues in trover for a conversion by reason of non-delivery on that demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Defendant, without objection, testified that the arrangement was that he should send the o$ to Horner <em>&amp; </em>Quitting for Yan Aukin\u2019s benefit, with instructions not to sell it under two dollars a pound. He further testified to receiving from them a letter finding fault with the quality of the oil, reporting current prices, and asking advice how to deal with it. That he showed this to Yan Aukin, who directed him that the oil should not be sold under two dollars, but gave no orders to have the oil sent back, but that they should hold the oil unless sold at his figures. That no instructions were ever given him to get the oil back before the demand in May, 1880, when O\u2019Connor offered, if Yan Aukin would pay expenses, to go to New York and try to recover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The court below refused to allow the Horner &amp; Quitting letter to be read, and refused to allow defendants to show by O\u2019Connor\u2019s clerk, who' received the oil, an agreement that the oil should be sent to Horner <em>&amp; </em>Quitting, who were to determine quality- and price.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Plaintiff swore that he considered the transaction with O\u2019Connor as a sale at its date.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The case shows that the real controversy depended \u00a9n the arrangements made upon or after the receipt of the oil by O\u2019Connor. It was, therefore, competent for defendant to show the transactions and all his conversations bearing on the subject. As the New York report formed a part of those dealings, and on one theory of the case was a very important part of the res gestae, it should not have been shut out. The testimony of the clerk of O\u2019Connor was also very material, as if admitted and believed it would have entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>destroyed plaintiff\u2019s theory. As the main facts were kept from the jury we do not think it important to discuss questions which probably would not have arisen had that testimony been received, or would not have arisen in their present shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The judgment must be reversed with costs and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
