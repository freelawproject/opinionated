Confining ourselves to the questions properly before us the case is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The defendant and appellant was the payee of the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>and indorsee, and the judgment entered against him in a justice\u2019s court was removed to the circuit by writ of certiorari, and the judgment of the justice was by the circuit court affirmed. The following is a copy of the note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">\u201c $50.00 Cehorse, Youn 18th, 1879.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">One yier after date I promise to .pay to the order of \u00a5m. Spaers fifty dollars, at American Express Office, Detroit, Mich. Yalue received with-. The makers and endorsers severally waive presentment for payment and notice of protest and non-payment of this note, and agree that if collected after maturity ten per-cent, for attorney\u2019s fees shall be added, and in case of suit:judgment for same shall be included in judgment on note. Without- any relief whatever from valuation or appraisment laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">P. O. Address, Ccorce Yadich Botol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">Joseph Sifman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">And endorsed, \u201cPay to the order of the Wilson Sewing Machine Company; W'm. Spears.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The party to whom the note was indorsed is plaintiff. It appears by the return to the writ of certiorari that defendant appeared in the case. The declaration was informal in assumpsit, on a promissory note on file, and on all the common counts, to which the defendant pleaded the general issue. The summons at commencement of suit in the justice\u2019s court is a summons to answer the Wilson Sewing Machine Company, a recital sufficient as an averment that the plaintiff was a corporation, and the liberal rule extended to pleading in such courts will permit this as supplying its omission in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">It is objected that there was no testimony showing the plaintiff was the owner of the note. The case as it comes before us is not distinguishable from the ordinary case of a suit by the indorsee of negotiable.paper against the payee in respect to the legal conclusions resulting from the act of indorsement. The plaintiff who sues as indorsee is presumed to be owner, and defendant\u2019s indorsement sufficiently establishes plaintiff\u2019s right to sue and the character in which he sues. <em>Ransom v. Priam Lodge </em>51 Ind. 60; <em>Congregational Society v. Perry </em>6 N. H. 164</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">It is further objected that the declaration not alleging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>plaintiff to be a corporation under the Laws of Michigan, proof of corporate existence was necessary. There was no plea in abatement that plaintiff had not sued in its right name, and there is in the act of the defendant, indorsing the note to be paid to the plaintiff, evidence of the name and lawful existence of the plaintiff as a corporation, which clearly brings the proceeding under the Act of 1871. 1 Sess. L. 1871 p. 176.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Lake Superior Building Co. v. Thompson </em>32 Mich. 293; <em>Garton v.
