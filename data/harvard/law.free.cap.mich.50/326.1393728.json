E. R. R. v. Sturgis </em>44 Mich. 538 ; personal liability statutes should be construed in accordance with the natural and ordinary sense of the language: <em>Bohn v. Brown </em>33 Mich. 257 ; the term employees in its ordinary and usual sense includes all whose services are rendered for another, and is not restricted to any kind of employment or service but includes as well the professional man as the common laborer: <em>Gurney v. A. &amp; G. W. Ry. </em>58 N. Y. 367; <em>Stryker v. Cassidy </em>76 N. Y. 50.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-5\"><em>Alex. B. Fowler </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2z\">In the constitutional clause protecting labor debts, the services referred to are menial or manual services, and he who performs them must be of a class whose members usually look -to the reward of a day\u2019s labor or service for immediate or present support, from whom the company does not expect credit, and to whom its future ability to pay is of no consequence, and who is responsible for no independent action, but who does a day\u2019s work, or a stated job, under the direction of a superior: <em>Wakefield v. Fargo </em>decided Oct. 17th, 1882, 2 N. Y. Cond. Rep. 35 (Wakefield having been book-keeper at a yearly salary); <em>Peak v. Miller </em>39 Mich. 594; <em>Brochway v.

Rusk </em>55 Wis. 465 (railroad agents); a judgment confessed by the president of a corporation without service of process and without the order or knowledge of the directors or company, and not setting forth the cause of the indebtedness, is void: <em>McMurray v. St. Louis &amp;c. Co. </em>33 Mo. 377.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b343-6\">Graves, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAqj\">The plaintiff, claiming to be a judgment creditor of the <em>\u201c </em>Condensed Oil Manufacturing Company \u201d for services rendered to the company, and that collection by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>execution had failed, prosecuted this action against the defendant as a stockholder to compel him to make payment. The trial judge ordered a verdict against the plaintiff. The alleged judgment against the corporation was before a justice, and was given on a confession made by the president and without a showing of authority from the directors. Whether this confession was sufficient to confer jurisdiction may be open to some discussion, but the point is now waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The circuit judge was of opinipn that the plaintiff\u2019s debt was not a labor debt within the meaning of the provisions on which the plaintiff relies, \u2014 Const., article 15 \u00a7 Y: Comp. L. \u00a7 2852 \u2014 and hence that the defendant was not liable for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We think this view is correct. The plaintiff\u2019s connection with' the company and the nature of his occupation were fully explained by him as a witness. He said : \u201c The kind of labor I rendered to the said company was that of traveling salesman or agent, selling their goods. My duties consisted in soliciting orders for the sale of the company\u2019s goods from customers, who were using those or similar goods in different towns through the country. I carried samples with me always; I carried this assortment of samples with me to each customer or man I solicited. I was to receive a salary or compensation at the rate of $1000 per year; that was my agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">From this it seems evident to the Court that he was not a labor performer for the corporation in the sense contemplated in the provisions for holding stockholders liable. He had no part in carrying on the establishment, nor in the manufacture. He was a mere outside agent or representative of the company to bring business to it, upon a salary. As regards the present question, his position was nearer the position of an officer of the corporation than that of a laborer.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The judgment is affirmed with costs,</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
