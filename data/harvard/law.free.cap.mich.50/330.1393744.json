Otis </em>21 Mich. 23; and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>must also appear that he has some substantial interest in the subject matter: <em>Golden v. Botts </em>12 Wend. 231; and that there is something material to be accomplished, \u2014 something upon which the judgment of this Court can act effectively and work advantage to the plaintiff: <em>People v. Leavitt </em>11 Mich. 171.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b347-4\">Graves, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARLT\">This writ of certiorari is brought to vacate certain proceedings to lay out a highway, and the plaintiff\u2019s title to prosecute it consists only in his being a tax-payer of the town, and so, potentially liable for some, as yet unknown, but very small, portion of the tax wherewith to pay the appraised damage of $275. We think this interest is too remote and too indirect and indefinite to warrant this remedy, and that any sanction of the proceeding would be an improper exercise of discretion. Were no other \u25a0objection apparent, the single circumstance that the record contains no evidence of any interest in the plaintiff large enough for the law to notice would be sufficient to defeat the writ. The facts in <em>Campau v. Button </em>33 Mich. 525, are not very fully stated in the report. But it will appear from an examination of the record that they are entirely distinguishable, and that case affords no authority for this.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Writ quashed, with costs to respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
