In her declaration she counts on the wrongful denial of her exemptions, but she also claims to recover the whole value of the property by reason of the failure of the officer to return\u2019it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The defense of the officer is that immediately on the termination of the attachment suit the property was taken from his possession by virtue of other writs against the plaintiff, and that if it was finally lost to the plaintiff, it was not through any fault of his. The circuit judge was of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover only nominal damages, unless she could show that she-made a demand upon the officer *for the return of the goods after the attachment suit had terminated. The officer denied that any such demand was made, but he also shows that it was impracticable ; for though he was present in the justice\u2019s court while the attachment suit was being tried, he went out of town before it was disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The circuit judge overlooked the fact that the plaintiff, if the facts are as she alleges, had suffered serious wrongs at the hands of the officer before the attachment suit was called for trial. The levy itself was grossly excessive; and if the plaintiff had been allowed all the exemptions she claimed, there would apparently have been ample property left to secure the pretended debt. It cannot be tolerated that such a seizure shall go unrebuked. The officer is or should be a minister of justice; not of oppression; and he should execute every writ put into his hands in such a manner as to do as little mischief to the debtor as possible. To seize and hold the whole of a debtor\u2019s property so as to preclude the debtor, not only from engaging in his customary business, but even from keeping house, when the enforcement of his process does not at all require it, is a proceeding which we cannot think the defendant himself would have failed to censure if it had come to his personal knowledge. Arid even if the seizure had been justifiable, the circumstances were such as to demand from the officer prompt action in. setting off, the exemptions ; for every day\u2019s delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>was an unnecessary injury. And there is much in this record to raise at least a strong suspicion that the wrong which the officer continued for a week he assisted in perpetuating afterwards. But the questions on this branch of the case are questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The judgment must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b374-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
