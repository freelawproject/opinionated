Plaintiffs-appellants are Texas voters; they challenge this uniform method of districting on the ground that it produces unequal districts when measured by voter-eligible population. Voter-eligible population, not total population, they urge, must be used to ensure that their votes will not be devalued in relation to citizens' votes in other districts. We hold, based on constitutional history, this Court's decisions, and longstanding practice, that a State may draw its legislative districts based on total population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court long resisted any role in overseeing the process by which States draw legislative districts. \"The remedy for unfairness in districting,\" the Court once held, \"is to secure State legislatures that will apportion properly, or to invoke the ample powers of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Colegrove v.

In the opening half of the 20th century, there was a massive population shift away from rural areas and toward suburban and urban communities. Nevertheless, many States ran elections into the early 1960's based on maps drawn to equalize each district's population as it was composed around 1900. Other States used maps allocating a certain number of legislators to each county regardless of its population. These schemes left many rural districts significantly underpopulated in comparison with urban and suburban districts. But rural legislators who benefited from malapportionment had scant incentive to adopt new maps that might put them out of office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court confronted this ingrained structural inequality in\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

But, in the overwhelming majority of cases, jurisdictions have equalized total population, as measured by the decennial census.

As they did before the District Court, appellants insist that the Equal Protection Clause requires jurisdictions to draw state and local legislative districts with equal voter-eligible populations, thus protecting \"voter equality,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"the right of eligible voters to an equal vote.\" Brief for Appellants 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To comply with their proposed rule, appellants suggest, jurisdictions should design districts based on citizen-voting-age-population (CVAP) data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), an annual statistical sample of the U.S. population. Texas responds that jurisdictions may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, design districts using any population baseline-including total population and voter-eligible population-so long as the choice is rational and not invidiously discriminatory. Although its use of total-population data from the census was permissible, Texas therefore argues, it could have used ACS CVAP data instead. Sharing Texas' position that the Equal Protection Clause does not mandate use of voter-eligible population, the United States urges us not to address Texas' separate assertion that the Constitution allows States to use alternative population baselines, including voter-eligible population. Equalizing total population, the United States maintains, vindicates the principle of representational equality by \"ensur[ing] that the voters in each district have the power to elect a representative who represents the same number of constituents as all other representatives.\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In agreement with Texas and the United States, we reject appellants' attempt to locate a voter-equality mandate in the Equal Protection Clause. As history, precedent, and practice demonstrate, it is plainly permissible for jurisdictions to\n   measure equalization by the total population of state and local legislative districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We begin with constitutional history. At the time of the founding, the Framers confronted a question analogous to the one at issue here: On what basis should congressional districts be allocated to States? The Framers' solution, now known as the Great Compromise, was to provide each State the same number of seats in the Senate, and to allocate House seats based on States' total populations. \"Representatives and direct Taxes,\" they wrote, \"shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union,\n   <em>\n    according to their respective Numbers\n   </em>\n   .\" U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3(emphasis added). \"It is a fundamental principle of the proposed constitution,\" James Madison explained in the Federalist Papers, \"that as the aggregate number of representatives allotted to the several states, is to be ... founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants; so, the right of choosing this allotted number in each state, is to be exercised by such part of the inhabitants, as the state itself may designate.\" The Federalist No. 54, p. 284 (G. Carey &amp; J. McClellan eds. 2001). In other words, the basis of\n   <em>\n    representation\n   </em>\n   in the House was to include all inhabitants-although slaves were counted as only three-fifths of a person-even though States remained free to deny many of those inhabitants the right to participate in the selection of their representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Endorsing apportionment based on total population, Alexander Hamilton declared: \"There can be no truer principle than this-that every individual of the community at large has an equal right to the protection of government.\" 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 473 (M.

Concerned that Southern States would not willingly enfranchise freed slaves, and aware that \"a slave's freedom could swell his state's population for purposes of representation in the House by one person, rather than only three-fifths,\" the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment considered at length the possibility of allocating House seats to States on the basis of voter population.

Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1866). Supporters of apportionment based on voter population employed the same voter-equality reasoning that appellants now echo.

Much of the opposition was grounded in the principle of representational equality. \"As an abstract proposition,\" argued Representative James G.

See U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a7 2(\"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.\"). Introducing the final version of the Amendment on the Senate floor, Senator Jacob Howard explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[The] basis of representation is numbers ...; that is, the whole population except untaxed Indians and persons excluded by the State laws for rebellion or other crime.... The committee adopted numbers as the most just and satisfactory basis, and this is the principle upon which the Constitution itself was originally framed, that the basis of representation should depend upon numbers; and such, I think, after all, is the safest and most secure principle upon which the Government can rest.

The Framers selected total population for the former, appellants and their\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   argue, because of federalism concerns inapposite to intrastate districting. These concerns included the perceived risk that a voter-population base might encourage States to expand the franchise unwisely, and the hope that a total-population base might counter States' incentive to undercount their populations, thereby reducing their share of direct taxes.\n   <em>\n    Wesberry,\n   </em>\n   however, rejected the distinction appellants now press. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1128 - 1129. Even without the weight of\n   <em>\n    Wesberry,\n   </em>\n   we would find appellants' distinction unconvincing. One can accept that federalism-or, as Justice ALITO emphasizes, partisan and regional political advantage, see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1145 - 1149-figured in the Framers' selection of total population as the basis for allocating congressional seats. Even so, it remains beyond doubt that the principle of representational equality figured prominently in the decision to count people, whether or not they qualify as voters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, appellants and Justice ALITO urge, see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1144 - 1145, the Court has typically refused to analogize to features of the federal electoral system-\n   here, the constitutional scheme governing congressional apportionment-when considering challenges to state and local election laws.

I agree with the majority that our precedents do not require a State to equalize the total number of voters in each district. States may opt to equalize total population. I therefore concur in the majority's judgment that appellants' challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I write separately because this Court has never provided a sound basis for the one-person, one-vote principle. For 50 years, the Court has struggled to define what right that principle protects. Many of our precedents suggest that it protects the right of eligible voters to cast votes that receive equal weight. Despite that frequent explanation, our precedents often conclude that the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied when all individuals within a district-voters or not-have an equal share of representation. The majority today concedes that our cases have not produced a clear answer on this point. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In my view, the majority has failed to provide a sound basis for the one-person, one-vote principle because no such basis exists. The Constitution does not prescribe any one basis for apportionment within States. It instead leaves States significant leeway in apportioning their own districts to equalize total population, to equalize eligible voters, or to promote any other principle consistent with a republican form of government. The majority should recognize the futility of choosing only one of these options. The Constitution leaves the choice to the people alone-not to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the 1960's, this Court decided that the Equal Protection Clause requires States to draw legislative districts based on a \"one-person, one-vote\" rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this Court's decisions have never coalesced around a single theory about what States must equalize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State from \"deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1.

The problem is more fundamental. There is simply no way to make a principled choice between interpreting one person, one vote as protecting eligible voters or as protecting total inhabitants within a State. That is because, though those theories are noble, the Constitution does not make either of them the exclusive means of apportionment for state and local representatives. In guaranteeing to the States a \"Republican Form of Government,\" Art. IV, \u00a7 4, the Constitution did not resolve whether the ultimate basis of representation is the right of citizens to cast an equal ballot or the right of all inhabitants to have equal representation. The Constitution instead reserves these matters to the people. The majority's attempt today to divine a single \" 'theory of the Constitution' \"-apportionment based on representation,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1128 - 1129 (quoting Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2766-2767 (1866))-rests on a flawed reading of history and wrongly picks one side of a debate that the Framers did not resolve in the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Constitution lacks a single, comprehensive theory of representation. The Framers understood the tension between majority rule and protecting fundamental rights from majorities. This understanding led to a \"mixed\" constitutional structure that did not embrace any single theory of representation but instead struck a compromise between those who sought an equitable system of representation and\n   those who were concerned that the majority would abuse plenary control over public policy. As Madison wrote, \"A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary controul on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\" The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).\n   <em>\n    This\n   </em>\n   was the theory of the Constitution. The Framers therefore made difficult compromises on the apportionment of federal representation, and they did not prescribe any one theory of how States had to divide their legislatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because, in the view of the Framers, ultimate political power derives from citizens who were \"created equal,\" The Declaration of Independence \u00b6 2, beliefs in equality of representation-and by extension, majority rule-influenced the constitutional structure. In the years between the Revolution and the framing, the Framers experimented with different ways of securing the political system against improper influence. Of all the \"electoral safeguards for the representational system,\" the most critical was \"equality of representation.\" G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776-1787, p. 170 (1998) (Wood).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Framers' preference for apportionment by representation (and majority rule) was driven partially by the belief that all citizens were inherently equal. In a system where citizens were equal, a legislature should have \"equal representation\" so that \"equal interests among the people should have equal interests in [the assembly].\" Thoughts on Government, in 4 Works of John Adams 195 (C. Adams ed. 1851). The British Parliament fell short of this goal. In addition to having hereditary nobility, more than half of the members of the democratic House of Commons were elected from sparsely populated districts-so-called \"rotten boroughs.\" Wood 171;\n   <em>\n    Baker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p191\">\n    369 U.S., at 302-303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p191\">\n    82 S.Ct. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Framers' preference for majority rule also was a reaction to the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation. Under the Articles, each State could cast one vote regardless of population and Congress could act only with the assent of nine States. Articles of Confederation, Art. IX, cl. 6;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., Art. X;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., Art. XI. This system proved undesirable because a few small States had the ability to paralyze the National Legislature. See The Federalist No. 22, at 140-141 (Hamilton).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Consequently, when the topic of dividing representation came up at the Constitutional Convention, some Framers advocated proportional representation throughout the National Legislature. 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 471-473 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). Alexander Hamilton voiced concerns about the unfairness of allowing a minority to rule over a majority. In explaining at the Convention why he opposed giving States an equal vote in the National Legislature, Hamilton asked rhetorically, \"If ... three states contain a majority of the inhabitants of America, ought they to be governed by a minority?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 473; see also The Federalist No. 22, at 141 (Hamilton) (objecting to supermajoritarian voting requirements because they allow an entrenched minority to \"controul the opinion of a majority respecting the best mode of conducting [the public business]\"). James Madison, too, opined that the general Government needed a direct mandate from the people. If federal \"power [were] not immediately derived from the people, in proportion to their numbers,\" according to Madison, the Federal Government would be as weak as Congress under the Articles of Confederation. 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 472.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In many ways, the Constitution reflects this preference for majority rule. To pass Congress, ordinary legislation requires a simple majority of present members to vote in favor. And some features of the apportionment for the House of Representatives reflected the idea that States should wield political power in approximate proportion to their number of inhabitants.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1126 - 1129. Thus, \"equal representation for equal numbers of people,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1129 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted), features prominently in how representatives are apportioned among the States. These features of the Constitution reflect the preference of some members of the founding generation for equality of representation. But, as explained below, this is not the single \"theory of the Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Framers also understood that unchecked majorities could lead to tyranny of the majority. As a result, many viewed antidemocratic checks as indispensable to republican government. And included among the antidemocratic checks were legislatures that deviated from perfect equality of representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Framers believed that a proper government promoted the common good. They conceived this good as objective and not inherently coextensive with majoritarian preferences. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   The Federalist No. 1, at 4 (Hamilton) (defining the common good or \"public good\" as the \"true interests\" of the community);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., No. 10, at 57 (Madison) (\"the permanent and aggregate interests of the community\"). For government to promote the common good, it had to do more than simply obey the will of the majority. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g., ibid.\n   </em>\n   (discussing majoritarian factions). Government must also protect fundamental rights. See The Declaration of Independence \u00b6 2; 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *124 (\"[T]he principal aim of society is to protect individuals in the enjoyment of those absolute rights, which are vested in them by the immutable laws of nature\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Of particular concern for the Framers was the majority of people violating the property rights of the minority. Madison observed that \"the most common and durable source of factions, has been the various and unequal distribution of property.\" The Federalist No. 10, at 59. A poignant example occurred in Massachusetts. In what became known as Shays' Rebellion, armed debtors attempted to block legal actions by creditors to recover debts. Although that rebellion was ultimately put down, debtors sought relief from state legislatures \"under the auspices of Constitutional forms.\" Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Apr. 23, 1787), in 11 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 307 (J. Boyd ed. 1955); see Wood 412-413. With no structural political checks on democratic lawmaking, creditors found their rights jeopardized by state laws relieving debtors of their obligation to pay and authorizing forms of payment that devalued the contracts.

(explaining that the Contract Clause came from the Framers' desire to \"shield themselves and their property from the effects of those sudden and strong passions to which men are exposed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Because of the Framers' concerns about placing unchecked power in political majorities, the Constitution's majoritarian provisions were only part of a complex republican structure. The Framers also placed several antidemocratic provisions in the Constitution. The original Constitution\n   permitted only the direct election of representatives. Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. Senators and the President were selected indirectly. See Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 1; Art. II, \u00a7 1, cls. 2-3. And the \"Great Compromise\" guaranteed large and small States voting equality in the Senate. By malapportioning the Senate, the Framers prevented large States from outvoting small States to adopt policies that would advance the large States' interests at the expense of the small States. See The Federalist No. 62, at 417 (Madison).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   These countermajoritarian measures reflect the Framers' aspirations of promoting competing goals. Rejecting a hereditary class system, they thought political power resided with the people. At the same time, they sought to check majority rule to promote the common good and mitigate threats to fundamental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As the Framers understood, designing a government to fulfill the conflicting tasks of respecting the fundamental equality of persons while promoting the common good requires making incommensurable tradeoffs. For this reason, they did not attempt to restrict the States to one form of government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Instead, the Constitution broadly required that the States maintain a \"Republican Form of Government.\" Art. IV, \u00a7 4. But the Framers otherwise left it to States to make tradeoffs and reconcile the competing goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Republican governments promote the common good by placing power in the hands of the people, while curtailing the majority's ability to invade the minority's fundamental rights. The Framers recognized that there is no universal formula for accomplishing these goals. At the framing, many state legislatures were bicameral, often reflecting multiple theories of representation. Only \"[s]ix of the original thirteen states based representation in both houses of their state legislatures on population.\" Hayden, The False Promise of One Person, One Vote,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20213\">\n    102 Mich.

Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); see also The Federalist No. 39, at 251 (Madison) (\"[W]e may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people; and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behaviour\"). By requiring the States to have republican governments, the Constitution prohibited them from having monarchies and aristocracies. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p191\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No. 43, at 291.

Amar, America's Constitution: A Biography 276-281 (2005) (arguing that the provision prohibited monarchies and aristocracies but not direct democracy); see also The Federalist No. 10, at 62 (Madison) (distinguishing a \"democracy\" and a \"republic\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166554\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/186/#p191\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No. 14, at 83-84 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Beyond that, however, the Constitution left matters open for the people of the States to decide. The Constitution says nothing about what type of republican government the States must follow. When the Framers wanted to deny powers to state governments, they did so explicitly. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1 (\"No State shall ... pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   None of the Reconstruction Amendments changed the original understanding of republican government. Those Amendments brought blacks within the existing American political community. The Fourteenth Amendment pressured States to adopt universal male suffrage by reducing a noncomplying State's representation in Congress. Amdt. 14, \u00a7 2. And the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited restricting the right of suffrage based on race. Amdt. 15, \u00a7 1. That is as far as those Amendments went. As Justice Harlan explained in\n   <em>\n    Reynolds,\n   </em>\n   neither Amendment provides a theory of how much \"weight\" a vote must receive, nor do they require a State to apportion both Houses of their legislature solely on a population basis.

These problems are antithetical to the values that the Framers embraced in the Constitution. These problems confirm that the Court has been wrong to entangle itself with the political process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    First,\n   </em>\n   in embracing one person, one vote, the Court has arrogated to the Judiciary important value judgments that the Constitution reserves to the people. In\n   <em>\n    Reynolds,\n   </em>\n   for example, the Court proclaimed that \"[l]egislators represent people, not trees or acres\"; that \"[l]egislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests\"; and that, accordingly, electoral districts must have roughly equal population.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    377 U.S., at 562-563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As I have explained, the Constitution permits, but does not impose, this view. Beyond that,\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ' assertions are driven by the belief that there is a single, correct answer to the question of how much voting strength an individual citizen should have. These assertions overlook that, to control factions that would legislate against the common good, individual voting strength must sometimes yield to countermajoritarian checks. And this principle has no less force within States than it has for the federal system. See The Federalist No. 10, at 63-65 (Madison) (recognizing that smaller republics, such as the individual States, are more prone to capture by special interests). Instead of large States versus small States, those interests may pit urban areas versus rural, manufacturing versus agriculture, or those with property versus those without. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 622-623,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Harlan, J., dissenting). There is no single method of reconciling these competing interests. And it is not the role of this Court to calibrate democracy in the vain search for an optimum solution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Government argues that apportioning legislators by any metric other than total population \"risks rendering residents of this country who are ineligible, unwilling, or unable to vote as invisible or irrelevant to our system of representative democracy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   27. But that argument rests on the faulty premise that \"our system of representative democracy\" requires specific groups to have representation in a specific manner. As I have explained, the Constitution does not impose that requirement. See Parts II-A, II-B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . And as the Court recently reminded us, States are free to serve as \" 'laboratories' \" of democracy.\n   <em>\n    Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591109\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2652/#p2673\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2673,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591109\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2652/#p2673\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). That \"laboratory\" extends to experimenting about the nature of democracy itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Second,\n   </em>\n   the Court's efforts to monitor the political process have failed to provide any consistent guidance for the States. Even if it were justifiable for this Court to enforce some principle of majority rule, it has been unable to do so in a principled manner. Our precedents do not address the myriad other ways that minorities (or fleeting majorities) entrench themselves in the political system. States can place policy choices in their constitutions or have supermajoritarian voting rules in a legislative assembly. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   N.Y. Const., Art. V, \u00a7 7 (constitutionalizing public employee pensions); Ill. Const., Art. VII, \u00a7 6(g) (requiring a three-fifths vote of the General Assembly to preempt certain local ordinances). In theory, of course, it does not seem to make a difference if a state legislature is unresponsive to the majority of residents because the state assembly requires a 60% vote to pass a bill or because 40% of the population elects 51% of the representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   So far as the Constitution is concerned, there is no single \"correct\" way to design a republican government. Any republic will have to reconcile giving power to the people with diminishing the influence of special interests. The wisdom of the Framers was that they recognized this dilemma and left it to the people to resolve. In trying to impose its own theory of democracy, the Court is hopelessly adrift amid political theory and interest-group politics with no guiding legal principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   This case illustrates the confusion that our cases have wrought. The parties and the Government offer three positions on what this Court's one-person, one-vote cases require States to equalize. Under appellants' view, the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to an equal vote. Brief for Appellants 26. Appellees, in contrast, argue that the Fourteenth Amendment protects against invidious discrimination; in their view, no such discrimination occurs when States have a rational basis for the population base that they select, even if that base leaves eligible voters malapportioned. Brief for Appellees 16-17. And, the Solicitor General suggests that reapportionment by total population is the only permissible standard because\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   recognized a right of \"equal representation for equal numbers of people.\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Although the majority does not choose among these theories, it necessarily denies that the Equal Protection Clause protects the right to cast an equally weighted ballot. To prevail, appellants do not have to deny the importance of equal representation. Because States can equalize both total population and total voting power within the districts, they have to show only that the right to cast an equally weighted vote is part of the one-person, one-vote right that we have recognized. But the majority declines to find such a right in the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1132 - 1133. Rather, the majority acknowledges that \"[f]or every sentence appellants\n   quote from the Court's opinions [establishing a right to an equal vote], one could respond with a line casting the one-person, one-vote guarantee in terms of equality of representation, not voter equality.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1131. Because our precedents are not consistent with appellants' position-that the only constitutionally available choice for States is to allocate districts to equalize eligible voters-the majority concludes that appellants' challenge fails.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1130 - 1133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I agree with the majority's ultimate disposition of this case. As far as the original understanding of the Constitution is concerned, a State has wide latitude in selecting its population base for apportionment. See Part II-B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . It can use total population, eligible voters, or any other nondiscriminatory voter base.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   And States with a bicameral legislature can have some mixture of these theories, such as one population base for its lower house and another for its upper chamber.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Our precedents do not compel a contrary conclusion. Appellants are correct that this Court's precedents have primarily based its one-person, one-vote jurisprudence on the theory that eligible voters have a right against vote dilution.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hadley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049169\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/50/#p56\">\n    397 U.S., at 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049169\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/50/#p56\">\n    90 S.Ct. 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Reynolds,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    377 U.S., at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The decennial census required by the Constitution tallies total population. Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3; Amdt. 14, \u00a7 2. These statistics are more reliable and less subject to manipulation and dispute than statistics concerning eligible voters. Since\n   <em>\n    Reynolds,\n   </em>\n   States have almost uniformly used total population in attempting to create legislative districts that are equal in size. And with one notable exception,\n   <em>\n    Burns v. Richardson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12041905\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/73/#p93\">\n    384 U.S. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12041905\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/73/#p93\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12041905\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/73/#p93\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), this Court's post-\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   cases have likewise\n   looked to total population. Moreover, much of the time, creating districts that are equal in total population also results in the creation of districts that are at least roughly equal in eligible voters. I therefore agree that States are permitted to use total population in redistricting plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Although this conclusion is sufficient to decide the case before us, Texas asks us to go further and to hold that States, while generally free to use total population statistics, are not barred from using eligible voter statistics. Texas points to\n   <em>\n    Burns,\n   </em>\n   in which this Court held that Hawaii did not violate the one-person, one-vote principle by adopting a plan that sought to equalize the number of registered voters in each district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Disagreeing with Texas, the Solicitor General dismisses\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   as an anomaly and argues that the use of total population is constitutionally required. The Solicitor General contends that the one-person, one-vote rule means that all persons, whether or not they are eligible to vote, are entitled to equal representation in the legislature. Accordingly, he argues, legislative districts must be equal in total population even if that results in districts that are grossly unequal in the number of eligible voters, a situation that is most likely to arise where aliens are disproportionately concentrated in some parts of a State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   This argument, like that advanced by appellants, implicates very difficult theoretical and empirical questions about the nature of representation. For centuries, political theorists have debated the proper role of representatives,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and political scientists have studied the conduct of legislators and the interests that they actually advance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have no need to wade into these waters in this case, and I would not do so. Whether a State is permitted to\n   use some measure other than total population is an important and sensitive question that we can consider if and when we have before us a state districting plan that, unlike the current Texas plan, uses something other than total population as the basis for equalizing the size of districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court does not purport to decide whether a State may base a districting plan on something other than total population, but the Court, picking up a key component of the Solicitor General's argument, suggests that the use of total population is supported by the Constitution's formula for allocating seats in the House of Representatives among the States. Because House seats are allocated based on total population, the Solicitor General argues, the one-person, one-vote principle requires districts that are equal in total population. I write separately primarily because I cannot endorse this meretricious argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   First, the allocation of congressional representation sheds little light on the question presented by the Solicitor General's argument because that allocation plainly violates one person, one vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is obviously true with respect to the Senate: Although all States have equal representation in the Senate, the most populous State (California) has 66 times as many people as the least populous (Wyoming). See United States Census 2010, Resident Population Data, http://www.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php. And even the allocation of House seats does not comport with one person, one vote. Every State is entitled to at least one seat in the House, even if the State's population is lower than the average population of House districts nationwide. U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. Today, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming all fall into that category. See United States Census 2010, Apportionment Data, http://www.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-data-text.php. If one person, one vote applied to allocation of House seats among States, I very much doubt the Court would uphold a plan where one Representative represents fewer than 570,000 people in Wyoming but nearly a million people next door in Montana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Sims\n   </em>\n   squarely rejected the argument that the Constitution's allocation of congressional representation establishes the test for the constitutionality of a state legislative districting plan. Under one Alabama districting plan before the Court in that case, seats in the State Senate were allocated by county, much as seats in the United States Senate are allocated by State. (At that time, the upper houses\n   in most state legislatures were similar in this respect.) The\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   Court noted that \"[t]he system of representation in the two Houses of the Federal Congress\" was \"conceived out of compromise and concession indispensable to the establishment of our federal republic.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    377 U.S., at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rejecting Alabama's argument that this system supported the constitutionality of the State's apportionment of senate seats, the Court concluded that \"the Founding Fathers clearly had no intention of establishing a pattern or model for the apportionment of seats in state legislatures when the system of representation in the Federal Congress was adopted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Gray v.

When the formula for allocating House seats was first devised in 1787 and reconsidered at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, the overwhelming concern was far removed from any abstract theory about the nature of representation. Instead, the dominant consideration was the distribution of political power among the States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The original Constitution's allocation of House seats involved what the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   Court rather delicately termed \"compromise and concession.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    377 U.S., at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171208\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/377/533/#p568\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Seats were apportioned among the States \"according to their respective Numbers,\" and these \"Numbers\" were \"determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons ... three fifths of all other Persons.\" Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. The phrase \"all other Persons\" was a euphemism for slaves. Delegates to the Constitutional Convention from the slave States insisted on this infamous clause as a condition of their support for the Constitution, and the clause gave the slave States more power in the House and in the electoral college than they would have enjoyed if only free persons had been counted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These slave-state delegates did not demand slave representation based on some philosophical notion that \"representatives serve all residents, not just those eligible or registered to vote.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1132.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court's account of the original Constitution's allocation also plucks out of context Alexander Hamilton's statement on apportionment. The Court characterizes Hamilton's words (more precisely, Robert Yates's summary of his fellow New Yorker's\n   words) as endorsing apportionment by\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   population, and positions those words as if Hamilton were talking about apportionment in the House.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1127. Neither is entirely accurate. The \"quote\" comes from the controversy over Senate apportionment, where the debate turned on whether to apportion by population\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   . See generally 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 470-474 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). Hamilton argued in favor of allocating Senate seats by population:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \"The question, after all is, is it our interest in modifying this general government to sacrifice individual rights to the preservation of the rights of an\n   <em>\n    artificial\n   </em>\n   being, called states? There can be no truer principle than this-that every individual of the community at large has an equal right to the protection of government. If therefore three states contain a majority of the inhabitants of America, ought they to be governed by a minority? Would the inhabitants of the great states ever submit to this? If the smaller states maintain this principle, through a love of power, will not the larger, from the same motives, be equally tenacious to preserve their power?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 473.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   As is clear from the passage just quoted, Hamilton (according to Yates) thought the fight over apportionment was about naked\n   <em>\n    power,\n   </em>\n   not some lofty ideal about the nature of representation. That interpretation is confirmed by James Madison's summary of the same statement by Hamilton: \"The truth is it [meaning the debate over apportionment] is a contest for power, not for liberty.... The State of Delaware having 40,000 souls will\n   <em>\n    lose power,\n   </em>\n   if she has\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    10\n   </sub>\n   only of the votes allowed to Pa. having 400,000.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 466. Far from \"[e]ndorsing apportionment based on total population,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1127, Hamilton was merely acknowledging the obvious: that apportionment in the new National Government would be the outcome of a contest over raw political power, not abstract political theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   After the Civil War, when the Fourteenth Amendment was being drafted, the question of the apportionment formula arose again. Thaddeus Stevens, a leader of the so-called radical Republicans, unsuccessfully proposed that apportionment be based on eligible voters, rather than total population. The opinion of the Court suggests that the rejection of Stevens' proposal signified the adoption of the theory that representatives are properly understood to represent all of the residents of their districts, whether or not they are eligible to vote.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1127 - 1129. As was the case in 1787, however, it was power politics, not democratic theory, that carried the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In making his proposal, Stevens candidly explained that the proposal's primary aim was to perpetuate the dominance of the Republican Party and the Northern States. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 74 (1865); Van Alstyne, The Fourteenth Amendment, The \"Right\" to Vote, and the Understanding of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 33, 45-47 (Van Alstyne). As Stevens spelled out, if House seats were based on total population, the power of the former slave States would be magnified. Prior to the Civil War, a slave had counted for only three-fifths of a person for purposes of the apportionment of House seats. As a result of the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment, the former slaves would now be fully counted even if they were not permitted to vote. By Stevens' calculation, this would give the South 13 additional votes in both the House and the electoral college. Cong. Globe, 39th\n   Cong., 1st Sess., 74 (1865); Van Alstyne 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Stevens' proposal met with opposition in the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, including from, as the majority notes, James Blaine.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1128. Yet, as it does with Hamilton's, the majority plucks Blaine's words out of context:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   \"[W]e have had several propositions to amend the Federal Constitution with respect to the basis of representation in Congress. These propositions ... give to the States in future a representation proportioned to their voters instead of their inhabitants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   \"The effect contemplated and intended by this change is perfectly well understood, and on all hands frankly avowed. It is to deprive the lately rebellious States of the unfair advantage of a large representation in this House, based on their colored population, so long as that population shall be denied political rights by the legislation of those States....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \"The direct object thus aimed at, as it respects the rebellious States, has been so generally approved that little thought seems to have been given to the incidental evils which the proposed constitutional amendment would inflict on a large portion of the loyal States-evils, in my judgment, so serious and alarming as to lead me to oppose the amendment in any form in which it has yet been presented. As an abstract proposition no one will deny that population is the true basis of representation; for women, children, and other non-voting classes may have as vital an interest in the legislation of the country as those who actually deposit the ballot....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   \"If voters instead of population shall be made the basis of representation certain results will follow, not fully appreciated perhaps by some who are now urgent for the change.\" Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 141 (1865).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The \"not fully appreciated\" and \"incidental evi[l]\" was, in Blaine's view, the disruption to\n   <em>\n    loyal\n   </em>\n   States' representation in Congress. Blaine described how the varying suffrage requirements in loyal States could lead to, for instance, California's being entitled to eight seats in the House and Vermont's being entitled only to three, despite their having similar populations.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see also 2 B. Ackerman, We the People: Transformations 164, 455, n. 5 (1998); Van Alstyne 47, 70. This mattered to Blaine because\n   <em>\n    both States were loyal\n   </em>\n   and so neither deserved to suffer a loss of relative political power. Blaine therefore proposed to apportion representatives by the \"whole number of persons except those to whom civil or political rights or privileges are denied or abridged by the constitution or laws of any State on account of race or color.\" Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 142.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \"This is a very simple and very direct way, it seems to me, of reaching the result aimed at without embarrassment to any other question or interest. It leaves population as heretofore the basis of representation, does not disturb in any manner the harmonious relations of the loyal States, and it conclusively deprives the southern States of all representation in Congress on account of the colored population so long as those States may choose to abridge or deny to that population the political rights and privileges accorded to others.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   As should be obvious from these lengthy passages, Blaine recognized that the \"generally approved\" \"result aimed at\" was to deprive southern States of political power; far from quibbling with that aim, he sought to\n   <em>\n    achieve it\n   </em>\n   while limiting the collateral damage to the loyal northern States. See Van Alstyne 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Roscoe Conkling, whom the majority also quotes,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1128, seemed to be as concerned with voter-based apportionment's \"narrow[ing] the basis of taxation, and in some States seriously,\" as he was with abstract notions of representational equality. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 358;\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 359 (\"representation should go with taxation\");\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   (apportionment by citizenship \"would narrow the basis of taxation and cause considerable inequalities in this respect, because the number of aliens in some States is very large, and growing larger now, when emigrants reach our shores at the rate of more than a State a year\"). And Hamilton Ward, also quoted by the majority,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1128, was primarily disturbed by \"[t]he fact that one South Carolinian, whose hands are red with the blood of fallen patriots, and whose skirts are reeking with the odors of Columbia and Andersonville, will have a voice as potential in these Halls as two and a half Vermont soldiers who have come back from the grandest battle-fields in history maimed and scarred in the contest with South Carolina traitors in their efforts to destroy this Government\"-and only secondarily worried about the prospect of \"taxation without representation.\" Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 434.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Even Jacob Howard, he of the \"theory of the Constitution\" language,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1128 - 1129, bemoaned the fact that basing representation on total population would allow southern States \"to obtain an advantage which they did not possess before the rebellion and emancipation.\" Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2766. \"I object to this. I think they cannot very consistently call upon us to grant them an additional number of Representatives simply because in consequence of their own misconduct they have lost the property [meaning slaves, whom slaveholders considered to be property] which they once possessed, and which served as a basis in great part of their representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The list could go on. The bottom line is that in the leadup to the Fourteenth Amendment, claims about representational equality were invoked, if at all, only in service of the\n   <em>\n    real\n   </em>\n   goal: preventing southern States from acquiring too much power in the National Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   After much debate, Congress eventually settled on the compromise that now appears in \u00a7 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under that provision, House seats are apportioned based on total population, but if a State wrongfully denies the right to vote to a certain percentage of its population, its representation is supposed to be reduced proportionally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Enforcement of this remedy, however, is dependent on action by Congress, and-regrettably-the\n   remedy was never used during the long period when voting rights were widely abridged. Amar 399.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In light of the history of Article I, \u00a7 2, of the original Constitution and \u00a7 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is clear that the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based in substantial part on the distribution of political power among the States and not merely on some theory regarding the proper nature of representation. It is impossible to draw any clear constitutional command from this complex history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   For these reasons, I would hold only that Texas permissibly used total population in drawing the challenged legislative districts. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Like Alexander Hamilton, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1127, n. 9, the Fourteenth Amendment's Framers doubtless made arguments rooted in practical political realities as well as in principle. That politics played a part, however, does not warrant rejecting principled argument. In any event, motivations aside, the Framers' ultimate choice of total population rather than voter population is surely relevant to whether, as appellants now argue, the Equal Protection Clause\n    <em>\n     mandates\n    </em>\n    use of voter population rather than total population.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Appellants also observe that standing in one-person, one-vote cases has rested on plaintiffs' status as voters whose votes were diluted.
