A person who violates that restriction can be sentenced to prison for up to 10 years. \u00a7 924(a)(2). For some felons, however, the Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a much more severe penalty. Under the Act, a person who possesses a firearm after three or more convictions for a \"serious drug offense\" or a \"violent felony\" is subject to a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of life in prison. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Because the ordinary maximum sentence for a felon in possession of a firearm is 10 years, while the minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act is 15 years, a person sentenced under the Act will receive a prison term at least five years longer than the law otherwise would allow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Act defines \"violent felony\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Subsection (i) of this definition is known as the elements clause.

Welch pleaded guilty in 2010 to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The Probation Office prepared a presentence report finding that Welch had three prior violent felony convictions, including a Florida conviction for a February 1996 \"strong-arm robbery.\" The relevant Florida statute prohibits taking property from the person or custody of another with \"the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.13\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (1994). The charging document from the 1996 Florida case tracked that statutory language. App. 187a. The 2010 federal presentence report provides more detail. It states that, according to the robbery victim, Welch punched the victim in the mouth and grabbed a gold bracelet from his wrist while another attacker grabbed a gold chain from his neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Welch objected to the presentence report, arguing (as relevant here) that this conviction was not a violent felony conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act. The District Court overruled the objection. It concluded that the Florida offense of strong-arm robbery qualified as a violent felony both under the elements clause,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i), and the residual clause, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The District Court proceeded to sentence Welch to the Act's mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. That court did not decide whether the conviction at issue could qualify as a violent felony under the elements clause. Instead, it held only that the conviction qualified under the residual clause. This Court denied certiorari, see\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States,\n   </em>\n   568 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20S.%20Ct.%20913\">\n    133 S.Ct. 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20702\">\n    184 L.Ed.2d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), and Welch's conviction became final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In December 2013, Welch appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   before the District Court and filed a collateral challenge to his conviction and sentence through a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He argued, among other points, that his strong-arm robbery conviction itself was \"vague\" and that his counsel was ineffective for allowing him to be sentenced as an armed career criminal. The District Court denied the motion and denied a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Still proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   Welch applied to the Court of Appeals for a certificate of appealability. His application noted that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was pending before this Court. Welch argued, in part, that his \"armed career offender status is unconstitutional and violate[s] [his] Fifth Amendment right to notice of the state priors.\" App. 20a. Two months later, Welch filed a motion asking the Court of Appeals to hold his case in abeyance until\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   could be decided, \"based on the fact he was sentenced under the [residual clause].\" App. 15a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In June 2015, the Court of Appeals entered a brief single-judge order denying the motion for a certificate of appealability. Less than three weeks later, this Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   holding, as already noted, that the residual clause is void for vagueness. Welch filed a motion asking the Court of Appeals for additional time to seek reconsideration of its decision in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   but the court returned that motion unfiled because Welch's time to seek reconsideration already had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Welch then filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for certiorari. His petition presented two questions: whether the District Court erred in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion because his Florida robbery conviction does not qualify as a violent felony conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act; and whether\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   announced a substantive rule that has retroactive effect in cases on collateral review.

The narrow question here is whether the Court of Appeals erred in making that determination. That narrow question, however, implicates a broader legal issue: whether\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is a substantive decision with retroactive effect in cases (like Welch's) on collateral review. If so, then on the present record reasonable jurists could at least debate whether Welch should obtain relief in his collateral challenge to his sentence.

The\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   framework creates a balance between, first, the need for finality in criminal cases, and second, the countervailing imperative to ensure that criminal punishment is imposed only when authorized by law. That balance turns on the function of the rule at issue, not the constitutional guarantee from which the rule derives. If a new rule regulates only the procedures for determining culpability, the\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   balance generally tips in favor of finality. The chance of a more accurate outcome under the new procedure normally does not justify the cost of vacating a conviction whose only flaw is that its procedures \"conformed to then-existing constitutional standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Teague, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 310,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The majority ignores an insuperable procedural obstacle: when, as here, a court fails to rule on a claim not presented in a prisoner's \u00a7 2255 motion, there is no error for us to reverse.

This case arises from petitioner Gregory Welch's challenge to the Eleventh Circuit's denial of a certificate of appealability. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). In other words, Welch asks the Court to review the Eleventh Circuit's refusal to allow him to appeal the claims he raised in a motion to vacate his sentence and lost in the District Court. But Welch never claimed that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague in his \u00a7 2255 motion, let alone that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively. Accordingly, courts below addressed neither issue. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was not even decided when the courts below issued their rulings. Those deficiencies should preclude us from deciding in this case whether\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is retroactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Our role in reviewing the denial of a certificate of appealability is far more circumscribed than normal appellate review.

Defendants can appeal their convictions and sentences as a matter of right on direct review, but \u00a7 2253 deprives courts of appeals of jurisdiction to review the denial of a petitioner's motion for federal postconviction relief unless he obtains a \"certificate of appealability.\" \u00a7 2253(c)(1).

But such outcomes are an inevitable byproduct of the Court's retroactivity jurisprudence, not a unique consequence of this case. Take a statute allowing the Federal Government to prosecute defendants for \"serious crimes involving interstate commerce\" of which they were acquitted in state court. See\n   <em>\n    Bartkus v. Illinois,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163001\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/121/\">\n    359 U.S. 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163001\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/121/\">\n    79 S.Ct. 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163001\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/121/\">\n    3 L.Ed.2d 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959) (no double jeopardy bar to such prosecutions). Suppose the Court, concerned that there might be a double jeopardy problem after all, narrowed the meaning of \"serious crimes involving interstate commerce\" to encompass only felonies that would be subject to a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Anyone acquitted of a minor felony by the State but convicted by the Federal Government before this Court's narrowing construction could, in the majority's view, seek relief on collateral review under\n   <em>\n    Bousley\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1268. But if the Court ruled that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   federal reprosecutions, I doubt that rule would be retroactive.

The Court in the 1950's \"extend[ed] the scope of habeas to all alleged constitutional errors\" to \"forc[e] trial and appellate courts in both the federal and state system to toe the constitutional mark\" in the face of perceived systemic violations.\n   <em>\n    Mackey v.

That development led to the\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   framework allowing retroactivity for certain types of constitutional rules. See\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

But this Court has\n   never suggested that lower courts had similar difficulties in interpreting the reach of criminal statutes, such that the retroactivity rules should be the same. Rather, the history suggests that the failure to apply a narrowing construction of a criminal statute is a qualitatively different type of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The majority instead determines whether a rule is substantive by looking to the \"function of the rule,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1265, and asking \"whether the new rule itself has a procedural function or a substantive function,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1266. This apparently means that courts should divine the\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   of a new rule and decide whether that effect alters the substantive elements of a crime or sentence. All that matters, the majority says, is that the vagueness rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   had the\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   of invalidating the residual clause and, as a result of its invalidation, the residual clause \"can no longer mandate or authorize any sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1265 (\"striking down the residual clause\" is what \"changed the substantive reach of [ACCA]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   That approach is untenable.

But if, as the majority contends, the \"function of the rule,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1265, is the relevant baseline, then\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   case invalidating a statute or a sentence establishes a \"new\" rule. The law's invalidation would be a departure from any prior decision that interpreted the law as if it were operative. Likewise, if any decision has the effect of invalidating substantive provisions of a criminal statute, it is a substantive rule under the majority's approach no matter what the reason for the statute's invalidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The majority denies that \"every decision striking down a statute is\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   a substantive decision,\" saying that only when a decision invalidates a provision that \"regulates conduct and prescribes punishment\" is it retroactive.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1268. But that still transforms innumerable\n   procedural rules into substantive ones. Take a state law that defines the crime of robbery and specifies that only 10 of the 12 jurors need to vote to convict someone of that crime. If this Court were to reverse\n   <em>\n    Apodaca v.

But assume that the state statute was nonseverable: the Court's jury unanimity rule, undoubtedly \"procedural,\" would have the effect of invalidating not only the portion of the state statute regarding unanimity but also the provision defining the crime of robbery, a provision that \"regulates conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1268. To the majority, these effects would make the rule substantive. That approach is mistaken, and would also produce arbitrary results.
