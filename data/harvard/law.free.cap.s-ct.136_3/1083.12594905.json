See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those assets include: (1) property \"obtained as a result of\" the crime, (2) property \"traceable\" to the crime, and (3) other \"property of equivalent value.\" \u00a7 1345(a)(2). In this case, the Government has obtained a court order that freezes assets belonging to the third category of property, namely, property that is untainted by the crime, and that belongs fully to the defendant. That order, the defendant says, prevents her from paying her lawyer. She claims that insofar as it does so, it violates her Sixth Amendment \"right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for [her] defence.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2012, a federal grand jury charged the petitioner, Sila Luis, with paying kickbacks, conspiring to commit fraud, and engaging in other crimes all related to health care. See \u00a7 1349; \u00a7 371; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A). The Government claimed that Luis had fraudulently obtained close to $45 million, almost all of which she had already spent. Believing it would convict Luis of the crimes charged, and hoping to preserve the $2 million remaining\n   in Luis' possession for payment of restitution and other criminal penalties (often referred to as criminal forfeitures, which can include innocent-not just tainted-assets, a point of critical importance here), the Government sought a pretrial order prohibiting Luis from dissipating her assets. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). And the District Court ultimately issued an order prohibiting her from \"dissipating, or otherwise disposing of ... assets, real or personal ... up to the equivalent value of the proceeds of the Federal health care fraud ($45 million).\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government and Luis agree that this court order will prevent Luis from using her own untainted funds,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   funds not connected with the crime, to hire counsel to defend her in her criminal case. See App. 161 (stipulating \"that an unquantified amount of revenue not connected to the indictment [had] flowed into some of the accounts\" subject to the restraining order);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (similarly stipulating that Luis used \"revenue not connected to the indictment\" to pay for real property that she possessed).

And that distinction makes a difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The relevant difference consists of the fact that the property here is untainted;\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   it belongs to the defendant, pure and simple.

The Government may well be able to freeze, perhaps to seize, assets of the latter, \"tainted\" kind before trial. As a matter of property law the defendant's ownership interest is imperfect. The robber's loot belongs to the victim, not to the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    Telegraph Co. v.

In other words, he believes that those cases stand for the proposition that property-whether tainted or untainted-is subject to pretrial restraint, so long as the property might someday be subject to forfeiture.

For one thing, as discussed,\n   <em>\n    Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   involved the restraint only of tainted assets, and thus we had no occasion to opine in those cases about the constitutionality of pretrial restraints of other, untainted assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For another thing, Justice KENNEDY's broad rule ignores the statutory background against which\n   <em>\n    Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   were decided. The Court in those cases referenced \u00a7 853(c) more than a dozen times.

We see this too in \u00a7 853(e)(1)(B), which requires the Government-in certain circumstances-to give \"notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for hearing\" before obtaining a restraining order against such property. We see this in \u00a7 853(c), which allows \"bona fide purchaser[s] for value\" to keep property that would otherwise be subject to forfeiture. And we see this in \u00a7 853(n)(6)(A), which exempts certain property from forfeiture when a third party can show a vested interest in the property that is \"superior\" to that of the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The distinction that we have discussed is thus an important one, not a technicality.

Cheuvronts,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3425576\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill/240/486/#p491\">\n    240 Ill. 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20N.E.%201011\">\n    88 N.E. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012 (1909) (\"[E]quity w[ill] interfere ... only when it is made to appear that the contingency ... is reasonably certain to happen, and the waste is ... wanton and conscienceless\"). The Government here seeks a somewhat analogous order,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   an order that will preserve Luis' untainted assets so that they will be available to cover the costs of forfeiture and restitution if she is convicted, and if the court later determines that her tainted assets are insufficient or otherwise unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government finds statutory authority for its request in language authorizing a court to enjoin a criminal defendant from, for example, disposing of innocent \"property of equivalent value\" to that of tainted property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i). But Luis needs some portion of those same funds to pay for the lawyer of her choice. Thus, the legal conflict arises. And, in our view, insofar as innocent (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   untainted) funds are needed to obtain counsel of choice, we believe that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the court order that the Government seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Three basic considerations lead us to this conclusion. First, the nature of the competing interests argues against this kind of court order. On the one side we find, as we have previously explained,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1088 - 1090, a Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel that is a fundamental constituent of due process of law, see\n   <em>\n    Powell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n    287 U.S., at 68-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n    53 S.Ct. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And that right includes \"the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire.\"\n   <em>\n    Caplin &amp; Drysdale,\n   </em>\n   491 U.S., at 624,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The order at issue in this case would seriously undermine that constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On the other side we find interests that include the Government's contingent interest in securing its punishment of choice (namely, criminal forfeiture) as well as the victims' interest in securing restitution (notably, from funds belonging to the defendant, not the victims). While these interests are important, to deny the Government the order it requests will not inevitably undermine them, for, at least sometimes, the defendant may possess other assets-say, \"tainted\" property-that might be used for forfeitures and restitution. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Lopez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500367\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\">\n    548 U.S., at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500367\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Deprivation of the right\" to counsel of the defendant's choice \"is 'complete' when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants\"). Nor do the interests in obtaining payment of a criminal forfeiture or restitution order enjoy constitutional protection. Rather, despite their importance, compared to the right to counsel of choice, these interests would seem to lie somewhat further from the heart of a fair, effective criminal justice system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, relevant legal tradition offers virtually no significant support for the Government's position. Rather, tradition\n   argues to the contrary. Describing the 18th-century English legal world (which recognized only a limited right to counsel), Blackstone wrote that \"only\" those \"goods and chattels\" that \"a man has\n   <em>\n    at the time of conviction\n   </em>\n   shall be forfeited.\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 388 (1765) (emphasis added); see 1 J. Chitty, Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 737 (1816) (\"[T]he party indicted may sell any of [his property] ... to assist him in preparing for his defense on the trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Describing the common law as understood in 19th-century America (which recognized a broader right to counsel), Justice Story wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"It is well known, that at the common law, in many cases of felonies, the party forfeited his goods and chattels to the crown. The forfeiture ... was a part, or at least a consequence, of the judgment of conviction. It is plain from this statement, that no right to the goods and chattels of the felon could be acquired by the crown by the mere commission of the offense; but the right attached only by the conviction of the offender.... In the contemplation of the common law, the offender's right was not divested until the conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    The Palmyra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429834\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/25/1/#p14\">\n    12 Wheat. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429834\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/25/1/#p14\">\n    6 L.Ed. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1827).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   See generally\n   <em>\n    Powell,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n    at 60-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n    53 S.Ct. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the scope of the right to counsel in 18th-century Britain and colonial America).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As we have explained,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1090 - 1092, cases such as\n   <em>\n    Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   permit the Government to freeze a defendant's assets pretrial, but the opinions in those cases highlight the fact that the property at issue was \"tainted,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   it did not belong entirely to the defendant. We have found no decision of this Court authorizing unfettered, pretrial forfeiture of the defendant's own \"innocent\" property-property with no connection to the charged crime. Nor do we see any grounds for distinguishing the historic preference against preconviction\n   <em>\n    forfeitures\n   </em>\n   from the preconviction\n   <em>\n    restraint\n   </em>\n   at issue here. As far as Luis' Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is concerned, a restraining order might as well be a forfeiture; that is, the restraint itself suffices to completely deny this constitutional right. See\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Lopez,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500367\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500367\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\">\n    at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500367\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Third, as a practical matter, to accept the Government's position could well erode the right to counsel to a considerably greater extent than we have so far indicated. To permit the Government to freeze Luis' untainted assets would unleash a principle of constitutional law that would have no obvious stopping place. The statutory provision before us authorizing the present restraining order refers only to \"banking law violation[s]\" and \"Federal health care offense[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). But, in the Government's view, Congress could write more statutes authorizing pretrial restraints in cases involving other illegal behavior-after all, a broad range of such behavior can lead to postconviction forfeiture of untainted assets. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1963(m) (providing for forfeiture of innocent, substitute assets for any violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, the financial consequences of a criminal conviction are steep. Even beyond the forfeiture itself, criminal fines can be high, and restitution orders expensive. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1344 ($1 million fine for bank fraud); \u00a7 3571 (mail and wire fraud fines of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

How are defendants whose innocent assets are frozen in cases like these supposed to pay for a lawyer-particularly if they lack \"tainted assets\" because they are innocent, a class of defendants whom the right to counsel certainly seeks to protect? See\n   <em>\n    Powell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n    287 U.S., at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n    53 S.Ct. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Amar, 84 Geo. L.

As the Department of Justice explains, only 27 percent of county-based public defender offices have sufficient attorneys to meet nationally recommended caseload standards. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, D. Farole &amp; L. Langton, Census of Public Defender Offices, 2007: County-based and Local Public Defender Offices, 2007, p. 10 (Sept. 2010). And as one\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   points out, \"[m]any federal public defender organizations and lawyers appointed under the Criminal Justice Act serve numerous clients and have only limited resources.\" Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers 11. The upshot is a substantial risk that accepting the Government's views would-by increasing the government-paid-defender workload-render less effective the basic right the Sixth Amendment seeks to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We add that the constitutional line we have drawn should prove workable. That line distinguishes between a criminal defendant's (1) tainted funds and (2) innocent funds needed to pay for counsel. We concede, as Justice KENNEDY points out,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1108 - 1110, that money is fungible; and sometimes it will be difficult to say whether a particular bank account contains tainted or untainted funds. But the law has tracing rules that help courts implement the kind of distinction we require in this case. With the help of those rules, the victim of a robbery, for example, will likely obtain the car that the robber used stolen money to buy. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   1 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution \u00a7 2.14, p. 175 (1978) (\"tracing\" permits a claim against \"an asset which is traceable to or the product of\" tainted funds); 4 A. Scott, Law of Trusts \u00a7 518, pp. 3309-3314 (1956) (describing the tracing rules governing commingled accounts). And those rules will likely also prevent Luis from benefiting from many of the money transfers and purchases Justice KENNEDY describes. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1108 - 1109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Courts use tracing rules in cases involving fraud, pension rights, bankruptcy, trusts, etc. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montanile v. Board of Trustees of Nat. Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan,\n   </em>\n   577 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264,12601263\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659-660,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601264\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/12601264/\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

And, constitutional rights necessarily protect the prerequisites for their exercise.

Otherwise the right to counsel-originally understood to protect only the right to hire counsel of choice-would be meaningless. History confirms this textual understanding. The common law limited pretrial asset restraints to tainted assets. Both this textual understanding and history establish that the Sixth Amendment prevents the Government from freezing untainted assets in order to secure a potential forfeiture. The freeze here accordingly violates the Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Sixth Amendment provides, \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" As originally understood, this right guaranteed a defendant the right \"to employ a lawyer to assist in his defense.\"\n    <em>\n     Scott v.

The law has long recognized that the \"[a]uthorization of an act also authorizes a necessary predicate act.\" A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 192 (2012) (discussing the \"predicate-act canon\"). As Thomas Cooley put it with respect to Government powers, \"where a general power is conferred or duty enjoined, every particular power necessary for the exercise of the one, or the performance of the other, is also conferred.\" Constitutional Limitations 63 (1868); see 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 464 (13th ed. 1884) (\"[W]henever a power is given by a statute, everything necessary to the making of it effectual or requisite to attain the end is implied\"). This logic equally applies to individual rights. After all, many rights are powers reserved to the People rather than delegated to the Government. Cf. U.S. Const., Amdt. 10 (\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Constitutional rights thus implicitly protect those closely related acts necessary to their exercise. \"There comes a point ... at which the regulation of action intimately and unavoidably connected with [a right] is a regulation of [the right] itself.\"\n    <em>\n     Hill v.

At English common law, forfeiture of all real and personal property was a standard punishment for felonies. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 95 (1769) (Blackstone). That harsh penalty never caught on in America. See\n    <em>\n     Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84684\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/663/#p682\">\n     416 U.S. 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 682-683,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84684\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/663/#p682\">\n     94 S.Ct. 2080\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84684\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/663/#p682\">\n     40 L.Ed.2d 452\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1974).

But the Constitution did not. See Art. III, \u00a7 3, cl. 2 (\"[N]o Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted\"). If the Government's mere expectancy of a total forfeiture upon conviction were sufficient to justify a complete pretrial asset freeze, then Congress could render the right to counsel a ity in felony cases. That would have shocked the Framers. As discussed, before adoption of the Sixth Amendment, felony cases (not misdemeanors) were\n    <em>\n     precisely\n    </em>\n    when the common law denied defendants the right to counsel. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1097. With an unlimited power to freeze assets before trial, the Government could well revive the common-law felony rule that the Sixth Amendment was designed to abolish.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The modern, judicially created right to Government-appointed counsel does not obviate these concerns. As understood in 1791, the Sixth Amendment protected a defendant's right to retain an attorney he could afford. It is thus no answer, as the principal dissent replies, that defendants rendered indigent by a pretrial asset freeze can resort to public defenders.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1110 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). The dissent's approach ifies the\n    <em>\n     original understanding\n    </em>\n    of the right to counsel. To ensure that the right to counsel has meaning, the Sixth Amendment limits the assets the Government may freeze before trial to secure eventual forfeiture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The longstanding rule against restraining a criminal defendant's untainted property before conviction guarantees a meaningful right to counsel. The common-law forfeiture tradition provides the limits of this Sixth Amendment guarantee. That tradition draws a clear line between tainted and untainted assets.

Even so, nothing suggests trial and judgment were expendable. See\n    <em>\n     Miller, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 304-305 (stating in dicta that confiscating Confederate property through\n    <em>\n     in rem\n    </em>\n    proceedings would have raised Fifth and Sixth Amendment concerns had they not been a war measure).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The common law thus offers an administrable line: A criminal defendant's untainted assets are protected from Government interference before trial and judgment. His tainted assets, by contrast, may be seized before trial as contraband or through a separate\n    <em>\n     in rem\n    </em>\n    proceeding. Reading the Sixth Amendment to track the historical line between tainted and untainted assets makes good sense. It avoids case-by-case adjudication, and ensures that the original meaning of the right to counsel does real work. The asset freeze here infringes the right to counsel because it \"is so broad that it differs not only in degree, but in kind, from its historical antecedents.\"\n    <em>\n     James Daniel Good, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 82,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230623\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/43/#p57\">\n     114 S.Ct. 492\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The dissenters object that, before trial, a defendant has an identical property interest in tainted and untainted assets. See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1106 - 1107 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.);\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1112 - 1113 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). Perhaps so. I need not take a position on the matter. Either way, that fact is irrelevant. Because the pretrial asset freeze here crosses into untainted assets, for which there is no historical tradition, it is unconstitutional. Any such incursion violates the Sixth Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Since the asset freeze here violates the Sixth Amendment, the plurality correctly concludes that the judgment below must be reversed. But I cannot go further and endorse the plurality's atextual balancing analysis. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel of choice. As discussed, a pretrial freeze of untainted assets infringes that right. This conclusion leaves no room for balancing. Moreover, I have no idea whether, \"compared to the right to counsel of choice,\" the Government's interests in securing forfeiture and restitution lie \"further from the heart of a fair, effective criminal justice system.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1093. Judges are not well suited to strike the right \"balance\" between those incommensurable interests. Nor do I think it is our role to do so. The People, through ratification, have already weighed the policy tradeoffs that constitutional rights entail. See\n    <em>\n     Heller,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p617\">\n     554 U.S., at 634-635\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p617\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Those tradeoffs are thus not for us to reevaluate. \"The very enumeration of the right\" to counsel of choice denies us \"the power to decide ... whether the right is\n    <em>\n     really worth\n    </em>\n    insisting upon.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p617\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p617\">\n     at 634\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p617\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The state court in\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    denied the defendants such an opportunity, the Court held, by moving to trial so quickly (six days after indictment) that the defendants had no chance to communicate with family or otherwise arrange for representation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The schedule in\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    was not designed to block counsel, which suggests the usual incidental-burden rule might be inapt in the Sixth Amendment context. I leave the question open because this case does not require an answer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The asset freeze here is not merely an incidental burden on the right to counsel of choice; it targets a defendant's assets, which are necessary to exercise that right, simply to secure forfeiture upon conviction. The prospect of that criminal punishment, however, is precisely why the Constitution guarantees a right to counsel. The Sixth Amendment does not permit the Government's bare expectancy of forfeiture to void that right. When the potential of a conviction is the only basis for interfering with a defendant's assets before trial, the Constitution requires the Government to respect the longstanding common-law protection\n    for a defendant's untainted property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice ALITO joins, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The plurality and Justice THOMAS find in the Sixth Amendment a right of criminal defendants to pay for an attorney with funds that are forfeitable upon conviction so long as those funds are not derived from the crime alleged. That unprecedented holding rewards criminals who hurry to spend, conceal, or launder stolen property by assuring them that they may use their own funds to pay for an attorney after they have dissipated the proceeds of their crime. It matters not, under today's ruling, that the defendant's remaining assets must be preserved if the victim or the Government is to recover for the property wrongfully taken. By granting a defendant a constitutional right to hire an attorney with assets needed to make a property-crime victim whole, the plurality and Justice THOMAS ignore this Court's precedents and distort the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The result reached today makes little sense in cases that involve fungible assets preceded by fraud, embezzlement, or other theft. An example illustrates the point. Assume a thief steals $1 million and then wins another $1 million in a lottery. After putting the sums in separate accounts, he or she spends $1 million. If the thief spends his or her lottery winnings, the Government can restrain the stolen funds in their entirety. The thief has no right to use those funds to pay for an attorney. Yet if the thief heeds today's decision, he or she will spend the stolen money first; for if the thief is apprehended, the $1 million won in the lottery can be used for an attorney. This result is not required by the Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The plurality reaches its conclusion by weighing a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice against the Government's interest in preventing the dissipation of assets forfeitable upon conviction. In so doing, it-like Justice THOMAS-sweeps aside the decisions in\n    <em>\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v.

The principle the Court adopted in those cases applies with equal force here. Rather than apply that principle, however, the plurality and concurrence adopt a rule found nowhere in the Constitution or this Court's precedents-that the Sixth Amendment protects a person's right to spend otherwise forfeitable assets on an attorney so long as those assets are not related to or the direct proceeds of the charged crime.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1087 (plurality opinion);\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1096 - 1097 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).

The Government alleges that, as part of her illegal scheme, Luis used her health care companies to defraud Medicare by billing for services that were not medically necessary or actually provided. The charged crimes, the Government maintains, resulted in the payment of $45 million in improper Medicare benefits to Luis' companies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The same day Luis was indicted, the Government initiated a civil action under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    to restrain Luis' assets before her criminal trial, including substitute property of an amount equivalent to the value of the proceeds of her alleged crimes. To establish its entitlement to a restraining order, the Government showed that Luis and her co-conspirators were dissipating the illegally obtained assets. In particular, they were transferring money involved in the scheme to various individuals and entities, including shell corporations owned by Luis' family members. As part of this process, Luis opened and closed well over 40 bank accounts and withdrew large amounts of cash to hide the conspiracy's proceeds. Luis personally received almost $4.5 million in funds and used at least some of that money to purchase luxury items, real estate, and automobiles, and to travel. Based on this and other evidence, the District Court entered an order prohibiting Luis from spending up to $45 million of her assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Before the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Luis argued that the Sixth Amendment required that she be allowed to spend the restrained substitute assets on an attorney. The Court of Appeals disagreed, concluding that \"[t]he arguments made by Luis ... are foreclosed by the United States Supreme Court decisions in ...\n    <em>\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n    </em>\n    [and]\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=564%20Fed.%20Appx.%20493\">\n     564 Fed.Appx. 493\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 494 (2014) (\n    <em>\n     per curiam\n    </em>\n    ).

As Blackstone noted with emphasis, \"goods and chattels are forfeited by\n    <em>\n     conviction\n    </em>\n    .\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 380 (1769) (Blackstone). Justice Story likewise observed that \"no right to the goods and chattels of the felon could be acquired by the crown by the mere commission of the offence; but the right attached only by the conviction of the offender.\"\n    <em>\n     The Palmyra,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429834\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/25/1/#p14\">\n     12 Wheat. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 14,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429834\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/25/1/#p14\">\n     6 L.Ed. 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1827) ;\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1429834\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/25/1/#p14\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"In the contemplation of the common law, the offender's right was not devested until the conviction\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    These authorities demonstrate that\n    <em>\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    cannot be distinguished based on \"the nature of the assets at issue.\" Title to the assets in those cases did not pass from the defendant to the Government until conviction. As a result, the assets restrained before conviction in\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    were on the same footing as the assets restrained here: There was probable cause to believe that the assets would belong to the Government upon conviction.

The doctrine's purpose is to prevent defendants from avoiding forfeiture by transferring their property to third parties. The doctrine, however, does not alter the time at which title to forfeitable property passes to the Government.

The\n    <em>\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n    </em>\n    Court did not do so, however, to suggest that forfeitable assets can be restrained only when the assets are tainted. Rather, the Court referred to the provision to rebut the law firm's argument that the United States has less of an interest in forfeitable property than robbery victims have in their stolen property. 491 U.S., at 627-628,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2646\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . More to the point, central to the Court's decision was its observation that, because the Government obtained \"title to [the defendant's] assets upon conviction,\" it would be \"peculiar\" to hold that the Sixth Amendment still gave the defendant the right to pay his attorney with those assets.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n     at 628\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2646\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    reinforced that view, holding that the pretrial restraint of assets-money to which the Government does not yet have title-is permissible even when the defendant wants to use those assets to pay for counsel. 491 U.S., at 616,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217495\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/600/#p616\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2657\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    True, the assets in\n    <em>\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    happened to be derived from the criminal activity alleged; but the Court's reasoning in those cases was based on the Government's entitlement to recoup money from criminals who have profited from their crimes, not on tracing or identifying the actual assets connected to the crime. For this reason, the principle the Court announced in those cases applies whenever the Government obtains (or will obtain) title to assets upon conviction. Nothing in either case depended on the assets being tainted or justifies refusing to apply the rule from those cases here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The plurality makes much of various statutory provisions that, in its view, give the United States a superior interest before trial in tainted assets but not untainted ones. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1091 - 1092. That view, however, turns not on any reasoning specific to the Sixth Amendment but rather on Congress' differential treatment of tainted versus untainted assets. The plurality makes no attempt to explain why Congress' decision in \u00a7 1345 to permit the pretrial restraint of substitute assets is not also relevant to its analysis. More to the point, Congress' statutory treatment of property is irrelevant to a Sixth Amendment analysis. The protections afforded by the Sixth Amendment should not turn on congressional whims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The plurality's concern over the implications of the Government's position appears animated by a hypothetical future case where a defendant's assets are restrained not to return stolen funds but, for example, to pay a fine. That case, however, is not the case before the Court. Section 1345 authorizes pretrial restraints to preserve substitute assets, not to provide for fines greater than the amounts stolen. The holdings in\n    <em>\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Monsanto,\n    </em>\n    and what should be the holding today, thus, do not address the result in a case involving a fine. The governmental interests at stake when a fine is at issue are quite separate and distinct from the interests implicated here. This case implicates the Government's interest in preventing the dissipation, transfer, and concealment of stolen funds, as well as its interest in preserving for victims any funds that remain. Those interests justify, in cases like this one, the pretrial restraint of substitute assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The principle the plurality and Justice THOMAS announce today-that a defendant has a right to pay for an attorney with forfeitable assets so long as those assets are not related to or the direct proceeds of the crime alleged-has far-reaching implications. There is no clear explanation why this principle does not extend to the exercise of other constitutional rights. \"If defendants have a right to spend forfeitable assets on attorney's fees, why not on exercises of the right to speak, practice one's religion, or travel?\"\n    <em>\n     Caplin\n    </em>\n    &amp;\n    <em>\n     Drysdale,\n    </em>\n    491 U.S., at 628,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2646\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nor does either opinion provide any way to distinguish between the restraint at issue here and other governmental interferences with a defendant's assets. If the restraint of Luis' assets violates the Sixth Amendment, could the same be said of any imposition on a criminal defendant's assets? Cf.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n     at 631\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2646\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[S]eizures of assets to secure potential tax liabilities ... may impair a defendant's ability to retain counsel ...

No explanation is provided for what, if any, limits there are on the invented exemption for attorney's fees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The result today also creates arbitrary distinctions between defendants. Money, after all, is fungible. There is no difference between a defendant who has preserved his or her own assets by spending stolen money and a defendant who has spent his or her own assets and preserved stolen cash instead.

In declarations relied on by the District Court, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent investigating the case explained that \"Luis transferred monies or caused the transfer of monies received from Medicare to ... family members and companies owned by family members,\" including $1,471,000 to her husband, and over a million dollars to her children and former daughter-in-law. App. 72-73. She also \"used Medicare monies for foreign travel,\" including approximately 31 trips to Mexico, \"where she owns several properties and has numerous bank accounts.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 73. She \"transferred Medicare monies overseas through international wire transfers to Mexico.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    And the Government was \"able to trace Medicare proceeds going into [all but one of the] bank account[s] owned by Defendant Luis and/or her companies listed in the Court's\" temporary restraining order.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 74.

They allow Luis to bankroll her private attorneys as well as \"the best and most industrious investigators, experts, paralegals, and law clerks\" money can buy-a legal defense team Luis claims she cannot otherwise afford. See Corrected Motion to Modify the Restraining Order in No. 12-Civ-23588, p. 13 (SD Fla., Nov. 16, 2012).

As a result of the District Court's order, Luis simply cannot afford the legal team she desires unless they are willing to represent her without advance payment. For Sixth Amendment purposes, the only question here is whether Luis' right to adequate representation is protected. That question is not before the Court. Neither Luis nor the plurality nor Justice THOMAS suggests that Luis will receive inadequate representation if she is not able to use the restrained funds. And this is for good reason. Given the large volume of defendants in the criminal justice system who rely on public representation, it would be troubling to suggest that a defendant who might be represented by a public defender will receive inadequate representation. See generally T. Giovanni &amp; R. Patel,\n    <em>\n     Gideon\n    </em>\n    at 50: Three Reforms to Revive the Right to Counsel 1 (2013), online at http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Gideon_Report_040913.pdf (as last visited Mar. 28, 2016). Since Luis cannot afford the legal team she desires, and because there is no indication that she will receive inadequate representation as a result, she does not have a cognizable Sixth Amendment complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The plurality does warn that accepting the Government's position \"would-by increasing the government-paid-defender workload-render less effective the basic right the Sixth Amendment seeks to protect.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1095. Public-defender offices, the plurality suggests, already lack sufficient attorneys to meet nationally recommended caseload standards.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But concerns about the caseloads of public-defender offices do not justify a constitutional command to treat a defendant accused of committing a lucrative crime differently than a defendant who is indigent from the outset. The Constitution does not require victims of property crimes to fund subsidies for members of the private defense bar.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Because the rule announced today is anchored in the Sixth Amendment, moreover, it will frustrate not only the Federal Government's use of \u00a7 1345 but also the States' administration of their forfeiture schemes. Like the Federal Government, States also face criminals who engage in money laundering through extensive enterprises that extend to other States and beyond. Where a defendant has put stolen money beyond a State's reach, a State should not be precluded from freezing the assets the defendant has in hand. The obstacle that now stands in the States' way is not found in the Constitution. It is of the Court's making.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Finally, the plurality posits that its decision \"should prove workable\" because courts \"have experience separating tainted assets from untainted assets, just as they have experience determining how much money is needed to cover the costs of a lawyer.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1095. Neither of these assurances is adequate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    As to the first, the plurality cites a number of sources for the proposition that courts have rules that allow them to implement the distinction it adopts.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Those rules, however, demonstrate the illogic of the conclusion that there is a meaningful difference between the actual dollars stolen and the dollars of equivalent value in a defendant's bank account. The plurality appears to agree that, if a defendant is indicted for stealing $1 million, the Government can obtain an order preventing the defendant from spending the $1 million he or she is believed to have stolen. The situation gets more complicated, however,\n    when the defendant deposits the stolen $1 million into an account that already has $1 million. If the defendant then spends $1 million from the account, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the money spent was stolen money rather than money the defendant already had. The question arises, then, whether the Government can restrain the remaining million.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    One of the treatises on which the plurality relies answers that question. The opinion cites A. Scott's Law of Trusts to support the claim that \"the law has tracing rules that help courts implement the kind of distinction ... require[d] in this case.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1095. The treatise says that, if a \"wrongdoer has mingled misappropriated money with his own money and later makes withdrawals from the mingled fund,\" assuming the withdrawals do not result in a zero balance, a person who has an interest in the misappropriated money can recover it from the amount remaining in the account. 4 A. Scott, Law of Trusts \u00a7 518, pp. 3309-3310 (1956). Based on this rule, one would expect the plurality to agree that, in the above hypothetical, the Government could restrain up to the full amount of the stolen funds-that is, the full $1 million-without having to establish whether the $1 million the defendant spent was stolen money or not. If that is so, it is hard to see why its opinion treats as different a situation where the defendant has two bank accounts-one with the $1 million from before the crime and one with the stolen $1 million. If the defendant spends the money in the latter account, the Government should be allowed to freeze the money in the former account in the same way it could if the defendant spent the money out of a single, commingled account. The Sixth Amendment provides no justification for the decision to mandate different treatment in these all-but-identical situations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The plurality sees \"little reason to worry\" about defendants circumventing forfeiture because courts can use rules like the tracing rule discussed above.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1095 - 1096. It also asserts that these rules \"will likely ... prevent Luis from benefiting from many of [her] money transfers and purchases.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    That proposition is doubtful where, as here, \"a lot of money was taken out in cash from the defendant's bank accounts\" because \"[y]ou can't trace cash.\" App. 155. Even were that not the case, this assertion fails to appreciate that it takes time to trace tainted assets. As the FBI agent testified, at the time of the hearing both the tracing and the FBI's analysis were \"still ongoing.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217840\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The whole purpose of a pretrial restraint under \u00a7 1345 is to maintain the status quo in cases, like this one, where a defendant is accused of committing crimes that involve fungible property,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    a banking law violation or a federal health care offense. The plurality's approach serves to benefit the most sophisticated of criminals whose web of transfers and concealment will take the longest to unravel. For if the Government cannot establish at the outset that every dollar subject to restraint is derived from the crime alleged, the defendant can spend that money on whatever defense team he or she desires.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Of equal concern is the assertion that a defendant's right to counsel of choice is limited to only those attorneys who charge a \"reasonable fee.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1095 - 1096. If Luis has a right to use the restrained substitute assets to pay for the counsel of her choice, then why can she not hire the most expensive legal team she can afford? In the plurality's view, the reason Luis can use the restrained funds for an attorney is because they are still hers. But if that is so, then she should be able to use all $2 million of her remaining assets to pay for a lawyer. The plurality's willingness to curtail the very right it recognizes reflects the\n    need to preserve substitute assets from further dissipation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Today's ruling abandons the principle established in\n    <em>\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Monsanto.\n    </em>\n    In its place is an approach that creates perverse incentives and provides protection for defendants who spend stolen money rather than their own.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    In my respectful view this is incorrect, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"dissent\">\n   <author id=\"p-146\">\n    Justice KAGAN, dissenting.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    I find\n    <em>\n     United States v.

But it is quite another thing to say that the Government may, prior to trial, freeze assets that a defendant needs to hire an attorney, based on nothing more than \"probable cause to believe that the property will ultimately be proved forfeitable.\"\n    <em>\n     Monsanto,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217495\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/600/#p616\">\n     491 U.S., at 615\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217495\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/600/#p616\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2657\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . At that time, \"the presumption of innocence still applies,\" and the Government's interest in the assets is wholly contingent on future judgments of conviction and forfeiture.\n    <em>\n     Kaley v.

I am not altogether convinced that, in this decidedly different circumstance, the Government's interest in recovering the proceeds of crime ought to trump the defendant's (often highly consequential) right to retain counsel of choice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    But the correctness of\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    is not at issue today. Petitioner Sila Luis has not asked this Court either to overrule or to modify that decision; she argues only that it does not answer the question presented here. And because Luis takes\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    as a given, the Court must do so as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    On that basis, I agree with the principal dissent that\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    controls this case. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1105 - 1106 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Because the Government has established probable cause to believe that it will eventually recover Luis's assets, she has no right to use them to pay an attorney. See\n    <em>\n     Monsanto,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217495\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/600/#p616\">\n     491 U.S., at 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217495\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/600/#p616\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2657\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[N]o constitutional violation occurs when, after probable cause is adequately established, the Government obtains an order barring a defendant from ... dissipating his assets prior to trial\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The plurality reaches a contrary result only by differentiating between the direct fruits of criminal activity and substitute assets that become subject to forfeiture when the defendant has run through those proceeds. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1089 - 1090. But as the principal dissent shows, the Government's and the defendant's respective legal interests in those two kinds of property, prior to a judgment of guilt, are exactly the same: The defendant maintains ownership of either type, with the Government holding only a contingent interest. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1060 - 1092. Indeed, the plurality's use of the word \"tainted,\" to describe assets at the pre-conviction stage, makes an unwarranted assumption about the defendant's guilt. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1093 - 1094 (characterizing such assets as, for example, \"robber's loot\"). Because the Government has not yet shown that the defendant committed the crime charged, it also has not\n    shown that allegedly tainted assets are actually so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    And given that money is fungible, the plurality's approach leads to utterly arbitrary distinctions as among criminal defendants who are in fact guilty. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1108 - 1109 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). The thief who immediately dissipates his ill-gotten gains and thereby preserves his other assets is no more deserving of chosen counsel than the one who spends those two pots of money in reverse order. Yet the plurality would enable only the first defendant, and not the second, to hire the lawyer he wants. I cannot believe the Sixth Amendment draws that irrational line, much as I sympathize with the plurality's effort to cabin\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    . Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment below.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
