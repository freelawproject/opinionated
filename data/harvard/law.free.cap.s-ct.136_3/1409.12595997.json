In\n   <em>\n    Williamson County,\n   </em>\n   the Court ruled that a plaintiff's allegation that local government action resulted in a taking is not \"ripe\" for review in federal court until the plaintiff \"seek[s] compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Court superimposed a state-litigation requirement on the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause.

In\n   <em>\n    Williamson County,\n   </em>\n   the Court reasoned that this language does not \"require that just compensation be paid in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the taking; all that is required is that a reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation exist at the time of the taking.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    473 U.S., at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). This suspect reasoning led the Court to conclude that, \"because the Constitution does not require pretaking compensation, and is instead satisfied by a reasonable and adequate provision for obtaining compensation after the taking, the State's action ... is not 'complete' until the State fails to provide adequate compensation for the taking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 195,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In effect,\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   forces a property owner to shoulder the burden of securing compensation\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the local government effects a taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This result seems at odds with the plain text and original meaning of the Takings Clause, which appear to make just compensation a prerequisite to taking property for public use. As critics of\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   have opined, the Takings Clause is more than a mere remedy. The requirement\n   to pay just compensation \"places a condition on the [government's] exercise of\" the power to take private property in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.

Land Use &amp; Env. L. 209, 219 (2003).

Nevertheless, several Courts of Appeals continue to treat the\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   rule as a jurisdictional rule limiting the courts' power to consider federal takings claims until the plaintiffs exhaust state-law remedies. See\n   <em>\n    Marek v. Rhode Island,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646092\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/650/#p653\">\n    702 F.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653-654 (C.A.1 2012) (explaining that a federal court cannot exercise \"jurisdiction\" over a \"takings claim\" until a plaintiff pursues state remedies);\n   <em>\n    Snaza v. St. Paul,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3954390\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1178/#p1182\">\n    548 F.3d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182 (C.A.8 2008) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that the\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   doctrine was merely \"prudential\" and insisting that it was \"jurisdictional\");\n   <em>\n    Busse v. Lee County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Fed.%20Appx.%20968\">\n    317 Fed.Appx. 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 972 (C.A.11 2009) (holding that plaintiff's takings claim was not ripe because he had not exhausted state remedies and concluding that the District Court therefore \"did not err in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\"); cf.\n   <em>\n    Perfect Puppy, Inc. v.

Even those courts that have cast the state-litigation rule as \"prudential\" are divided over whether the rule may be waived. Compare\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Clifton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048234\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/498/727/#p734\">\n    498 F.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (C.A.7 2007) (holding that \"[t]he prudential character of the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   requirements do not ... give the lower federal courts license to disregard them\"), with\n   <em>\n    Sansotta v.

In short, the Court's efforts to bring clarity have failed. The quagmire that the Court has created in the lower courts is yet another reason to grant the petition. See this Court's Rule 10(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the 30 years since the Court decided\n   <em>\n    Williamson County,\n   </em>\n   individual Justices have expressed grave doubts about the validity of that decision and have called for reconsideration. This case presents the opportunity to consider whether there are any justifications for the ahistorical, atextual, and anomalous state-litigation rule, and if not, to overrule\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   . I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
