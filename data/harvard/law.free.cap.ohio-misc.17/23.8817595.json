Under Section 4515.02, Revised Code, we find Page\u2019s case note 147.2 which cites <em>Lombardo </em>v. <em>DeShance, </em>167 Ohio St. 431. This case holds that \u201cthe word \u2018guest\u2019 does not require anything more than the giving of such hospitality in order to make the person, receiving and to be benefitted by it, a guest.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b37-17\">At page 435 in the opinion of 167 Ohio St., <em>supra, </em>we find:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-18\">\u201cSome support for plaintiff\u2019s contention is indicated in the annotation at 16 A. L. R. 2d 1304, where it is said that \u2018the view has been taken * * * that if an infant is of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tender age as to be legally incapable of \u201caccepting\u201d a ride in a motor vehicle, such infant is not a \u201cguest.\u201d \u2019 However, as indicated in that annotation, that \u2018view has apparently only been supported by one court of last resort and two intermediate appellate courts and it has apparently been rejected by at least two courts of last resort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">(( # # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cAfter referring to the similar decision in <em>Rocha, a Minor, </em>v. <em>Hulen, </em>6 Cal. App. 2d 245, 44 P. 2d 478 (1935), the Oregon court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u2018 \u2018 \u2018 [It] * * * is sought to be distinguished because the California statute reads, \u201cany person who as a guest <em>accepts </em>a ride in any vehicle\u201d * * *; while our statute does not contain the word \u201caccepts.\u201d But * * * this court has defined a guest as one who \u201caccepts\u201d a ride, so that the suggested ground of distinction does not exist.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cA similar result was reached in <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Thrun, </em>109 Ind. App. 407, 31 N. E. 2d 670 (1941), by so construing the word \u2018guest.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">\u201cHowever, it has been held by other courts that a child of tender years may become and be a guest although it does not have the mental capacity to accept an invitation. <em>Morgan, a Minor, </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>149 Kan. 814, 89 P. 2d 866 (1939); <em>Tilghman, Admr., </em>v. <em>Rightor, </em>211 Ark 229, 199 S. W. 2d 943 (1947); <em>In re Wright\u2019s Estate, </em>170 Kan. 600, 228 P. 2d 911 (1951 \u2014 -saying as to four-year-old child, \u2018 the weight of authority is that a minor * * * can be a guest even though unaccompanied by parent or guardian, even though no consent of parent or guardian is shown\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">This would seem to settle the matter by unanimous opinion of our Supreme Court which concurred in Judge Taft\u2019s opinion referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">In the absence of any allegations of wanton or willful misconduct, the guest statute relieves defendant of liability to the eight-year-old child or her parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">Exceptions may be noted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
