The Commissioner in issuing his final assessment denied a request for a refund of the personal property tax paid on the basis that \u2018request for refund based on claim the taxpayer is not in business as defined by Section 5701.08 (B), Revised Code, is denied,\u2019 when such taxpayer is not engaged in business pursuant to Section 5709.01, Revised Code, and as defined in Section 5701.08, Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">\u201c3. Said final assessment order and final determination is not sustained by the evidence and is against the weight of the evidence and is contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">\u201c4. That the said Tax Commissioner by his final order discriminates against the appellant since refunds have been granted country clubs and private organizations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Hamilton County, Ohio, and other counties throughout the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\">\u201cAppellant prays that the Board of Tax Appeals declare an order that the finding, order and final determination and assessment No. 223162, dated March 8, 1968, is in error and further declare the order and assessment by the commissioner be abated and held for naught.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The appellant, Beta Upsilon Chapter of Sigma Kappa House Association is a corporation not for profit, organized and existing under the laws of the state of Ohio since 1951. The corporation was organized for the purposes set forth in its purpose clause in its Articles of Incorporation and are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u201cThird. The purpose or purposes for which said corporation is formed are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201cTo acquire by purchase, lease, or otherwise, real estate for use as house or houses suitable for a college sorority; to own, maintain, improve, build, remodel, house or houses; to own household goods, furnishings, and other personal property; and to own and maintain equipment and purchase supplies for the serving of meals, all of which is for the accommodation, convenience, benefit, social entertainment and pleasure of members while attending and receiving their education at Ohio University; and the doing of any and all things necessary or incident thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The corporation manages the affairs of Sigma Kappa Sorority, a chapter of a national Sorority whose facilities are located in Athens, Ohio, in conjunction with Ohio University, also situated in Athens, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The Sorority provides room and board for its members during the school year while they are attending and receiving their education at Ohio University.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Several employees keep the chapter house in operation, including a cook, house mother and a janitor.

However, in arriving at this surplus figure the appellant has included dues and if such figure was withdrawn from consideration, appellant would show a very substantial loss each operating year.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\">Pertinent cases are <em>American Jersey Cattle Club </em>v. <em>Glander, </em>152 Ohio St. 506, wherein Syllabi 1, 2 and 3 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">\u201c1. The fact, that a corporation is organized and operated as one not for profit, does not mean that its enterprises may not be conducted for gain, profit or net income to the corporation as a legal entity apart from its members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201c2. In determining whether the activities of a nonprofit corporation constitute enterprises conducted for gain, profit or net income, it is proper to consider the history of such corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201c3. The activities of such a corporation constitute enterprises conducted for gain, profit or net income where it appears that (a) those activities have resulted in the accumulation by the corporation over a period of years of substantial surplus funds, (b) the corporation has had a substantial surplus of revenues over expenditures from those activities during the preceding year, and (c) the corporation admittedly regards such a surplus as essential for the expansion of its activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The <em>Kirtland Country Club </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>174 Ohio St. 116, wherein the syllabus reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201cThe personal property of an organization formed as a corporation for profit under Ohio law, which operates a private country club conducted for social and recreational purposes solely for the benefit of its members and not conducted for purposes of gain, profit or income is not taxable under Section 5709.01, Revised Code.\u201d and <em>The Engineers\u2019 Club of Dayton </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>8 Ohio St. 2d 18, which affirmed the Board of Tax Appeals finding that certain personal property was not \u201cused in business\u201d upon the authority of the <em>Kirtland Country Club Co. </em>v. <em>Bowers, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Giving consideration to the facts, the statutes and the case law herein set forth it is the finding of the Board of Tax Appeals that the personal property of the appellant herein is not \u201cused in business\u201d within the meaning of Section 5701.08, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\">It is therefore the order of the Board of Tax Appeals that the final orders of the Tax Commissioner herein, wherein that official denied appellant\u2019s requests for personal property tax refunds for 1966 and 1967, must be, and hereby is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Tax Commissioner with instructions to that official to do all things necessary to give effect to this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">It further is ordered that a copy of this order be certified to the Tax Commissioner, the Auditor of Athens County, Ohio, and the counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">I hereby certify the foregoing to be a true and correct copy of the action of the Board of Tax Appeals of the Department of Taxation this day taken with respect to the above mater.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Arthur W.
