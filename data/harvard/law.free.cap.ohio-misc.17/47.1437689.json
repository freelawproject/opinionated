Coyne, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. Code Section 2241. His claim is that a conviction and sentence in and by the Common Pleas Court of Clermont County, Ohio, pursuant to which he is being detained, was \u201cimposed in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution in that petitioner\u2019s place of business was searched by police officers under color of a totally invalid and unlawful search warrant, property being unlawfully taken therefrom and illegally and unlawfully admitted in evidence upon trial\u201d by said court.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">The case was heard on an \u201cagreed statement of facts\u201d which has been supplemented in certain respects by each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>party, without objection by the other party, with exhibits appended to briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On August 16,1965, an affidavit was filed before a magistrate in Clermont County, Ohio, and on that date a search warrant was issued. There is appended hereto a copy of the affidavit and the warrant. On August 17, 1965, during the daytime, the officer, Arthur Guard, entered the premises described in the affidavit and found a machine gun in a house trailer then used by the petitioner as his office. The weapon was confiscated by the officer. On August 27, 1965, petitioner filed with the County Court of Clermont County, Ohio, his written motion to quash the search warrant; that motion was overruled by that court in September 1965. Thereafter in December, petitioner was indicted by the Grand Jury of Clermont County, Ohio, for a violation of the machine gun Section 2923.04 of the Revised Code of Ohio. Prior to his arraignment, petitioner filed with the Common Pleas Court his written motion to suppress the evidence seized under the search warrant, which was overruled. That motion was orally renewed at the commencement of petitioner\u2019s trial; it was again overruled. On trial, petitioner was adjudged guilty. The machine gun was. introduced in evidence at trial over his objection and obviously substantially contributed to his conviction. The conviction was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the First Appellate District of Ohio. In that court the sufficiency of the affidavit and the validity of the search warrant were again attacked \u2014 again unsuccessfully. The petitioner thereupon filed a motion to certify to the Supreme Court of Ohio. The same attacks were made in that court in that motion. The Supreme Court of Ohio on October 26, 1966, <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed that appeal for the reason that no substantial constitutional question exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The parties in this court have stipulated that during each stage and phase of the state court proceedings, petitioner raised and argued the issue of infringement of his constitutional rights and \u201cthe invalidity of the affidavit for search warrant\u201d \u2014 the record so shows, for all prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tical purposes. While the rationale of the attack differed at various stages of the state court proceeding, we are satisfied that the ultimate questions involved have been presented to and passed on by each of the state courts, including the court of last resort. Although the Ohio postconviction procedure (Section 2953.21 <em>et seq., </em>Revised Code) became effective after the submission of <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden, </em>351 F. (2d) 285, (6th, 1965), the reasoning of that case is applicable to the present situation; the asserted federal Constitution violations have been presented to each of the Ohio state courts and any repeti\u2022tion would be futile. It is held, therefore, that the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">See also <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>363 F. (2d) 429, (6th, 1966), and <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>369 F. (2d) 687 (6th, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The affidavit is and has been claimed as insufficient in several respects, (a) there is nothing in the affidavit to indicate that the informers were \u201creliable\u201d or \u201ccredible\u201d people; (b) there is an insufficiency in respect of the time relative to August 16, 1965, that the eyewitnesses informed the deputy sheriff of the facts as set forth in the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">It is true that language may be found in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. (2d) 697; <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U. S. 160, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879; <em>Aquilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. (2d) 723, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. (2d) 684, which, at first blush, would almost seem to require the use of the verbiage \u201ccredible\u201d or \u201creliable\u201d in connection with the \u201cinformers\u201d in affidavits for search warrants based on hearsay, as distinguished from the personal knowledge of the affiant. The affidavit involved in this case does not use either of those adjectives on its face. However, the reason which might require the use of such an adjective or the equivalent is the basic or underlying requirement of something in the affidavit to indicate a \u201csubstantial basis for crediting the hearsay.\u201d In our view the requirement of \u201csubstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>tial basis\u201d is better met \u2014 or at least equivalently met\u2014 with the description of the informer or informers as \u201ceye witnesses. \u201d This certainly indicates a strong reason for the officer\u2019s belief based upon which the magistrate may conclude that probable cause exists. We are strengthened in this conclusion by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bowling, </em>351 F. (2d) 236 (6th, 1965). In that case, decided since <em>Ventresca, </em>a search warrant was attacked as \u201cdefective because issued without basis of fact and as a fishing expedition or flier.\u201d The affidavit in the <em>Bowling case, </em>insofar as relevant to the problem here, contained this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">\u201cThat affiant\u2019s reason for stating the laws are being violated are that affiant was informed on this date by W. A. Hennard, who is in custody, that the following stolen articles are in possession of * * *\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Judge Edwards, writing the opinion for the Sixth Circuit, concluded \u201cthe affidavit on its face recited ample reason for the magistrate to issue the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">With respect to the deficiency in \u201ctime,\u201d it must be conceded that the affidavit must contain something affirmatively indicating that there is probable cause at or about the time the search warrant is applied for. If it be on personal knowledge, there should be some indication of the officer\u2019s personal knowledge <em>now, </em>or if it be based on hearsay, there should be some indication that the information was imparted to the affiant at or shortly before the time of the application and that the information indicated probable cause <em>now, </em>not five or six days or months ago. See <em>Rosencranz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 F. (2d) 310 (1st Cir. 1966). Were it not for that portion of the affidavit involved here which dealt with a \u201cnight search\u201d we would have no hesitancy in holding the search warrant invalid for the reason stated in the <em>Rosencranz case. </em>However, the affidavit before us indicates that, based on the information which was received from the two eyewitnesses, the officer concluded \u201cthat there is urgent necessity that said premises be searched in the night, to prevent said things from being concealed or removed so as not to be found.\u201d In our view, this affidavit therefore contains language which shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>on its face that the information received by the officer was recently contemporaneous and was to the effect that the machine gun was \u201cnow\u201d in the possession of Coyne on the described premises. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>351 F. (2d) 475 (6th, 1965) in which the Sixth Circuit in an opinion written by Judge Peck, held that the inclusion of the word \u201cready\u201d in an affidavit reciting that a person \u201ckept a ready supply of heroin on hand in his apartment\u201d caused the allegation to be one of \u201ccontinuing possession,\u201d satisfying the requirement that the allegations of a warrant apply to conditions existing \u201cat the time of the issuance of the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We do not mean to imply that no \u201cdoubt\u201d could exist in this question. The state evidently thought a doubt existed\u2014 at one of the hearings involving the question before the Common Pleas Court of Clermont County, the state saw fit to supplement the record with an affidavit from the magistrate reciting that \u201cthe affiant further says that at the time he received the affidavit for search warrant from the deputy sheriff, additional information was given to him as county court judge, which information consisted of the statement of Deputy Sheriff Arthur Guard, that \u2018witnesses told him, Arthur Guard, that they saw John E. Coyne in the possession of a machine gun on his premises at the intersection of Twelve Mile Road and State Route 132.\u2019 \u201d It is, however, our conclusion that the affidavit for the search warrant was sufficient on its face. The \u201ccircumstances\u201d were detailed, <em>i. e., </em>the possession by Coyne on certain described premises of a machine gun, the possession of which was forbidden by the applicable laws of the state of Ohio. \u201cReason for crediting the source of the information is given\u201d \u2014 eyewitnesses are referred to as such just for that reason \u2014 and the plural rather than the singular is certainly an additional reason. This court sees no magic as between \u201cone reliable witness\u201d and \u201ctwo eyewitnesses.\u201d The \u201cmagistrate * * * found probable causes\u201d \u2014 his action in issuing the warrant indicates such and there is further indication in this record that the magistrate examined the proceedings and did not simply \u201crubber stamp.\u201d While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the request was for a night warrant, the magistrate decided to issue only a \u201cday warrant.\u201d Finally and to continue the quotation from <em>Ventresca-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">\u201cThe courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hyperteehnical, rather than a common sense manner. Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, at page 109, 85 S. Ct. 741, at page 746.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The petitioner is now in the technical custody of the sheriff of Clermont County, Ohio. He is presently at liberty on bond, pending determination of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">It is concluded that the petitioner\u2019s prayer for writ of habeas corpus should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">Rev.
