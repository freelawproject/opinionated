Taxes\u2014when a high school tax must be regarded as valid. On appeal from a judgment denying the collector\u2019s application for judgment for a delinquent high school tax the Supreme Court will take judicial notice that the curative act of 1917 became effective during the pendency of the application and removed the objection made to the tax, even though the only ground urged for reversal is that the existence of the district as a de facto corporation could not be collaterally attacked.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-8\" pgmap=\"16\">2.

While the only reason urged by counsel for appellant for a reversal of the judgment is that the high school district was a corporation de facto and its corporate existence could not be questioned in a collateral proceeding to collect taxes levied by it, we will take notice of the curative act of June 14, 1917, which was passed and became effective during the pendency of this application. As this act had the effect of legalizing the organization of the district and is decisive of the questions involved, for the reasons given in People v. Mathews, (post, p. 85,) the judgment of the county court is reversed and the cause is remanded, with directions to overrule the objections. Reversed, and remanded, with directions.</p> <p id=\"b17-6\" pgmap=\"17\">Cartwright, Dunn and Duncan, JJ., dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
