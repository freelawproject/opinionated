' When, in the exercise of its discretion the General Term refuses to grant a new trial, such discretion, is not re viewable in this court. An appeal to this court from a judgment of conviction, brings up for review only questions of law. Unless, therefore, the order of the General Term shows that the Supreme Court has exercised its discretion and refused a new trial upon the facts, and granted it only for errors of law, there is nothing for this court to review on appeal to it.
