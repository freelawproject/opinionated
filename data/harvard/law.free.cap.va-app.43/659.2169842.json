HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">This matter comes before the Court on a rehearing <em>en banc </em>from an unpublished panel decision of January 6, 2004. <em>See Hilliard v. </em>Commonwealth 04 Vap UNP 0394022, 2004 WL 26307 (2004). In that decision, a divided panel of this Court affirmed Hilliard\u2019s convictions for murder (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32), use of a firearm in the commission of murder (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1), maliciously shooting into an occupied vehicle (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-154), and discharging a firearm on or -within 1000 feet of school property (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-280(B)), finding that the trial court properly denied Hilliard\u2019s motion to suppress inculpatory statements obtained from him by the police after he allegedly invoked his right to an attorney and that it did not err in giving an <em>Allen </em>charge to the jury during the guilt phase of the trial or in its response to questions from the jury during the sentencing phase of the trial on the presumption of consecutive sentences and the possibility of geriatric release. By order dated February 10, 2004, we granted the appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>stayed the mandate of that decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing this case <em>en banc, </em>we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the Commonwealth all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">On July 7,1999, the victim, Anthony Robinson, Jr., was shot and killed in Richmond, Virginia. Hilliard was indicted for Robinson\u2019s murder on September 13, 1999, and arrested on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>September 15, 1999. Richmond City Police Detectives White and Kochell interviewed him the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">At the beginning of the interview, Detective Kochell advised Hilliard of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 469-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1625-27, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and asked him to sign a waiver form indicating he understood his rights and wished to speak to the detectives. Before signing the form, Hilliard asked the detectives, \u201cCan I have somebody else present too, I mean just for my safety, like a lawyer, like y\u2019all just said, or something? Can I ... ?\u201d Detective White responded, \u201cThat\u2019s up to you. Like [Detective Kochell] said, all we\u2019re doing today is just trying to get your side of the story. That\u2019s all we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d Hilliard replied, \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to tell you, I don\u2019t have a side. I don\u2019t.\u201d Detective White then explained to Hilliard that they could not continue to speak with him unless he signed the form. Hilliard signed the waiver form, and the detectives continued the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Moments later, after being asked how he knew the victim and being told by the detectives to be \u201chonest,\u201d Hilliard stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">I understand what both of you all are saying wholeheartedly. I need to say that ... I\u2019m not saying that I know anything. I\u2019m not saying that I know the person. You know what I\u2019m saying? The only thing, ... like I said, / <em>would like to have somebody else in here because I may say something I don\u2019t even know what I am, saying, </em>and it might fuck me up, might jam me up in some incidents, and I don\u2019t want that to happen, man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">(Emphasis added.) Detective Kochell replied, \u201cWe\u2019re not here trying to jam you up. Okay?\u201d Kochell then explained to Hilliard that the interview was not going to be conducted in a harsh manner, like those seen on television. Hilliard then continued his conversation with the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Approximately an hour into the interview, Detective White told Hilliard he wanted to know \u201cwhat happened and why\u201d and wanted Hilliard to tell his \u201cside of the story.\u201d The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>HILLIARD: Can I get a lawyer in here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Do you want to do that? HILLIARD: I already have a lawyer. I mean, I can talk to you, don\u2019t get me wrong. But I just want to make sure I don\u2019t, like I said before, just jam myself up. And I\u2019ll tell you everything that I know. This is my word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Okay. That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">DETECTIVE KOCHELL: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">HILLIARD: I\u2019m not saying that I will say anything other or just because he\u2019s in here. I just want to, you know, make sure I have ... I\u2019d feel a little bit more comfortable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASK\">DETECTIVE KOCHELL: That\u2019s not a problem. We tried to provide you -with a comfortable atmosphere here. And, like I said, it\u2019s not the stuff that you see on TV dealing with Sipowicz, okay, where he takes a guy and throws him up on the wall. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">HILLIARD: I will say, I will go as far as to say this. Probably what you all got in that book ain\u2019t nowhere near. DETECTIVE WHITE: I\u2019m not with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">HILLIARD: I\u2019m just saying, what you all probably have in that book, I doubt that it\u2019s anywhere near it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Anywhere near ... of what we know of why it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">HILLIARD: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Well, that\u2019s why we want to hear from you, because we know there\u2019s a bigger picture there. Okay? You know what the problem is, [Hilliard], is that you got caught up in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-14\">HILLIARD: Yeah, I did. I was there. I\u2019m going to just say that, I was there. But before I say anything else, I mean, I already talked to you before we go to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-15\">A few moments later, Detective White told Hilliard:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-16\">And like you said, we\u2019ve got plenty of time to sit down and talk like this again with your attorney here, okay, because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve expressed. And you\u2019ve told us that you were there and there\u2019s a bigger picture that you\u2019d like to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>over it with your attorney and then explain it to us, okay, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The interview ended shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Prior to his trial on the charges at issue, Hilliard filed a motion to suppress alleging that police obtained the statement he provided during the September 16, 1999 interview, in violation of his \u201cfourth, fifth and sixth Amendment [rights]\u201d \u201cand/or\u201d in violation of his rights under \u201cArticle 1, Section 8, 10, or 11 of the Constitution of Virginia and Section 19.2-59 of the Code of Virginia.\u201d The videotape of that interview was the sole evidence presented during the hearing on Hilliard\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Based upon that evidence, Hilliard argued he made three requests for the assistance of an attorney, but the police ignored each request and continued the interrogation. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, finding that Hilliard\u2019s questions and statements referencing an attorney were \u201cequivocated\u201d and that, \u201ceven if he invoked his right to a lawyer immediately prior to the statement,\u201d HiUiard\u2019s admission that he was at the scene of the crime \u201cwas purely voluntary, was not as the result of any continuing interrogation or response to a question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Hilliard was tried on February 29, 2000 and March 1, 2000. During jury deliberations, at the end of the first day, the jury foreperson sent a note to the trial judge saying, \u201cWe are split 10-2. We can\u2019t reach a unanimous decision.\u201d The trial judge released the jurors until the following day and told the attorneys to \u201cdecide in the meantime if you want me to give them the <em>Allen </em>charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">The next morning, the trial judge asked the attorneys, \u201cHave you all discussed whether or not you want to give them the <em>Allen </em>charge or just continue?\u201d Hilliard\u2019s counsel told the trial judge he did not want the court to give the <em>Allen </em>charge. The trial judge responded, \u201cI will just tell them to start again, reread the evidence, don\u2019t speculate; go over the evidence and talk to each other.\u201d Neither party objected to the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>suggestion. Thereafter, the jury returned to the courtroom and the trial judge made the following remarks to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4S\">Good morning. Seems like we just left. You know, we all know what kind of job you all are assigned here, and it\u2019s a very difficult thing. We can\u2019t go out and get twelve better people to do this job than you all; you can do this job. You have a duty to listen to each other and you have a duty to follow the law and not speculate. But what I want you to do is to go back, try to start fresh with the instructions, take your time, go through these things and the facts and talk to each other about it. You can reach a decision in this case. So you all go back and take your time. I think they will get you some coffee and if you need a Coke or something\u2014 whatever you need, let them know; they will be glad to accommodate you. Thank you. Continue your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Hilliard made no objection to the trial court\u2019s remarks. The jury subsequently found Hilliard guilty of murder, use of a firearm in the commission of murder, maliciously shooting into an occupied vehicle and discharging a firearm on/near school property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">After the jury returned its verdicts, the trial court prepared to instruct the jury with respect to sentencing. The trial court asked Hilliard, \u201cDo you want anything about parole in Virginia or not?\u201d Initially, Hilliard\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cI think you should say there is no parole.\u201d However, after further discussion with the trial judge and consultation with Hilliard, Hilliard\u2019s counsel decided not to ask for an instruction regarding parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">During its sentencing deliberations, the jury submitted three written questions to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">1. Do the sentences run concurrently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>2. Will he get credit for times [sic] served?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">3. When will he be eligible for parole?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In the ensuing discussion about how to respond to the jury\u2019s questions, Hilliard\u2019s counsel asked the trial court to tell the jury \u201cthere is no parole\u201d and that the sentences would \u201crun consecutively.\u201d The trial court responded: \u201cIt may not run consecutive. It could run concurrent. That\u2019s not for them to decide and credit for time served. I don\u2019t mind telling them he gets credit for time served. I don\u2019t mind telling them as far as they\u2019re concerned, there is personally no parole.\u201d Hilliard made no objection to the court\u2019s decision. Instead, his counsel asked, \u201cJust the parole issue?\u201d to which the trial court responded, \u201cAll right. Bring [the jury] back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Before the jury returned, however, the Commonwealth sought further clarification of how the trial court was intending to respond to the jury\u2019s questions. In reply to the Commonwealth\u2019s query, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">Well, they say-when will he be eligible for parole and that sort of bothers me because he may be eligible when he\u2019s seventy or when he\u2019s sixty, or whatever it is, and then you get into that\u2019s not a true\u2014as far as a jury is concerned, there is no parole in Virginia. But in this situation, they want to know when he will be eligible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The Commonwealth then asked the trial court not to answer the parole question. Hilliard\u2019s counsel again asked that the jury be instructed, \u201cthat there is no parole.\u201d The trial court then instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">Ms. Bowles I got your question and I have talked it over with the lawyers and pretty generally, it\u2019s\u2014I am to explain to you that your function at this time is to listen, take the evidence and the law and what you\u2019ve heard and decide on a proper punishment in each of these cases. That\u2019s what you do. You\u2019re not to concern yourself with what may happen afterward. You set an appropriate punishment in each of these cases. That\u2019s your job. I will tell you that other than some exceptional circumstances, parole in Virginia was abolished several years ago and that\u2019s all I\u2019m allowed to tell you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Hilliard did not object to the instruction given. The jury ultimately recommended that Hilliard be sentenced to serve 40 years for murder, 3 years for use of a firearm in the commission of murder, 10 years for shooting into an occupied vehicle, and 10 years for discharging a firearm within 1000 feet of school property.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">At Hilliard\u2019s sentencing on April 21, 2000, Hilliard made a motion to set aside the verdict on the basis that the trial court improperly advised the jury during its deliberations in the guilt phase of his trial. Specifically, Hilliard argued that, although the trial court\u2019s statement to the jury was \u201cnot the same as the <em>Allen </em>charge, ... it [was] very similar, and that this comment by the Court improperly interfered with the jury\u2019s deliberation.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AZ6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">On appeal, Hilliard first contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because police violated his right to counsel as embodied in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Because we find that the police violated Hilliard\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel by continuing to interrogate him after he clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to counsel, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We begin by recognizing that, on an appeal of a ruling on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them,\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc), </em>but we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion to the particular facts of the case, <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">An accused who is \u201csubject to custodial interrogation has the right to consult with an attorney and to have counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>present during questioning.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 457, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2354, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469-73, 86 S.Ct. at 1625-27); <em>see also United States v. Patane, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2620, 159 L.Ed.2d 667 (2004) (\u201c[TJhe <em>Miranda </em>rule is a prophylactic employed to protect against violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause.\u201d). \u201c[T]he police must explain this right to [the accused] before questioning begins.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 457, 114 S.Ct at 2354. If the accused \u201ceffectively waives his right to counsel after receiving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, law enforcement officers are free to question him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 114 S.Ct. at 2350. However, if the accused \u201crequests counsel at any time during the interview, he is not subject to further questioning until a lawyer has been made available or the suspect himself reinitiates conversation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\u201c[T]he test for determining whether the accused invoked the right to counsel is an objective one.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 602, 605, 518 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cThe Court must determine whether the accused \u2018articulated his desire to have counsel present <em>sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355) (emphasis added). Only if the accused \u201cclearly requested] an attorney\u201d would the interviewing officers be required to stop questioning him. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">An issue of whether an accused \u201cclearly requested an attorney during a custodial interrogation is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Redmond, </em>264 Va. 321, 326, 568 S.E.2d 695, 697 (2002) (plurality opinion). \u201c \u2018[T]he determination of what [the accused] actually said is a question of fact that we review only for clear error.... Whether those words are sufficient to invoke the right to counsel is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 327, 568 S.E.2d at 698 (quoting <em>United States v. Uribe-Galindo, </em>990 F.2d 522, 523 (10th Cir.1993) (other citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Davis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel \u201crequires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u201d <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. [171,] 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, [2209,] 115 L.Ed.2d 158 [(1991)]. But if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355. The Supreme Court further explained in <em>Davis </em>that \u201cwhen a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether he actually wants an attorney.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356. The Court added, however: \u201cBut we decline to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions. If the suspect\u2019s statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-62,114 S.Ct. at 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">A statement, however, \u201ceither is such an assertion [of the right to counsel] or it is not. Where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease. In these circumstances, an accused\u2019s subsequent statements are relevant only to the question whether the accused waived the right he had invoked.\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 97-98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 493-94, 83 L.Ed.2d 488, 494 (1984) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In <em>Davis, </em>the suspect, after waiving his right to counsel, was interviewed by investigators regarding his involvement in a murder. During the interview, the suspect stated, \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer.\u201d 512 U.S. at 455, 114 S.Ct. at 2353. The investigators did not stop the interview at that point. <em>Id. </em>The United States Supreme Court held that the suspect\u2019s statement \u201cwas not a request for counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 114 S.Ct. at 2357.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Redmond, </em>the accused, after waiving his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, was questioned by the police regarding the circumstances of a murder for which he had been arrested. 264 Va. at 324-25, 568 S.E.2d at 696-97. During the interrogation, the accused asked, \u201cCan I speak to my lawyer? I can\u2019t even talk to [a] lawyer before I make any kinds of comments or anything?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 568 S.E.2d at 697. The officers conducting the interrogation did not discontinue their questioning of the accused at that point. <em>Id. </em>In concluding that the accused \u201cfailed to make a clear and unambiguous assertion of his right to counsel,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 330, 568 S.E.2d at 700, the Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis, </em>this Court consistently held that a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to counsel is necessary to invoke the rule [requiring the police to cease an interrogation when the accused requests counsel]. <em>See Mueller v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 396, 422 S.E.2d 380, 387 (1992) (defendant\u2019s question \u201cDo you think I need an attorney here?\u201d not a clear assertion of right to counsel), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1043, 113 S.Ct. 1880, 123 L.Ed.2d 498 (1993); <em>Eaton v.

And, this Court applied <em>Davis </em>in <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 266-67, 462 S.E.2d 112, 115 (1995) (defendant\u2019s statement \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer\u201d not a clear assertion of right to counsel).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 568 S.E.2d at 699-700. In that case, however, the Court noted, after having reviewed a videotape of the interrogation contained in the record, that \u201cthe historical facts such as the context of the defendant\u2019s questions, the tone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>his voice, his voice inflections, and his demeanor support[ed] the conclusion that this defendant did not make a clear assertion of his right to counsel. At best, the defendant\u2019s questions may be construed as a desire on his part to obtain more information about his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 568 S.E.2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In contrast, in <em>McDaniel, </em>we held that the accused\u2019s response after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me,\u201d was an unequivocal request for counsel. 30 Va.App. at 606, 518 S.E.2d at 853. Despite the accused\u2019s use of the words \u201cthink\u201d and \u201crather,\u201d we found that the accused \u201cmade his choice clear, informing the detective that he desired to have an attorney speak for him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In the case at bar, Hilliard contends that he made three requests for the assistance of counsel during the September 16,1999 interrogation and that each of those requests equated to a clear, unequivocal request for counsel. Applying the above-stated principles to the facts and circumstances of this case, and after reviewing the videotape of his interrogation that was admitted as an exhibit in this case, we conclude that Hilliard\u2019s first two \u201crequests\u201d did not express a clear and unequivocal desire for counsel, but that his final \u201crequest\u201d constituted an unequivocal invocation of his right to counsel, requiring police to immediately cease the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In the first instance, after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Hilliard asked, \u201cCan I have somebody else present too, I mean just for my safety, like a lawyer, like you all just said, or something? Can I ... ?\u201d Uncertain about Hilliard\u2019s response, one of the detectives replied, \u201cThat\u2019s up to you.\u201d When told by the detectives that they could not talk to him unless he signed the waiver form, Hilliard signed the form, agreeing to speak to the detectives without a lawyer being present. Thus, Hilliard\u2019s question was, at most, an inquiry designed to elicit clarification from the detectives regarding the rights he had just been read, not an unequivocal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>request for an attorney. <em>See Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 330, 568 S.E.2d at 700.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Shortly thereafter, Hilliard stated, \u201c[L]ike I said, I would like to have <em>somebody else </em>in here because I may say something I don\u2019t even know what I am saying, and it might ... jam me up .... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Although Hilliard\u2019s statement \u201cexpresses his reservation about the wisdom of continuing the interrogation without\u201d <em>someone </em>there to assist him, \u201cit does not clearly and unambiguously communicate a desire to invoke his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Midkiff, </em>250 Va. at 267, 462 S.E.2d at 115. Thus, it was not a clear request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">However, approximately one hour later, Hilliard asked, \u201cCan I get a lawyer in here?\u201d Detective White then asked Hilliard the clarifying question, \u201cDo you want to do that?\u201d Hilliard responded, \u201cI already have a lawyer. I mean, I can talk to you, don\u2019t get me wrong. But I just want to make sure I don\u2019t, like I said before, just jam myself up. And I\u2019ll tell you everything that I know. This is my word.\u201d We find Hilliard\u2019s statements in this regard, when considered in their context, constituted a clear and unequivocal request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Like the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Redmond, </em>we have \u201cindependently] review[ed]\u201d the videotape of Hilliard\u2019s custodial interrogation and we have given \u201cdue weight to the inferences drawn from the historical facts therein.\u201d <em>Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 330, 568 S.E.2d at 700. From that examination, we conclude that Hilliard\u2019s statements could only be understood by reasonable officers, under the circumstances at issue in this case, as an unambiguous assertion of his right to counsel. \u201c[T]he historical facts such as the context,\u201d <em>id., </em>of Hilliard\u2019s question, \u201cthe circumstances leading up to the request,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>469 U.S. at 97-98,105 S.Ct. at 494, \u201cthe tone of his voice, his voice inflections, and his demeanor,\u201d in totality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>support the reasonable conclusion that Hilliard clearly requested the presence of counsel before police proceeded further with the interrogation, <em>Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 330, 568 S.E.2d at 700. <em>See also Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355 (noting \u201ca suspect need not \u2018speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Dumas, </em>750 A.2d 420, 425 (R.I.2000) (\u201cWe believe that the statement, \u2018Can I get a lawyer?\u2019 <em>could be sufficiently clear in some circumstances </em>to meet this standard. In normal parlance, this syntactic phraseology is an acceptable and reasonable way to frame a request. A suspect asserting his or her right to counsel need not speak with perfect formality, but may use any manner of colloquial speech, so long as his or her statement would be reasonably understood as a request for an attorney.\u201d (emphasis added) (footnote omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For these reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of Hilliard\u2019s motion to suppress to the extent that it held Hilliard\u2019s final \u201crequest\u201d for counsel was \u201cequivocated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Our analysis, however, does not end there. We note that, after the officers acknowledged Hilliard\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJF\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Okay. That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">DETECTIVE KOCHELL: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">HILLIARD: I\u2019m not saying that I will say anything other or just because he\u2019s in here. I just want to, you know, make sure I have ... I\u2019d feel a little bit more comfortable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ady\">DETECTIVE KOCHELL: That\u2019s not a problem. We tried to provide you with a comfortable atmosphere here. And, like I said, it\u2019s not the stuff that you see on TV dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Sipowicz, okay, where he takes a guy and throws him up on the wall. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">HILLIARD: I will say, I will go as far as to say this. Probably what you all got in that book ain\u2019t nowhere near.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">While it is true that, pursuant to <em>Miranda, </em>\u201cif the suspect requests counsel at any time during the interrogation, the interrogation must cease until an attorney has been made available to the suspect or the suspect reinitiates the interrogation,\u201did at 328, 568 S.E.2d at 698 (citing <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. at 1885), we recognized in <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 15, 371 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1988), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">[I]nterrogation includes ... express questioning [and] its \u201cfunctional equivalent.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689-90, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). The [United States Supreme] Court defined the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of questioning as \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect,\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a suspect\u2019s statement was not foreseeable, then it is volunteered. \u201cVolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by <em>[Miranda].\u201d Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630. We interpret the <em>Innis </em>standard as requiring a determination whether an objective observer would view an officer\u2019s words or actions as designed to elicit an incriminating response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The record establishes that neither Detective Kochell nor Detective White asked Hilliard any questions after he invoked his right to counsel and before he stated: \u201cI will say, I will go as far as to say this. Probably what you all got in that book ain\u2019t nowhere near.\u201d Moreover, it can hardly be argued that Detective Kochell\u2019s statements about the \u201ccomfortable atmosphere\u201d and the fictional television police officer were words that an objective observer would view as \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d from Hilliard. It is thus clear that Hilliard\u2019s statement in that regard was a \u201cvolun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>teered statement\u201d and, therefore, its admissibility is not affected by <em>Miranda-, Edwards, </em>or any invocation of Hilliard\u2019s right to counsel. Consequently, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Hilliard\u2019s motion to suppress as to this particular statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Nonetheless, the discussion between police and Hilliard continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">DETECTIVE WHITE: I\u2019m not with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">HILLIARD: I\u2019m just saying, what you all probably have in that book, I doubt that it\u2019s anywhere near it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Anywhere near ... of what we know of why it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">HILLIARD: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Well, that\u2019s why we want to hear from you, because we know there\u2019s a bigger picture there. Okay? You know what the problem is, [Hilliard], is that you got caught up in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">HILLIARD: Yeah, I did. I was there. I\u2019m going to just say that, I was there. But before I say anything else, I mean, I already talked to you before we go to court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">Clearly, Hilliard\u2019s statement about his presence at the scene of the crime was produced as a result of express questioning by the officers. As stated above, that questioning should have ceased immediately after it became clear to the officers that Hilliard invoked his right to counsel. Thus, the trial court should have suppressed Hilliard\u2019s statement in that regard. Because the trial court found that statement \u201ccould be inculpatory, and ... a declaration against [Hilliard\u2019s] interest,\u201d we reverse Hilliard\u2019s convictions on this ground and remand this matter for further proceedings if the Commonwealth is so inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">Hilliard next contends the police officers also violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, because the September 16,1999 interrogation occurred \u201cpost-indictment.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered \u201cat or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated ...

However, the Commonwealth contends that Hilliard\u2019s contention in this regard was not properly preserved pursuant to Rule 5A:18. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">It is well-settled that \u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">The main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals.

Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991) (citation omitted). Thus, the Court of Appeals will not consider an argument on appeal that was not presented to the trial court. <em>See Ohree v.

That rule applies to constitutional claims, as well as non-constitutional claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">While we recognize that Hilliard made a bare reference to the Sixth Amendment in his broadly-written motion to suppress, we would be remiss if we did not likewise acknowledge that Hilliard\u2019s counsel made not a single reference to the Sixth Amendment during the hearing on his motion to suppress. In fact, Hilliard\u2019s counsel did not mention that police spoke with Hilliard \u201cpost-indictment,\u201d nor did he remotely contend that police deliberately or designedly elicited information from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel. <em>See Fellers, </em>540 U.S. at-, 124 S.Ct. at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">As indicated above, the contemporaneous objection rule\u2014 Rule 5A:18\u2014\u201crequires ... that a party inform the trial court of the action it wishes the court to take or its objection to the action of the court and the \u2018grounds therefor.\u2019\u201d <em>Lash v.

While the rule does not prohibit reliance on statutes or cases not presented to the trial court, it does require that any position on appeal be \u201cadequately presented\u201d below. <em>Id. </em>at 929, 421 S.E.2d at 853. That did not occur here. In fact, because Hilliard\u2019s counsel did not raise the issue of the Sixth Amendment during the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth had no opportunity to respond and the trial court had no opportunity to render a ruling on that issue. Thus, we find that Hilliard is now barred from raising that issue for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18. Moreover, because Hilliard has not argued on appeal that any exception to Rule 5A:18 would apply to the circumstances presented in this case, we do not address the issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Hilliard\u2019s motion to suppress as it relates to any statements Hilliard made to police prior to what we have here determined to be his unequivocal request for counsel. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>further affirm the trial court\u2019s decision not to suppress his volunteered statement, but find that the trial court erred in denying the motion as it related to any statements he made thereafter. As we have found those statements to be inculpatory, we reverse Hilliard\u2019s convictions for murder (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32), use of a firearm in the commission of murder (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1), maliciously shooting into an occupied vehicle (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-154), and discharging a firearm on or within 1000 feet of school property (in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-280(B)), and remand this matter for further proceedings if the Commonwealth is so inclined.

Under the circumstances, Hilliard \u201carticulate[d] his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand [each of] the statements] to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the trial judge erred in failing to suppress the statements, all of which were obtained in violation of Hilliard\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In his motion to suppress, Hilliard alleged that \u201cevidence was obtained dining that interview ... in violation of the fourth, fifth and sixth amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d I would hold that this motion was sufficient to apprise the trial judge of the action Hilliard desired the judge to take and the legal basis for the motion. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-384 (providing that \u201c[n]o party, after having made an objection or motion known to the court, shall be required to make such objection or motion again in order to preserve his right to appeal\u201d). I would also hold, therefore, that Rule 5A:18 does not preclude this Court from considering Hilliard\u2019s claim of a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Recently, the United States Supreme Court addressed this precise Sixth Amendment protection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASj\">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered \u201cat or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>... \u201cwhether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brewer v.

We have held that an accused is denied \u201cthe basic protections\u201d of the Sixth Amendment \u201cwhen there [is] used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents ... deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\u201d <em>Massiah v.

United States, </em>540 U.S 519,-, 124 S.Ct. 1019, 1022 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Under the circumstances I have addressed above, the record clearly established that the officers interrogated Hilliard post-indictment and ignored his invocation of his right to an attorney. Indeed, Hilliard told the detectives: \u201cI already have a lawyer. I would feel more comfortable with him here.\u201d Yet, the interrogation continued in violation of the Sixth Amendment. I would hold, therefore, that the trial judge erred in failing to suppress the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge erred in denying the motion to suppress the incriminating statements, and I would reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<author id=\"b727-10\">CLEMENTS, J., with whom BUMGARDNER, FELTON and KELSEY, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASO\">join, concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">I join with that portion of Judge Humphreys\u2019s opinion holding that, having failed to properly preserve his claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated, Hilliard is barred from raising that issue for the first time on appeal. I further concur with Judge Humphreys\u2019s decision that neither of Hilliard\u2019s first two purported requests for an attorney during the custodial interrogation constituted a clear invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel. However, I disagree with Judge Humphreys and Judge Benton\u2019s view that Hilliard\u2019s third \u201crequest\u201d was a \u201cclear and unequivocal request for counsel,\u201d requiring the cessation of the interrogation and the suppression of Hilliard\u2019s subsequent inculpatory statements. Hence, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision that the trial court erred in denying Hilliard\u2019s motion to suppress his inculpatory statements to police, and, for the reasons that follow, I would affirm Hilliard\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">I. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Hilliard contends, on appeal, that he made three requests for an attorney during the September 16, 1999 custodial interrogation by police. He argues that his clear invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel required the immediate cessation of the interrogation and the suppression of the incriminating statements he thereafter gave to police when the interrogation was not terminated. Finding that Hilliard\u2019s purported requests for counsel were not clear and unequivocal invocations of his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, I would hold that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">It is well settled that \u201claw enforcement officers must immediately cease questioning a suspect who has clearly asserted his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 454, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2352,129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (citing <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981)). In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[t]o avoid difficulties of proof and to provide guidance to officers conducting interrogations,\u201d the determination whether an accused invoked the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel is \u201can objective inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458-59, 114 S.Ct. at 2355. The Supreme Court also held, in <em>Davis, </em>that, to invoke the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>suspect must unambiguously request counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459,114 S.Ct. at 2355. The suspect\u2019s reference to counsel \u201c \u2018either is such an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 97-98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 494, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984) (per curiam) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)). The Supreme Court explained that, \u201c[although a suspect need not \u2018speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don,\u2019 he must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>id. </em>at 476, 114 S.Ct. at 2364 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment)). Thus, the Court explained further, \u201cif a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel,\u201d the interrogation need not be ceased. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355. In other words, \u201cafter a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly[, unambiguously, and unequivocally] requests an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356. To require otherwise, the Court noted, \u201c \u201cwould transform the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 114 S.Ct. at 2356 (quoting <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 102, 96 S.Ct. 321, 326, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Aware that its rule requiring suspects wanting assistance of counsel to clearly, unambiguously, and unequivocally invoke the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel was not without its drawbacks, the Supreme Court farther noted, in <em>Davis, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">We recognize that requiring a clear assertion of the right to counsel might disadvantage some suspects who\u2014because of fear, intimidation, lack of linguistic skills, or a variety of other reasons\u2014will not clearly articulate their right to counsel although they actually want to have a lawyer present. But the primary protection afforded suspects subject to custodial interrogation is the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves. \u201cFull comprehension of the rights to remain silent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>and request an attorney [is] sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.\u201d A suspect who knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to counsel after having that right explained to him has indicated his willingness to deal with the police unassisted. Although <em>Edwards </em>provides an additional protection\u2014if a suspect subsequently requests an attorney, questioning must cease\u2014it is one that must be affirmatively invoked by the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 460-61, 114 S.Ct. at 2356 (quoting <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 427, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 1144, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"A2le\">The Supreme Court also noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement,] it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney.... Clarifying questions help protect the rights of the suspect by ensuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one, and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial second-guessing as to the meaning of the suspect\u2019s statement regarding counsel. But we decline to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions. If the suspect\u2019s statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 114 S.Ct. at 2356.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The Supreme Court concluded, in <em>Davis, </em>that the appellant\u2019s statement during the custodial interrogation, \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer,\u201d did not constitute a clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal request for an attorney and, hence, \u201cwas not a request for counsel\u201d requiring cessation of the interrogation or suppression of appellant\u2019s subsequent inculpatory admissions. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 114 S.Ct. at 2357.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Redmond, </em>264 Va. 321, 330, 568 S.E.2d 695, 700 (2002) (plurality opinion), our Supreme Court found that the defendant\u2019s questions during the custodial interrogation, \u201cCan I speak to my lawyer? I can\u2019t even talk to [a] lawyer before I make any kinds of comments or anything?,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>did not constitute \u201ca clear and unambiguous assertion of his right to counsel.\u201d In reaching that decision, the Court applied the \u201csubstantive principles articulated by the [United States] Supreme Court\u201d in <em>Davis, </em>as well as its own precedent, about which it stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis, </em>this Court consistently held that a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to counsel is necessary to invoke the rule [requiring the police to cease an interrogation when the accused requests counsel]. <em>See Mueller v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 396, 422 S.E.2d 380, 387 (1992) (defendant\u2019s question \u201cDo you think I need an attorney here?\u201d not a clear assertion of right to counsel), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1043, 113 S.Ct. 1880, 123 L.Ed.2d 498 (1993); <em>Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 250, 252-54, 397 S.E.2d 385, 393, 395-96 (1990) (defendant\u2019s question \u201cYou did say I could have an attorney if I wanted one?\u201d not a clear assertion of right to an attorney), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 824, 112 S.Ct. 88, 116 L.Ed.2d 60 (1991); <em>Poyner v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 410, 329 S.E.2d 815, 823 (defendant\u2019s question \u201cDidn\u2019t you say I have the right to an attorney?\u201d not a clear assertion of right to counsel), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865, 106 S.Ct. 189, 88 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985). And, this Court applied <em>Davis </em>in <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 266-67, 462 S.E.2d 112, 115 (1995) (defendant\u2019s statement \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer\u201d not a clear assertion of right to counsel).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 568 S.E.2d at 699-700. Holding that \u201ca reasonable police officer ... would have concluded that the defendant did not invoke his right to counsel during the custodial interrogation,\u201d the Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the confession he made during the interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 568 S.E.2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Here, the facts pertinent to the third purported request for counsel are undisputed. Approximately an hour after waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Hilliard asked the detectives conducting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the interrogation, \u201cCan I get a lawyer in here?\u201d The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Do you want to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abu\">HILLIARD: I already have a lawyer. I mean, I can talk to you, don\u2019t get me wrong. But I just want to make sure I don\u2019t, like I said before, just jam myself up. And I\u2019ll tell you everything that I know. This is my word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Okay. That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">DETECTIVE KOCHELL: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">HILLIARD: I\u2019m not saying that I will say anything other or just because he\u2019s in here. I just want to, you know, make sure I have ... I\u2019d feel a little bit more comfortable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWD\">DETECTIVE KOCHELL: That\u2019s not a problem. We tried to provide you with a comfortable atmosphere here. And, like I said, it\u2019s not the stuff that you see on TV dealing with Sipowicz, where he takes a guy and throws him up on the wall. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">HILLIARD: I will say, I will go as far as to say this. Probably what you all got in that book ain\u2019t nowhere near.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABd\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Talking about what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">HILLIARD: I\u2019m just saying, what you all probably have in that book, I doubt that it\u2019s anywhere near it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Anywhere near ... of what we know of why it happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\">HILLIARD: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-13\">DETECTIVE WHITE: Well, that\u2019s why we want to hear from you, because we know there\u2019s a bigger picture there. Okay? You know what the problem is, Curtis, is that you got caught up in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-14\">HILLIARD: Yeah, I did. I was there. I\u2019m going to just say that, I was there. But before I say anything else, I mean, I already talked to you before we go to court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">I do not believe that a reasonable police officer in these circumstances would have understood Hilliard\u2019s question, \u201cCan I get a lawyer in here?,\u201d to be an unequivocal request for an attorney within the meaning of <em>Davis </em>or <em>Redmond. </em>Certain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ly, Hilliard\u2019s question is no less equivocal than his first two purported requests for counsel or the defendant\u2019s question in <em>Redmond, </em>\u201cCan I speak to my lawyer?\u201d At best, \u201ca reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that [Hilliard] <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355. Likewise, Hilliard\u2019s statements and actions in response to the detective\u2019s follow-up clarifying question, \u201cDo you want to do that?,\u201d were equivocal. Instead of directly answering the detective\u2019s question in the affirmative, Hilliard again merely \u201cexpressed] his reservation about the wisdom of continuing the interrogation without consulting a lawyer\u201d and continued talking to the detectives in a manner that did \u201cnot clearly and unambiguously communicate a desire to invoke his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Midkiff, </em>250 Va. at 267, 462 S.E.2d at 115. Thus, under these circumstances, a reasonable police officer would not have necessarily understood Hilliard to be making an unequivocal request for an attorney. Consequently, because \u201cthe <em>likelihood </em>that a suspect would wish counsel to be present is not the test for applicability of [the rule requiring cessation of the interrogation if the suspect requests counsel],\u201d <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 2209, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991), Hilliard\u2019s reference to a lawyer, like those of the defendants in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Redmond, </em>\u201cfell short of requesting counsel in a clear and unambiguous manner,\u201d <em>Midkiff, </em>250 Va. at 267, 462 S.E.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">I conclude, therefore, that Hilliard\u2019s third purported request for an attorney did not constitute a clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel requiring the cessation of the interrogation and the suppression of Hilliard\u2019s subsequent inculpatory statements. Accordingly, I would hold that the trial court did not err in denying Hilliard\u2019s motion to suppress his admission that he was at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">II. <em>ALLEN </em>CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Hilliard further contends, on appeal, that the trial court\u2019s comments to the jury after receiving notification from the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>during its deliberations in the guilt phase of the trial that it was \u201csplit 10-2\u201d and could not \u201creach a unanimous decision\u201d were improper. The court\u2019s comments, Hilliard argues, \u201csuggested that the jury would be kept until unanimity was reached\u201d and amounted to a coercive Allen<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> charge that, in effect, instructed the two jurors in the minority to change their votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The Commonwealth contends that Rule 5A:18 bars this Court\u2019s consideration of this issue, because Hilliard made no contemporaneous objection to the judge\u2019s remarks. I agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In applying Rule 5A:18, this Court has held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">[wjhere an accused alleges that the trial court has made improper remarks in the presence of the jury but fails contemporaneously to object, request a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial, he waives the right to challenge those remarks on appeal. \u201cA motion for a mistrial is untimely and properly refused when it is made after the jury has retired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-8\"><em>Humbert v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 783, 791, 514 S.E.2d 804, 808 (1999) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 39, 393 S.E.2d 599, 606 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">In this case, Hilliard made no contemporaneous objection to the trial court\u2019s remarks. While he initially objected to the giving of an <em>Allen </em>charge, once the trial court stated its intentions and gave its remarks, Hilliard did not contemporaneously object. Indeed, he did nothing before the jury retired to apprise the trial court that the remarks were erroneous or improper in any way. He neither requested a cautionary instruction nor moved for a mistrial. It was not until sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ing, several weeks later, that he moved to have the verdict set aside. The issue, therefore, was not properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Moreover, my review of the record in this case does not reveal any reason to invoke the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions to Rule 5A:18. Consequently, I would hold that this claim of error is procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">III. SENTENCING INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Hilliard also contends, on appeal, that the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury that multiple sentences are presumptively consecutive. He also contends the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on the possibility of parole, specifically the singular circumstance of geriatric release.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The Commonwealth contends that Rule 5A:18 likewise bars this Court\u2019s consideration of these issues, because Hilliard did not object to the instruction the trial court gave in response to the jury\u2019s questions concerning parole and the concurrency of the sentences. Again, I agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Although Hilliard initially asked the trial court to answer the jury\u2019s questions by instructing the jury that multiple sentences are presumptively consecutive, he made no contemporaneous objection to the trial court\u2019s reasoning and ruling to the contrary or to the court\u2019s instruction in response to the jury\u2019s question regarding the concurrency of the sentences. Likewise, Hilliard made no contemporaneous objection to the court\u2019s instruction with respect to the issue of parole. Hilliard\u2019s failure to properly preserve these issues precludes this Court from considering his \u201cchallenges to jury instructions raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jerman, </em>263 Va. 88, 93-94, 556 S.E.2d 754, 757-58 (2002) (holding that defendant \u201cwas required to state any objection to the circuit court\u2019s instruction and to ask the court for any other instruction on the subject that he deemed necessary\u201d and his failure to timely do so \u201cbars his present challenge to that instruction\u201d); <em>see also Cherrix v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 292, 311, 513 S.E.2d 642, 654 (1999) (holding that defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to proffer a parole eligibility instruction and his failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>to object to the trial court\u2019s instruction in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry ... precludes us from addressing the merits of this assignment of error\u201d); Rule 5A:18. Hence, finding no reason to invoke the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions to Rule 5A:18, I would hold that this claim of error is also procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">IV.
