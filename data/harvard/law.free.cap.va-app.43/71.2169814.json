Appellant contends that the Mattaponi Indian Tribe improperly barred him from its reservation. Thus, the Commonwealth failed to prove appellant was forbidden to \u201cgo[ ] upon or remain upon\u201d the reservation by the \u201cperson lawfully in charge thereof.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-119. For the reasons that follow, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">On appeal, we review the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the party prevailing below. <em>Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997). That principle requires us to discard the evidence of the defendant in conflict with the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and regard as true all evidence favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Watkins v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So viewed, the record shows that appellant trespassed upon the Mattaponi Indian Reservation on February 23, 2002 after having been forbidden to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth presented one witness, Mark Custalow, a member of the tribal council of the Mattaponi Indian tribe, who testified he saw appellant on the reservation on February 23, 2002. He further testified that, after a tribal council meeting on November 3, 2000, the council voted to expel appellant from the reservation for a period of two years. The council subsequently extended the expulsion by one year because appellant violated the tribal council\u2019s ruling. Mark Custalow testified that the matter was also voted upon at a tribal meeting. He stated that the tribal meeting was a regular meeting of the tribe and that \u201csomewhere in the neighborhood of less than one-half of tribal members show up at the regular meetings.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">The written statement of facts asserts that the trial court took judicial notice that in a previous circuit court civil case an appeal of the Tribal Council\u2019s decision to bar [appellant] from the reservation was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds and, therefore, the council\u2019s decision stood. The trial court noted that the prior matter had collateral estoppel effect upon the issue of whether [appellant] was barred from the reservation. [Appellant] argued that a civil matter cannot have collateral estoppel effect upon a criminal matter due to, among other things, the differing standards of proof. The court overruled this argument and noted [appellant\u2019s] exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Appellant subsequently argued that he could not be convicted \u201cunless there was ... a vote of a majority of the members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of the tribe voting [in] favor of such a barring.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe trial court rejected this defense and [appellant] noted his exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The trial court subsequently convicted appellant of trespassing and sentenced him to serve six months in jail and to pay a $1,000 fine. The trial court suspended the jail term in its entirety and suspended $800 of the $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">On appeal, appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court err[ed] in finding [him] guilty of trespassing upon the Mattaponi Indian Reservation [because] there was evidence that the tribal council did not follow the proper procedure in barring [him] from the reservation^]\u201d Appellant further claims that the trial court erred in finding that the \u201cdismissal of [the] prior civil appeal of [his] barring from the reservation on jurisdictional grounds had collateral estoppel [sic] in the instant proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Before reaching the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments, we note two troubling inconsistencies in the appellant\u2019s written statement of facts. First, the record reflects that the original written statement of facts, which was initially filed in this appeal, did not contain the paragraph quoted above concerning the trial court \u201cnot[ing]\u201d the \u201ccollateral estoppel effect\u201d of appellant\u2019s expulsion and subsequent appeal. However, because the trial court failed to sign the original written statement of facts, we remanded the matter for appropriate action pursuant to Rules 5A:8(c)(2) or 5A:8(d). The written statement of facts that was subsequently filed was signed by the trial court and contained this additional paragraph. Nevertheless, the trial court\u2019s handwritten notes on the \u201cMisdemeanor/Traffie Order\u201d for the trial of July 24, 2002, reflect only that the court took \u201cjudicial notice\u201d that appellant had \u201cnotice\u201d of the expulsion, due to the previous \u201ccourt case.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The trial court\u2019s notes make no mention of the words \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d or \u201ccollateral attack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Second, although both written statements of fact reflect that appellant noted his exceptions to the challenged rulings, the trial court\u2019s handwritten notes do not reflect such \u201cexceptions.\u201d In fact, the trial court\u2019s notes specifically state that its conclusion that Custalow was \u201cproperly excluded from [the] reservation\u201d \u201ccame in without objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Despite the above, because the trial court\u2019s handwritten notes concerning the trial proceedings do not take the form of an order, and because the final, typewritten \u201cMisdemeanor Trial Order\u201d makes no reference to these matters, we assume without here deciding, that the written statement of facts does not conflict with the trial court\u2019s order and that appellant properly preserved his appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Turning to the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments, we first note that Code \u00a7 18.2-119 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">If any person without authority of law goes upon or remains upon the lands, buildings or premises of another, or any portion or area thereof, after having been forbidden to do so, either orally or in writing, by the owner, lessee, custodian or other person lawfully in charge thereof ... he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Appellant argues insufficient evidence existed to establish that those \u201clawfully in charge\u201d of the reservation forbade him from going on the reservation. Specifically, appellant claims the tribal council did not follow the proper procedure in barring him. In support of his argument, appellant cites to the Acts of the Assembly, 1896 Va. Acts ch. 848, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of Virginia, That an act entitled an act to appoint trustees for the Mattaponi tribe of Indians of King William county, and to prescribe their duties as such trustees, approved March eight, eighteen hundred and ninety-four, be amended and re-enacted so as to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u00a7 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of Virginia, That Doctor B. Richards, R.C. Hill, senior, L.D. Robinson, J.S. Robinson and W.T. Neale be, and they are hereby, appointed trustees for the Mattaponi Indian tribe, in King William county, Virginia, formerly known as a branch of the Pamunkey Indian tribe. Said trustees shall be governed by the laws now in force in regard to Indians and their reservations in this state; and, further, shall have the right upon the vote of the majority of the trustees, and also a majority of the members of the tribe above twenty-one years of age, to expel from their reservation, any person who has no right upon said reservation, or any member of the tribe who shall be guilty of any lawful offense: provided that any person expelled from said reservation shall have the right of appeal to the county court of King William from the decision of the trustees and the members of the tribe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">2. This act shall be in force from its passage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Based upon this legislation, appellant contends that the <em>only </em>manner in which he could have been barred from the Mattaponi reservation was pursuant to a \u201cvote of the majority of the trustees), and also a majority of the members of the tribe above twenty-one years of age.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because evidence in the record established that, after the tribal council voted to bar appellant from the reservation, they finalized his expulsion after a tribal meeting, and because Mark Custalow testified that \u201csomewhere in the neighborhood of less than one-half of the tribal members show up at the regular meetings,\u201d appellant claims that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he was barred from the reservation upon a vote of \u201ca majority of the members of the tribe above twenty-one years of age.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The Indian Treaty of 1677, between the King of England, acting through the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, and the Indian tribes constituting what is generally referred to by historians as the Powhatan Confederacy including what is now known as the Mattaponi Indian Tribe, specifically provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">II. ... [T]he said Indian Kings &amp; Queens and their Subjects shall hold their lands, and have the same confirmed to them and their posterity by Patent under the Seale of this his Majesties Colony, without any fee gratuity or Reward for ye same, in such sort, and in as free and f\u00edrme manner as other his Majesties Liege Subjects, have and enjoye their Lands, and possessions....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">III. That all Indians who are in amity with us, <em>&amp; </em>have not land siffitient to plant up, be upon information forthwith provided for, and laid out, and confirmed to them as affores\u2019d never to be disturbed therein, or taken from them, soe long as they owne keep and maintaine the due obedience &amp; Subjection to his Majestie his Govern\u2019r and Government; &amp; amity &amp; friendship towards the English.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Treaty Between Virginia and the Indians (1677).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Pursuant to the Treaty, the Commonwealth has recognized that although it maintains a fee simple interest in the reservation, that interest is \u201csubject to the exclusive use and occupancy of the [tribe] possessing Indian title to the land.\u201d 2001 Va. Att\u2019y Gen. 36. Nevertheless, over the hundreds of years since the signing of the Treaty, the legislature has \u201cfrequently appointed trustees to lease the surplus lands of the[ ] tribe[ ] and empowered the trustees to prosecute actions against persons trespassing thereon.\u201d 1917 Va. Att\u2019y Gen. 160. It was exactly for that purpose that 1894 Va. Acts ch. 845, and its amended version, 1896 Va. Acts ch. 843, was enacted. <em>Id.; see also </em>1917 Va. Att\u2019y Gen. 161 (recognizing that the trustees were appointed to provide \u201cprotection and assistance\u201d to the Tribe \u201cin carrying out their by-laws and in governing their tribe and reservation,\u201d including prosecuting actions at law (or \u201cin tort\u201d) against trespassers (quoting 1894 Va. Acts ch. 845)). Appellant points to no authority for his supposition that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Acts were intended to provide the sole method by which the Mattaponi could expel or forbid an individual from \u201ccoming upon the reservation,\u201d nor do we find any such authority. <em>Cf. Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 366, 378, 541 S.E.2d 920, 926 (2001) (recognizing that the Mattaponi Tribe \u201cpossesses!,] in its own right!,] justiciable interests\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Accordingly, because the evidence before the trial court established, without dispute, that the Tribal Council<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at a regular tribal meeting voted to bar Custalow from the reservation, and, because the Supreme Court of Virginia has specifically recognized that the Tribal Council is the \u201cgovernmental body\u201d of the sovereign Mattaponi Tribe, we find the evidence was sufficient to establish that Custalow was forbidden from entering the reservation by those \u201clawfully in charge thereof.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Report of the Joint Subcommittee Studying </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Relationships Between the Commonwealth and Native Indian Tribes to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia, </em>House Document No. 10, at 4 (1983) (recognizing that the treaty between the Commonwealth and the Mattaponi included provisions for possession of tribal reservations and \u201cthe right of internal tribal government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We likewise disagree with appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly attributed \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d effect to the King William County Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of the expulsion. Indeed, the written statement of facts indicates only that the \u201ctrial court noted that the prior matter had collateral estoppel effect upon the issue of whether defendant was barred from the reservation.\u201d This language comports with the trial court\u2019s handwritten notes, indicating that it considered the prior adjudication only as evidence of \u201cnotice\u201d to Custalow that he had been barred from the reservation. It does not establish, as Custalow contends, that the trial court considered that adjudication as preclusive with regard to whether Custalow was barred from the reservation by someone \u201clawfully in charge thereof.\u201d Indeed, the written statement of facts proves that the trial court took evidence, from Mark Custalow, on that very issue\u2014evidence which appellant did not dispute\u2014and found that appellant was \u201cproperly excluded from [the] reservation.\u201d We find no error in that determination and we, thus, affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">. In lieu of a transcript, appellant has submitted a written statement of facts pursuant to Rule 5A:8(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\">.

The written statement of facts does not reflect that appellant submitted legal authority for this proposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\">. <em>See Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 280-81, 257 S.E.2d 808, 822 (1979) (holding that, where an order conflicts with a transcript of a related proceeding, the order is presumed to be an accurate reflection of what transpired); <em>see also Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 506, 509, 413 S.E.2d 75, 77 (1992) (observing that, because transcripts and written statements of fact serve the same purpose on appeal, policies concerning them should be reasonably analogous); <em>Ange v. York/Poquoson Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>37 Va.App. 615, 623 n. 7, 560 S.E.2d 474, 478 n. 7 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">. The dissent asserts the Commonwealth failed to prove \"those 'lawfully in charge\u2019 of the reservation forbade Custalow from 'going upon\u2019 their land because it presented no evidence that a majority of the tribal members over twenty-one years of age voted to expel him as required by 1896 Va. Acts ch. 843 (the Act).\u201d This, of course, presupposes that the Mattaponi Tribe and its elected leaders have no \"lawful\u201d authority or control over their own tribal lands. We disagree with this supposition. Moreover, as implicitly noted in <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>the 19th century paternalistic approach toward the Commonwealth\u2019s Native American citizens, as embodied in the Act, has evidently and appropriately evolved into a relationship that recognizes that they have justiciable interests in their own right. 261 Va. at 378, 541 S.E.2d at 926.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">. The dissent states that \"[b]oth parties treat the terms, 'tribal council\u2019 and 'tribal trustees,\u2019 synonymously. There is no contention that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the trustees acted properly; the issue on appeal is whether it proved that a majority of the tribal members over the age of twenty-one voted to expel as required by the Act.\u201d In asserting legal insufficiency of the evidence, the appellant makes no such concession. Furthermore, the 1897 Act specifically named \"Doctor B. Richards, R.C. Hill, senior, L.D. Robinson, J.S. Robinson and W.T. Neale\u201d as trustees and provided no mechanism for their replacement upon resignation or death, nor does it appear that any subsequent statute provided such a mechanism or directly appointed new trustees. Therefore, the logic of the dissent would necessarily dictate that the exclusive \"lawful authority\u201d to bar individuals from the Mattaponi reservation is a majority of those individuals named over a century ago, together with a majority of the tribal membership over twenty-one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b125-7\">ANNUNZIATA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">I respectfully dissent because I would find that the Commonwealth failed to establish that Charles Custalow (Charles) was expelled from the reservation by those \u201clawfully in charge\u201d as required by the criminal trespass statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">It is well established that the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution \u201cprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Here, the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the criminal trespass statute. Specifically, the Commonwealth failed to prove that those \u201clawfully in charge\u201d of the reservation forbade Charles from \u201cgoing upon\u201d their land because it presented no evidence that a majority of the tribal members over twenty-one years of age voted to expel him as required by 1896 Va. Acts ch. 843 (the Act). The Act states that the trustees of the tribe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALF\">shall have the right upon the vote of the majority of the trustees, and also a majority of the members of the tribe above twenty-one years of age, to expel from their reservation, any person who has no right upon said reservation, or any member of the tribe who shall be guilty of any lawful offense[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">1896 Va. Acts ch. 843. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, the Act does not establish \u201ctwo ways to bar an individual from the reservation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A plain reading reveals that the terms, \u201cmajority of the trustees\u201d and \u201cmajority of the members of the tribe over twenty-one years of age,\u201d are stated in the conjunctive; in other words, both conditions must be satisfied for a proper expulsion. A \u201cplain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Here, the Commonwealth failed to establish that a majority of the tribal members over twenty-one years of age voted to expel Charles. Mark Custalow (Mark), the Commonwealth\u2019s main witness, testified that Charles was expelled by vote of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the \u201ctribal council.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He further testified that the tribal council voted at a tribal meeting and that \u201csomewhere in the neighborhood of less than one-half of the tribal members show up at the regular meetings.\u201d The meeting which resulted in Charles\u2019s expulsion was described as a \u201cregular meeting.\u201d In order to find compliance with the Act, the trial court would have had to infer that, although fewer than a majority of the members were present, a majority of those over twenty-one years of age, in fact, were present and voted to expel Charles. Although we grant all reasonable inferences to the Commonwealth, the inference must be a \u201clogical deduction or conclusion from established fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Grow, </em>394 F.2d 182, 199 (4th Cir.1968). Neither Mark\u2019s testimony establishing that the \u201ctribal council\u201d voted to expel Charles or his testimony that \u201csomewhere in the neighborhood of less than one-half of the tribal members\u201d were present at the meeting permit the reasonable inference that a majority of tribal members over the age of twenty-one voted to expel Charles.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The only evidence that persons \u201clawfully in charge\u201d of the reservation expelled Charles is Mark\u2019s testimony that the \u201ctribal council,\u201d the entity which voted to expel Charles, \u201cdetermines ... who can be barred from the reservation.\u201d His statement is patently inconsistent with the voting requirements set forth by the Act and Ms testimony regarding a matter of law is not binding on this Court. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 142, 147, 590 S.E.2d 572, 574-75 (2004) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The majority affirms Charles\u2019s conviction for trespassing, not on the ground that the Commonwealth\u2019s proof established he was expelled from the reservation by the vote mandated by the Act, but rather on the ground that Charles failed to prove that the Act prescribes the exclusive means of expulsion from the Mattapom Indian Tribe\u2019s reservation. Neither the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>monwealth nor the majority points to any authority in support of the proposition that the Act does not establish the only valid procedure for expelling a member from the reservation. Indeed, the Commonwealth did not raise such an argument at trial or on appeal. Rather, its arguments were, and continue to be, confined to whether its proof of the authority to expel met the requirements of the Act, i.e. that the tribal council, acting alone, had the authority to expel and that, in the alternative, the evidence established that a majority of tribal members over the age of twenty-one voted to expel Charles from the reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In summary, I would find that the Commonwealth failed to prove all elements of the crime of trespass, as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-119, because it presented no evidence that those \u201clawfully in charge\u201d of the reservation, as defined by the Act, voted to expel Charles. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. In its brief, the Commonwealth argued that \"the plain reading of [1896 Va. Acts ch. 843] demonstrates that there are two ways to bar an individual from the reservation: (1) the vote of the majority of the trustees 'and also' (2) a majority of the members of the tribe who are above the age of 21.\u201d It concluded that, because the record established that \"a majority of the trustees voted to bar the defendant,\" the Commonwealth did not have to prove that a majority of tribal members over the age of twenty-one voted to expel Charles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">. Both parties treat the terms, \"tribal council\u201d and \"tribal trustees,\" synonymously. There is no contention that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the trustees acted properly; the issue on appeal is whether it proved that a majority of the tribal members over the age of twenty-one voted to expel as required by the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
