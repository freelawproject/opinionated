FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Floyd Gordon Clements (appellant) was convicted in a bench trial of driving after being declared a habitual offender, second or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in finding that the Commonwealth sufficiently proved the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) had complied with a notice provision found in former Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">During a traffic stop for speeding, appellant was unable to produce an operator\u2019s license. He indicated he had no license, stating, \u201cI know I\u2019m suspended, I\u2019ve been suspended since 1992.\u201d DMV records revealed that appellant previously was determined to be a habitual offender. Appellant was arrested for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>At trial, the Commonwealth introduced a copy of an Order of Revocation, issued by DMV and dated May 5, 1997. The Order of Revocation included appellant\u2019s name and last known address. The order advised appellant that his privilege to drive was revoked indefinitely, effective June 4, 1997, because he was determined a habitual offender by the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The Commonwealth also submitted a DMV form, titled \u201cSuspension/Revocation/Disqualification Notice,\u201d dated April 1, 2000. This form advised appellant that his license had been revoked as a result of DMVs determination that he was a habitual offender. The form further explained that appellant was not allowed to operate a motor vehicle in Virginia until he had complied with the requirements stated in the previously issued habitual offender order. Appellant signed the notice, indicating personal receipt. The notice also indicated appellant had surrendered his driver\u2019s license to the officer who served the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The Commonwealth also introduced into evidence a copy of a conviction order, dated March 26, 2001, finding appellant guilty of driving after having been declared a habitual offender. The conviction order showed appellant was represented by counsel and was sentenced on the charge. Appellant never appealed that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Finally, the Commonwealth introduced a copy of appellant\u2019s DMV record, showing (1) his last known address; (2) issuance of a license to drive on December 2, 1994; (3) a revocation of his driving privileges pursuant to the habitual offender process on May 5, 1997, effective on June 4, 1997; and (4) notice of delivery of the revocation on May 17, 1997, which was not accepted by appellant. The DMV transcript showed appellant had not changed his address since November 1998, and he was still a habitual offender on November 8, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Appellant moved to strike the evidence, arguing the Commonwealth presented no evidence that the DMV Commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>er complied with the notice provision of Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A), which required that the Commissioner mail a certified copy with return receipt requested to appellant. He claimed this mailing requirement in Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A) was an element of the instant felony crime. Appellant also argued that the Revocation Order was void, contending the mailing requirement was necessary to confer subject matter jurisdiction on DMV. The trial court overruled the motion to strike and convicted appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>\u25a0 </em>On appeal, appellant contends the underlying Order of Revocation was defective because the Commonwealth did not prove that the Commissioner used the appropriate mailing procedures. Appellant does not claim DMV lacked statutory authority<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to determine he was a habitual offender nor does he claim he was improperly determined a habitual offender. Instead, he limits his argument to the proposition that the mailing requirement of Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A) was not met. Based on this argument, appellant asks this Court to declare the Order of Revocation void. The Commonwealth contends appellant\u2019s position is a collateral attack on the Order of Revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A) authorized the Commissioner of DMV to determine a driver was a habitual offender and \u201crevoke the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\u201d It also included the following language: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A). Thus, the statute required the Commissioner to mail notice of the finding to appellant via certified mail with return receipt requested.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Commissioner shall immediately notify the person of the revocation and or his right to file a petition and request a hearing as provided in subsection B. Such notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, deliver to addressee only, to the address for the person contained in the Department\u2019s records. The revocation shall become effective thirty days from the date on which the notice was mailed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u201cThere is a presumption that public officials will obey the law.\u201d <em>Hinderliter v. Humphries, </em>224 Va. 439, 448, 297 S.E.2d 684, 689 (1982). <em>See also Hladys v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 145, 148, 366 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1988) (noting the appellate courts presume \u201cthat public officials have acted correctly\u201d). Similarly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">[a]s a general principle, when a prior order of a court with jurisdiction to hear a matter is collaterally attacked, \u201cthe Commonwealth is entitled to a presumption of regularity which attends the prior [judgment] because \u2018every act of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be presumed to have been rightly done, till the contrary appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nicely v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 579, 584, 490 S.E.2d 281, 283 (1997) (quoting <em>Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 30, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992)) (other citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL\"><em>Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 620, 624, 500 S.E.2d 823, 824-25 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Clearly, the DMV Commissioner is a public official. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-201, -202 (codifying the appointment of the commissioner by the governor and his oath of office); \u00a7 42.1-77 (including in the definition of \u201cpublic official\u201d any person \u201cholding any office created ... by any act of the General Assembly\u201d). Appellant does not argue otherwise. Appellant also does not offer any evidence that the Commissioner violated his statutory duty to mail the revocation notice. He simply contends the Commonwealth did not prove the mailing was consistent with the statutory requirement. Given the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the presumption of regularity stands, and appellant\u2019s argument fails. <em>See Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 854, 856-57, 406 S.E.2d 417, 418 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">As we presume the Commissioner followed the statute\u2019s requirements for mailing appellant\u2019s notice, we do not address whether failure to comply with the mailing requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-352(A) renders the revocation order void, whether the mailing requirement is an element of the offense, or whether appellant\u2019s position is a collateral attack on the revocation order. We conclude the Commissioner complied with the mailing requirement and, thus, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-12\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-352 was repealed in 1999. 1999 Va. Acts ch. 945, 987. Neither party discusses the implications of this repeal on the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\">.
