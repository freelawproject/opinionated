On appeal, Jefferson contends the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (trial court) erred in ruling that his indictment and conviction were not barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 even though he had previously been convicted, based upon the same underlying incident, of carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308. Finding no error, we affirm Jefferson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The relevant facts in this appeal are not in dispute. On November 3, 2002, Richmond City Police Officer Hawkins Kuper observed Jefferson driving a car with a large hole in the windshield. Kuper stopped Jefferson and asked him for his driver\u2019s license and registration. Jefferson informed Kuper that his driver\u2019s license was suspended. Kuper told Jefferson to step out of the car. After getting out of the car, Jefferson attempted to flee, but Kuper grabbed him from behind. As Jefferson and Kuper struggled, a handgun fell out of Jefferson\u2019s waistband onto the street. After other officers assisted in placing Jefferson under arrest, Kuper retrieved the fully loaded handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">After his arrest, Jefferson told Officer Kuper that he had just been convicted of possession of heroin, a felony, but had not yet begun serving his sentence. That night, the police obtained warrants against Jefferson for several offenses. However, because Jefferson\u2019s criminal record at the time did not reflect his previous conviction of possession of heroin, the issuing magistrate denied the police\u2019s request to charge Jefferson with possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Instead, Jefferson was charged with carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">On December 20, 2002, the general district court convicted Jefferson on the carrying a concealed weapon charge. Jefferson appealed that conviction to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">On February 3, 2003, Jefferson was indicted by the grand jury on the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Like Jefferson\u2019s conviction in the general district court for carrying a concealed weapon, that charge was based on the November 3, 2002 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">On February 13, 2003, Jefferson withdrew his appeal to the trial court of his carrying a concealed weapon conviction. The trial court affirmed the general district court conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Also on February 13, 2003, Jefferson filed a motion to quash his indictment for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, arguing that the factual basis for the felony prosecution was the \u201csame act\u201d upon which his conviction in the general district court of carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308, had been based. Thus, Jefferson contended the felony prosecution was barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 because he was charged in a successive prosecution with committing an act for which he had already been prosecuted and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On March 10, 2003, the trial court conducted a hearing on Jefferson\u2019s motion and ruled that Jefferson\u2019s indictment constituted a successive, rather than simultaneous, prosecution. The court concluded, however, that Jefferson was not being prosecuted for the \u201csame act\u201d and denied Jefferson\u2019s motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Thereafter, Jefferson was tried and convicted of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Jefferson contends his indictment and conviction on the felony charge of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony was barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 because the basis for that successive prosecution was the \u201csame act\u201d upon which his conviction in the general district court for carrying a concealed weapon had been based.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He claims the underlying act for both offenses was the same because the only act on his part that the Commonwealth had to prove to sustain each conviction was his possession of a concealed firearm. He concludes, therefore, that the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>denying his motion to quash his indictment for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[i]f the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, ... conviction under one of such statutes ... shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.\u201d The statute \u201cprohibits multiple convictions for separate offenses arising out of the same act\u201d where the convictions are obtained in successive, rather than simultaneous, prosecutions. <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 900, 421 S.E.2d 455, 461 (1992) (en banc); <em>Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 548, 551-52, 514 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Here, the trial court determined that Jefferson\u2019s indictment for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, following his conviction in the general district court of carrying a concealed weapon, was a successive prosecution. On appeal, the Commonwealth does not challenge this ruling. Therefore, we assume, without deciding, that, for purposes of this appeal, Jefferson\u2019s prosecution in the instant case constitutes a successive, rather than simultaneous, prosecution. <em>See Correll v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 460 n. 1, 352 S.E.2d 352, 355 n. 1 (1987) (holding that an unchallenged ruling becomes the law of the case by which we are bound).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The sole issue before us, then, is whether Jefferson\u2019s indictment and conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon arose from the \u201csame act,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-294, as his earlier conviction of carrying a concealed weapon. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u201cLike the Fifth Amendment bar of former jeopardy, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 prevents the Commonwealth from \u2018subjecting an accused to the hazards of vexatious, multiple prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips, </em>257 Va. at 551-52, 514 S.E.2d at 342 (quoting <em>Hall, </em>14 Va.App. at 899, 421 S.E.2d at 460).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">However, unlike the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy, which is dependent on \u201cthe identity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>offense, and not the act,\u201d <em>Epps [v. Commonwealth], </em>216 Va. [150,] 153-54, 216 S.E.2d [64,] 68 [(1975)], the prohibition of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 \u201cis dependent upon \u2018the identity of the act,\u2019\u201d rather than the identity of the offense, <em>Lash v. County of Henrico, </em>14 Va.App. 926, 930, 421 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1992) (en banc) (quoting <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 760, 240 S.E.2d 658, 661 (1978)). In other words, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 \u201cspeaks to \u2018acts\u2019 of the accused, not elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 359, 365, 388 S.E.2d 277, 280 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Londono v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 377, 393, 579 S.E.2d 641, 648-49 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Because the prohibition of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 \u201conly \u2018forbids multiple prosecution of offenses springing from the <em>same </em>criminal act,\u2019 \u201d if the \u201cstatutory violations involve different acts, the prohibition is not applicable.\u201d <em>Lash, </em>14 Va.App. at 930, 421 S.E.2d at 853 (quoting <em>Jones, </em>218 Va. at 761, 240 S.E.2d at 661). Thus, \u201ca conviction of one statutory offense does not bar conviction under another statutory offense if each offense could have been proved without the necessity of proving the other.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 625, 628, 401 S.E.2d 208, 210, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>13 Va.App. 281, 411 S.E.2d 228 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201cThe test of whether there are separate acts sustaining several offenses \u2018is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Treu v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 996, 997, 406 S.E.2d 676, 677 (1991) (quoting <em>Estes v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 23, 24, 181 S.E.2d 622, 623-24 (1971)); <em>see also Hundley v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 449, 451, 69 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1952) (holding that a \u201ctest of the identity of acts or offenses is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them; if not, then the fact that several charges relate to and grow out of one transaction or occurrence does not make a single act or offense where two separate acts or offenses are defined by statute\u201d). \u201cIn applying the \u2018same evidence\u2019 test, \u2018the particular criminal transaction must be examined to determine whether the acts are the same in terms of time, situs, victim, and the nature of the act itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 137, 146, 562 S.E.2d 341, 345 (2002) (quoting <em>Hall, </em>14 Va.App. at 898, 421 S.E.2d at 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The resolution of this case is controlled by our decision in <em>Johnson. </em>In <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant was stopped by the police for having an invalid inspection decal. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 562 S.E.2d at 343. Based on the defendant\u2019s statement that his license was suspended, the police charged him with driving on a suspended license. <em>Id. </em>However, because the police computers were inoperable at the time of the traffic stop, the police could not check the defendant\u2019s criminal record. <em>Id. </em>The defendant later pled guilty in general district court to the driving on a suspended license charge and was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 562 S.E.2d at 343. Following that conviction, the police discovered the defendant had been \u201cadjudicated an habitual offender before the traffic stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant was then indicted for driving after having been adjudicated an habitual offender. <em>Id. </em>As in this case, the defendant sought dismissal of the indictment, arguing that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 barred his conviction because both prosecutions involved the \u201csame act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 562 S.E.2d at 344. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In affirming the trial court, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">Here, assuming time, situs and victim coincided, the nature of the specific act peculiar to each prosecution is distinct. In the first instance defendant admittedly was unlawfully operating a vehicle while his privileges were in suspension. In contrast, the subject prosecution resulted from such operation after he had been adjudicated an habitual offender. While driving was conduct common and necessary to each offense, the legal disability upon defendant that attended and was integral to the respective acts was significantly different. Thus, the \u201csame evidence\u201d would not produce a conviction for both offenses. Accordingly, the disparate \u201cnature\u201d of the acts saves the instant prosecution from the reach of Code \u00a7 19.2-294.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 147, 562 S.E.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The same rationale applies here. To sustain Jefferson\u2019s earlier conviction of carrying a concealed handgun, in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>of Code \u00a7 18.2-308, the Commonwealth had to prove that Jefferson carried a handgun \u201cabout his person, hidden from common observation,\u201d without legal authorization to do so. Code \u00a7 18.2-308; <em>see also Main v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 370, 372, 457 S.E.2d 400, 401 (1995) (en banc). That conviction did not require proof that Jefferson was a convicted felon. Conversely, to establish Jefferson\u2019s guilt in this case of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the Commonwealth had to prove that he had previously \u201cbeen convicted of a felony\u201d and that he \u201cknowingly and intentionally possesse[d] or transport[ed] any firearm.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The Commonwealth was not required to prove that the handgun in Jefferson\u2019s possession was concealed. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 358, 429 S.E.2d 615, 617 (noting that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 \u201cis concerned with preventing a person, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed, regardless of whether that person uses, displays, or conceals the firearm\u201d), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993). Hence, while possession of the handgun was conduct common to the prosecution of both statutory offenses, the attendant acts and legal disabilities necessary to sustain the two prosecutions were decidedly different.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Thus, \u201cthe nature of the specific act peculiar to each prosecution\u201d was separate and distinct. <em>Johnson, </em>38 Va.App. at 147, 562 S.E.2d at 346. Consequently, \u201cthe \u2018same evidence\u2019 would not produce a conviction for both offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the subject statutory violations involve separate acts, and Jefferson\u2019s indictment and conviction in the instant case are not barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Jefferson\u2019s motion to quash the indictment and affirm Jefferson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">. Jefferson was also convicted in the same proceeding of felonious assault and battery on a police officer, but that matter is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\">. Jefferson relies exclusively upon the preclusion of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 to bar his present conviction. He presents no claim invoking the constitutional defense of double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
