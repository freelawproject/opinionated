He contends the circuit court erred in terminating his parental rights because: (1) the Spotsylvania Department of Social Services (DSS) did not make reasonable efforts to reunite D.B. with Brown, and (2) DSS did not adequately consider placement of D.B. with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Brown\u2019s mother, Rosemary Brown. For the following reasons, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On March 21, 2001, DSS visited the home of Allen Brown in response to information that a child living in the home, A.V., was severely bruised. DSS discovered that A.V. had two large gashes on his head, two black eyes, bite marks on his shoulder and inner thigh, and numerous other bruises and scratches on his body and face. It was subsequently determined that A.V. had a fractured skull as well. DSS immediately removed A.V. and four other children living in the home, including Brown\u2019s son, D.B. A.V. is not related to Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">DSS interviewed the children living in the home, and those interviews revealed that Brown and Shawna Ostberg, another adult woman who lived with Brown, encouraged the children to \u201cpunch and scratch A.V. because he [defecated] on himself.\u201d The children also stated that A.V. \u201cwas made to sleep and eat in the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The following day, March 22, 2001, Brown was arrested for child abuse and neglect in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103. All children were removed from the home, including Brown\u2019s son, D.B. On May 9, 2001, the juvenile and domestic relations district court made a finding of abuse and neglect against Brown with respect to D.B. DSS filed a foster care plan with the goal of returning D.B. to Brown\u2019s care, which the juvenile court approved on June 1,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The foster care plan required Brown to obtain and maintain suitable housing and to complete parenting classes, anger management classes, a substance abuse evaluation, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>psychological evaluation. Brown completed the anger management and parenting classes. However, the parenting class instructor concluded that, \u201cbased on information received in class, interviews with the couple, and parent counseling sessions[,] the risk for abuse and neglect remains high.\u201d She noted that \u201cMr. Brown ... [has] a difficult time recognizing that any of [his] behaviors place [the] children in danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">On October 31, 2001, the circuit court convicted Brown pf the abuse and neglect of A.V. in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 after receiving his guilty plea. Brown\u2019s expected release date is January 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">On January 9, 2002, the juvenile court ruled, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014281(B)(3), that DSS no longer had to make reasonable efforts to reunite D.B. with Brown due to Brown\u2019s October 31, 2001 conviction. DSS subsequently filed a petition to terminate Brown\u2019s parental rights with respect to D.B. on February 8, 2002. The juvenile court ordered the termination of Brown\u2019s parental rights on October 7, 2002. Brown appealed the juvenile court order to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Before the juvenile court ordered the termination of Brown\u2019s parental rights, Brown\u2019s mother, Rosemary Brown, filed a petition seeking custody of D.B. In the circuit court hearing, Troi Coleman, a foster care worker for DSS, testified that she had investigated Rosemary as a possible relative placement for D.B. From interviews with Brown and Rosemary\u2019s daughter, Kim Marshall, Coleman learned that the living conditions in Rosemary\u2019s home were inadequate and that Brown believed \u201cthat his mother was not a possibility\u201d for placement due to her living conditions, age, and work hours. At the time of the interviews, Rosemary resided in a one-bedroom apartment in Connecticut. Marshall \u201creiterated that space was an issue\u201d in Rosemary\u2019s apartment, and Coleman learned that Rosemary in fact supported Marshall as the appropriate relative with whom to place D.B. The New Hampshire DSS informed Coleman about the suitability of Marshall\u2019s home. It had recently removed K., another child of Brown, from Marshall\u2019s care and it had not yet decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>place K with Rosemary, notwithstanding the fact that Marshall and Rosemary lived in the same apartment complex at that time; the New Hampshire DSS only allowed Rosemary supervised visitation with K. Contrary to his earlier stated reservations, Brown expressed support for his mother\u2019s request for custody at the circuit court hearing. Rosemary testified that she had the ability to care for D.B. if she were granted custody, that she was capable of supporting herself, and that she had moved to a larger apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">By order dated July 17, 2003, the circuit court terminated Brown\u2019s parental rights and denied Rosemary\u2019s petition for custody of D.B. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Brown urges two grounds for reversal of the circuit court\u2019s decision. First, he argues that the circuit court erred in finding that DSS did not have to make reasonable efforts to reunite D.B. with Brown after Brown\u2019s conviction for child abuse and neglect. Second, he argues that DSS failed to consider placing D.B. with Rosemary prior to termination of his parental rights. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">A <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">When addressing matters concerning the custody and care of a child, this Court\u2019s paramount consideration is the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Toombs v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs., </em>223 Va. 225, 230, 288 S.E.2d 405, 407-08 (1982). On appeal, we presume that the trial court thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 329, 387 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1990). The trial court is vested with broad discretion in making decisions \u201cnecessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 387 S.E.2d at 795. We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s factual findings on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\n<em>B. DSS Was Not Required to Pursue Efforts to Reunite Brown\u2019s Conviction for Child Abuse and Neglect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">The local board or other child welfare agency having custody of the child shall not be required by the court to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child with a parent if the court finds that ... (3) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of this Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the United States or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent or a child with whom the parent resided at the time of such offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The statute defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as an injury \u201cthat involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">By order dated January 9, 2002, the juvenile and domestic relations district court found that DSS need not continue its efforts to reunite Brown with D.B. because Brown was convicted of abusing and neglecting A.V., a child who resided with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>him, in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its final order terminating Brown\u2019s parental rights, the circuit court ruled that DSS was no longer required to provide services to Brown because it found \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that Allen Brown [was] convicted of an offense under the laws of this Commonwealth which constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Although he acknowledges that his violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103 constituted a felony, Brown contends that Code \u00a7 40.1-103 cannot be construed as a \u201cfelony assault\u201d because it does not contain the common law elements of assault, specifically the intent to cause bodily harm. We disagree because we find that the term \u201cfelony assault,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), means any felonious crime that results in serious bodily injury to a child of the parent or a child who lives with the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B) was enacted in response to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671, a legislative effort by the federal government to bring uniformity to the states\u2019 foster care and adoption assistance programs in exchange for federal aid. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670 et seq. Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B) closely mirrors 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(D). Subsection (D)(ii)(IV) of the federal statute provides that reasonable efforts to reunite the child with a parent need not be made if the parent has \u201ccommitted a felony assault that results in serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent.\u201d Neither the federal statute nor Virginia\u2019s statute expressly defines the term \u201cfelony assault.\u201d The federal statute makes clear in other subsections, however, \u201cthat Congress expected the state legislators to insert into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>applicable state statutes the state crimes that would meet the federal requirement instead of simply copying that portion of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(D).\u201d <em>State v. Florance S., </em>12 Neb.App. 42, 666 N.W.2d 741, 750-52 (2003), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Selina N., </em>266 Neb. 782, 669 N.W.2d 429, 435 (2003); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(D)(i) (\u201cthe parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances (as defined in State law, which definition may include but need not be limited to abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, and sexual abuse)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Assault is a common law crime in Virginia. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 679, 681, 36 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1946). Although the elements of assault<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the elements of child abuse and neglect, as defined by Code \u00a7 40.1-103, are not the same, we are persuaded that the legislature did not intend to limit the definition of \u201cfelony assault\u201d found in Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3) to those crimes that only include the elements of common law assault. Rather, we hold that the term \u201cfelony assault\u201d in Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3) means any crime which results in serious bodily injury to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In reaching the conclusion that the term \u201cfelony assault,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), encompasses crimes other than common law assault, we are guided by the usual rules of statutory construction. \u201cIn construing statutes, courts are charged with ascertaining and giving effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Hill, </em>254 Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997). \u201c[A] fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that courts view the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the \u2018true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>(1989) (quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957)). \u201cIn construing statutes, courts should give the fullest possible effect to the legislative intent embodied in the entire statutory enactment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">If, however, the words in the statute are not sufficiently explicit, we may determine legislative intent \u201cfrom the occasion and necessity of the statute being passed [or amended]; from a comparison of its several parts and of other acts <em>in pari materia; </em>and sometimes from extraneous circumstances which may throw light on the subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><em>Yamaha Motor Corp. v. Quillian, </em>264 Va. 656, 665, 571 S.E.2d 122, 126 (2002) (quoting <em>Richmond v. Sutherland, </em>114 Va. 688, 691, 77 S.E. 470, 471 (1913)) (alteration in original). With these principles in mind, we conclude that the conviction of a crime other than assault that results in serious bodily injury qualifies as a \u201cfelony assault\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3) for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">First, we are persuaded by the focus of \u201cthe entire statutory enactment\u201d that the legislature\u2019s overarching concern in adopting Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B) was the physical health of the child, made evident in subsection (B)(3) of the statute, which establishes \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to the child as a determinative factor in applying the statute. The term \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is defined as that injury which \u201cinvolves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B). Irrespective of whether the offense was an assault or a \u201cbodily wounding,\u201d it must have resulted in serious bodily injury to the child-victim to satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3). Consistent with the purpose of the act, we believe the provision\u2019s focus on crimes that result in serious bodily injury indicates, in this particular instance, that the legislature is not as concerned with the nomenclature or the elements of the crime itself, but rather with the effect the crime had on the child-victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Second, we note that an act which results in serious bodily injury is not an assault; it is a battery. Therefore, incorporating the common law definition of assault to the term \u201cfelony assault\u201d in Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3), as Brown urges, would not be appropriate because the predicate act or offense in that statute must result in serious bodily injury. Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3). By coupling the term \u201cfelony assault\u201d with serious bodily injury, the legislature defined the term within the statute itself. It is thus neither necessary nor appropriate to look beyond the words of the statute to discern the meaning of \u201cfelony assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Third, and finally, an interpretation limiting the definition of \u201cfelony assault\u201d in Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014281(B)(3) to the crime of felony assault as defined elsewhere in the Code would lead to an absurd result. An assault in Virginia is punishable only as a misdemeanor, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-57(A); <em>see also Jones, </em>184 Va. at 681, 36 S.E.2d at 572, unless the person assaulted is a law enforcement officer, in which case the offense is punishable as a felony. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C). Were we to interpret the statute as Brown suggests, the \u201cfelony assault\u201d provision of Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3) would be rendered meaningless because one could never commit a \u201cfelony assault\u201d against a child. We decline to interpret Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014281(B)(3) in such a manner. The \u201cplain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Here, the record establishes that Brown encouraged the other children in the home to hurt A.V.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result of the beatings administered by the other children, A.V. suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>multiple injuries, the most serious of which was a fractured skull. A fractured skull plainly \u201cinvolves a substantial risk of death\u201d and may lead to \u201cprotracted and obvious disfigurement.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B). Thus, although Brown was convicted of child abuse and neglect in violation of Code \u00a7 40.1-103, his crime \u201cconstituted] [a] felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury\u201d to a child with whom he was living at the time. <em>Id. </em>Considering the purpose of Code \u00a7 16.1-281 as a whole, and the court\u2019s paramount duty to protect the best interests of children, we conclude that, under the facts of this case, Brown\u2019s crime of child abuse and neglect, as defined by Code \u00a7 40.1-103, and the result it caused sufficed to meet the definition of the term \u201cfelony assault\u201d in Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B)(3). We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that DSS was relieved of its duty to provide services to Brown in an attempt to reunite him with D.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\n<em>C. DSS Did Not Fail To Consider Placing D.B. with a Relative</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Brown argues that DSS did not give sufficient consideration to placing D.B. with his grandmother, Rosemary. In support of his position, Brown relies primarily on the failure of DSS to conduct a home study of Rosemary\u2019s home. We reject Brown\u2019s contention, finding that DSS investigated Rosemary in accordance with its statutory duty and that, in any event, Rosemary\u2019s testimony sufficiently apprised the circuit court of the suitability of placing D.B. with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) provides that, in a termination of parental rights case, \u201cthe court shall give a consideration to granting custody to relatives of the child, including grandparents.\u201d \u201cBefore the court grants custody of a child, under the provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) the Department has a duty to produce sufficient evidence so that the court may properly determine whether there are relatives willing and suitable to take custody of the child, and to consider such relatives in comparison to other placement options.\u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 131, 409 S.E.2d 460, 465 (1991). Nothing in the statute or case law suggests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>that DSS has an affirmative duty to conduct a home study. That being said, DSS is mandated \u201cto produce sufficient evidence so that the court may properly determine whether there are relatives willing and suitable to take custody of the child, and to consider such relatives in comparison to other placement options.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find that DSS met that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The record reveals that DSS investigated Rosemary as a possible placement for D.B. At the time of D.B.\u2019s removal, DSS questioned Brown regarding possible placements for his son. Brown indicated at that time that his mother Rosemary was \u201cnot a possibility\u201d due to her age, work hours, and living arrangements. Instead, Brown suggested his sister, Kim Marshall, as a possible placement for D.B., a choice in which Rosemary concurred. However, the record establishes that K., another child of Brown, had been recently removed from Marshall\u2019s home and care and that the New Hampshire DSS had not placed K. with Rosemary, only according her supervised visitation with the child at the time. DSS presented the facts discussed above to the trial court for its consideration in determining the propriety of placing the child with a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Moreover, Rosemary testified at the hearing and informed the court of her \u201csuitability and willingness\u201d to take D.B. into her custody. <em>See Hawthorne v. Smyth County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>33 Va.App. 130, 139, 531 S.E.2d 639, 644 (2000). The trial court also heard evidence from an expert, Ann Henley, who had evaluated \u201cthe family history of the children and the parents.\u201d Based on her evaluation, Henley concluded that D.B. had no attachment to, or bond with, Rosemary. She determined that Rosemary last saw D.B. when he was ten months old. She farther concluded that placing D.B. with Rosemary would separate him from his sister, H., \u201cthe only constant in D.B.\u2019s whole existence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThus, as required by statute, the trial court was presented with evidence for its consideration as to the suitability of placing [D.B.] with [Rose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>mary] before it ordered the termination of appellant's] parental rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the evidence the trial court received, we cannot say that its decision to deny Rosemary's petition for custody of D.B. was plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the circuit court terminating Brown\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">.
