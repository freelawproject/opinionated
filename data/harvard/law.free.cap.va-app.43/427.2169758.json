Yopp (mother) appeals the trial court\u2019s decision awarding visitation with her minor child D.L.H. (child) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Danny Lee Hodges (maternal grandfather) and his wife (maternal grandmother) (grandparents, collectively). Mother contends the trial court applied the wrong burden of proof and, thus, failed to find by clear and convincing evidence that denial of visitation to the maternal grandparents would be harmful or detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare. She also contends that the trial court erred in finding that visitation with the maternal grandparents was in the child\u2019s best interests. At oral argument on this case, this Court asked the parties to brief whether or not the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction based on mother\u2019s failure to timely mail or deliver a copy of her notice of appeal to the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>Deanna P. Stone. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>and maternal grandfather submitted briefs arguing that the appeal must be dismissed under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hughes v. York County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>36 Va.App. 22, 548 S.E.2d 237 (2001). We hold that <em>Hughes </em>is distinguishable and decline to dismiss the appeal. We further hold on the merits that the trial court did not err in awarding visitation to the maternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">I. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Danny Lee Hodges, the child\u2019s maternal grandfather, filed a petition in the juvenile and domestic relations district court on behalf of the maternal grandparents seeking visitation with the child. Following resolution of the matter by the juvenile and domestic relations district court, the case was appealed to the circuit court and tried <em>de novo. </em>As permitted by Code \u00a7 16.1-266(E)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (formerly Code \u00a7 16.1-266(D)), the trial court appointed Deanna P. Stone as guardian <em>ad litem </em>to represent the child\u2019s interests in the matter. Neither party challenges the trial court\u2019s authority to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>this case to represent the interests of the child. The court\u2019s order of August 22, 2002, appointing the guardian <em>ad litem </em>was \u201c[rjequested by\u201d mother and \u201c[s]een and agreed\u201d to by maternal grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The child\u2019s natural father, who neither lived with mother nor had any contact with the child, joined in the maternal grandparents\u2019 request that the court award them visitation with the minor child. At the hearing, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>allied herself with the maternal grandparents and the child\u2019s natural father in requesting that the maternal grandparents be awarded visitation with the child. The circuit court found it was in the child\u2019s best interests to have visitation with the maternal grandparents on the second weekend of each month, on December 26 and 27, and for one week during summer vacation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court\u2019s final order memorializing its ruling was entered on October 30, 2002. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>endorsed the final order under the heading \u201cSeen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On December 2, 2002, mother timely filed a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court indicating her intention to challenge the circuit court\u2019s final order, but she failed to deliver a copy of the notice of appeal to the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">II. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">On appeal, we view the evidence, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence, in a light most favorable to the maternal grandparents as the party prevailing below. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). So viewed, the record establishes that the child and mother lived in the home of the maternal grandparents for the first year and a half of the child\u2019s life. Mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>moved to a residence immediately adjacent to the maternal grandparents\u2019 home, but the child remained with the grandparents. The child resided with the maternal grandparents in their home until age four and a half.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Around the time the child reached age five, mother married Jamie Yopp (Jamie). Jamie stayed with mother only occasionally. Grandfather testified that Jamie would \u201cmove in for a while and then move out and get an apartment and stay there for a while, then he\u2019ll move back in again, then move back out. It\u2019s just like a revolving door.\u201d Grandfather said that he was concerned \u201cwith the situation with [Jamie] moving in and out [because] there\u2019s no sense of stability to [the child\u2019s] life.\u201d Jamie and mother have since separated, although they still \u201csocialize like human beings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">After mother\u2019s marriage, the child began spending more time with her. However, the maternal grandparents still cared for him a majority of the time because \u201che would go up there [to mother\u2019s house] and want to come back, and she would let him come back.\u201d The maternal grandparents essentially \u201craised [the child] until he was five or six years old.\u201d They ensured the child got on the school bus every morning, met him in the afternoon on his return, prepared dinner for him, and helped him with his homework. Grandfather helped the child plant sunflower and green bean seeds in their backyard. Grandfather said, \u201cWe dug a little spot and we planted it. He [the child] checked it every day, every day.\u201d Grandfather talked to a neighbor about \u201cplowing up a place to plant a big garden\u201d for the child, and the child became \u201call excited about [it].\u201d Grandfather also took the child on fishing trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The relationship between mother and grandparents disintegrated in 2002 after mother denied the grandparents\u2019 request to take the child \u201cto the beach.\u201d The grandparents subsequently filed a petition seeking visitation rights. Mother thereafter refused to allow the grandparents to see the child except for one weekend each month. Mother resisted the grandparents\u2019 petition for visitation on the grounds that the grandparents \u201cbadger[ed] [the child] with questions\u201d when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>they visited with him and consumed alcohol in the child\u2019s presence. She also contended that grandfather has a \u201cvery violent\u201d temper. As evidence of grandfather\u2019s violent temper, mother related an incident in which grandfather \u201cpicked up [her] bed and slammed it down because ... [mother\u2019s] boyfriends made him mad.\u201d However, mother admitted that this incident took place before she had any children.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">When the child visits with his grandparents, mother does not allow them to touch, hug, or kiss the child. The child \u201ccries to stay\u201d with his grandparents when mother ends the visitation. Mother admitted that the child loves his grandparents \u201cvery much.\u201d However, she opined that severing contact between the child and his grandparents would have no effect on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The child\u2019s biological father expressly requested that the maternal grandparents be given visitation rights. The mother did not claim, nor does any evidence establish, that the biological father is an \u201cunfit\u201d parent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Troxel v. Granville, 530 </em>U.S. 57, <em>68, 120 </em>S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion). The child\u2019s appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>took the father\u2019s request into account and joined in the recommendation that the maternal grandparents be given visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">After hearing the evidence, the court ordered the parties to mediation. Mediation proved fruitless, however, and the trial court ultimately ruled that, \u201cbased on the evidence ... I\u2019ve heard, I do find that it would be in the child\u2019s best interest to continue to have some relationship and contact with these grandparents.\u201d It thus granted the maternal grandparents\u2019 petition for visitation with the child. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">A. Mother\u2019s Failure to Notice the Guardian <em>Ad Litem </em>Did Not Create a Jurisdictional Defect Requiring Dismissal of her Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">We first address whether mother\u2019s appeal must fail on jurisdictional grounds because she failed to deliver a copy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the notice of appeal to the guardian <em>ad litem. </em>We hold that mother\u2019s failure does not give rise to a jurisdictional defect requiring dismissal of her appeal because the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in this case is not an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Rule 5A:6, which governs notices of appeal to this Court, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">No appeal shall be allowed unless, within 30 days after entry of final judgment or other appealable order or decree, counsel files with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal, and at the same time mails or delivers a copy of such notice to all <em>opposing counsel </em>and the clerk of the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">(Emphasis added). Rule 5A:1 defines \u201copposing counsel\u201d as \u201cdepending on the context, \u2018counsel for the appellant\u2019 or \u2018counsel for the appellee.\u2019 \u201d Rule 5A:1 further defines \u201ccounsel for the appellee\u201d as \u201cone of the attorneys representing each appellee represented by an attorney, and each appellee not represented by an attorney.\u201d The Rules do not specifically define the term \u201cappellee.\u201d <em>See Hughes, </em>36 Va.App. at 25, 548 S.E.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In <em>Hughes, </em>we held that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in a termination of parental rights case is an \u201cappellee\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5A:1 because the guardian had taken a position opposing that of the appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239. Central to the conclusion that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>was an appellee within the meaning of Rule 5A:1 was our determination that, \u201c[i]n a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>representing the interests of the children is an indispensable party to the appeal of the final decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 238. \u201cThus,\u201d we concluded, <em>\u201cin the present case, </em>the guardian <em>ad litem </em>[,] [as an indispensable party,] constituted an appellee and \u2018opposing counsel\u2019 for purposes of Rule[ ] 5A:6.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239 (emphasis added). We therefore dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction because the appellant \u201cfailed to provide the guardian <em>ad litem </em>with notice of the appeal\u201d as required by Rule 5A:6. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Here, like the appellant in <em>Hughes, </em>mother failed to deliver a copy of the notice of appeal to the guardian <em>ad litem. </em>However, we find <em>Hughes </em>inapposite to the instant case because we hold that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in a custody or visitation case is not an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of Virginia has used the terms \u2018indispensable parties\u2019 and \u2018necessary parties\u2019 synonymously.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Family Servs., </em>42 Va.App. 760, 765, 595 S.E.2d 19, 22 (2004) (citing <em>Asch v. Friends of Mount Vernon Yacht Club, </em>251 Va. 89, 90-91, 465 S.E.2d 817, 818 (1996)). It has defined a necessary or indispensable party as one who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">is in the actual enjoyment of the subject matter, or has an interest in it ... which is likely to be defeated or diminished by the plaintiffs claim, in such case he has an immediate interest in resisting the demand, and all persons who have such immediate interests are necessary parties to the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHqx\"><em>Asch, 251 Va. </em>at 90-91, 465 S.E.2d at 818 (quotations omitted). Thus, a necessary or indispensable party is \u201cso bound up with that of the other parties, that their legal presence as parties to the proceeding is an absolute necessity, without which the court cannot proceed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 465 S.E.2d at 818 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The holding in <em>Hughes </em>that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>in termination of parental rights cases is an indispensable party is rooted in the statutory bar to proceeding with such cases in the absence of an appointed guardian. Code \u00a7 16.1-266(A) requires that, \u201c[pjrior to the hearing by the court of ... a petition seeking termination of residual parental rights ..., the court <em>shall </em>appoint a discreet and competent attorney-at-law as guardian ad litem to represent the child.\u201d (Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 16.1-266(A)\u2019s directive is mandatory, not discretionary. <em>See Watkins, </em>42 Va.App. at 765, 595 S.E.2d at 22 (\u201cIndeed, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>is clearly an indispensable party in termination cases because the statute governing the appointment of guardians <em>ad litem </em>in termination proceedings, Code \u00a7 16.1-266, mandates their appointment in such cases.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>In the absence of an appointed guardian <em>ad litem, </em>by statute the proceeding to terminate parental rights is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In contrast, Code \u00a7 16.1-266(E) allows the trial court to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>\u201c[i]n all other cases which <em>in the discretion of the court </em>require\u201d such an appointment. (Emphasis added). In fact, in a custody or visitation case, the trial court \u201cshall not\u201d appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>\u201cunless the court finds ... that the interests of the child or children are not otherwise adequately represented.\u201d The courts of the Commonwealth routinely resolve custody and visitation disputes without the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Because the trial court may resolve a custody or visitation dispute in the absence of a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>we cannot say that the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>presence in the case before us <em>\u201cis an absolute necessity, </em>without which the court cannot proceed.\u201d <em>Asch, </em>251 Va. at 91, 465 S.E.2d at 818 (quotations omitted) (emphasis added). One whose participation in a suit is merely permissible cannot be said to be necessary or indispensable to the proceedings, nor can it be said that the party\u2019s absence deprives the court of jurisdiction to address the issues raised. <em>Cf. Hughes, </em>36 Va.App. at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 238. We thus conclude that, by making the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>in a custody case a matter of judicial discretion, the legislature has determined that the appointment and presence of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>representing the interests of a child who is the subject of a custody and visitation dispute, while permissible, is not required before the court can fully adjudicate the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In summary, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in this case is not necessary or indispensable to the proceedings. It follows that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>is neither an \u201cappellee\u201d nor \u201copposing counsel\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5A:6 as explained in <em>Hughes. </em>Thus, mother\u2019s failure to provide the guardian <em>ad litem </em>with a copy of the notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 5A:6 is inconsequential to this Court\u2019s power to exercise its jurisdiction and adjudicate the maternal grandparents\u2019 petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>visitation with mother\u2019s minor child. We find that the appeal is properly before us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">B. The Trial Court Did Not Apply the Wrong Standard of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Turning to the merits of this appeal, mother contends that the trial court erred when it awarded the maternal grandparents visitation with her minor son in the absence of a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the denial of visitation would be harmful or detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare. She relies on <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>24 Va.App. 778, 485 S.E.2d 651 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998), to support her contention. The trial court found <em>Williams </em>distinguishable from the instant case, and we find no error in that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B) provides that the \u201ccourt shall give due regard to the primacy of the parent-child relationship but may upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the best interest of the child would be served thereby award custody or visitation to any other person with a legitimate interest.\u201d Persons with a legitimate interest include a minor child\u2019s grandparents. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.1. The party seeking visitation bears the burden of proving it is in the best interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B); <em>Dotson v. Hylton, 29 </em>Va.App. 635, 640, 513 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1999). The term \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">has been defined as \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and <em>unequivocal. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>Fred C. Walker Agency, Inc. v. Lucas, </em>215 Va. 535, 540-41, 211 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1975) (quoting <em>Cross v. Ledford, </em>161 Ohio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118,123 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>this Court considered an appeal from a trial court\u2019s order granting visitation with a minor child to paternal grandparents. <em>Williams, </em>24 Va.App. at 780, 485 S.E.2d at 652. The trial court granted the grandparents\u2019 petition for visitation over the objections of both mother and father. <em>Id. </em>We reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, holding that \u201cthe parents\u2019 right to autonomy in child rearing is a fundamental right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and that state interference with that right must be justified by a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of the primacy of the parent-child relationship and in furtherance of the principle that parents have a constitutional right to autonomy in child rearing, this Court determined that the third party seeking visitation over the objections of both parents must show more than that the requested visitation would be in the child\u2019s best interests. \u201c[BJefore visitation can be ordered over <em>the objection of the child\u2019s parents, </em>a court must find an actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare without such visitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784-85, 485 S.E.2d at 654 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">We subsequently distinguished the holding in <em>Williams </em>in a case involving only one parent\u2019s objection to grandparent visitations. In <em>Dotson, </em>we affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of visitation to the paternal grandmother. Although father was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>incarcerated, he requested that the paternal grandmother be allowed to visit with his child. <em>Dotson, </em>29 Va.App. at 638, 513 S.E.2d at 902. The trial court granted the request over mother\u2019s objection, finding that such visitation was in the best interests of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 513 S.E.2d at 903. We rejected mother\u2019s argument that the trial court erroneously-failed to apply the <em>Williams </em>standard, holding that \u201c[w]hen only one parent objects to a grandparent\u2019s visitation and the other parent requests it, the trial court is not required to follow the standard enumerated in <em>Williams.\u201d Id. </em>at 639, 513 S.E.2d at 903; <em>see also Griffin v. Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. 77, 83-84, 581 S.E.2d 899, 902 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The standard enunciated in <em>Dotson </em>applies here because father expressly supported the maternal grandparents\u2019 request for visitation with the child and the mother has never asserted, and does not now assert, that father is an unfit parent who should be deemed legally incapable of participating in parental decision making. \u201cCustody and visitation disputes between two fit parents involve one parent\u2019s fundamental right pitted against the other parent\u2019s fundamental right. The discretion afforded trial courts under the best-interests test, Code \u00a7 20-124.3, reflects a finely balanced judicial response to this parental deadlock.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>41 Va. App. at 83, 581 S.E.2d at 902. Thus, the trial court in the instant case applied the correct standard, i.e. the best interests of the child, in determining whether to award visitation to the grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We disagree with mother\u2019s reliance on <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), for the proposition that the trial court applied the incorrect standard. The <em>Troxel </em>Court recognized that \u201cthere is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children\u201d which must be considered in disputes that arise between the parent and a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 120 S.Ct. at 2061. The Supreme Court specifically signaled the lower court\u2019s error in applying a presumption in favor of visitation with grandparents which \u201cdirectly contravened the traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that, in so doing, the lower court \u201cfailed to provide any protection for [the fit parent\u2019s] fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning the rearing of her [or his] own [children].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 120 S.Ct. at 2062. The <em>Troxel </em>Court was not presented with the circumstances we face in the instant case. Here, one parent requests that visitation be accorded the third party, the other parent objects to the request, and both parents are fit. Because both parents are fit, the trial court had to presume that both were \u201cact[ing] in the best interests of their\u201d child in order to protect each parent\u2019s \u201cfundamental right to make decisions concerning the rearing of\u2019 their child. <em>See id. </em>at 68-70, 120 S.Ct. at 2061. Thus, faced with a contest in which one parent\u2019s fundamental rights were pitted against the other parent\u2019s fundamental rights, <em>see Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. at 83, 581 S.E.2d at 902, the trial court properly considered the child\u2019s best interests. We therefore find that <em>Troxel </em>is inapposite and that <em>Dotson </em>controls the issue on appeal, and we hold that the trial court did not err as a matter of law in considering only the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">C. The Trial Court\u2019s Determination that Visitation with Maternal Grandparents Is in the Best Interests of the Child Is Not Plainly Wrong</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We afford great deference to the trial court\u2019s determination of what is in the best interests of the child. <em>Sullivan v. Knick, </em>38 Va.App. 773, 783, 568 S.E.2d 430, 435 (2002). It \u201cis a matter of discretion ..., and, unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, the court\u2019s decree must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Bostick v. Bostick-Bennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 533, 478 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1996). Similarly, \u201c[w]hen a court hears evidence at an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, its decision is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. Wheeler, </em>42 Va.App. 282, 288, 591 S.E.2d 698, 701 (2004). Moreover, the credibility of -witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony is a matter exclusively within the province of the trier of fact. <em>See Barker v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 373, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>337 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1985). Finally, we view the evidence upon which the trial court relied in a light most favorable to the maternal grandparents as the party prevailing below. <em>Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. at 258, 578 S.E.2d at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Applying these principles, we find that the evidence supported the visitation requested and that the trial court\u2019s decision was not plainly wrong. The evidence establishes that the maternal grandparents had been a significant part of the child\u2019s life until the summer of 2002. The child routinely stayed at the maternal grandparents\u2019 house for the first four or five years of his life. They ensured that he attended school and completed his homework. They provided him with meals every evening, and they participated in family recreational activities such as gardening and fishing. The child loves his grandparents and cries when mother takes him away from them. The evidence also shows that the grandparents were a source of stability that was often lacking in mother\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Based on this evidence, the trial court determined it would be in the child\u2019s best interest to have regular and frequent visitation with the grandparents. The decision of the trial court was not plainly wrong and was supported by the evidence. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">. Code \u00a7 16.1-266(E) provides, in pertinent part, that, \"[i]n all other cases which in the discretion of the court require ... a guardian ad litem ... to represent the child ..., competent attomeys-at-law may be appointed by the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\">. The maternal grandparents objected to the limits imposed on visitation but did not file a cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\">. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>did not file a responsive brief on behalf of the child or appear at oral argument before this Court. However, as noted <em>supra, </em>the guardian <em>ad litem </em>filed a brief in response to this Court\u2019s request addressing whether mother's failure to mail or deliver a copy of the notice of appeal to her precluded consideration of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\">. The mother reiterated the concession at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\">. We do not suggest that, where the trial court has determined that \"interests of the child ... are not ... adequately represented\u201d by the parents\u2019 or other parties\u2019 counsel, necessitating the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the child\u2019s interests should be unrepresented on appeal. Code \u00a7 16.1-266. The role of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>appointed by the trial court is important to the proper adjudication of the issues. <em>See Standards to Govern the Performance of Guardians Ad Litem for Children, </em>std. J (2003), <em>at </em>http://courts.state.va.us/gal/ gaLstandards_children_080403.html. We conclude only that the absence of the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>by virtue of the appellant\u2019s failure to provide the requisite notice, does not deprive this Court of its subject matter jurisdiction and authority to adjudicate the matter. Nothing here changes this Court's authority to take into account the views of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>by ordering that the child's representative be brought into the case. Finally, we do not hold here that this Court may not, under appropriate circumstances, dismiss an appeal on the ground that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not provided requisite notice. Rule 5A:6, <em>Hughes, </em>36 Va.App. at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b486-8\">CLEMENTS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Axs\">dissenting, in part, and concurring, in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">While I agree with the result of this appeal, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that mother\u2019s failure to provide timely notice of the appeal to the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>does not require dismissal of mother\u2019s appeal. In my view, the decision of this Court in <em>Hughes v. York County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>36 Va.App. 22, 548 S.E.2d 237 (2001), controls the outcome of this case and requires the opposite conclusion. I would hold, therefore, that mother\u2019s failure to make the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>a party to this appeal by providing her with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>notice of the appeal in accordance with Rule 5A:6(a) precludes us from entertaining this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Rule 5A:6(a) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o appeal [to this Court] shall be allowed unless, within 30 days after entry of final judgment ..., counsel files with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal, <em>and at the same time mails or delivers a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Here, it is undisputed that, while mother timely filed a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court indicating her intention to challenge the circuit court\u2019s final order, she did not mail or deliver a copy of the notice of appeal to the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>who, pursuant to Rule 1:5, was still a counsel of record in the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The issue, then, is whether we may consider this appeal even though the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not given proper notice of the appeal under Rule 5A:6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Faced with a similar issue in <em>Hughes, </em>a case involving the termination of parental rights, we held that the appellant\u2019s failure to provide notice of the appeal, under Rule 5A:6(a), to the guardian <em>ad litem </em>appointed by the circuit court to represent the children\u2019s interests precluded us from entertaining the appeal. 36 Va.App. at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239. We explained that, for purposes of Rule 5A:6(a), the term \u201copposing counsel\u201d includes all necessary or indispensable parties to the appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>This is so, we reasoned, because \u201c[a]n appellate court [may not properly] adjudicate an appeal unless all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>necessary [or indispensable] parties are properly before the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 548 S.E.2d at 238. We further explained that a necessary or indispensable party \u201cis one whose interests are likely to be defeated or diminished by a successful appeal\u201d and that, \u201c[wjhere the guardian <em>ad litem </em>has taken a position on behalf of the children in opposition to the appealing party, then the interests of the children are subject to being \u2018defeated or diminished\u2019 by the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 548 S.E.2d at 238-39. Applying these principles, we concluded that the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>who had \u201cjoined the [Department of Social Services] in requesting that appellant\u2019s parental rights be terminated,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 25, 548 S.E.2d at 238, was a necessary or \u201cindispensable party to the appeal and, thus, qualifie[d] as an \u2018opposing counsel\u2019 under Rule 5A:6(a), to whom the appellant ha[d] a duty to mail or deliver a copy of the notice of appeal,\u201d <em>M.G. v. Albemarle County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 170, 177, 583 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2003) (citing <em>Hughes, </em>36 Va.App. at 25-26, 548 S.E.2d at 238-39). We further concluded that, because the \u201cappellant failed to provide the [children\u2019s] guardian <em>ad litem </em>with the notice of appeal,\u201d as required by Rule 5A:6(a), \u201cthe guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not ... made a party to the appeal.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>36 Va.App. at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239; <em>see also M. G., </em>41 Va.App. at 177, 583 S.E.2d at 764 (noting that \u201cthe court never acquires jurisdiction over the indispensable party\u201d when that party is not given notice of the appeal). Thus, we held we could not entertain the appeal. <em>Hughes, </em>36 Va.App. at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">As the majority notes, \u201c[h]ere, like the appellant in <em>Hughes, </em>mother failed to deliver a copy of the notice of appeal to the [child\u2019s] guardian <em>ad litem.\u201d </em>And like the children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>in <em>Hughes, </em>the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>in this case took a position on behalf of the child in opposition to the appellant. At the hearing before the circuit court, the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>joined the child\u2019s grandparents and the child\u2019s natural father in requesting that the circuit court award visitation to the grandparents. The child\u2019s mother opposed that request. After the circuit court entered an order grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ing visitation to the grandparents, mother noted her appeal, seeking to overturn the circuit court\u2019s decision. Thus, the child\u2019s interests are subject to being defeated or diminished by mother\u2019s claim in this appeal. Accordingly, under the principles set forth in <em>Hughes, </em>the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>is a necessary or indispensable party to this appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 548 S.E.2d at 238-39. As such, she is an \u201copposing counsel\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5A:6(a). <em>Id. </em>at 26, 548 S.E.2d at 239. Mother was, thus, required under Rule 5A:6(a) to mail or deliver a copy of the notice of appeal to her. Because mother failed to do so, the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not made a party to the appeal. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we may not entertain this appeal. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, I would dismiss this appeal and not reach the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The majority finds <em>Hughes </em>inapplicable here because the instant case involves visitation, rather than the termination of parental rights. The majority reasons that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>appointed by the trial court in a termination-of-parental-rights case is a necessary or indispensable party on appeal because that appointment is required by Code \u00a7 16.1-266(A), while a guardian <em>ad litem </em>appointed by the trial court in a custody or visitation case is not a necessary or indispensable party on appeal, even when representing children whose interests are subject to being defeated or diminished, because that appointment is merely discretionary under Code \u00a7 16.1-266(E). I disagree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">For one thing, it disregards the established definition of \u201ca necessary or indispensable party\u201d long employed by the Supreme Court and this Court. As the majority notes, the Supreme Court has defined \u201cnecessary parties\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASu\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cWhere an individual is in the actual enjoyment of the subject matter, or has an interest in it, either in possession or expectancy, which is likely to be defeated or diminished by the plaintiffs claim, in such case he has an immediate interest in resisting the demand, and all persons who have such immediate interests are necessary parties to the suit.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Asch v. Friends of Mount Vernon Yacht Club, </em>251 Va. 89, 90-91, 465 S.E.2d 817, 818 (1996) (quoting <em>Raney v. Four Thirty Seven Land Co., </em>233 Va. 513, 519-20, 357 S.E.2d 733, 736 (1987) (quoting <em>Gaddess v. Norris\u2019 Ex\u2019rs., </em>102 Va. 625, 630, 46 S.E. 905, 907 (1904) (quoting 1 <em>Daniel\u2019s Chancery Practice, </em>244))). Thus, as we said in <em>Hughes, </em>a necessary or indispensable party to an appeal \u201cis one whose interests are likely to be defeated or diminished by a successful appeal.\u201d 36 Va.App. at 25, 548 S.E.2d at 238. Consequently, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>is not a necessary or indispensable party to this appeal, even though the child\u2019s interests stood to be defeated or diminished if mother prevailed on appeal, impermissibly conflicts with the established definition of \u201ca necessary or indispensable party.\u201d <em>See Roane v. Roane, </em>12 Va.App. 989, 993, 407 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1991) (\u201cWe are bound by decisions of the Supreme Court of Virginia and are without authority to overrule [them].\u201d); <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 540, 543, 413 S.E.2d 661, 662 (1992) (\u201cUnder the rule of <em>stare decisis, </em>a decision by a panel of this court is an established precedent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Likewise, the majority\u2019s view that \u201c[o]ne whose participation in a suit is merely permissible cannot be said to be necessary or indispensable to the proceedings\u201d ignores the fact that the lower court may appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>in cases like this only if the court finds that independent representation of the child\u2019s interests is necessary. <em>See Verrocchio v. Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. 314, 317, 429 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (\u201cThe established practice is that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>may be appointed after a trial judge makes a preliminary finding that the best interests of the child <em>require </em>such appointment.\u201d (emphasis added)); Code \u00a7 16.1-266(E) (allowing the court to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>\u201c[i]n all other cases which in the discretion of the court <em>require </em>... a guardian <em>ad litem </em>... to represent the child or children\u201d (emphasis added)). Indeed, as the majority notes, Code \u00a7 16.1-266(E) specifically permits the court to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>in a custody or visitation case only if the court \u201cfinds ... that the interests of the child or children are not otherwise adequately represented\u201d by the parents\u2019 or other parties\u2019 counsel. <em>See also Verrocchio, </em>16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Va.App. at 320, 429 S.E.2d at 486 (\u201cCode \u00a7 16.1-266 \u2018recognizes that the substantive rights and interests of the child are often separate and distinct from those of the other parties to the litigation ... [and] that these rights and interests are best protected by an independent party.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 596, 601, 395 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>242 Ya. 60, 405 S.E.2d 621 (1991))). Thus, \u201ca finding that the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>is necessary and would be in the child\u2019s best interest is an essential prerequisite\u201d to the making of such an appointment. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 429 S.E.2d at 487 (holding that, while not required in every case, \u201cwhere the trial judge finds that the best interests of the child are not adequately protected by the parties\u201d and that appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>is \u201cnecessary to protect the interests of the minor child,\u201d then \u201cappointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the child is appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">It follows, therefore, that, in appointing the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in this case to represent and advocate the child\u2019s interests, the circuit court specifically found that the guardian <em>ad litem\u2019s </em>participation in the case was necessary to the proceedings because the child\u2019s interests were not otherwise represented. For this Court to then say that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>in the instant case is not a necessary or indispensable party to the appeal simply because the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>is not required in all custody and visitation cases is, in my view, an unwarrantedly narrow application of the principles set forth in <em>Hughes. </em>It not only serves to effectively overrule the circuit court\u2019s determination that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>was required to represent the child in the case, it also serves to generally demean and diminish the role of guardians <em>ad litem </em>in custody and visitation cases appealed to this Court. <em>See generally Bottoms v. Bottoms, </em>249 Va. 410, 420, 457 S.E.2d 102, 108 (1995) (noting that \u201cthe recommendation of the guardian <em>ad litem ..., </em>while not binding or controlling, should not be disregarded\u201d and that, \u201c[t]he duty of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>in a child custody dispute is to see that the interest of the child is \u2018represented and protected\u2019\u201d (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-9)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Most significantly, however, in leaving the child\u2019s independent interests unrepresented by counsel on appeal in this case, the majority\u2019s decision elevates the procedural rights of mother over what should be the paramount consideration\u2014the welfare and best interests of the child. <em>See Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. at 320, 429 S.E.2d at 486 (\u201c \u2018In Virginia, we have established the rule that the welfare of the infant is the primary, paramount, and controlling consideration of the court in all controversies between parents over the custody [and visitation] of their minor children.
