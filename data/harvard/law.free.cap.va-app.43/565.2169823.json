Moses contends the evidence was insufficient to support the misdemeanor convictions. We agree, and we reverse both misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">The evidence proved a ten-year-old girl was in a department store with her mother and her brother in August of 2001, when she saw Moses walking among the aisles. Later, in the check-out line, Moses began a conversation with the girl. Moses told the girl she was very beautiful and told her he thought other people must have said this to her. The girl testified that Moses had his hands in his pants as he talked to her. She saw \u201chis hand through his pants\u201d and said his hand was rubbing his penis. She also testified that she did not see the \u201cshape of his penis under his clothes.\u201d When the girl\u2019s mother arrived, the girl left the store with her mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>brother. Outside the store, the girl reported the incident to her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In December of 2001, an eleven-year-old girl was in another department store with her mother. The girl saw Moses behind a display rack looking at her and \u201crubbing himself ... [i]n his private area.\u201d She told her mother \u201cthat ... man was adjusting himself.\u201d After her mother paid for merchandise, she momentarily walked away from the girl. Moses approached the girl when she was alone near the entrance and \u201ctold [her] that [she] was a pretty little girl and ... asked how [her] butt felt.\u201d Later, in the parking lot, the <em>girl </em>reported the conversation to her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The trial judge convicted Moses of two offenses of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-387.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-387 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">Every person who intentionally makes an obscene display or exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where others are present, or procures another to so expose himself, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. No person shall be deemed to be in violation of this section for breastfeeding a child in any public place or any place where others are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The evidence proved Moses\u2019s conduct was indecent, but we hold that the evidence failed to prove either \u201can obscene <em>display </em>... of his person, or the private parts thereof\u2019 or \u201can obscene ... <em>exposure </em>of his person, or the private parts thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-387 (emphases added). Our review of the common law of indecent exposure and the language of the statute itself compels the conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>words \u201cdisplay\u201d and \u201cexposure\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-387 are synonymous and that the statute applies only when the body part in question was clearly visible without clothing or was exposed without clothing and likely to be seen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>1960 Va.

Both the history of the common law offense of indecent exposure and the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>used by the legislature in enacting the successive code sections that have proscribed indecent exposure fail to support the conclusion that the legislature intended to change the common law when it used the word \u201cdisplay\u201d in its enactment of Code \u00a7 18.2-387.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">At common law, indecent exposure involved intentionally exposing one\u2019s private parts in a manner that same could reasonably have been seen by members of the public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Noblett v.

In doing so, we conducted an extended analysis of the \u201corigin and contemporary definition of the verb \u2018expose\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cExpose\u201d originated as an adaptation of the Latin verb \u201cexponere,\u201d which includes the following definitions: 1) to put or bring out into the open, or 2) to put on show or <em>display. </em>5 <em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>578 (2d ed.1989); <em>Oxford Latin Dictionary </em>651 (1982). Today, the definition has remained true to its roots. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>802 (1981), defines \u201cexpose\u201d as \u201cto lay open to view.\u201d In <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>579 (6th ed.1990), \u201cexpose\u201d is defined as: \u201cTo show publicly; <em>to display; </em>to offer to the public view....\u201d <em>Black\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cindecent exposure\u201d is also instructive: \u201cThis term refers to exhibition of those private parts which ... human decency ... require[s] shall be kept covered in [the] presence of others. Exposure ... becomes indecent when it occurs at such time and place where [a] reasonable person knows or should know his act [may be viewed by] others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACQ\"><em>Id. </em>at 697-98, 508 S.E.2d at 352 (emphases added); <em>see also Brooker v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 609, 616, 587 S.E.2d 732, 735 (2003) (adopting <em>Siquina\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cexpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The structure of the statute itself also fails to establish that the legislature did not intend the term \u201cdisplay\u201d to be synonymous with the term \u201cexposure.\u201d The legislature used the terms \u201cdisplay or exposure\u201d in the first part of the statute to proscribe the behavior in which an individual may not himself or herself engage, but it used only the term \u201cexposure\u201d in the second half of the statute to set out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>behavior in which an individual may not \u201cprocure\u201d another to engage. It would be anomalous under the language of this statute to hold that the legislature intended to punish a defendant for engaging in either of two types of behavior himself but to punish him for enticing someone else to engage in only one of those two types of behavior. A court must construe the challenged statute \u201cfrom its four corners and not by singling out particular words or phrases.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 109, 113, 379 S.E.2d 374, 376 (1989). \u201cIf the several provisions of a statute suggest a potential for conflict or inconsistency, we construe those provisions so as to reconcile them and to give full effect to the expressed legislative intent.\u201d <em>Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 173, 176-77, 474 S.E.2d 866, 868 (1996) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201c[A] statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). Absent a clear legislative intent to the contrary, principles of statutory construction compel us to conclude the legislature intended that a \u201cdisplay\u201d in violation of the statute also requires an \u201cexposure.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Thus, by its plain terms, the statute requires that the accused actually render visible or cause to be seen or likely to be seen the body or the proscribed part. The statute requires proof of some degree of nudity of the body or the private parts of the body under circumstances denoting obscenity and satisfying the other statutory requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 512, 515-16, 525 S.E.2d 9, 10-11 (2000) (holding that evidence of defendant\u2019s exposing his genitals and being visibly aroused in a woman\u2019s backyard was sufficient to support conviction for indecent exposure); <em>Morales v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 541, 543, 525 S.E.2d 23, 24 (2000) (holding evidence of defendant\u2019s exposing his erect penis and masturbating outside a lighted window sufficient to convict for indecent exposure).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The evidence proved that Moses did not expose his genitalia or private parts to the children on either occasion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence proved Moses was fully clothed and exposed no part of his body as proscribed by the statute. <em>Cf. Hart v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 77, 80, 441 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1994) (holding that a man wearing \u201ca skimpy G-string which covered only his penis and anus, leaving his pubic area and buttocks exposed,\u201d violated the statute by intentionally exposing in an obscene manner his pubic area and buttocks). In both instances, Moses rubbed his \u201cprivate parts\u201d beneath his clothing while looking at the girls and while in a position where the girls could see his conduct. In neither instance, however, did he cause to be visible any part of his body that he rubbed. One girl testified that she did not see the shape of his penis as he rubbed it. The other girl testified only that he was standing behind a display rack \u201crubbing ... his private area.\u201d She, likewise, did not see his genitalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The statute is not a general bar to a person\u2019s conducting himself or herself in an indecent or offensive manner. Thus, for example, the statute obviously does not purport to proscribe tight pants or sweaters or other garments that opaquely clothe the body but leave some portion of the population offended due to sensitivity about the tightness of the garment. It does not, by its terms, bar hand gestures that might be considered offensive. Indeed, nothing in the statutory words, when given their meanings in ordinary parlance, bars a person from the mere act of rubbing himself or herself without proof of more. The statute bars \u201cobscene\u201d conduct, not indecent conduct that does not expose parts of the body. <em>See, e.g., State v. Jaime </em>4 Conn.Cir.Ct. 530, 236 A.2d 474, 475 (1967) (holding that defendant\u2019s \u201cshaking his hand in his pelvic region\u201d and exposing white underpants was insufficient to support a conviction for violating statute prohibiting \u201cwantonly and indecently expos[ing] his person\u201d); <em>State v. Wymore, </em>98 Idaho 197, 560 P.2d 868, 869-70 (1977) (holding that a statute barring a person from \u201cpublicly exposing] his person or his genitals\u201d does not reach obscene gestures and comments where the accused did not expose his private parts).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">This case is not about a disagreement over whether Moses\u2019s acts were rude, disgusting, or indecent. It also is not about freeing a pedophile. Moses is serving a ten-year sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>tence, with four years suspended on various conditions, for the felony of taking indecent liberties with a child pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-370. Further, the prosecutor obviously selected among the various other statutes under which Moses could have been prosecuted in deciding how to proceed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 (proscribing aggravated sexual battery); Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4 (proscribing sexual battery); Code \u00a7 18.2-370(1) (proscribing indecent liberties with children); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-26 (proscribing <em>attempts </em>to commit noncapital felonies); <em>Jaime, </em>236 A.2d at 475-76 (holding defendant\u2019s \u201cshaking his hand in his pelvic region\u201d and exposing white underpants did not violate indecent exposure statute but might amount to disorderly conduct). If any gaps exist in the types of behavior the various statutes proscribe, it is the job of the legislature, not the courts, to fill those gaps. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Statler, </em>121 F.Supp.2d 925, 927 &amp; n. 6 (E.D.Va.2000) (holding \u201cthere is little doubt that masturbation in a public bathroom, if proven, fits well within <em>the federal regulation </em>proscribing \u2018a display or act that is obscene\u2019 \u201d but emphasizing that the federal regulation is <em>\u201cbroader </em>than ... the Virginia indecent exposure statute\u201d because the Virginia statute \u201crequires a display or exposure of parts of one\u2019s body [whereas the federal regulation] does not\u201d (emphases added)); <em>see also </em>Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2907.09 (2004) (proscribing public indecency, which it defines to include \u201crecklessly\u201d \u201c(1) [e]xpos[ing] his or her private parts, or engaging] in masturbation; (2) [e]ngag[ing] in sexual conduct; [or] (3) [e]ngaging in conduct that to an ordinary observer would appear to be sexual conduct or masturbation\u201d); <em>Duvallon v. District of Columbia, </em>515 A.2d 724, 725 n. 1 (D.C.1986) (analyzing conviction for indecent exposure under statute making it unlawful \u201cfor any person or persons to make any obscene or indecent exposure of his or her person, <em>or </em>to make any other lewd, obscene, or indecent sexual proposal, <em>or </em>to commit any other lewd, obscene, or indecent act\u201d (emphases added)); <em>State v.

Absent proof that either of the girls saw or was reasonably likely to have seen Moses\u2019s genitals, at least partially uncovered, the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions under the particular statute at issue in this case, regardless of the intent with which Moses acted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is our job to interpret and apply the laws the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>legislature has enacted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For these reasons, we reverse both misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-10\">. We do not describe the evidence supporting the felony conviction because those events occurred on a separate occasion and are not germane to the issues on this appeal. Furthermore, because Moses does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to prove he acted intentionally, we also need not review as an issue on appeal that aspect of the misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\">. No evidence established that Moses's covered penis was visible in outline form through his clothing in either of the incidents at issue. Thus, we need not consider whether such behavior would constitute a \"display or exposure\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. Indecent exposure \u201c[sjtatutes have generally adopted the common law requirements of the offense of indecent exposure; to convict someone of indecent exposure, there must be shown a wilful and intentional exposure of the private parts of the body.\u201d 50 Am.Jur.2d <em>Lewdness, Indecency, and Obscenity </em>\u00a7 17, at 291-92 (1995). Thus, courts typically have held that \"[i]ndecent exposure at common law consists of exposure in public of the entire person or of parts that should not be exhibited.\u201d <em>State v. Chiles, </em>53 Wash.App. 452, 767 P.2d 597, 599 (1989); <em>see also Massicot, </em>118 Cal.Rptr.2d at 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\">. An analogy between the use of the term \"display\u201d in the indecent exposure statute and Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, which proscribes \"display[ing]\u201d a firearm in a threatening manner during the commission of certain felonies, is inapt for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">First, the Virginia cases construing the firearms statute to hold a weapon was displayed to a victim through a sense other than actual sight involved the sense of touch. See, <em>e.g., Cromite v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 64, 67-68, 348 S.E.2d 38, 40 (1986) (involving a robber who approached the victim with his hand in his pocket and \"stuck something ['hard'] in his stomach ... that \u2018felt ... like a pistol\u2019 \u201d). Here, Moses's conduct did not involve tactile experiences. Rather, they involved only vague visual manifestations not proved sufficient to show even the outline of a penis beneath his trousers. <em>See supra </em>footnote 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Second, the evils at which the two statutes are directed are entirely different. The presence of a firearm as an aid to a felony may be just as effective even where the firearm is not displayed visually; one need not see a firearm in order to be motivated by fear of the potential harm it represents. <em>See Cromite, </em>3 Va.App. at 67-68, 348 S.E.2d at 40. In the case of indecent exposure, however, the core of the offense is just that\u2014 the exposure itself, coupled with the related shock and embarrassment, <em>Massicot, </em>118 Cal.Rptr.2d at 711-12, rather than the fear that it represents some intent to do physical harm to the victim. Other statutes criminalize sexual behavior that threatens direct physical con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>tact or harm. As a result, what it means to display a firearm during the commission of a felony has little or no relevance to determining what types of displays violate the indecent exposure statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">. <em>See supra </em>footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">. Citing <em>Wicks </em>and <em>Siquina, </em>the dissent suggests that we do not need to have an actual display of a person\u2019s genitalia in order to find conduct sufficient to convict for indecent exposure under Code \u00a7 18.2-387. The facts in <em>Wicks </em>showed, however, that while the police officer \"could not be certain that he had actually seen the defendant\u2019s organ because his hand was covering it,\u201d the officer did testify that he saw the defendant \"holding his hand in front of his trousers and ... urinating\u201d as he walked. 215 Va. at 275 n. 1, 208 S.E.2d at 754 n. 1. Thus, the defendant\u2019s conduct supported an inference beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s genitalia was actually exposed. Furthermore, in <em>Siquina, </em>while the child did not see the defendant\u2019s genitalia, the child's mother saw the defendant in the bathroom with her child and saw the defendant's erect penis. 28 Va.App. at 697, 508 S.E.2d at 352. Although <em>Siquina </em>dealt with Code \u00a7 18.2-370, taking indecent liberties with a child, the facts also showed that actual exposure of genitalia did occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\">. Although the dissent contends otherwise, our present holding, in conjunction with existing case law, does not compel the conclusion that a female swimmer wearing a thong bathing suit violates the indecent exposure statute whereas a man masturbating beneath his trench coat does not. The indecent exposure statute requires both a proscribed act and a particular intent. Our decision in <em>Hart </em>involved not a swimmer at the beach but a man in an office supply store who wore Velcro shorts which he dropped to reveal a \u201creal skimpy,\u201d \"form-fitting\u201d \u201cG-string\u201d that showed the outline of his penis and provided no coverage for his remaining pubic area and buttocks. 18 Va.App. at 78, 441 S.E.2d at 706-07. We held Hart violated the statute not only because his choice of attire \"constituted 'an exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof,\u2019 \u201d by exposing his groin and buttocks, but also because his behavior, including his suggestive statements to the store clerk about his G-string and shorts, his delay in putting his shorts back on, and his return to the store wearing the same shorts six days later, indicated an intent to make \"an obscene display or exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 441 S.E.2d at 707-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Thus, under <em>Hart, </em>a sunbather wearing a G-string swim suit at the beach might violate the \"exposure\u201d portion of the statute, but more would be required to prove she acted with the requisite intent. In the case of a man masturbating in obvious fashion beneath his trench coat without exposing his person or private parts to public view, just the reverse would likely be true\u2014the evidence would establish that his behavior was obscene but would not establish the requisite exposure of his person or private parts. The possible existence of a gap in the statutes proscribing obscene and lewd behavior does not permit the judiciary to expand the scope of the offense of indecent exposure beyond its statutory and common law bounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b625-11\">.

He followed. \u201cYou look a lot like my granddaughter,\u201d he added. The defendant then asked her if she would \u201clike to see a picture\u201d of his granddaughter. Without waiting for a response, he showed her a photo of a young woman performing oral sex with a man. \u201cDo you want to do it?\u201d the defendant asked. \u201cI\u2019ll give you $20.\u201d The girl ran to her mother, crying hysterically.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">On August 8, 2001, the defendant walked up to a 10-year-old girl at a Kmart. While he masturbated in front of the child, he told her she was \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d The child saw his hand \u201cthrough his pants\u201d exercising his penis. Pale with fright, the child later told her mother what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">On December 4, 2001, the defendant stalked an 11-year-old girl at a Wal-Mart. He made eye-contact with the child and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>passed her in the aisle several times. As he did so, the defendant masturbated with a hand down his pants while looking directly at her. During a brief moment while the child\u2019s mother spoke with a friend, the defendant approached the girl. He told her she was a \u201cpretty girl\u201d and asked her how her \u201cbutt felt.\u201d The child ran to her mother confused and upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">After his arrest, the defendant admitted he showed the lewd photo to the first child and solicited oral sex from her. He also admitted the other two incidents. According to him, he used a similar <em>modus operandi </em>about 40 to 50 times with young girls. It \u201cMnda became a habit.\u201d He showed the same photo to \u201cprobably half a dozen\u201d young girls. This pattern of behavior, he confessed, began about four months earlier when for \u201csome unknown reason\u201d he approached a young girl and told her \u201cshe was very attractive.\u201d The girl walked away after he offered to \u201ctake her back to [his] cabin\u201d in the mountains.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The following week he stayed at a friend\u2019s home. \u201cI found myself walking in my sleep,\u201d he recounted, and slept-walked into \u201cmy buddy\u2019s daughter\u2019s bedroom.\u201d Thereafter, the defendant began to frequent Wal-Mart and Kmart because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s where the crowd is and where you can wander around and look at people.\u201d \u201cIt became a method of letting off steam,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause I had no other sexual outlet.\u201d He went to several public libraries for the same purpose. His underlying problem, the defendant said, was the \u201cneed to fulfill my sex drive.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>After reviewing the defendant\u2019s sex offender evaluation, the trial judge found the defendant to be a sexual \u201cpredator\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe least I can do in this case is to try to prevent you from committing these crimes again by incarcerating you.\u201d Convicted of one count of taking indecent liberties with a child under Code \u00a7 18.2-370 and two counts of indecent display or exposure under Code \u00a7 18.2-387, the defendant appeals only his latter two convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The majority opinion holds that the defendant\u2019s public masturbation, <em>as a matter of law, </em>does not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-387. Such behavior can only offend the statute, the majority reasons, if the masturbation takes place at least partly in the nude. Without explanation, however, the opinion leaves open the possibility (one inconsistent with its holding) that the statute may also forbid fully clothed masturbation where \u201cthe outline form\u201d of the penis can be discerned \u201cthrough his clothing.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 571 n. 2 <em>&amp; </em>575 n. 5, 600 S.E.2d at 165 n. 2 &amp; 167 n. 5 (cross-referencing n. 2). I find both the holding, as well as its caveat, to be just the kind of \u201ccurious, narrow, or strained construction\u201d of a statute, <em>Melanson v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 178, 183, 539 S.E.2d 433, 435 (2001), that we should faithfully avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, a man sitting on a boardwalk bench at the beach could masturbate under his trench coat\u2014in a way that brazenly reveals what he is doing to every passerby\u2014and not display or expose his \u201cperson\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-387. But a swimmer wearing a thong bathing suit arguably would. <em>See, e.g., Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 77, 80, 441 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1994) (exposure of \u201cbuttocks\u201d and \u201cpubic area,\u201d while wearing a \u201cG-string\u201d swim suit, violates indecent exposure statute).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>example, the man displays sexual activity obvious to all. In the second, the swimmer displays no sexual activity of any nature. Yet the swimmer, not the masturbator, has a greater risk of violating the display-or-expose element of Code \u00a7 18.2-387.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Equally incongruent is that the children in our case actually saw the defendant masturbating. He was, after all, standing right in front of them. His obscene display was considerably more communicative than the statute requires. Under existing precedent, indecent exposure in a public place can occur even if no one in fact observes it\u2014so long as it could have been observed had someone been looking. <em>See Wicks v. Charlottesville, </em>215 Va. 274, 276, 208 S.E.2d 752, 754-55 (1974) (noting that, if the exposure likely could be seen, it is irrelevant \u201cwhether actually seen by a single person or by several\u201d because it still \u201cis an act of \u2018gross and open indecency, injurious to public morals\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Siquina v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 694, 697-99, 508 S.E.2d 350, 352-53 (1998) (holding that, under the indecent liberties statute, \u201cwhether an object is actually seen by its intended audience is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>irrelevant to whether that object has been exposed\u201d). Under the majority view, therefore, the statute applies to a man who exposes himself only to himself, but not to a man who flagrantly masturbates in plain view of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">These interpretative anomalies cannot be squared with either the historical context or literal text of Code \u00a7 18.2-387. The common law recognized any \u201copen and notorious lewdness\u201d as an indictable offense. 4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Law of England </em>*64 (1769). The offense included any \u201cgrossly scandalous and public indecency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Virginia adopted this common law restatement. <em>See </em>William W. Hening, <em>The Virginia Justice </em>431 (4th ed. 1825) (stating that \u201cin general, all open lewdness, grossly scandalous, is punishable upon indictment at common law\u201d); James M. Matthews, <em>Virginia Criminal Laws </em>123 (2d ed. 1878) (recognizing crime of \u201copen and gross lewdness and lasciviousness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Nudity or near nudity is not, and never has been, the all-important referent. The lewd nature of the <em>conduct </em>itself, if open and notorious, was the main characteristic of the offense. When state legislatures began codifying various subsets of this common law crime, they did not abandon its \u201copen and notorious\u201d characteristic. The history of these codification efforts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">leads to one of two possible conclusions about the framers\u2019 intentions with respect to the regulation of sexual intercourse and masturbation. On the one hand, it could be inferred that, because the framers so relentlessly prohibited even as little as public nudity, it necessarily follows that public intercourse and masturbation would have been regarded as even more odious and even more obviously subject to state regulation. On the other hand, it could be inferred that, although the framers understood that public nudity could be regulated, they apparently understood that public nudity while engaged in intercourse or masturbation could not (or that both were permissible as long as the offenders kept their clothes on). Frankly, given the evidence that we have described about antebellum public mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>als, statutes, and case law, we find the latter possibility to be remote, to say the least.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><em>State v. Ciancanelli, </em>181 Or.App. 1, 45 P.3d 451, 459 (Or.Ct. App.) <em>(en </em>banc), petition for review allowed, 335 Or. 90, 58 P.3d 821 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">It follows that open and notorious masturbation in a public place, in a manner obvious to all, falls squarely within reach of the common law. <em>See generally Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (noting that patently offensive \u201crepresentations or descriptions of masturbation\u201d are \u201cobscene\u201d); <em>State v. Maunsell, </em>170 Vt. 543, 743 A.2d 580, 582-83 (1999) (upholding conviction for \u201copen and gross lewdness\u201d where defendant \u201cmassag[ed] his genitals through his pants\u201d in a public place); <em>see also United States v. Statler, </em>121 F.Supp.2d 925, 927 (E.D.Va.2000) (observing that \u201cthere is little doubt that masturbation in a public bathroom, if proven, fits well within the federal regulation proscribing \u2018a display or act that is obscene\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Consistent with this view, Virginia codified a particular type of common law lewdness offense in Code \u00a7 18.2-387. Leaving little doubt as to its intentions, the General Assembly criminalized the \u201cobscene display <em>or </em>exposure\u201d of one\u2019s \u201cperson, <em>or </em>the private parts thereof\u2019 in a public place. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). As has been often said: \u201cWords in a statute should be interpreted, <em>if possible, </em>to avoid rendering words superfluous.\u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 114, 597 S.E.2d 84, 86 (2004) (emphasis added); <em>Zhou v. Zhou, </em>38 Va.App. 126, 136, 562 S.E.2d 336, 340 (2002) (observing that \u201cbasic canons of statutory construction\u201d exclude interpretations rendering statutory language \u201csuperfluous\u201d). The question, then, is whether it is possible to do so in this case. I think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The majority opinion interprets the word \u201cexposure\u201d to mean nudity and \u201cdisplay\u201d to mean nothing more. The disjunctive thus becomes a redundant conjunctive. No Virginia case has ever interpreted this statute in this manner. And for good reason: Unless the word \u201cdisplay\u201d is superfluous, it must mean something different from \u201cexposure.\u201d If \u201cexposure\u201d can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>only mean some degree of nudity, then \u201cdisplay\u201d necessarily means something different. And so it does. Among the definitions of \u201cdisplay\u201d in ordinary speech (particularly where, as here, it is used as a noun rather than a verb) is the \u201cdemonstration or manifestation of something.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>407 (2d coll, ed.1985).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is just that definition we give to the word \u201cdisplay\u201d when used in other provisions of the Virginia Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">For example, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 criminalizes the \u201cdisplay\u201d of a firearm while committing a felony. A robber can effectively \u201cdisplay\u201d a firearm in his pocket even though completely hidden from view. <em>Cromite v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 64, 67, 348 S.E.2d 38, 40 (1986). The word \u201cdisplay\u201d means \u201cnot only the notion of spreading before view or exhibiting to the sight, but also that which is manifested to any of a victim\u2019s senses.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Smallwood, </em>346 A.2d 164, 167 (Del.1975)). \u201cThus a weapon may be manifested to a victim even though he may not see it\u201d because the ability to otherwise discern the weapon\u2019s presence itself is a manifestation \u201cjust as effective, for the statutory purpose, as putting a gun in plain view.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Deshields v. State, </em>706 A.2d 502, 507 (Del.1998) (finding that robber \u201cdisplays\u201d a weapon by putting his hand in his pocket and then handling the weapon); <em>People v. Butts, </em>181 A.D.2d 432, 580 N.Y.S.2d 758, 758 (N.Y.App.Div.1992) (holding that robber displays a weapon by putting his hand inside his jacket and asking victim if it would \u201cmake a difference\u201d if he had a gun).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The majority finds none of this persuasive, concluding instead that the meaning of \u201cdisplay\u201d has been foreclosed by prior Virginia cases. The three Virginia cases cited by the majority, however, do not mention or discuss the word \u201cdisplay\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-387. <em>See, e.g., Wicks, </em>215 Va. at 276, 208 S.E.2d at 754 (interpreting local ordinance stating that no \u201cperson shall indecently <em>expose </em>himself\u2019 (emphasis added)); <em>Noblett v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 241, 72 S.E.2d 241 (1952) (affirming a conviction on an indictment alleging that the defendant <em>exposed </em>himself); <em>Siquina, </em>28 Va.App. at 697-99, 508 S.E.2d at 352-53 (interpreting the indecent liberties statute, which forbids <em>exposing </em>one\u2019s sexual or genital parts to a child). They instead focus entirely on the meaning of \u201cexpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Under Virginia law, <em>stare decisis </em>does not \u201cforeclose inquiry\u201d into an issue not previously \u201craised, discussed, or decided.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Hosp. Auth. v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 551, 560, 554 S.E.2d 55, 59 (2001); <em>see also Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 639-40, 593 S.E.2d 568, 574 (2004). The majority\u2019s holding, therefore, cannot be justified as a necessary application of settled precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Even so, I see a deeper problem with the majority\u2019s singular focus on cases interpreting the word \u201cexpose.\u201d From a logical point of view, the entire discussion begs the question. Every visible <em>exposure </em>of one\u2019s genitals will necessarily involve a <em>display </em>of one\u2019s genitals. The former concept, by definition, subsumes the latter. (That\u2019s why <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cexposure\u201d to include \u201cdisplay.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 572, 600 S.E.2d at 166.) But that does not prove the reverse: that every <em>display </em>necessarily includes an <em>exposure. </em>Hence, a robber can still display a handgun in his pocket while not exposing it to sight. (Which explains why <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>nowhere defines \u201cdisplay\u201d to include \u201cexposure.\u201d) This <em>non sequitur </em>permeates the majority\u2019s reasoning. And it was just this misunderstanding, I believe, the General Assembly sought to avoid by conspicuously using the disjunctive \u201cdisplay <em>or </em>exposure\u201d formulation in Code \u00a7 18.2-387.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Finally, the majority opinion contains a curious caveat. The opinion\u2019s <em>ratio decidendi </em>collapses together the words display and exposure, treating them as exact synonyms. But in <em>dicta </em>the majority says it \u201cneed not\u201d decide whether its interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-387 would criminalize non-nudity in cases where the \u201coutline\u201d of the penis could be discerned underneath the defendant\u2019s clothing. <em>Ante </em>at 571 n. 2 <em>&amp; </em>575 n. 5, 600 S.E.2d at 165 n. 2 &amp; 167 n. 5 (cross-referencing n. 2). This caveat attempts to keep alive the remark in <em>Hart, </em>18 Va.App. at 78, 441 S.E.2d at 706, which found legal significance in the fact that the \u201coutline\u201d of the defendant\u2019s penis could be discerned underneath his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">I do not think the majority can have it both ways. If display means exposure, and exposure means some degree of nudity, then a masturbator who keeps his pants on cannot be convicted as a matter of law\u2014no matter how much his penis distorts the outer contours of his clothing. I thus do not understand how it can be said by my colleagues that they \u201cneed not\u201d decide this point. <em>Ante </em>at 571 n. 2, 600 S.E.2d at 165 n. 2. It seems to me they already did.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The majority apparently believes, however, its interpretation of the statute would not necessarily foreclose a conviction in this case if the two girls had simply said they could discern the \u201coutline\u201d of the defendant\u2019s penis underneath his clothing. If so, I do not see any principled basis to draw the line there. If the statute applies to a victim seeing the \u201coutline\u201d of the defendant\u2019s penis through his clothes, it should be no less objectionable that the victim similarly sees the outline of the defendant\u2019s hand masturbating his non-outlined penis. The visual assault in the latter scenario is arguably more obscene than in the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Sitting as factfinder, the trial judge found the defendant\u2019s public masturbation to be an \u201cobscene display or exposure\u201d of his \u201cperson, or the private parts thereof\u2019 in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-387. The issue on appeal is whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>of fact\u201d could have come to this conclusion. <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 747, 595 S.E.2d 9, 13 (2004) (emphasis in original and citations omitted). The question answers itself. To be sure, I can think of few things more obscene than a pedophile masturbating in front of a young child as he tries to talk her into being his next victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\">. On appeal, we should review the evidence in the \"light most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v.

The defendant in <em>Hart </em>raised two issues on appeal, arguing that \"the evidence was insufficient to show (1) that his behavior constituted \u2018an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof' and (2) that his behavior was obscene.\" <em>Id. </em>at 78, 441 S.E.2d at 706. <em>Hart </em>answered the first question by pointing out that the G-string \u201ccovered\u201d the defendant\u2019s \"penis and anus\" but left his \"pubic area and buttocks exposed\u201d to view. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 441 S.E.2d at 708. <em>Hart </em>answered the second question, whether that exposure was obscene, by finding it sufficient that the defendant made crude remarks alluding to sex. <em>Id. </em>at 80, 441 S.E.2d at 708 (finding obscene the defendant\u2019s statement to a saleswoman \"What do you think of the whole picture?\u201d and his comment that \"he liked his velcro shorts because they 'gave easy access to women who wanted him\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. It entirely misses the point to observe, <em>ante </em>at 578 n. 7, 600 S.E.2d at 169 n. 7, that to convict the scantily clad swimmer he must also do or say something obscene. The statute requires both: the act of \"display or exposure\u201d and circumstances allowing a factfinder to deem that act obscene. <em>Ante </em>at 572 n. 3, 600 S.E.2d at 166 n. 3. In my example, I focus solely on the act, not its lewd characteristics. However, if this case required an examination of the obscenity aspect of the statute, I would agree with the majority that <em>Hart </em>found this element proved by the defendant\u2019s \"suggestive statements\u201d about his \"G-string and shorts.\u201d <em>See Ante </em>at 578 n. 7, 600 S.E.2d at 169 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">. This point demonstrates the irrelevance of <em>State v. Jaime, 4 </em>Conn.Cir.Ct. 530, 236 A.2d 474, 475 (1967), and <em>State v. Wymore, 98 </em>Idaho 197, 560 P.2d 868, 869-70 (1977), cited by the majority. <em>Ante </em>at 576, 600 S.E.2d at 168. The indecency laws in both cases only make it unlawful to \"expose\u201d the person or private parts. Neither statute goes further and criminalizes the \"display\u201d of the person or private parts, as does Code \u00a7 18.2-387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. I see nothing \"anomalous\u201d or \"absurd,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 574, 600 S.E.2d at 167, about the General Assembly using the \"so expose\u201d phrase in the procurement portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-387. Nor do I understand how this phrase empties the word \"display\u201d of any substantive meaning, leaving it legally immaterial that it is even in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
