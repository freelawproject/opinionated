Berglund also argues that the statute of limitations and equitable doctrine of laches bar Landrum\u2019s claim. Finding no error in the commission\u2019s findings, we affirm its award.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">We view the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to Landrum, the prevailing party before the commission. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>While at work on August 26,1994, Landrum suffered a back injury when a co-employee pulled a chair from beneath him as he was sitting down. Landrum fell, \u201clanding on his buttock with his back striking the wall.\u201d Landrum described feeling a shock \u201cextend up his spine to about his head and down into both legs to about the knees.\u201d He reported the accident and received a workers\u2019 compensation award for a herniated disc, requiring lower back surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Soon after the accident, Landrum began feeling a \u201csevere\u201d and \u201csteady constant pain\u201d in his \u201cprivate area.\u201d Within a few months, he started experiencing intermittent episodes of sexual dysfunction. Landrum explained the problem, at that time, \u201cwas more in the nature of pain rather than actual erectile dysfunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Landrum visited Dr. John Heil, a clinical psychologist, in September 1999. Dr. Heil evaluated Landrum and concluded he suffered from \u201cmajor depression\u201d and \u201cpain disorder with psychological factors.\u201d Over the next several months, Land-rum began taking a variety of anti-depressant medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In early 2000, Landrum experienced increased episodes of sexual dysfunction. The symptoms grew worse as time progressed, but it was not until March 2002 that Landrum disclosed his condition to Dr. John Daugherty, his treating physician. Dr. Daugherty prescribed Viagra based upon his medical opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">Mr. Landrum is regularly followed through our office for complications of a closed head injury that occurred on 6/08/90 with associated chronic headaches. He, in addition, has a history of back injuries associated with both the headaches and back pain, a chronic pain syndrome/complex regional pain disorder. As a result of the <em>combination of these problems and the medications used to treat them, </em>he has difficulty with erectile dysfunction, improved with Viagra. It is difficult to blame a specific medication or injury and it is likely that it is the <em>combination of both injuries and his medications </em>that have contributed to his sexual dysfunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>It is my feeling that both injuries play a role in causing his sexual dysfunction, along with the associated treating medications and therefore there should be some divided responsibility relative to coverage of the patient\u2019s Viagra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHC\">(Emphasis added). The 1990 accident referred to by Dr. Daugherty involved a preexisting injury caused when \u201ca meat hook or some type of metal hook\u201d hit Landrum in the forehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Focusing more on Landrum\u2019s depression rather than his pain syndrome, Dr. Heil offered this psychological opinion in a December 2002 report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">Based on the timeline of onset and clinical circumstances, it is my impression that there is a preponderance of evidence to suggest that <em>this is due to his on-the-job injury </em>of August 24,1994. Specifically, sexual performance was not a problem prior to the injury. To the extent it may be influenced by stress, depression, or medication use, it, in turn, appears to relate back to this injury\u2014as use of mediation [sic] and issues of depression and anxiety do appear to have arisen from this injury. In addition, Mr. Landrum has been in a well established, positive, supportive, marital relationship which would preclude performance anxiety as a likely precipitant in this case. In fact, failure to perform sexually has added stress to this relationship, which is the most important element of his support system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHh\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Based upon these opinions, Landrum filed a claim with the commission for payment of his Viagra prescriptions and for one of his visits with Dr. Daugherty. After reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>evidence, the deputy commissioner awarded the Viagra prescription benefits on the ground that Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction was \u201ca direct result of side-effects from medications prescribed to treat his injury, and the cost of managing those side effects is the defendant\u2019s responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Because Landrum\u2019s condition did not become constant until shortly before he reported it to his employer, the deputy declined to apply the doctrine of laches. The deputy did not address Berglund\u2019s statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The deputy refused to order Berglund Chevrolet to pay Dr. Daugherty\u2019s invoice, finding that particular office visit unrelated to the workplace accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">On review, the full commission unanimously affirmed. The commission held that \u201cthe evidence predominates in establishing that the claimant has developed sexual/erectile dysfunction (and a need for Viagra), at least in part, as a direct consequence of the workplace injury to his back.\u201d The commission also determined neither the statute of limitations nor the doctrine of laches barred Landrum\u2019s claim. The denial of Dr. Daugherty\u2019s invoice, the commission agreed, was proper because Landrum did not prove this treatment related to his employment injury or its medical <em>sequelae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">On three grounds, Berglund appeals the commission\u2019s award of Viagra prescription benefits to Landrum. First, Berglund argues that Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction cannot be fairly characterized as a compensable consequence of his 1994 workplace injury. Second, in any event, the sexual dysfunction should be treated as a new and separate injury for purposes of the statute of limitations. Third, Berglund contends the equitable doctrine of laches bars the claim even if the statute of limitations does not do so. The commission disagreed with each of these assertions, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">We begin with the governing standard of review. By statute, an award of the commission \u201cshall be conclusive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A). \u201cThis appellate deference is not a mere legal custom, subject to a flexible application, but a statutory command,\u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology </em>Assocs. <em>v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 279, 590 S.E.2d 631, 639 (2004), one that we scrupulously obey both in principle and in practice when reviewing questions of causation, <em>see, e.g., Steadman v. Liberty Fabrics, Inc., </em>41 Va.App. 796, 803, 589 S.E.2d 465, 469 (2003); <em>S.P. Terry Co. v. Rubinos, </em>38 Va.App. 624, 632, 567 S.E.2d 584, 588 (2002); <em>Lee County Sch. Bd. v. Miller, </em>38 Va.App. 253, 260, 563 S.E.2d 374, 377 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">We likewise defer to the commission\u2019s \u201cconclusions upon conflicting inferences, legitimately drawn from proven facts\u201d\u2014for inferences, like historic facts, are likewise \u201cequally binding on appeal.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Halco Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>225 Va. 97, 101, 300 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1983); <em>see also Hall v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., </em>41 Va.App. 835, 843, 589 S.E.2d 484, 488 (2003). Such deference is warranted \u201ceven though there is evidence in the record to support a contrary finding.\u201d <em>S.P. Terry Co., </em>38 Va.App. at 632, 567 S.E.2d at 588 (citations omitted). Acting within its factfinding discretion, therefore, the commission \u201cis free to adopt that view \u2018which is most consistent with reason and justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Georgia-Pac. Corp. v. Robinson, </em>32 Va.App. 1, 5, 526 S.E.2d 267, 269 (2000) (quoting <em>C.D.S. Constr. Servs. v. Petrock, </em>218 Va. 1064, 1070, 243 S.E.2d 236, 240 (1978)) (bracketed material omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The doctrine of compensable consequences attempts, in a single phrase, to summarize the attenuation limits of causation in workers\u2019 compensation law. \u201cThe simplest application of this principle is the rule that all the medical consequences and <em>sequelae </em>that flow from the primary injury are compensable.\u201d 1 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 10.01, at 10-3 (2003). Virginia courts have often used just this description, <em>see, e.g., Leonard v. Arnold, </em>218 Va. 210, 214, 237 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1977); <em>Sturtz v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>Chesapeake Corp., </em>38 Va.App. 672, 677, 568 S.E.2d 381, 384 (2002); <em>Am. Filtrona Co. v. Hanford, </em>16 Va.App. 159, 163, 428 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1993), as has the commission, <em>see, e.g., Fuller v. Meadow Creek Wood Shop, </em>2004 Va. Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 139, at *7 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Where such a causal link exists, \u201cthe doctrine of compensable consequences extends the coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to the subsequent injury because the subsequent injury \u2018is treated as if it occurred in the course of and arising out of the employee\u2019s employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bartholow Drywall Co. v. Hill, </em>12 Va.App. 790, 794, 407 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1991) (quoting <em>Leonard, </em>218 Va. at 214, 237 S.E.2d at 100). The doctrine applies \u201cwhen the injury does not arise on the day of the accident, but instead develops as a direct consequence of an initial injury.\u201d <em>Paul Johnson Plastering v. Johnson, </em>265 Va. 237, 244, 576 S.E.2d 447, 451 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The doctrine has its limits, however. \u201cThe link of causation must <em>directly connect </em>the original accidental injury with the additional injury for which compensation is sought.\u201d <em>Amoco Foam Prods. Co. v. Johnson, </em>257 Va. 29, 33, 510 S.E.2d 443, 445 (1999) (emphasis added); <em>see also Paul Johnson Plastering, </em>265 Va. at 244, 576 S.E.2d at 452. In other words, the issue is \u201cessentially one of whether the medical evidence proves a causal connection between the primary injury and the subsequent occurrence.\u201d <em>Williams Indus, v. Wagoner, </em>24 Va.App. 181, 188, 480 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1997). \u201cThe issue in all of these cases is exclusively the medical issue of causal connection between the primary injury and the subsequent medical complications. By the same token, denials of compensation in this category have invariably been the result of a conclusion that the requisite medical causal connection did not exist.\u201d 1 Arthur Larson, <em>et al., supra </em>\u00a7 10.02, at 10-5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>In this case, Dr. Daugherty attributed Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction (and, thus, his need for Viagra) to the original workplace injury. Dr. Daugherty focused on the combination of the \u201cchronic pain syndrome/complex regional pain disorder\u201d caused in part by the workplace accident and \u201cthe medications used to treat them.\u201d In his view, the causal chain was not interrupted by any intervening accidents, unrelated injuries, idiopathic conditions, or causal influences for which Landrum should bear responsibility. Finding Dr. Daugherty\u2019s opinion persuasive, the commission concluded \u201cthe evidence predominates in establishing that the claimant has developed sexual/erectile dysfunction (and a need for Viagra), at least <em>in part, </em>as a <em>direct consequence </em>of the workplace injury to his back.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Berglund contends Dr. Daugherty\u2019s opinion lacks sufficient certitude to justify the commission\u2019s reliance on it. His medical opinion attributed the sexual dysfunction to a cluster of causes\u2014the 1990 head injury, the 1994 back injury, the chronic pain syndrome, and the pain medications\u2014but did not separate out any specific predominating cause. Instead, Dr. Daugherty concluded only that the sexual dysfunction was a \u201cresult of the combination of these problems and the medications used to treat them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Berglund\u2019s point, however, goes only to the weight of the evidence, not its probative sufficiency. A medical opinion finding causation <em>in part, </em>if established with the requisite certitude, can be relied upon by the factfinder as persuasive. <em>See Smith v. Fieldcrest Mills, </em>224 Va. 24, 29, 294 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982) (holding that compensable cause need only be a <em>\u201ccontributing </em>factor\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Bergmann v. L &amp; W Dry wall, </em>222 Va. 30, 32, 278 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1981). \u201cThe extent or degree to which the work-related cause contributed is not important. It matters only that the work-related cause contributed in some part to claimant\u2019s disability.\u201d <em>Henrico County Sch. Bd. v. Etter, </em>36 Va.App. 437, 446, 552 S.E.2d 372, 376 (2001). It was unnecessary, therefore, for Dr. Daugherty\u2019s expert opinion to segregate the work-related part from the non-work-related part.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">In our case, the commission found the sexual dysfunction was \u201cat least in part\u201d a consequence of the workplace injury. Given the weight afforded the opinion of a treating physician\u2014particularly one involving medical causation <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014coupled with the compounding weight that opinion has once it has been accepted as true by the factfinder, we see no basis for overturning the commission\u2019s decision to treat Land-rum\u2019s sexual dysfunction as a compensable consequence of his workplace injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Berglund next claims that even if Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction was compensable, the commission erred by not applying the statute of limitations to bar Landrum\u2019s claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The timeliness of a compensable consequence claim depends on the type of injury suffered. \u2018Where the subsequent injury is a new injury, the provisions of Code \u00a7 [65.2-601] are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>applicable from the date of that new injury. When the subsequent injury is a change in condition, the provisions of Code \u00a7 [65.2-708(A) ] are applicable.\u201d <em>Bartholow Drywall Co., </em>12 Va.App. at 797, 407 S.E.2d at 5. Thus, \u201cnew and separate\u201d claims that causally relate to the original <em>accident, </em>but not the original <em>injury, </em>must be filed within the original limitations period outlined in Code \u00a7 65.2-601, which requires filing \u201cwithin two years after the accident.\u201d <em>See also Sturtz, </em>38 Va.App. at 676, 568 S.E.2d at 383.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">On the other hand, if the consequent injury is a mere change in condition\u2014some form of medical <em>sequelae </em>of the original injury, though not of the accident itself\u2014the claim falls within the limitations period of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), which requires filing within 24 months from the \u201clast day for which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award\u201d by the commission. When the medical evidence shows \u201can unbroken \u2018chain of causation,\u2019 the subsequent accident and injuries flowing from it are treated as part of the original claim and do not result in the establishment of a new, original, separate and independent claim file.\u201d <em>Sturtz, </em>38 Va.App. at 676-77, 568 S.E.2d at 383; <em>see also Bartholow Drywall Co., </em>12 Va.App. at 793, 407 S.E.2d at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In this case, the commission correctly viewed Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction as a change in condition, not a new and separate injury. This holding tracks Dr. Daugherty\u2019s opinion attributing the sexual dysfunction to a combination of the \u201cchronic pain syndrome/complex regional pain disorder\u201d caused in part by the workplace accident and \u201cthe medications used to treat them.\u201d As a result, Landrum\u2019s claim was subject to the statute of limitations period codified in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). By filing his claim for benefits in November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>2002, while under an open award of temporary total disability benefits, Landrum acted before the time limitation outlined in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) even began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We likewise find no fault in the commission\u2019s refusal to dismiss Landrum\u2019s claim under the equitable doctrine of laches. We define laches as \u201c \u2018the neglect or failure to assert a known right or claim for an unexplained period of time under circumstances prejudicial to the adverse party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bazzle v. Bazzle, </em>37 Va.App. 737, 747, 561 S.E.2d 50, 55 (2002) (quoting <em>Princess Anne Hills Civic League v. Susan Constant Real Est, </em>243 Va. 53, 58, 413 S.E.2d 599, 602 (1992)). The doctrine has no fixed guidelines\u2014\u201c \u2018no rigid rule can be laid down as to what delay will constitute laches; every suit must depend upon its own circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Stewart v. Lady, </em>251 Va. 106, 114, 465 S.E.2d 782, 786 (1996) (quoting <em>Puckett v. lessee, </em>195 Va. 919, 930, 81 S.E.2d 425, 431 (1954)). The litigant raising laches as a defense bears the burden of demonstrating both the requisite delay and prejudice. <em>Barr v. S.W. Rodgers Co., </em>34 Va.App. 50, 58, 537 S.E.2d 620, 624 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The commission acted within its factfinding discretion when it found that the delayed emergence of Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction, not a neglectful failure to assert his claim, explains the interval between his 1994 back injury and his 2002 claim for Viagra prescription benefits. Landrum acknowledged suffering occasional episodes of sexual dysfunction \u201csoon after his workplace accident,\u201d but considered the situation \u201cmore in the nature of pain rather than actual erectile dysfunction.\u201d It was not until \u201cprobably right at the year 2000,\u201d he explained, that his sexual dysfunction truly emerged. And even then, the condition was intermittent and did not become chronic until later.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In addition, Berglund did not demonstrate any prejudice because of the timing of the claim. No evidence was lost; no witnesses unfound; no temporary opportunities to mitigate Landrum\u2019s medical problems squandered. Under these cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>cumstances, the commission did not err in refusing to bar Landrum\u2019s claim under the equitable doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that Landrum\u2019s sexual dysfunction was a compensable consequence of his workplace injury. Because the claim was properly characterized as a medical <em>sequelae </em>rather than a new and separate injury, the commission correctly held Code \u00a7 65.2-601\u2019s statute of limitations did not apply. Given the circumstances explaining Landrum\u2019s delay in asserting his claim and Berglund\u2019s lack of prejudice, we also hold the commission did not err in refusing to dismiss Landrum\u2019s claim under the equitable doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. Landrum also began receiving psychiatric care from Dr. Robert Murdock in September 2002. Dr. Murdock concluded the \u201cprimary basis of [Landrum\u2019s] sexual dysfunction may be one or more of [his] psychiatric medications, most especially Celexa and Amitriptyline. Since this type of anti-depressant appears essential to control [his] psychiatric symptoms and as Viagra appears to be the only medicine likely to offset this particular side-effect, I recommend that [Landrum\u2019s] request to have it authorized through your Workman's Compensation insurance be granted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">. Even so, that does not mean a finding of causation must be \"based exclusively on medical evidence.
