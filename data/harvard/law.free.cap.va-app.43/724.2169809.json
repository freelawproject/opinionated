Alliance To Save The Mattaponi, <em>et al. </em>sought to intervene in the VAPA circuit court case. On September 25, 2003, the circuit court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>motion to intervene. Alliance filed a notice of appeal on October 20, 2003, which we recorded as Record No. 2700-03-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">On December 19, 2003, we directed the parties to file briefs addressing the question whether Code \u00a7 17.1-405(4) authorizes this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction over the circuit court\u2019s order denying intervention. Having reviewed the briefs and heard oral argument, we hold that the circuit court\u2019s order was not final and falls outside our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1405(4). <em>See generally Thrasher v. Lustig, </em>204 Va. 399, 403, 131 S.E.2d 286, 289 (1963) (noting that \u201cas a general rule interlocutory decrees or orders overruling motions as to joinder of parties, or a substitution of parties, are not appealable\u201d); <em>cf. Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action, </em>480 U.S. 370, 107 S.Ct. 1177, 94 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987) (holding that denial of permissive intervention cannot be subject to interlocutory appeal); <em>Bagwell v. United Mine Workers, </em>244 Va. 463, 474, 423 S.E.2d 349, 356 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>512 U.S. 821, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994) (holding that an \u201corder denying intervention was not a final, appealable order because it did not dispose of the whole subject matter of the case,\u201d and thus, the denial order motion can be challenged in an appeal of the final order).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>In their briefs, the parties advise that the underlying VAPA circuit court action has been settled by Newport News and the VMRC. Based upon that settlement, the circuit court entered a \u201cFinal Decree\u201d remanding the matter back to the VMRC for further proceedings and dismissing \u201cwith prejudice\u201d the VAPA proceeding commenced by Newport News. Alliance contends the entry of the Final Decree \u201cmay render moot this Court\u2019s question regarding its jurisdiction over the Alliance\u2019s appeal.\u201d This observation\u2014however valid with respect to an appeal filed after the entry of a final judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014 is not valid with respect to a previously filed appeal of an interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Under settled appellate practice, a notice of appeal of an interlocutory order must rise or fall based upon the Court\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 17.1-405(4). Rule 5A:6(a) provides that no appeal \u201cshall be allowed\u201d unless a notice of appeal has been filed within 30 days \u201cafter\u201d the appealable order. We have recognized an exception to this rule in cases where the appellant files the notice of appeal after the pronouncement of judgment, but before the formal entry of the judgment order. <em>See Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 154, 155, 402 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1991). But we have never suspended the timing requirement altogether to resurrect an otherwise unsuccessful interlocutory appeal. <em>See generally FirsTier Mortgage Co. v. Investors Mortgage Ins. Co., </em>498 U.S. 269, 276, 111 S.Ct. 648, 652, 112 L.Ed.2d 743 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">For these reasons, we dismiss without prejudice Record No. 2700-03-1 as outside our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-405(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">\n<em>Dismissed without prejudice.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">. We disagree that <em>Jones v. Rhea, </em>130 Va. 345, 369, 107 S.E. 814, 822 (1921), concludes otherwise. In that case, the Virginia Supreme Court held that it had appellate jurisdiction over an interlocutory order denying intervention under a statute authorizing appeal of \"any\u201d order of the State Corporation Commission. <em>Id. </em>The statute did \"not use the word 'final.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>Though we acknowledge the remark in <em>Jones </em>along the lines that the denial order was \"final\u201d as to the intervenors, we reject it as non-binding <em>dicta. See generally Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 566, 593 S.E.2d 533, 538 (2004) <em>(en banc ) (\u201cDicta </em>cannot 'serve as a source of binding authority in American jurisprudence.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). <em>Cf. Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>99 Va. 282, 284, 38 S.E. 195, 195 (1901) (referring to <em>Jeter v. Board, </em>68 (27 Gratt.) Va. 910, 1876 Va. LEXIS 82 (1876), the only citation relied upon in <em>Jones </em>for its <em>dicta, </em>the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIn that case, however, the court was dealing with a final order, and a glance at the opinion is sufficient to show that the language used by the learned judge was <em>obiter, </em>and it has been so held by this court in <em>Tucker v. Sandridge, </em>82 Va. 532.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">. <em>See Smith v. Woodlawn Constr. Co., </em>235 Va. 424, 429, 368 S.E.2d 699, 702 (1988) (recognizing the general rule that an \u201cadverse interlocutory adjudication may be the subject of appeal from the final adjudication\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
