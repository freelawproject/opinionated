On appeal, Breeden contends the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support each of these convictions and in admitting evidence of the complaining witness\u2019 recent complaints of rape under Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Breeden\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">Familiar appellate principles dictate that \u201cwe view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence established that Breeden and the complaining wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ness dated for some time prior to March 20, 2001. He stayed overnight in her house on several occasions and left some of his belongings at her house. Approximately two weeks before March 20, 2001, the complaining witness told Breeden she did not want him staying at her home and returned some of his belongings to his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On March 20, 2001, the complaining witness left her house at 7:30 p.m. She locked her house when she left. While she was out, Breeden broke into her house through a back window and waited for her to return. When she returned at 11:30 p.m., Breeden \u201cjumped out from behind the door\u201d with a pistol in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Holding the gun, Breeden demanded that she tell him where she had been that night. She responded, \u201cWhat do you mean, where have I been? What are you doing?\u201d He grabbed her face between his hands, repeated his question, pushed her to the couch, and told her to sit down. Leaning over her, he told her this \u201cwas going to be the night that he ended it\u201d and \u201che didn\u2019t have anything to live for.\u201d Putting the gun under his chin, Breeden threatened to \u201cblow his head off.\u201d He then told her he wanted to \u201cmake love to her one last time before [he] end[ed] it.\u201d When she told him \u201cno,\u201d Breeden hit her in the face with his hand, causing her nose to bleed \u201cprofusely.\u201d As she tried to stop the bleeding, Breeden lifted the front of her sweater, wiped her nose with it, and told her to go upstairs and wash her face. When she refused to go upstairs, Breeden, who had the pistol in one hand and a 12-gauge shotgun in the other, \u201ckicked her in the butt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">When they got upstairs, Breeden pointed the pistol at himself, again threatened to kill himself, and told her he was going to have intercourse with her. She said \u201cno,\u201d telling him she did not \u201cfeel like making love, not with somebody that\u2019s busted me in the nose.\u201d After placing the pistol on a shelf above the bed, Breeden \u201cwent ahead and had sex [with her] anyway.\u201d The complaining witness testified on cross-examination that Breeden did not threaten, force, or intimidate her to have sex. Rather, she \u201cwas afraid he was going to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>himself.\u201d When he finished having sexual intercourse, Breeden picked up the gun and kept it with him in bed throughout the night. The complaining witness testified she was \u201cfrightened,\u201d \u201cscared,\u201d and \u201cterrified\u201d throughout the night and was able to sleep only \u201ca little bit.\u201d She also testified she did not leave the house because she feared he would kill himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In the morning, she effectuated her \u201cplan to get away from\u201d Breeden and told him she was going to work. She agreed to give him a ride to his residence but, when he went back into the house to get his shoes, she left without him.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The complaining witness drove to a friend\u2019s house. Her friend immediately observed that she \u201chad been hurt,\u201d noting one of her eyes was swollen, her nose appeared to be broken, and she was \u201creally shaky\u201d and crying. Over Breeden\u2019s objection, the friend testified that the complaining witness told her Breeden had \u201craped\u201d her and \u201cforced [her] to have sex with him.\u201d The friend drove the complaining witness to the sheriffs office. From there, she was taken to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Around 8:30 a.m., Page County Investigator Rebecca Hilliards recorded a detailed statement from the complaining witness concerning the previous night\u2019s events. The entire thirty-nine-page transcript of the statement was admitted into evidence, over Breeden\u2019s objection. When asked during that interview if Breeden threatened her before having sexual intercourse with her, the complaining witness said Breeden \u201cheld the gun up under his chin\u201d and told her she would have a \u201cbigger mess\u201d than she already had from when he hit her in the face before. He told her \u201che was going to make love to her.\u201d She told him \u201cno\u201d and he said he was going to anyway, \u201c[o]ne last time.\u201d He then had sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">During an interview the next day with Page County Investigator Carl S. Cook and other investigators, Breeden admitted to possessing some marijuana that was found in his home. He confirmed that admission at trial, explaining that someone had given it to him, but he \u201chadn\u2019t used it yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Testifying on his own behalf at trial, Breeden denied he raped the complaining witness. He explained that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>she told him she did not want to \u201cmake love\u201d with him after he hit her in the nose, he \u201chad sex\u201d with her instead. \u201cHaving sex,\u201d he further explained, \u201cis just being with somebody, ... like screwing them. And making love is different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The trial court convicted Breeden of, among other crimes, rape, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61; use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1; statutory burglary, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91; and possession of marijuana, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"A1x\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Bright v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 248, 250, 356 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1987). \u201c \u2018In so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (quoting <em>Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 295, 373 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1988)). We are further mindful that the \u201ccredibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Crawley v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 372, 375, 512 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1999). \u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">B. Rape</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Breeden contends on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of rape because the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>did not prove the use of force, threat, or intimidation required under Code \u00a7 18.2-61. In support of this claim, he points to the complaining witness\u2019 explicit testimony that Breeden did not force, threaten, or intimidate her to have sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-61 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">If any person has sexual intercourse with a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse or causes a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, to engage in sexual intercourse with any other person and such act is accomplished ... against the complaining witness\u2019s will, by force, threat or intimidation of or against the complaining witness <em>or another person, </em>... he or she shall be guilty of rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In order to prove force sufficient to support a rape conviction, \u201c[t]he force must be used to overcome the victim\u2019s will. \u2018There must be evidence of \u201csome array or show of force in form sufficient to overcome resistance.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Sabol v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 9, 16-17, 553 S.E.2d 533, 536-37 (2001) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 983, 986, 252 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1979) (quoting <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 936, 946, 45 S.E.2d 167, 171 (1947))).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-0\">As used in the statute, threat means expression of an intention to do bodily harm. Intimidation may occur without threats. Intimidation, as used in the statute, means putting a victim in fear of bodily harm by exercising such domination and control of her as to overcome her mind and overbear her will. Intimidation may be caused by the imposition of psychological pressure on one who, under the circumstances, is vulnerable and susceptible to such pressure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\"><em>Sutton v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 654, 663, 324 S.E.2d 665, 670 (1985). \u201cThis fear of bodily harm must derive from some conduct or statement of the accused.\u201d <em>Sabol, </em>37 Va.App. at 18, 553 S.E.2d at 537. Moreover, it is clear from the inclusion in Code \u00a7 18.2-61 of the language \u201cor another person\u201d that the threat used by a person to get the complaining witness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>have sex with him may be a threat against someone other than the complaining witness. Whether the accused used force, threat, or intimidation \u201cto overcome the victim\u2019s will is a factual question, and this Court defers to the fact finder\u2019s decision unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 553 S.E.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In this case, the evidence amply supports a finding that Breeden used a combination of threats and force to intimidate the complaining witness and overcome her will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When she returned to her house at night, Breeden was there with a gun and held it the entire time. He used physical force against her, including pushing her, hitting her face, and kicking her buttocks, and repeatedly threatened to kill himself. He told her he wanted to \u201cmake love to her one last time before [he] end[ed] it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Breeden\u2019s words and conduct were clearly intended to put the complaining witness \u201cin fear of bodily harm by exercising such domination and control of her as to overcome her mind and overbear her.\u201d <em>Sutton, </em>228 Va. at 663, 324 S.E.2d at 670. In pushing, hitting, and kicking her, he manifested his physical control over her and created the implicit threat that he would use more force and violence if she did not comply with his wishes. In threatening to kill himself, holding the gun up to his chin, and continually holding a gun in his hand or keeping one near him throughout the night, he created the additional implicit threat that he would kill \u201canother person,\u201d namely, himself, if she did not do what he wanted. After making these threats and using violence, Breeden engaged in sexual intercourse with the complaining witness against her expressed will.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In view of these events, the fact finder could give little weight to the complaining witness\u2019 testimony that Breeden did not threaten, force, or intimidate her to have sexual intercourse with him because her testimony in its entirety estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>lished that she had sex with him because she \u201cwas afraid he was going to kill himself\u2019 and the evidence proved that she told her friend the following morning that Breeden had \u201craped\u201d her and \u201cforced [her] to have sex with him.\u201d In a case where the evidence offered by a complaining witness is \u201cinternally inconsistent,\u201d the finder of fact has \u201cthe discretion to ignore\u201d that portion of the witness\u2019 testimony that is contrary to the portion believed to be true. <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 751, 595 S.E.2d 9, 15 (2004); <em>see also Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986) (recognizing that the finder of fact has \u201cthe right to reject that part of the evidence believed ... to be untrue and to accept that found ... to be true\u201d); <em>Montague v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 430, 436, 579 S.E.2d 667, 669 (2003) (noting that a fact finder need not decide between rejecting or accepting a witness\u2019 testimony in full, but may find it credible in part and incredible in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">From this evidence, the trial court, as fact finder, could reasonably conclude that Breeden imposed such physical and psychological pressure on her that, despite her unwillingness to do so, she engaged in sexual intercourse with him anyway. For these reasons, we conclude the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">C. Use or Display of a Firearm in the Commission of a Felony</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Breeden further contends the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the use or display of a firearm in the commission of a felony because the Commonwealth failed to prove he used or displayed a firearm to accomplish the rape. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In order to support Breeden\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Commonwealth had to prove Breeden \u201cactually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit [rape].\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 218, 441 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>As noted above, the record reveals that Breeden was holding the gun the entire time. Putting the gun under his chin, Breeden told the complaining witness he was going to \u201cblow his head off.\u201d He then told her he wanted to \u201cmake love to her one last time before [he] end[ed] it.\u201d After she refused, he picked up a shotgun in his free hand and told her to go upstairs. While holding the shotgun and pistol, he kicked her, forcing her to climb the stairs to the bedroom. At least two more times, Breeden pointed the pistol at himself and threatened to kill himself. \u201c[A]fraid he was going to kill himself,\u201d the complaining witness engaged in sexual intercourse with him against her will. He put the pistol on a shelf above the bed within his reach while he raped her. Later, he retrieved the pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Based on this evidence, the trial court could properly conclude that Breeden \u201cactually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing\u201d the rape. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Breeden used a firearm during the commission of the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">D. Statutory Burglary</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Breeden concedes on appeal that the evidence established he broke into and entered the complaining witness\u2019 house. He contends, however, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for statutory burglary under Code \u00a7 18.2-91 because the Commonwealth failed to prove he entered the house with the requisite intent to commit larceny or any other felony or assault and battery. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">A conviction for statutory burglary is supported by evidence of a breaking and entering \u201cwith intent to commit assault and battery.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-91. \u201cIn a prosecution for statutory burglary under Code \u00a7 18.2-91, proof that the accused unlawfully entered another\u2019s dwelling supports an inference that the entry was made for an unlawful purpose. The specific intent with which the unlawful entry is made may be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Rob</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>ertson v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 814, 822, 525 S.E.2d 640, 644 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Here, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, proved that Breeden broke into the locked house through a back window. When the complaining witness later arrived, Breeden stepped from behind the front door with a pistol in his hand, demanding to know where she had been. He then grabbed her face, pushed her to the couch, and hit her in the nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The trial court, as fact finder, could reasonably infer from this evidence that Breeden had the intent to assault and batter the complaining witness when he broke into and entered her house that night. His unlawful entry into the residence supports the inference that he entered with an unlawful purpose, and the surrounding circumstances support an inference that he entered with an intent to assault and batter. We conclude, therefore, that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">E. Possession of Marijuana</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Breeden also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction for marijuana possession. He concedes, however, that the issue was not preserved at trial as required by Rule 5A:18, but contends \u201cthe ends of justice require this court to review this issue for the first time on appeal.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Pursuant to Rule 5A:18, \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals 'will not consider an argument on appeal [that] was not presented to the trial court,\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998), and \u201cwill not consider trial court error as a basis for reversal where no timely objection was made,\u201d <em>Marshall v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 627, 636, 496 S.E.2d 120, 125 (1998). However, Rule 5A:18 provides for our consideration of an argument not raised before the trial court or a claim of trial court error not properly preserved \u201cto enable [us] to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\u201c \u2018The ends of justice exception is narrow and is to be used\u2019 \u201d only when the trial court error is \u201c \u2018clear, substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tial and material.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 220-21, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (quoting <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10-11 (1989)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">To invoke the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18, the record must \u201caffirmatively show[] that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not ... merely ... that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). To satisfy this burden, an appellant must show \u201cmore than that the Commonwealth <em>failed </em>to prove an element of the offense____ The appellant must demonstrate that he or she was convicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense[,] or the record must affirmatively prove that an element of the offense did not occur.\u201d <em>Redman, 25 </em>Va.App. at 221-22, 487 S.E.2d at 272-73.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"><em>Marshall, </em>26 Va.App. at 636-37, 496 S.E.2d at 125 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The record does not support Breeden\u2019s contention that the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception should apply. Indeed, it plainly demonstrates that Breeden admitted to possessing marijuana that was found inside his home. In light of this evidence, we cannot say that Breeden \u201cwas convicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense\u201d or that \u201can element of the [possession of marijuana] offense did not occur.\u201d <em>Redman, </em>25 Va.App. at 221-22, 487 S.E.2d at 272-73. Breeden having failed to affirmatively persuade us \u201cthat a miscarriage of justice has occurred,\u201d we hold that the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception does not require us to consider this argument on appeal. <em>Mounce, 4 </em>Va.App. at 436, 357 S.E.2d at 744. Hence, Rule 5A:18 prevents our review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">III. ADMISSION OF RECENT COMPLAINTS OF RAPE</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Breeden further contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the complaining witness\u2019 recent complaints of rape to her friend and to Investigator Hilliards. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The recent-complaint exception to the hearsay rule is codified as Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any prosecution for criminal sexual assault ... the fact that the person injured made complaint of the offense recently after commission of the offense is admissible, not as independent evidence of the offense, but for the purpose of corroborating the testimony of the complaining witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u201cThis statute makes admissible, as an exception to the hearsay rule, a recent complaint by the victim of\u2019 a rape. <em>Mitchell v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 81, 85, 486 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1997). Thus, under the usual standards, \u201c[decisions on the admissibility of evidence he within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 486 S.E.2d at 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In support of his claim that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the recent complaints of rape, Breeden first argues that, at the time the trial court allowed such corroborative evidence to be admitted, \u201cno evidence of rape had yet been presented by the Commonwealth.\u201d Because the Commonwealth had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case of rape, Breeden\u2019s argument continues, \u201cthe hearsay exception provisions of [Code] \u00a7 19.2-268.2[did] not apply\u201d because \u201cthere was no rape testimony to corroborate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">We find Breeden\u2019s argument meritless for two reasons. First, Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2 does not require, as a matter of law, that the Commonwealth establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of rape before the trial court may properly admit evidence of a recent complaint of rape. Breeden offers no authority, and we are aware of none, that compels the Commonwealth to do so. Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2 provides that evidence of the recent complaint is admissible simply \u201cto corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and other independent evidence of the offense,\u201d without regard to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 486 S.E.2d at 553. The order in which such evidence is admitted at trial is a procedural matter, left to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>court\u2019s inherent discretion. <em>See Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 667, 676, 283 S.E.2d 905, 910 (1981) (holding that \u201cthe conduct of a trial is committed to the trial judge\u2019s discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Second, Breeden\u2019s assertion that the Commonwealth had not presented any evidence of rape when the evidence concerning the recent complaints was admitted is simply wrong. Prior to the admission of the recent-complaint evidence, the complaining witness testified concerning the events that occurred in her house. As we discussed above in considering the sufficiency of the evidence, her testimony clearly tended to show that she was raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Thus, we hold that the evidence was admissible \u201cto corroborate [the complaining witness\u2019] testimony and other independent evidence of the offense.\u201d <em>Mitchell, 25 </em>Va.App. at 86, 486 S.E.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Breeden also argues that the trial court should not have admitted the entire thirty-nine-page transcript of the complaining witness\u2019 statement because it gave a detailed and prejudicial account of the alleged rape. Even if the transcript was properly admitted, he further argues, \u201cthe only piece of evidence the trial court was allowed to consider was the fact that the complaint was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">As Breeden correctly points out on brief, Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2 limits the admissibility of evidence concerning recent complaints of sexual assault to corroboration purposes only and proscribes its use as independent evidence. <em>See Mitchell, 25 </em>Va.App. at 85-86, 486 S.E.2d at 553 (observing that \u201c[ejvidence of the victim\u2019s out-of-court complaint is not admissible as independent evidence of the offense\u201d and, \u201c[standing alone, ... is insufficient to support a conviction\u201d). Moreover, as this Court noted in <em>Mitchell, </em>\u201c[t]he \u2018recent complaint\u2019 exception embraces only the fact of the complaint and not details reported by the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 486 S.E.2d at 553. \u201cHowever, the scope of admissibility lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Recognizing these proscriptions and principles, the trial judge responded to Breeden\u2019s objection to the admission of the interview transcript as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">THE COURT: All right. Well, [the transcript of the interview] is some thirty-nine pages long, so I can\u2019t ... I have reviewed certain pertinent parts, in which she describes non-consensual sex to the investigator. And therefore, based on [Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2], I will admit it. But I do not admit it, and will not consider it relevant to other issues not having to do with the nature of the sex act, and what permission was or was not granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: I understand, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">THE COURT: But I can\u2019t go through and try to expurgate it here. It is sort of woven throughout it. But it is not being admitted to prove various statements concerning the handling of the guns and things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Breeden\u2019s counsel raised no additional objection to the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Clearly, as the trial judge acknowledged, the interview transcript could not properly be considered in whole because it contained inadmissible details that went beyond the fact of the complaint of rape. The issue before us, then, is whether the trial court\u2019s admission of the transcript was outside the scope of the recent-complaint exception to the hearsay rule. We hold that, as qualified by the trial court, it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">This Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Mitchell </em>is instructive. In that case, we considered the question whether the hearsay testimony of the victim\u2019s brother detailing the appellant\u2019s alleged proposition of an act of sodomy was admissible as evidence of the victim\u2019s recent complaint of a sexual assault. <em>Id. </em>at 85-86, 486 S.E.2d at 553. The appellant argued that the brother\u2019s testimony, which was offered to corroborate the twelve-year-old victim\u2019s testimony, was inadmissible because \u201cthe content of the brother\u2019s testimony went beyond reporting that the victim had complained of the offense and included inadmissible details, reported to the brother by the victim, but outside the scope of the \u2018recent complaint\u2019 exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 486 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>S.E.2d at 553. We disagreed with the appellant\u2019s position, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">The statute recognizes the probative value of the victim\u2019s recent complaint of a sexual offense. It is unreasonable to expect the victim of such an offense, particularly a child, to express his report in succinct, technical terms. It is consistent with human experience that such a victim will lodge his complaint in the form of a description of the event, and in that description lies his complaint of the offense. The brother\u2019s testimony described such a complaint. It exceeded in no significant way a report of the offense. The details of the victim\u2019s complaint were elements of the offense. Without those details, the complaint would have been incomplete. Thus, the brother\u2019s testimony was properly admitted into evidence as a report of the victim\u2019s recent complaint of a sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Here, as in <em>Mitchell, </em>the statement to Investigator Hilliards was not reported in succinct and technical terms. Indeed, given the intricate nature of the events, the complaining witness\u2019 account of what happened that night was understandably not a simple, straightforward complaint of rape. Instead, she provided a lengthy, detailed description of the night\u2019s events, recounting, among other things, Breeden\u2019s assorted acts of violence against her, his pointing a gun at himself and threatening to kill himself, her denials of his requests to have sex, her fear that he would kill himself, and, ultimately, his having sex with her despite her denials of his requests. In other words, the fact of the complaint of rape lay in the details of her statement. Thus, as we said in <em>Mitchell, </em>\u201c[t]he details of the ... complaint were elements of the offense. Without those details, the complaint would have been incomplete.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, it was proper for the trial court to admit those details \u201cto corroborate [the complaining witness\u2019] testimony and other independent evidence of the offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The fact remains, however, that the statement included inadmissible details that went beyond the fact of the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of rape. Finding it impossible to expurgate those inadmissible portions of the thirty-nine-page transcript from the admissible portions because they were inextricably \u201cwoven throughout\u201d the statement, the trial judge admitted the entire transcript, with the qualification that he would consider only the admissible portions of the statement related to the alleged rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u201cA trial court is presumed to apply the law correctly.\u201d <em>Shenk v. Shenk, </em>39 Va.App. 161, 169, 571 S.E.2d 896, 900 (2002). In addition, judges, unlike jurors, are presumed capable of distinguishing inadmissible evidence from admissible evidence. <em>See Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981) (\u201cA judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments and to separate, during the mental process of adjudication, the admissible from the inadmissible, even though he has heard both.\u201d). Consequently, absent \u201cclear evidence to the contrary,\u201d we presume, on appeal, \u201cthat a trial judge [has properly] disregarded] prejudicial or inadmissible evidence.\u201d <em>Cole v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 113, 116, 428 S.E.2d 303, 305 (1993). Trial judges are also presumed to have considered the presented evidence \u201conly in its permissible context.\u201d <em>Vanhook v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 130, 135, 578 S.E.2d 71, 73 (2003). Hence, \u201cif the trial court excludes evidence, then, presumptively, the judge does not consider the rejected evidence when ruling on the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The trial judge specifically said he did \u201cnot admit [the statement], and [would] not consider it relevant to other issues not having to do with the nature of the sex act, and what permission was or was not granted.\u201d Absent any evidence in the record to the contrary, \u201cwe are unwilling to disregard the court\u2019s unequivocal statement\u201d that it would limit its consideration of the transcript to those portions of it that were admissible in accordance with the recent-complaint exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Overton v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 599, 604, 539 S.E.2d 421, 424 (2000). This limited admission was within the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to support each of the convictions addressed herein and in admitting the complaining witness\u2019 recent complaints of rape under Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2. Accordingly, we affirm Breeden\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">. It is undisputed that, before the sexual encounter with Breeden, the complaining witness explicitly refused consent to his sexual advances. Indeed, Breeden conceded at trial that she said \"no\u201d when he told her he was going to make love to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
