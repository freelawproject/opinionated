(employer) and The Union Insurance Company (carrier) appeal from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission holding that overpayments of disability compensation to Frankie Oreal Davis (claimant) entitled carrier only to a credit against any future compensation due and did not entitle it to recover those overpayments from claimant \u201cby action at law\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-710 or 65.2-712. We hold the commission\u2019s refusal to certify the award for an action at law in the circuit court was not error, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">The facts are largely undisputed. Claimant suffered an inguinal hernia on April 23, 1999, while working for employer as a concrete foreman. He continued working after the injury, but on May 3, 1999, he underwent surgery for that condition and was temporarily and totally disabled through at least October 11,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">The carrier accepted the injury as compensable, and the commission entered an award for medical and disability bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>fits. Carrier paid claimant temporary total disability compensation from May 10, 1999, through October 11, 1999, in the total amount of $11,146.74. Notwithstanding claimant\u2019s inability to work during this same period, employer continued to pay him his pre-injury wages in the gross amount of $760 per week. Employer explained claimant had been a loyal and very hard-working employee for approximately 15 years prior to his injury. Employer \u201ckept paying [claimant] ... because of the value he was to the company\u201d and because \u201c[it] just wanted to make sure that [he] was financially taken care of until he could come back to work.\u201d Although the carrier began paying claimant disability compensation as of May 10, 1999, claimant did not inform employer of this fact and did not notify carrier that he was simultaneously receiving payments from employer equal to his fall pre-injury wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In October 1999, employer and carrier each learned of the other\u2019s payments to claimant, and the carrier voiced an intention to seek a credit for the compensation payments it had made to claimant during that time. \u201c[I]n order to protect [claimant from] any action that the [carrier] was going to take\u201d due to the \u201cdouble payments\u201d claimant had received, employer and claimant entered into an agreement characterizing employer\u2019s payments to claimant as a loan that claimant would pay back to employer at the rate of $100 per month. Due to the existence of an \u201copen award giving [claimant] [compensation benefits,\u201d claimant\u2019s ongoing disability, and employer\u2019s representation that claimant had agreed to pay back to employer the monies he had received from employer while also receiving disability compensation, carrier did not seek a credit for the compensation payments at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Claimant made no payments to employer pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Claimant testified that employer\u2019s president, Jim Williams, asked him to sign the repayment agreement because \u201cthe insurance company was on his back.\u201d Claimant testified Williams said the agreement was \u201cjust for [carrier\u2019s] benefit,\u201d that Williams \u201cwas glad ... he did what he did,\u201d and that he \u201cwasn\u2019t looking for [claimant] to pay [the money] back.\u201d Williams testified he could not recall what, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>anything, he told claimant about whether he expected claimant to make those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">In 2002, carrier filed an application for hearing in which it sought, <em>inter alia, </em>a credit for alleged overpayments made in 1999, based on claimant\u2019s simultaneous receipt of both monies equal to his full pre-injury wage from employer and temporary total disability compensation from carrier. Carrier also indicated its intent to request \u201ccertif[ication of] an[y] award for a credit to the circuit court to be reduced to a judgment upon which collection procedures at law would follow.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The deputy commissioner ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[K]nowledge regarding a claim is imputed from employer to insurer and from insurer to employer. Further, the evidence does not establish that the claimant engaged in any fraud or deception in regard to his receipt of these payments [from employer and insurer]. Nevertheless, the case law cited by the insurer shows that the insurer is due a credit for its overpayment of compensation as against any future compensation for disability that may be due____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">The employer has requested that the Commission certify any \u201c... credit awarded to the circuit court.\u201d ... We do not find any basis for such an attempt in the language of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.... [Overpayments that occur absent fraud or a failure to report earnings can only be recouped by way of a credit. There is no evidence of fraud in this case and there was not a failure to report earnings given that the insurer and employer stand as one in regard to their knowledge of the status of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">Carrier requested commission review of the deputy\u2019s decision. The commission, on review, summarized the deputy\u2019s decision and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">The deputy commissioner found that the employer should be awarded a credit for the [1999] payments ... [but] declined to find that the claimant violated Code \u00a7 65.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>712.... On [r]eview, the employer argues that these [1999] payments ... were an \u201cincrease in earnings\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-712. We do not agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">The evidence did not show any earnings between May 14 and October 11, 1999.... [T]he employer, for business reasons, made the payments because of the claimant\u2019s work history with the employer. Code \u00a7 65.2-712 seeks to protect employers and insurers when payments are made to an employee as a result of fraud or misrepresentation or when an employee returns to work, or receives a pay increase after a return to work, but does not report the return to work or the pay increase. Here, the payments clearly were not \u201cearnings\u201d pursuant to a return to work as envisioned by Code \u00a7 65.2-712.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">The employer ... argues that the deputy commissioner incorrectly found that the claimant was not required to report the employer\u2019s payments to the carrier---- Code \u00a7 65.2-712 specifically provides that ... a return [to work for one\u2019s pre-injury employer] shall be disclosed directly to the insurer, unless the employer is self-insured----Here, however, there was no return to work, increase in post-return earnings, fraud, or misrepresentation such that Code \u00a7 65.2-712 should apply. Rather, there was an overpayment. The deputy commissioner awarded a credit to the employer against future compensation for this overpayment, and we see no reason to overturn this decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Carrier noted this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-710 provides that \u201c[ojrders or awards of the Commission may be recorded, enforced, and satisfied as orders or decrees of a circuit court upon certification of such order or award by the Commission. The Commission shall certify such order or award upon satisfactory evidence of noncompliance with the same.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-712 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">So long as an employee ... receives payment of compensation under this title, [the employee] shall have a duty immediately to disclose to the employer, when the employer is self-insured, or insurer in all other cases, any ... return to employment [or] increase in his earnings____Any payment to a claimant by an employer or insurer which is later determined by the Commission to have been procured by the employee ... by fraud, misrepresentation, or failure to report any ... return to employment [or] increase in earnings may be recovered from the claimant ... by the employer or insurer either by way of credit against future compensation payments due the claimant ... or by action at law against the claimant____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Here, the commission awarded employer a credit for the temporary total disability compensation carrier paid claimant while employer continued to pay the disabled claimant sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>equal to Ms pre-injury wage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Employer assigns error to (1) the commission\u2019s conclusion that \u201ccarrier and employer stand as one in regard to their knowledge of the status of\u2019 a claimant\u2019s return to work for employer; (2) the commission\u2019s finding that claimant had no duty to report to carrier employer\u2019s ongoing payments to claimant under Code \u00a7 \u00a7 65.2-712 because they were not an increase in earnings and did not result from a return to work; and (3) the commission\u2019s refusal to certify the award to the circuit court f\u00f3r a credit in accordance with Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-710 or 65.2-712. We hold no reversible error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">IMPUTING TO CARRIER KNOWLEDGE OF EMPLOYER\u2019S ONGOING PAYMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We hold employer\u2019s challenge to the conclusion that \u201ccarrier and employer stand as one in regard to their knowledge of the status of\u2019 a claimant\u2019s return to work for employer is not properly before us because only the deputy, not the commission, reached such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The deputy expressly held employer\u2019s knowledge of the status of claimant\u2019s claim was imputed to the carrier and implicitly held employer\u2019s payment of claimant\u2019s pre-injury wage amounted to a \u201creturn to employment\u201d or \u201cincrease in earmngs\u201d that claimant would otherwise have had a duty to report under Code \u00a7 65.2-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The commission affirmed the deputy\u2019s award but did so for reasons different from those assigned by the deputy. The commission did not state that an employer\u2019s knowledge of a claimant\u2019s receipt of his pre-injury wage is imputed to the carrier. In fact, it implied the contrary by expressly acknowledging the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-712 providing that \u201ca return [to work] shall be disclosed directly to the insurer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>unless the employer is self-insured.\u201d Finally, the commission concluded that claimant had no \u201creturn to employment\u201d or \u201cincrease in earnings\u201d and, thus, had nothing to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">In sum, only the deputy concluded that employer\u2019s knowledge of the status of claimant\u2019s claim was imputed to carrier for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-712. Because the commission did not rely on this reasoning in support of its affirmance of the award, the issue is not before us in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">WHAT CONSTITUTES AN \u201cINCREASE IN EARNINGS\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 65.2-712</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Here, the commission expressly concluded that Code \u00a7 65.2-712 was inapplicable because \u201cthere was no return to work, increase in post-return earnings, fraud, or misrepresentation.\u201d Thus, the commission\u2019s affirmance of the deputy\u2019s award of credit did not occur pursuant to that statute. Instead, the commission found that the money employer gave to claimant despite his inability to work \u201cwas an overpayment\u201d and appears implicitly to have applied the doctrine of imposition to award a credit against future compensation for disability paid claimant while claimant continued to receive from employer an amount equal to his pre-injury wages, despite his inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">General principles of workers\u2019 compensation law provide that an employer or carrier should \u201cnot be required to pay twice for an employee\u2019s injury\u201d and that double recoveries are to be avoided. <em>See Va. Int\u2019l Terms, v. Moore, </em>22 Va.App. 396, 403, 470 S.E.2d 574, 578 (1996) (determining employer\u2019s entitlement to credit, pursuant to voluntary payments provision of Code \u00a7 65.2-520, for disability paid under federal workers\u2019 compensation act), <em>aff'd, </em>254 Va. 46, 50, 486 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1997). Applying these principles under the discretionary doctrine of imposition, the commission has \u201c \u2018jurisdiction to do full and complete justice in each case,\u2019 \u201d which includes \u201c \u2018the power and authority not only to make and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>enforce its awards, but [also] to protect itself and its awards from fraud, imposition and mistake.\u2019\u201d <em>Collins v. Dep\u2019t of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>21 Va.App. 671, 679-80, 467 S.E.2d 279, 282 (quoting <em>Harris v. Diamond Constr. Co., </em>184 Va. 711, 720, 36 S.E.2d 573, 577 (1946)), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>22 Va.App. 625, 472 S.E.2d 287 (1996). Nevertheless, we are aware of \u201cno authority ... that permits the commission to use the imposition doctrine to override the clear provisions of a workers\u2019 compensation statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 467 S.E.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In the present appeal, employer challenges not the presumed application of the discretionary doctrine of imposition to award a credit but rather the construction of specific statutes under which employer claims it was <em>entitled </em>to pursue an action at law in the circuit court in order to recoup the amount of the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\u201cIn construing statutes, courts are charged with ascertaining and giving effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Hill, </em>254 Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997). \u201cThat intention is initially found in the words of the statute itself, and if those words are clear and unambiguous, we do not rely on rules of statutory construction or parol evidence, unless a literal application would produce a meaningless or absurd result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018[W]here the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import[,] the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 249, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002) (quoting <em>City of Va. Beach v. ESG Enters., </em>243 Va. 149, 152-53, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We are also guided by the principle that the Act \u201cis highly remedial and should be liberally construed to advance its purpose ... [of compensating employees] for accidental injuries resulting from the hazards of the employment.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Central Tel. Co., </em>233 Va. 377, 382, 355 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1987). Although \u201cwe are not bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases,\u201d <em>USAir, Inc. v. Joyce, </em>27 Va.App. 184, 189 n. 1, 497 S.E.2d 904, 906 n. 1 (1998), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>we give great weight to the commission\u2019s construction of the Act, <em>see City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985), and we defer to the commission\u2019s factual findings if supported by credible evidence in the record, <em>see Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. Goad, </em>15 Va.App. 710, 712, 427 S.E.2d 215, 217 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Here, employer did not allege and presented no evidence that claimant failed to disclose to carrier a return to work during the period in question. In addition, credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s determination that claimant did not commit fraud or misrepresentation in order to procure the disability compensation payments at issue. The undisputed evidence established that he was totally disabled during the relevant period of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Finally, the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant did not receive an \u201cincrease in earnings.\u201d Claimant was totally disabled, and employer continued to pay him not for any work he actually did but solely in the hope that he would remain a loyal employee and eventually return to work for employer. The Act equates \u201cearnings\u201d with \u201cwages.\u201d <em>Smith v. Robert W. Smith, </em>32 Va.App. 242, 255, 527 S.E.2d 463, 470 (2000) (citing Code \u00a7 65.2-101).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201cThe reason for calculating the average weekly wage is to approximate the economic loss suffered by an employee ... when there is a <em>loss of earning capacity </em>because of work-related injury.\u201d ... If the claimant suffers a disability as a result of the injury, the commission must compare the claimant\u2019s pre-injury average weekly wage to <em>the wage he is able to earn </em>after the injury to determine whether he is entitled to total or partial disability benefits and, if so, at what rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 249-50, 527 S.E.2d at 467 (quoting <em>Bosworth v. 7-Up Distrib. Co., </em>4 Va.App. 161, 163, 355 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1987)) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Here, because of claimant\u2019s total physical disability, he was not able to earn any wage during the period in question, and thus, he had no \u201cearnings\u201d within the plain meaning of Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u00a7 65.2-712. <em>Cf. Allegheny Airlines, Inc. v. Merillat, </em>14 Va. App. 341, 344-45, 416 S.E.2d 467, 469-70 (1992) (holding under predecessor to Code \u00a7 65.2-500 that entitlement to temporary total disability benefits requires only proof of pre-injury average weekly wage and a showing of total disability and does not require proof that the claimant\u2019s \u201cweekly earnings are reduced below his pre-injury average weekly wage as a result of injuries sustained in the industrial accident\u201d). Accordingly, the evidence proved, at most, that carrier made an overpayment of compensation to claimant due to a mistake, and the commission awarded employer a credit for those overpayments as against future compensation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Harris, </em>184 Va. at 720, 36 S.E.2d at 577. Adopting the construction of Code \u00a7 65.2-712 \u201csought by employer[ ] would require us to extend the ... Act\u2019s provisions beyond their obvious meaning and to hold that the legislature did not mean what it actually expressed. If such a change is to be made, it is for the legislature to undertake, not us.\u201d <em>Peacock, </em>38 Va.App. at 251, 563 S.E.2d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In addition to the clear language of the statute, policy reasons also dictate this result. If anyone has suffered a loss in this case, it is not carrier but employer, which paid both sums equal to claimant\u2019s pre-injury wage and its own workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums. Employer paid the money to the claimant \u201cfor business reasons ... because of the claimant\u2019s work history with the employer.\u201d Employer paid at its own expense, not carrier\u2019s; employer, having paid its workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums, was entitled to have claimant, its injured employee, compensated by carrier for the undisputed period of time in 1999 during which he was temporarily and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Further, a primary purpose of providing for recoupment by credit rather than an action at law in cases in which no fraud, misrepresentation or failure to report a return to work or increase in earnings has been shown is that, in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>such proof, no evidence establishes the claimant was at fault in causing the overpayment, and he or she is the party presumably least able to bear the burden of losing money if forced to repay it in an action at law. Allowing recoupment through a credit as opposed to an action at law best balances the dual goals of preventing a claimant\u2019s unjust enrichment without unduly penalizing the claimant financially for failing to recognize or report the overpayment in a more timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Thus, under the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-712, we affirm the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant had no \u201cincrease in earnings\u201d he was required to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">AUTHORITY FOR RECOUPMENT OF OVERPAYMENTS IN AN ACTION AT LAW UNDER CODE \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-710 OR 65.2-712</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Employer contends the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-712 or 65.2-710 authorized it to seek recoupment of the overpayment in an action at law. We hold neither statute entitled employer to such relief under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-712 authorizes an action at law against a claimant only where the claimant has \u201cprocured [the payment of compensation] ... by fraud, misrepresentation, or failure to report any ... return to employment [or] increase in earnings.\u201d As we held above, see <em>supra </em>Part II.B., the evidence fails to establish an \u201cincrease in earnings,\u201d fraud or misrepresentation, and employer did not allege a return to work. Thus, Code \u00a7 65.2-712 does not authorize an \u201caction at law against the claimant\u201d for recovery of the overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-710 provides that \u201c[t]he commission shall certify [an] order or award [to a circuit court for recording, enforcement and satisfaction] upon satisfactory evidence of noncompliance with the same.\u201d Here, the commission\u2019s award was for a credit against future compensation, and the record contained no evidence of \u201cnoncompliance with the same.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Thus, Code \u00a7 65.2-710 also did not authorize the commission to certify the credit award for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">For these reasons, we hold the commission\u2019s refusal to certify the award for an action at law in the circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-710 or 65.2-712 was not error, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">. The deputy\u2019s and commission\u2019s resolution of the other issues raised by carrier in its application are not before us in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\">. The Act expressly provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">When any employer is insured against liability for compensation with an insurance carrier, and such insurance carrier shall have paid any compensation for which the employer is liable or shall have assumed the liability of the employer therefor, it shall be subrogated to all the rights and duties of the employer and may enforce any such rights in its own name ...; however, nothing herein shall be construed as conferring upon the insurance carriers any other or further rights than those existing in the employer at the time of the injury to his employee, anything in the policy of insurance to the contrary notwithstanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-812. Thus, the carrier stands in the shoes of the employer for purposes of seeking relief under the Act, even when it opts to sue in its own name. <em>See Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>491 F.2d 603, 605 (4th Cir.1974) (relying on former Code \u00a7 65.1-112, predecessor to Code \u00a7 65.2-812).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Here, the deputy and commission actually awarded the credit to employer. However, the procedural history of the case makes clear that it was the carrier, pursuant to its contractual agreement to provide employer with workers' compensation insurance coverage, that made the disability compensation payments and seeks the relief at issue in this appeal. For ease of reference in the analysis section of this opinion, we refer to the appellant as employer. We are aware of no dispute between carrier and employer as to who is entitled to the credit and do not address any such dispute in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\">. Claimant does not contest the commission's award of such a credit, and thus, we do not consider the propriety of the credit award on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b588-7\">FRANK, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyB\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">I concur with the opinion to the extent that the commission correctly determined that Code \u00a7 65.2-712 does not apply to this case. The only remaining issue is whether the commission erred in not allowing the carrier to pursue a civil remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">No one contests that an overpayment was made or that the carrier is entitled to a credit. In its brief, the carrier premised certification under Code \u00a7 65.2-710 upon a finding of a violation of Code \u00a7 65.2-712. Under the carrier\u2019s theory before the commission, if it does not prevail under Code \u00a7 65.2-712, then there is no civil relief under Code \u00a7 65.2-710. The issue of whether Code \u00a7 65.2-710 applies independently to this case was not before the commission and is not properly before this Court. I therefore disagree that this Court has the authority to consider the independent application of Code \u00a7 65.2-710 and would not address the issue of whether or not the commission properly declined to certify the award to the circuit court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
