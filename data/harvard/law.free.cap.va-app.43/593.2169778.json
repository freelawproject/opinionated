Outright of driving while intoxicated in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Because the Commonwealth gave him only one laboratory to choose from to perform an independent blood analysis, Outright argues that the court should have dismissed his DUI charge or, short of that, at least suppressed the results of the blood tests. Finding neither remedy applies in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). \u201cThat principle requires us to \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 743, 595 S.E.2d 9, 11 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">On February 16, 2002, at 2:55 a.m., Richard Outright drove into a commuter parking lot. Noticing Deputy G.M. Harvey sitting in his police cruiser, Outright approached and asked him if he had seen some people Outright was looking for. Deputy Harvey detected a strong odor of alcohol coming from Outright and \u201casked him how much he had had to drink that evening.\u201d Outright admitted drinking about \u201ceight beers\u201d earlier in the evening. Having observed Outright driving into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the lot, Deputy Harvey conducted four field sobriety tests on Outright, three of which he failed, as well as a preliminary breath test, which produced a high result. Deputy Harvey then arrested Outright for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Deputy Harvey informed Outright of Virginia\u2019s implied consent law and transported him to Mary Washington Hospital for a blood test. Medical personnel drew two vials of blood. Harvey retained one vial for analysis by the Division of Forensic Science. He provided Outright with a form so Outright could choose an additional laboratory for an independent analysis of the second vial. The form listed only one approved laboratory, Medical College of Virginia Toxicology Laboratory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Outright requested that the second vial of blood be sent to MOV. Both the Division of Forensic Science and MOV found Outright\u2019s blood alcohol content to be .12%.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The Commonwealth charged Outright by misdemeanor warrant asserting a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After being convicted in the general district court, Outright appealed to the circuit court for a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>At the time of Cutright\u2019s arrest, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6 provided that the arresting officer \u201cshall give to the accused a form provided by the Division which sets forth the procedure to obtain an independent analysis of the blood in the second container, and a list of the names and addresses of laboratories approved by the Division.\u201d The statute continued: \u201cIf the accused directs the officer in writing on the form to forward the second container to an approved laboratory of the accused\u2019s choice, the officer shall do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In the circuit court, Cutright did not challenge the prosecution\u2019s evidence of his inability to pass simple field sobriety tests, his admitted consumption of eight beers, the strong smell of alcohol coming from him, or, for that matter, the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that he had driven under the influence of alcohol. Instead, Cutright argued only that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6 guaranteed him the right to choose between at least two independent laboratories. Because only one laboratory had contracted with the Commonwealth to provide independent testing services, Cutright argued, the trial court erred in not dismissing the DUI charge or, at a minimum, in not suppressing the BAC test results. The trial court rejected these arguments, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">A. <em>Dismissal Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The Commonwealth charged Cutright with violating all four subsections of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Even if it had not done so, the Commonwealth could rely on any subsection of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 in support of a charge asserting a violation of the statute generally. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-266 (\u201cA charge alleging a violation of this section shall support a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii) <em>or </em>(iv).\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The incriminating evidence against Cutright included not only the two BAC test results, but also Deputy Harvey\u2019s extensive observations of Cutright\u2019s intoxication moments after he stepped out of his car.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This evidentiary showing\u2014 even without the BAC test results\u2014would support a DUI conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2\u2014266(ii). <em>See Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 20, 24, 577 S.E.2d 514, 516 (2003) (\u201cTest results from a breath or blood test are not necessary or required to prove driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The absence of the BAC test results would require dismissal only if the Commonwealth had prosecuted Cutright <em>solely </em>for violating subsection (i) of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, the \u201c \u2018per se\u2019 statute\u201d predicating guilt on blood alcohol content alone. <em>Kehl v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 602, 605, 426 S.E.2d 127, 129 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Dismissal of a subsection (ii) DUI charge may be appropriate in cases involving an outright failure of the Commonwealth to provide any independent testing of any kind despite a statutory requirement that it do so. <em>See, e.g., Shoemaker v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 61, 64, 441 S.E.2d 354, 356 (1994) (holding dismissal appropriate where Commonwealth failed to take further action when sample was returned unopened and marked \u201crefused\u201d by lab selected by defendant); <em>Kemp v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 360, 365-66, 429 S.E.2d 875, 878-79 (1993) (dismissing charge where indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dent BAC test results were never submitted to the court or made available to defendant).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The dismissal remedy, however, cannot be sensibly applied to this case. Outright requested and received independent BAC testing at MCV. He concedes on appeal, as he did in the trial court, that no evidence suggested that these results were invalid or that additional testing elsewhere might have produced different findings. In other words, even Outright does not speculate that a <em>second </em>independent lab would have come up with exculpatory evidence previously undiscovered by either the MCV lab or the Division of Forensic Science. Under these circumstances, no statutory policy would be served by vacating a DUI conviction of a drunk driver who otherwise concedes his guilt. The trial court, therefore, did not err in refusing to dismiss the DUI charge against Outright.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">B. <em>Suppression of BAC Test Results</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Even if he has no right to a dismissal, Outright argues, the trial court still erred by not suppressing the evidence of his BAC test results. To answer this contention, we need not determine whether the now-superseded language in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.6 contemplated two or more laboratories as Cut-right argues (a conclusion he finds implicit in \u00a7 18.2-268.6\u2019s use of the plural in the phrase \u201clist of the names and address<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>es of laboratories\u201d), or whether the list could include just one lab as the Commonwealth asserts (a conclusion it finds implicit in \u00a7 18.2-268.6\u2019s silent incorporation of Code \u00a7 1-13\u2019s tolerance for using plural and singular language interchangeably). We hold that, in either event, the trial court had no obligation to suppress the BAC test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Absent an infirmity of constitutional dimensions, the \u201cmere violation of state statutory law does not require that the offending evidence be suppressed, unless the statute expressly provides for an evidentiary exclusion remedy.\u201d <em>Seaton, </em>42 Va.App. at 757 n. 7, 595 S.E.2d at 17 n. 7; see also <em>Vinson v. Commonwealth, 258 </em>Va. 459, 469, 522 S.E.2d 170, 177 (1999); <em>Janis v. Commonwealth, 22 </em>Va.App. 646, 651, 472 S.E.2d 649, 652, aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, 23 Va.App. 696, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996); <em>Penn v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 399, 406-07, 412 S.E.2d 189, 193 (1991), <em>aff'd </em>per curiam, 244 Va. 218, 420 S.E.2d 713 (1992); <em>Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 117, 122, 390 S.E.2d 198, 201 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The DUI statutes nowhere provide for a suppression remedy for procedural violations. Instead, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11 states that a violation of the procedural steps of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 through 18.2-268.9 \u201cshall go to the weight of the evidence and shall be considered with all the evidence in the case.\u201d See <em>Shumate v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 877, 883, 153 S.E.2d 243, 247 (1967) (holding that procedural violations merely affect \u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d); <em>Snider v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 729, 734, 496 S.E.2d 665, 667 (1998). The same provision also makes clear that the defendant may \u201cintroduce evidence on his own behalf to show noncompliance with the aforesaid procedures or any part thereof, and that as a result his rights were prejudiced.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11; see also <em>Snider, </em>26 Va.App. at 734, 496 S.E.2d at 667. By statute, therefore, the legislative remedy for a <em>procedural violation </em>is not suppression of the evidence, but a full and fair opportunity for both sides to attempt to prove or disprove any prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>effect of the violation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Mere procedural violations must be distinguished from cases where the essential precondition of the implied consent statute\u2014a lawful and timely arrest\u2014has not been met. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 228, 233, 527 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2000) (noting that \u201cfor an arrestee to be deemed to have given implied consent under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, the arrest must have been lawful\u201d); <em>see also Overbee v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 238, 243, 315 S.E.2d 242, 244 (1984) (untimely arrest); <em>Thomas v. Marion, </em>226 Va. 251, 254, 308 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1983) (unlawful arrest); <em>Durant v. Suffolk, </em>4 Va.App. 445, 449, 358 S.E.2d 732, 734 (1987). By failing to satisfy a basic condition underlying the statute, the Commonwealth has no right to collect the sample in the first place and, <em>a fortiori, </em>even less right to offer into evidence test results based on the sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">It may also be appropriate to exclude the BAC test results in cases where the statutory violation calls into serious question the reliability of the test results. <em>See, e.g., Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 184, 186, 462 S.E.2d 913, 914 (1995) (holding BAC test results inadmissible due to the potential contamination of a blood sample with benadine topical agent). In suppressing the evidence in such cases, however, the courts are not sanctioning the prosecution\u2014but, rather, simply refusing to admit unreliable expert evidence. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>(noting that prosecutor offered no evidence of \u201cchemical properties of benadine\u201d and gave no explanation of why its use substantially complied with statutory protocol requiring the use of \u201csoap and water, polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine or benzalkonium chloride\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Nothing in the DUI statutes provides for suppression of BAC test results in the event the Commonwealth\u2019s form includes only one independent laboratory. The absence of a second, or third, or fourth lab on the list of approved laboratories does not violate any preconditions to the lawful application of the implied consent statute. Nor does it call into serious question the evidentiary reliability of the BAC test results of the one independent lab available to the defendant\u2014 especially where, as here, that independent lab confirmed precisely the findings of the Division of Forensic Science. Thus, the intended \u201csafeguard\u201d has been fulfilled by requiring the Commonwealth to \u201ctake two blood samples and allow the accused to obtain his separate blood analysis, so that the results can be compared with the results of the Commonwealth and so that any discrepancies can be considered by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Wendel v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 958, 961, 407 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Outright argues that this conclusion effectively leaves him without a remedy for what he contends is a statutory violation affecting the BAC evidence. We disagree. The absence of a statutory suppression remedy did not prevent Outright from introducing evidence if he felt \u201chis rights were prejudiced.\u201d See Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11; <em>Snider, </em>26 Va.App. at 734, 496 S.E.2d at 667. Nor did it preclude him from arguing that the BAC test results should receive discounted evidentiary weight by the factfinder to the extent such prejudice could be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The trial court in this case understood its duty to weigh the evidence in this way. Noting that Outright did not challenge the accuracy of the BAC test results, the trial court concluded that no evidence demonstrated that \u201chis rights were prejudiced.\u201d \u201cThere is no suggestion,\u201d the trial court emphasized, \u201cthat Mr. Cutright\u2019s independent analysis was in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>deficient or inaccurate.\u201d To be sure, Outright did not provide any explanation for the fact that MCV\u2019s independent results exactly matched the results obtained by the Division of Forensic Science, other than the natural inference that one confirmed the reliability of the other. Given these findings, we discern no principled legal basis for Outright\u2019s assertion that the trial court had a duty to suppress the BAC test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Finding the trial court did not err by refusing to dismiss Outright\u2019s DUI charge or to suppress the BAC test results, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">. The statement of facts stipulated that the Division of Forensic Science contacted six laboratories in an effort to recruit additional labs to perform this service, but none agreed to do so. The MCV employees performing the independent laboratory analyses did not work for the state, but were contract employees employed by the private hospital corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">.
