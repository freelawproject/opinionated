Farnsworth was convicted in a bench trial of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in concluding that his prior felony conviction in the state of West Virginia for armed robbery constituted a predicate felony conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, because his civil rights, including his right to possess a firearm, had been previously restored by the state of West Virginia upon his completion of the sentence for that offense. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and Farnsworth\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. On October 5, 2001, Farnsworth was indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Prior to trial, Farnsworth moved to have the charge dismissed, arguing the Commonwealth could not use his prior felony conviction in West Virginia as the requisite predicate conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 because that state had earlier restored his civil rights upon his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">At the May 22, 2002 hearing on that motion, Farnsworth and the Commonwealth stipulated that Farnsworth was convicted on March 19, 1979, of armed robbery in Lewis County, West Virginia and that, following his release from prison in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that state, he received an \u201cOfficial Certificate of Discharge\u201d issued by the West Virginia Department of Corrections, which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">This is to certify that Samuel Farnsworth HCC-11183 is hereby discharged by expiration of sentence as of the 1st day of April, 1985. Any and all civil rights heretofore forfeited are restored. Done this 18th day of April, 1985.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADZ\">The parties further stipulated that Farnsworth possessed a firearm in Stafford County, Virginia on or about April 15, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Concluding that the restoration of Farnsworth\u2019s civil rights in West Virginia did not prohibit his prosecution under the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Farnsworth then stipulated that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to convict him, and the trial court found him guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The trial court subsequently imposed the minimum mandatory sentence of five years in the penitentiary, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In this appeal, we are asked to review the trial court\u2019s determination that Farnsworth was a convicted felon within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Because this is a question of law involving the construction and application of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo. See Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (noting that, \u201calthough the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Relying on <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>961 F.2d 50 (4th Cir.1992), and <em>United States v. Stump, </em>784 F.Supp. 326 (N.D.W.Va.1992), Farnsworth asserts, on appeal, that, although he was previously convicted of a felony in West Virginia, he was not prohibited from possessing a firearm in Virginia on or about April 15, 2001, because, after serving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>sentence for the felony conviction in West Virginia, he received a certificate of discharge from the West Virginia Department of Corrections in 1985 officially restoring all of the civil rights he had forfeited as a result of his conviction. Thus, he argues, because his civil rights were previously restored by the state of West Virginia and because Virginia law makes no reference to the restoration of a convicted felon\u2019s civil rights by another state, his felony conviction in West Virginia may not be used as a predicate felony conviction to prosecute him for possession of a firearm by a felon under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. He further argues that, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, Virginia must recognize, in its application of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the restoration of his civil rights by the state of West Virginia and his right, under the law of that state, to possess a firearm. Thus, he concludes, he was not properly subject to prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and the trial court erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In response, the Commonwealth contends that Farnsworth\u2019s reliance on federal court cases is misplaced and that the trial court correctly concluded, in accordance with the clear meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, that the restoration of Farnsworth\u2019s civil rights in West Virginia did not exempt him from prosecution under that statute, because his right to possess a firearm in West Virginia had no bearing on his legal ability to do so in Virginia. The Commonwealth further contends that Farnsworth\u2019s argument regarding the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d clause is barred on appeal because he did not raise it in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">On appeal, as below, the Commonwealth does not challenge Farnsworth\u2019s assertion that his civil rights were restored in West Virginia by virtue of the April 18, 1985 certificate of discharge issued by the West Virginia Department of Corrections. Thus, we assume, without deciding, that, for purposes of this appeal, Farnsworth\u2019s civil rights were restored by the state of West Virginia upon his discharge from prison after serving the sentence for his March 19, 1979 armed robbery conviction in West Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The dispositive question before us, then, is whether the restoration of Farnsworth\u2019s civil rights after he served the sentence for his armed robbery conviction in West Virginia precludes the use of that conviction as a predicate felony conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. We conclude that the plain meaning of the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 answers this question in the negative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">In reviewing the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, we adhere to the familiar principle that \u201c[u]nder basic rules of statutory construction, we determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words contained in the statute. When the language of a statute is unambiguous, courts are bound by the plain meaning of that language and may not assign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 255, 259, 590 S.E.2d 563, 565 (2004) (quoting <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 268, 271, 576 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2003) (citations omitted)). \u2018We must also assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990). \u201cMoreover, we examine a statute in its entirety, rather than by isolating particular words or phrases.\u201d <em>Chesterfield County v. Stigall, </em>262 Va. 697, 704, 554 S.E.2d 49, 53 (2001). Furthermore, \u201c[w]hile it is true that penal statutes must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth in criminal cases, \u2018we will not apply \u201can unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u201d that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alger, </em>267 Va. at 259, 590 S.E.2d at 565 (quoting <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979))). \u201cThe manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The version of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 in effect on or about April 15, 2001, when Farnsworth admittedly possessed a firearm in Stafford County, provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">A. It shall be unlawful for ... any person who has been convicted of a felony ..., whether such conviction ... occurred under the laws of this Commonwealth, or any other state, the District of Columbia, the United States or any territory thereof, to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">B. The prohibitions of subsection A shall not apply to ... any person who has been pardoned or whose political disabilities have been removed pursuant to Article V, Section 12 of the Constitution of Virginia....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">C. Any person prohibited from possessing, transporting, or carrying a firearm under subsection A, may petition the circuit court of the jurisdiction in which he resides for a permit to possess or carry a firearm; however, no person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to petition for such a permit unless his civil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority. The court may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, grant such petition and issue a permit. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any person who has been granted a permit pursuant to this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">As relevant to the issue before us in this appeal, the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) is plain and unambiguous and clearly manifests the legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit those who have been convicted of a felony under the law of, <em>inter alia, </em>any state in the United States, including West Virginia, from possessing a firearm in Virginia. <em>See generally Alger, </em>267 Va. at 259, 590 S.E.2d at 565 (stating that \u201cit is clear the obvious intent of that statute [is] to prohibit persons convicted of felonies from possessing firearms\u201d). The statute draws no distinction between those felons previously convicted of a felony in Virginia and those previously convicted of a felony in another state. It is concerned only \u201cwith preventing a person, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed\u201d while in Virginia. <em>Jones </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 358, 429 S.E.2d 615, 617, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993); <em>see Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 89, 93, 578 S.E.2d 51, 53 (2003) (observing that \u201cthe \u2018mischief at which [Code] \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) is directed is the possession of firearms by-convicted felons in an attempt to prevent indiscriminate use of dangerous weapons by one previously convicted of a serious crime\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>267 Va. 255, 590 S.E.2d 563 (2004); <em>Mayhew v.

Pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(B)(iii), the prohibition does not apply to \u201cany\u201d felon who has had his \u201cpolitical disabilities\u201d removed by the Governor \u201cpursuant to Article V, Section 12 of the Virginia Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(0, \u201cany\u201d felon whose \u201ccivil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority\u201d may petition the circuit court in Virginia where he resides for a permit to possess a firearm. If the court, \u201cin its discretion and for good cause shown,\u201d grants such a permit, the statute\u2019s prohibition against possessing a firearm does not apply to that felon. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(C). Farnsworth did not obtain relief under either of these statutory exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 sets forth no other method by which a person convicted of a felony may have his right to possess a firearm restored in Virginia. Indeed, nothing in the statute automatically exempts from its application a convicted felon whose civil rights have been restored by another state following the felon\u2019s completion of his sentence in that state. Consequently, to hold as Farnsworth urges would require us to incorporate into the statute an additional exemption not provided for by the statute\u2019s plain terms, which we may not do. <em>See Flanary v. Milton, </em>263 Va. 20, 23, 556 S.E.2d 767, 769 (2002) (holding that a court may not read a new exemption into a \u201cstatute plain on its face\u201d); <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Roanoke, Inc. v. County of Botetourt, </em>259 Va. 559, 565, 526 S.E.2d 746, 750 (2000) (holding that courts are not permitted to \u201cchange or amend a statute under the guise of construing it\u201d). Had the legislature wished to include such an exemption in the statute, it could have done so, but it did not. We conclude, therefore, that the legislature intended that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(B)(iii) and 18.2-308.2(0 constitute the exclusive means by which a convicted felon in Farnsworth\u2019s position may be exempted from the prohibition against possessing a firearm in Virginia. <em>See Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 704-05, 529 S.E.2d 96, 100 (2000) (holding that, under the fundamental principle of statutory construction <em>expressio uni-us est exclusio </em>alterius\u2014which \u201cprovides that where a statute speaks in specific terms, an implication arises that omitted terms were not intended to be included within the scope of the statute\u201d\u2014when a \u201c \u2018legislative enactment limits the manner in which something may be done, the enactment also evinces the intent that it shall not be done another way \u201d (quoting <em>Grigg v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 356, 364, 297 S.E.2d 799, 803 (1982))). Accordingly, the restoration of Farnsworth\u2019s civil rights by the state of West Virginia did not, by itself, preclude the use of Farnsworth\u2019s conviction for armed robbery in West Virginia as a predicate felony conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We further note that Farnsworth\u2019s reliance in this case upon federal case law is misplaced. The cases cited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Farnsworth, <em>Haynes </em>and <em>Stump, </em>address the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), which establishes the federal prohibition against a convicted felon\u2019s possession of a firearm. The application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20), which expressly states that \u201c[w]hat constitutes a [predicate felony conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)] shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a [predicate felony] conviction for purposes of this chapter.\u201d Thus, in both <em>Haynes, </em>961 F.2d at 53, and <em>Stump, </em>784 F.Supp. at 328, the federal defendants charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) who had their civil rights restored by West Virginia were automatically exempted from prosecution under that statute by the clear language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20). However, as discussed above, no such or similar language appears in or pertains to Virginia\u2019s Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Accordingly, the federal case law cited by Farnsworth is neither binding nor of any persuasive value in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We further find that Farnsworth\u2019s reliance, on appeal, on the federal Constitution\u2019s Full Faith and Credit Clause is procedurally barred under Rule 5A:18. Pursuant to Rule 5A:18, this Court \u201cwill not consider an argument on appeal [that] was not presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998). \u201cRule 5A:18 applies to bar even constitutional claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe purpose of [this] rule is to ensure that the trial court and opposing party are given the opportunity to intelligently address, examine, and resolve issues in the trial court, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 479, 493, 559 S.E.2d 401, 408 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Here, Farnsworth argues on appeal that, pursuant to Article IV, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, Virginia was obligated to give full faith and credit to the restoration of his civil rights in West Virginia. Thus, he argues, Virginia was required to accept his right to possess a firearm \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>determined under the law of West Virginia.\u201d He asserts that he properly \u201cpreserved this issue\u201d when he argued to the trial court that \u2018Virginia needs to recognize [that his rights were restored in West Virginia].\u201d We disagree. Farnsworth made this statement in the context of arguing that the federal case law discussed above, which has no relevance to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, supported his position and that Virginia did not provide a means of restoring a felon\u2019s rights if the felon was not convicted in Virginia. Moreover, Farnsworth neither mentioned the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution by name nor drew any connection between it and the matter before the trial court. We hold, therefore, that, having failed to make any argument concerning the Full Faith and Credit Clause before the trial court, Farnsworth is procedurahy barred by Rule 5A:18 from raising the issue for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Moreover, our review of the record in this case does not reveal any reason to invoke the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions to Rule 5A-.18. <em>See M. Morgan Cherry &amp; Assocs. v. Cherry, </em>38 Va.App. 693, 702, 568 S.E.2d 391, 396 (2002) (en banc) (holding that the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18 will not be invoked where appellant had the opportunity to raise the issue at trial but did not do so); <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (\u201cIn order to avail oneself of the [ends of justice] exception, a defendant must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d); <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 761, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) (en banc) (\u2018We will not consider, <em>sua sponte, </em>a \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 argument under Rule 5A:18.\u201d), <em>petition for appeal granted, </em>No. 040019 (Va. Sup.Ct.

And number two, he was restored in West Virginia where he was required to be restored. And number three, I think Virginia needs to recognize that. I don\u2019t think it would make any sense to require him to reapply for restoration in every state he happens to live in. And I don\u2019t think Virginia has any restoration statutes that would apply to somebody that was convicted in another state. I don\u2019t think Virginia would be the proper jurisdiction for him to be restored. I don\u2019t think our law makes application to laws like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">Bear [with] me for a moment. Some language used in some of these cases was that it was fundamentally unfair to require somebody to have to reapply every time the law changed. That was kind of the holding of the Federal Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">This argument merely addresses the attorney\u2019s belief that the statute did not provide Farnsworth a means of obtaining a permit to possess a firearm because he was convicted in another state and had his civil rights restored in another state. Agreeing with the majority, I do not perceive this argument to be focused upon the Full Faith and Credit Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">I continue to believe that this Court may consider <em>sua sponte </em>the exception to Rule 5A:18 that permits our review \u201cfor good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d <em>See Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 770-77, 589 S.E.2d 444, 453-56 (2003) (Benton, J., dissenting). <em>See also Ball v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 754, 758, 273 S.E.2d 790, 792-93 (1981) (when appellant\u2019s attorney, \u201c[i]n reply to [the Supreme Court\u2019s] inquiry,\u201d addressed an issue \u201cnot presented at trial,\u201d the Court invoked Rule 5:21 (the predecessor to its Rule 5:25) to reverse the conviction \u201cbecause it was necessary to attain the ends of justice\u201d). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>seems to me, however, that Farnsworth\u2019s analysis summarily ignores the provision in the statute which provides that a convicted felon may petition the circuit court for a permit if \u201chis civil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(C). It further seems clear to me that in Farnsworth\u2019s case the \u201cappropriate authority\u201d includes the West Virginia agency charged to restore the civil rights of persons convicted in West Virginia. In short, he had an avenue of relief under the statute which he failed to pursue, foreclosing a claim that we should invoke the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18 to address his contention that the Full Faith and Credit Clause is implicated in this case. <em>See also People v. Shear, </em>71 Cal.App.4th 278, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 707, 714 (1999) (holding that the \u201cfull faith and credit clause\u201d did not preclude California from prohibiting a convicted felon from possessing a firearm within its borders merely because his civil rights had been restored in the state of the conviction).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
