He argues that he was taken into custody in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-74 and that the contraband seized during the search incident to that custodial arrest should have been suppressed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201cOn appeal, \u201cwe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">On January 13, 2003, Officers Richard Lloyd and Sharon Powell were on patrol in a high crime area when they observed Fox pacing on the sidewalk behind a hedge adjacent to a parking lot. As Lloyd exited his marked police vehicle, Fox ran toward a nearby alley. The officers pursued him. Fox produced from the front of his body a handgun, which he threw behind a dumpster as he continued running. Lloyd apprehended Fox a short distance from the alley and arrested him for carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308, a Class 1 misdemeanor. Powell retrieved the handgun. She observed that the serial number on the handgun had been obliterated in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-311.1, also a Class 1 misdemeanor. Lloyd searched Fox at the scene incident to the arrest, but recovered no evidence. He took Fox into custody and transported him to the police station, where a farther search of his person produced the cocaine underlying the subject convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Fox does not contest his initial detention, the search of his person incident to that detention, or the seizure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>handgun. However, in his motion to suppress, Fox argued that Code \u00a7 19.2-74 required that he be issued a summons and released after his initial detention. He argued that his transportation to the police station and his search there violated Code \u00a7 19.2-74 and the Fourth Amendment, requiring suppression of the cocaine discovered in that search. <em>See West v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 237, 242, 549 S.E.2d 605, 607 (2001). We hold that Fox\u2019s custodial arrest and transportation to the police station complied with Code \u00a7 19.2-74 and that the search of his person incident to that arrest was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-74 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">Whenever any person is detained by or is in the custody of an arresting officer for any violation committed in such officer\u2019s presence which offense is a violation of ... any provision of this Code punishable as a Class 1 or Class 2 misdemeanor ... the arresting officer shall take the name and address of such person and issue a summons or otherwise notify him in writing to appear at a time and place to be specified in such summons or notice. Upon the giving by such person of his written promise to appear at such time and place, the officer shall forthwith release him from custody. However, if any such person shall fail or refuse to discontinue the unlawful act, the officer may proceed according to the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-82.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, if any person is believed by the arresting officer to be likely to disregard a summons issued under the provisions of this subsection, or if any person is reasonably believed by the arresting officer to be likely to cause harm to himself or to any other person, a magistrate or other issuing authority having jurisdiction shall proceed according to the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-82.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Fox argues that the \u201cis believed\u201d and \u201cis reasonably believed\u201d language in the statutory exclusion of the summons requirement invokes the application of a wholly subjective test. He argues that for the exclusion to apply, the police officer must testify to a personal belief in the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>circumstances as distinguished from producing evidence supporting that belief. He further argues that \u201c[tjhere is simply no evidence on the record to justify a determination that Officer Lloyd reasonably believed that the defendant was likely to disregard the summons or that he was a danger to himself or others.\u201d In its ruling, the trial court noted \u201cthat it is both a subjective and objective standard. The officer must reasonably believe that either the person will not appear or will be a danger to the community.\u201d We hold that although the statute refers to predictive estimation of the accused person\u2019s future conduct, the standard for determining satisfaction of the statute is objective, whether evidence supports a reasonable belief that the statutory circumstances obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The language used in Code \u00a7 19.2-74 is substantially similar to language used in probable cause cases where an objective test is routinely employed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">Probable cause ... turns only on \u201c \u2018objective facts,\u2019 not the \u2018subjective opinion\u2019 of a police officer.\u201d As a result, \u201cthe fact that the officer does not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the officer\u2019s action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.\u201d <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\"><em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 109, 582 S.E.2d 448, 451 (2003) (citation omitted). Thus, it is well established that \u201c[pjolice actions are to be tested \u2018under a standard of objective reasonableness without regard to the underlying intent or motivation of the officers involved.\u2019\u201d <em>Limonja v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 532, 537-38, 383 S.E.2d 476, 480 (1989) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. </em>128, 138, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978) (footnote omitted)). This rule provides a firm and fair framework governing imposition on the personal freedom of suspects and is obviously far preferable to a system based on the suppositions of individual officers. Whether the officer actually believed that the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>tory circumstances obtained is immaterial. Because the circumstances supported such a belief, the statutory exclusion of Code \u00a7 19.2-74 was satisfied and the custodial arrest was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Fox relies on our decision in <em>West, </em>in which we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress based upon the argument that the police improperly searched West in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-74. Importantly in <em>West, </em>we held that the arresting officer \u201chad no reason, at the point he searched appellant, to believe appellant was not going to appear in court on his promise, nor did he believe appellant was a threat to himself or others. Appellant had not refused to discontinue his unlawful acts.\u201d <em>West, </em>36 Va.App. at 242, 549 S.E.2d at 607. In contrast, at the time Lloyd decided to transport Fox to the police station, he had reason to believe Fox was both a flight risk and a danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Although Lloyd did not specifically testify that he conducted the full custodial arrest because he believed Fox would not appear or was a danger to himself or others, the evidence fully supports such a belief. The trial court found \u201cthe defendant took flight immediately and [this] would indicate his unwillingness to acquiesce in any proceeding by fleeing at this time. So the officer could reasonably believe that he would not show up for court because of that.\u201d The trial court further noted that \u201chaving the weapon is a strong indication that he could do harm to others.... \u201d The serial number on Fox\u2019s weapon had been obliterated. The trial court reasoned that \u201c[t]here is no reason to do that unless the gun ... is being held for a purpose other than a legal purpose.... This gives the Court a strong indication that the weapon was being used for unlawful purposes.\u201d Based on this evidence, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe officer had a subjective belief that this individual would not ... show up or would be a danger to the community.\u201d Finding this belief objectively reasonable, the court denied Fox\u2019s motion to suppress. Whether the officer actually held that belief is immaterial. Because the circumstances supported such a belief, the statutory exclusion of Code \u00a7 19.2-74 was satisfied and the custodial arrest was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>We affirm Fox\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
