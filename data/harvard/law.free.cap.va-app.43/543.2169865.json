Hoebelheinrich (husband) appeals from a final decree of divorce that awarded Nancy A. Hoebelheinrich (wife) $827,388 as a one-half share of husband\u2019s medical practice, $100,163 in spousal support arrearages, $4,800 per month in spousal support, and certain other sums from the marital estate. Husband contends the trial court erred: 1) in valuing his medical practice; 2) in awarding wife one-half the value of that practice; 3) in awarding wife $4,800 per month in spousal support; 4) in failing to consider the tax consequences of the spousal support awards; 5) in determining that the value of certain household goods was not established and in awarding wife nearly all those goods; and 6) in awarding wife one-half the value of husband\u2019s retirement accounts. The relevant facts are discussed as each issue is addressed. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">I. Value of Husband\u2019s Medical Practice</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Husband contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in adopting the expert opinion of Dr. Ward Zimmerman that the medical practice had a value of $654,776 for purposes of equitable distribution. Husband also contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in rejecting the valuation of the medical practice offered by husband\u2019s expert, Janet Shrader. We find, however, that husband has failed to establish that the trial court\u2019s adoption of Zimmerman\u2019s opinion, and its rejection of Shrader\u2019s opinion, violated established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">We view the evidence on this issue, and all inferences that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence, in a light most favorable to wife as the party prevailing below. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). So viewed, the record establishes the trial court instructed the parties to agree on an expert to evaluate husband\u2019s solo medical practice. The trial court stated that, if the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>could not reach an agreement, each party should offer the names of two qualified experts, from whose names the trial court would choose one to submit a valuation. Counsel for wife agreed to this procedure, and counsel for husband stated that the procedure was \u201c[flair enough.\u201d Wife subsequently submitted the names of two experts, one of whom was Zimmerman. Husband failed to submit any names. By decree dated July 9, 2001, the trial court found that \u201cDr. Ward Brian Zimmerman is qualified to evaluate [the medical] practice\u201d and directed Zimmerman to \u201cinvestigate and evaluate the medical practice ... and make his report unto the court.\u201d Husband did not object to the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">On February 22, 2002, Zimmerman submitted his report to the trial court. The report revealed that Zimmerman computed four alternative values for the medical practice. He used two distinct base methods\u2014the \u201ccapitalization of earnings\u201d method and the \u201cdiscounted future earnings\u201d method\u2014to conduct his analysis. Within the calculations performed using each base method, he considered two \u201cscenarios,\u201d differing only in the treatment of husband\u2019s salary. In the first scenario, he treated husband\u2019s salary as a \u201cgeneral and administrative expense,\u201d which had the effect of decreasing the net income of the practice. In the second scenario, he excluded husband\u2019s salary from his calculations altogether. Treating husband\u2019s salary as a business expense under the capitalization of earnings method yielded a value of $654,776 for husband\u2019s medical practice. Excluding husband\u2019s salary under the same method yielded a value of $1,824,434. The discounted future earnings method yielded a value of $743,608 if husband\u2019s salary was treated as a business expense and a value of $1,994,921 if husband\u2019s salary was excluded from the calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">By letter dated May 22, 2002, husband notified wife that he \u201cdisagree[d] strongly with the valuation\u201d conducted by Zimmerman and intended to hire Janet Shrader, a certified public accountant, to testify as to the value of husband\u2019s medical practice. Shrader submitted a report that valued husband\u2019s medical practice at $140,000. She utilized two base methods\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the capitalization of earnings method and the \u201cexcess earnings\u201d method. The capitalization of earnings method yielded a value of $515,000, and the excess earnings method yielded a value of $460,000. Shrader further determined that the total value of the practice included an \u201cintangible value\u201d of $300,000 which reflected the goodwill of the practice. She attributed eighty-five percent of the intangible value to husband\u2019s professional or personal goodwill and fifteen percent to the goodwill of the enterprise or business entity. She therefore subtracted eighty-five percent of the intangible value ($255,000) from the value calculated under each base method, yielding an adjusted value of $260,000 under the capitalization of earnings method and $205,000 under the excess earnings method. \u201cWeighting [both] the [base] methods equally,\u201d she arrived at a value of $220,000. She then applied a thirty-five percent discount for lack of marketability, a percentage derived from statistical data indicating that securities which are restricted from sale for at least two years were selling at a thirty to thirty-five percent discount. Applying the discount for marketability yielded a final value of $140,000 for husband\u2019s medical practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">In addition to her report, Shrader gave testimony through deposition. During her deposition, she criticized Zimmerman\u2019s report. She stated that Zimmerman defined the value of husband\u2019s medical practice in terms of \u201cfair value,\u201d a term she believed was \u201creally closer to \u2018fair market value.\u2019 \u201d She opined that fair market value was \u201cnot appropriate to use in this situation\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019re not trying to sell this practice or determine what a hypothetical buyer would pay for this business.\u201d She also criticized the figure Zimmerman used for the capitalization rate. She finally stated that Zimmerman should not have omitted husband\u2019s salary from some of his calculations because her \u201cstudies showfed] that the compensation [husband] is receiving ... is reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">After discussing the evidence on valuation presented by Zimmerman and Shrader in an opinion letter dated April 24, 2003, the trial court adopted Zimmerman\u2019s lowest figure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>$654,776, as the value of husband\u2019s medical practice. The trial court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">The Court finds that the appropriate method for valuing this medical practice is the Capitalization of Earnings Method, including the deduction for officer\u2019s salary. The salary deducted is reasonable and [husband] is an essential officer of the corporation. In fact, without him the business has only the value of its assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">Therefore, the Court accepts and adopts the value determined by Dr. Zimmerman of $654,776....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">The \u201clack of marketability discount\u201d applied by the [h]us-band\u2019s expert [Shrader] is not appropriate because there is no evidence that a sale of the practice is necessary or foreseeable. <em>(See Howell v. Howell, </em>31 Va.App. 332, [523 S.E.2d 514] (2000)[) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Husband contends on appeal that the trial court erred as a matter of law by assigning value to the medical practice beyond its fixed, tangible assets because all other value can, and must, be attributed to his personal goodwill. He cites <em>Howell </em>in support of his position that personal or professional goodwill is separate property not subject to equitable distribution upon divorce. Although we agree that personal goodwill is separate property, we find that husband has failed to show that the trial court\u2019s reliance on Zimmerman\u2019s opinion violated this principle of law because no evidence establishes that the figure adopted failed to take account of husband\u2019s personal goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">In Virginia, the courts look to the intrinsic value of the property to the parties to measure value for equitable distribution purposes. <em>Owens v. Owens, </em>41 Va.App. 844, 854, 589 S.E.2d 488, 493 (2003). \u201cIntrinsic value is a very subjective concept that looks to the worth of the property to the parties and their marriage.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 339, 523 S.E.2d at 517. As a consequence of the subjective nature of intrinsic value, \u201cthe particular method of valuing and the precise application of that method to the singular facts of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>must vary with the myriad situations that exist among married couples.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 523 S.E.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The intrinsic value of an asset may include goodwill, which is defined as the \u201cincreased value of the business, over and above the value of its assets, that result from the expectation of continued public patronage.\u201d <em>Russell v. Russell, </em>11 Va.App. 411, 415, 399 S.E.2d 166, 168 (1990) (internal quotations omitted). Although we have said that, as a matter of law, goodwill attributable to personal characteristics is considered separate property and goodwill attributable to the business entity is considered marital property, <em>see Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 344, 523 S.E.2d at 520; <em>Russell, </em>11 Va.App. at 415-16, 399 S.E.2d at 168, we will not disturb a \u201c \u2018trial court\u2019s valuation of goodwill ... if it appears that the court made a reasonable approximation of the goodwill value, if any, of the professional practice based on competent evidence and the use of a sound method supported by that evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 339, 523 S.E.2d at 518 (quoting <em>Russell, </em>11 Va.App. at 417, 399 S.E.2d at 169). \u201cIf conflicting, competent evidence is presented, that [evidence] found more credible will determine whether goodwill exists and its value if it does exist. The existence [of goodwill] is not fixed as a matter of law, nor is the method of [its] valuation; both are functions of the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340, 523 S.E.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Here, the expert appointed by the trial court, Zimmerman, and husband\u2019s expert, Shrader, presented conflicting evidence regarding the value of husband\u2019s medical practice. The trial court rejected husband\u2019s expert and adopted Zimmerman\u2019s opinion. The evidence fails to show, as husband contends on appeal, that the trial court failed to consider husband\u2019s personal goodwill in adopting Zimmerman\u2019s valuation. Indeed, the trial court\u2019s opinion letter indicates the contrary; recognizing that \u201cwithout [husband] the business has only the value of its assets,\u201d the trial court accepted Zimmerman\u2019s valuation figure which, <em>inter alia, </em>excluded husband\u2019s salary. Husband presented no evidence to the trial court which we can use as a basis to conclude, as a matter of law, that Zimmerman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>method of valuation failed to exclude the value of the medical practice attributable to his personal goodwill. Although Shrader criticized Zimmerman\u2019s valuation on several grounds, she did not testify that his method of valuation, which excluded husband\u2019s salary, failed to deduct husband\u2019s personal goodwill from the value of the medical practice. Thus, in light of the absence of any evidence establishing that Zimmerman\u2019s methodology failed to account for husband\u2019s personal goodwill in accordance with Virginia law, we conclude that the trial court relied \u201c \u2018on competent evidence and ... a sound method supported by that evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 339, 523 S.E.2d at 518 (quoting <em>Russell, </em>11 Va.App. at 417, 399 S.E.2d at 169); <em>see also Russell, </em>11 Va.App. at 417, 399 S.E.2d at 169 (holding that \u201cthat no single method\u201d for the valuation of goodwill \u201cis to be preferred as a matter of law\u201d). Therefore, considering the record in the instant case, \u201c[w]e cannot say that ... [Zimmerman\u2019s] opinion was unworthy of belief as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 343, 523 S.E.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Husband further contends that the \u201ctrial court committed a clear error of law\u201d by rejecting Shrader\u2019s valuation opinion on the ground that she applied a discount for lack of marketability. The trial court stated only that the \u201c \u2018lack of marketability discount\u2019 applied by the husband\u2019s expert is not appropriate because there is no evidence that a sale of the practice is necessary or foreseeable.\u201d There is no indication, however, that the trial court rejected Shrader\u2019s opinion on this ground alone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court was presented with a classic \u201cbattle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the experts\u201d and was entitled to judge \u201cthe weight and credibility to be given their testimony.\u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. HCA Health Servs. of Virginia, Inc., </em>260 Va. 317, 332, 535 S.E.2d 163, 171 (2000). The trial court gave more weight to Zimmerman\u2019s opinion, and nothing in the record shows that the trial court\u2019s decision was plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">II. Award of Half the Medical Practice to Wife</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Husband contends the trial court erred in awarding wife half the value of the medical practice. He contends the figure was arrived at arbitrarily, without regard to the statutory factors. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). Although a fifty-fifty distribution is not required, <em>see Shackelford v. Shackelford, </em>39 Va.App. 201, 211, 571 S.E.2d 917, 922 (2002), nothing in the statute or case law suggests that such a distribution is inappropriate or disfavored. Furthermore, even though the trial court did not elaborate upon its reasoning, the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to wife, supports the trial court\u2019s award. <em>See Alphin v. Alphin, </em>15 Va.App. 395, 405, 424 S.E.2d 572, 578 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The record reveals that husband and wife were married in 1977 and separated twenty-two years later in 1999. After the parties were married, husband attended medical school while wife worked. When husband graduated from medical school, husband and wife agreed that wife would stay home to raise their children and care for the home. They had four children, and wife raised them well, involving them in numerous activities. \u201cIf there was something available, [i.e. extracurricular activities],\u201d wife \u201chad [the children] in it.\u201d Wife was also accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle. She belonged to country clubs, purchased new vehicles on a regular basis, and never wanted \u201cfor anything.\u201d In light of this evidence, we find that the \u201caward is adequately supported by the evidence relevant to those factors\u201d found in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). <em>Alphin, </em>15 Va.App. at 405, 424 S.E.2d at 578. \u201cAccordingly, the husband\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue is without merit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>III. Trial Court\u2019s Award of Spousal Support to Wife</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Husband contends that the trial court erred in awarding wife $4,800 per month in spousal support. Husband complains primarily that the trial court \u201cdouble-dipped\u201d into a single revenue stream by awarding wife <em>both </em>half the value of his medical practice and spousal support which must be paid from the income he derives from the medical practice. However, husband cites no relevant authority in support of his position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, husband\u2019s argument does not merit appellate consideration, <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992) (holding that arguments \u201cunsupported by ... authority ... do not merit appellate consideration\u201d), and we decline to address it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">IV. Trial Court\u2019s Consideration of Tax Impact Incurred by Husband</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">A. The Prospective Spousal Support Award</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Husband contends that the trial court failed to consider the tax impact arising from his past payments to wife pursuant to a settlement agreement that provided wife would receive the payments free of taxes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, husband complains the trial court gave no consideration to the deleterious tax consequences of the settlement agreement when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>determined the amount of spousal support he must pay prospectively to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) provides that a trial court, \u201c[i]n determining the nature, amount and duration of [a spousal] support award pursuant to this section, ... shall consider the following: ... (13) Such other factors, including the tax consequences to each party, as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\u201d Nothing in the statute suggests that the trial court must consider the tax consequences of a past contractual obligation when determining the amount of future spousal support. In fact, husband cites no authority in support of his argument, and we have found none. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">B. The Award of Spousal Support Arrearages</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Husband further contends the trial court erred in failing to consider the tax impact to husband of the award of spousal support arrearages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The final decree of divorce determined that husband owed spousal support arrearages in the amount of $100,163 for September 1, 2001 through August 21, 2003. During that time period, husband was under an obligation pursuant to a <em>pendente lite </em>order to pay spousal support in accordance with the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the <em>pendente lite </em>order required husband to pay spousal support in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement, husband argued that he suffered the same deleterious tax consequences discussed above, i.e. he was unable to deduct the amount of spousal support paid from his income for federal tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Husband cites no authority for the proposition that a trial court must consider the tax impact of an arrearage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>award. In fact, it is \u201cwell-established ... that court-ordered [spousal] support becomes vested when it accrues and [that] the courts are without authority to make any change with regard to arrearages.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>4 Va.App. 148, 152, 354 S.E.2d 816, 818-19 (1987). We accordingly reject husband\u2019s argument that the trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to consider the tax consequences of the spousal support arrearage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">V. Household Goods</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Husband contends the trial court erred in rejecting his unrebutted testimony that the value of the parties\u2019 household goods was $83,000. He contends further that trial court erred in awarding to each party those items currently in his or her possession. We find husband\u2019s contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Husband introduced at trial a typewritten list of the household goods and their value. The list is divided into two columns: the first column lists the item according to its room location, and the second column lists each item\u2019s value. No other information\u2014such as copies of receipts, the dates of purchase, or the amount the items had depreciated\u2014is provided. Husband testified that he \u201clisted what I felt the replacement value was for the things, but that\u2019s the best I could do.\u201d The total value of all items listed came to approximately $83,000. Wife lodged no objection to husband\u2019s testimony or to the admission of his list into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In his letter opinion, the trial judge stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4-S\">[t]he only evidence as to the value of the furniture and household goods comes from the husband who testified that the \u201creplacement value\u201d was over $83,000. The Court finds that replacement value is not an appropriate means to value used furniture, appliances, tools, and other household goods. No other evidence as to value has been presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">A trial court has broad discretion to determine the value of assets. <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 341, 523 S.E.2d at 519. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s valuation cannot be based on mere guess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>work. The burden is on the parties to provide the trial court sufficient evidence from which it can value their property.\u201d <em>Bosserman v. Bosserman, </em>9 Va.App. 1, 5, 384 S.E.2d 104, 107 (1989) (quotations and citations omitted). Further, the trial court determines the weight and credibility to afford the evidence presented to it. <em>Wheeler v. Wheeler, </em>42 Va.App. 282, 295, 591 S.E.2d 698, 705 (2004). In sum, \u201cthe value of property is an issue of fact, not law.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 340, 523 S.E.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Here, the trial court determined that husband failed to carry his burden of establishing the value of the household goods. <em>See Bosserman, </em>9 Va.App. at 5, 384 S.E.2d at 107. Although husband\u2019s evidence was unrebutted by wife, he testified only to the replacement cost of the household items. Husband cites no authority that holds that the trial court cannot, in its discretion, reject evidence of replacement value. In fact, although \u201c[t]he cost to replace an asset under present conditions is some evidence of an asset\u2019s present fair market value[,] ... Replacement cost is not ... the legally controlling definition of value.\u201d Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 7.04, at 504, 508 (2d ed.1994). We therefore find that the trial court\u2019s determination that the value of the household goods was not established is supported by the law and credible evidence and is not plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We further find that husband\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in awarding the household items to the party who possessed them is procedurally defaulted. He cites no authority in support of his position, and he does not develop the argument on brief. Accordingly, we will not address the merits of his argument. <em>See Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. at 56, 415 S.E.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">VI. Husband\u2019s Retirement Accounts</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Husband finally argues that the trial court erred in awarding wife one-half the value of his retirement assets. Because a one-half share of the retirement assets is the upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>limit, husband argues the trial court abused its discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) provides that the trial court may award up to one-half the value of a spouse\u2019s retirement assets to the other spouse. The statute directs the trial court to consider the equitable distribution factors found in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) before dividing the marital retirement assets. \u201c \u2018In reviewing an equitable distribution award on appeal, we recognize that the trial court\u2019s job is a difficult one. Accordingly, we rely heavily on the discretion of the trial judge in weighing the many considerations and circumstances that are presented in each case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shackelford, </em>39 Va.App. at 210, 571 S.E.2d at 921 (quoting <em>Artis v. Artis, </em>4 Va.App. 132, 137, 354 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1987)). \u2018We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award merely because it is unequal in value between the parties, where the record reflects that the trial court has considered each of the factors set out in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), and where the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Budnick v. Budnick, </em>42 Va.App. 823, 838, 595 S.E.2d 50, 57 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Viewed in a light most favorable to the wife, we find that the trial court considered the relevant equitable distribution factors and that credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s award of one-half the value of husband\u2019s retirement assets to wife. <em>See supra </em>Part II. Accordingly, we will not disturb that award on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"AM5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Aov\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-5\">. We do not suggest that Zimmerman's valuation method correctly accounts for personal goodwill. We hold only that the present record does not allow us to conclude that Zimmerman\u2019s valuation method was insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">. In any event, the trial court was entitled to reject Shrader\u2019s opinion on this ground because such a discount \"presupposes a probable sale.... If a sale is improbable, the discount need not be applied.\u201d <em>Owens, </em>41 Va.App. at 856, 589 S.E.2d at 494-95. Here, as noted by the trial court, \"there is no evidence that a sale of the practice is necessary or foreseeable.\u201d <em>See Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 345, 523 S.E.2d at 521.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">. Husband\u2019s citation to <em>Howell </em>for the argument he advances is misplaced. <em>Howell </em>stated that courts should not confuse personal future earning capacity with practice, or enterprise, goodwill \"in order to avoid double counting.\u201d 31 Va.App. at 344, 523 S.E.2d at 520. Thus, the issue of \"double counting\u201d appeared in <em>Howell </em>in the context of equitable distribution and valuation of goodwill, factual and legal circumstances far removed from the spousal support award at issue here. By contrast, we have held that it is proper for the trial court to consider all assets when fashioning a spousal support award. <em>See Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 204, 480 S.E.2d 792, 799 (1997) (\" 'An award of alimony can be based not only upon the payor's income but also upon his property.... All types of property ... should be a permissible source for future alimony payments.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6.11 p. 355 (2d ed.1994))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">. Under such an agreement, husband could not deduct the amount he paid in spousal support from his income for federal tax purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\">. The trial court issued an order on September 11, 2003, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to February 28, 2001, finding the parties\u2019 settlement agreement to be \"null and void\u201d because it was executed while the parties were cohabiting. The order further directed husband to pay spousal support pursuant to the settlement agreement \"until further order of this Court.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
