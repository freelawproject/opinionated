We agree that the court erred in refusing to enforce the prenuptial agreement, but find no fault with the court\u2019s distribution of the marital home or award of fees. We thus reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for the court to reconsider its allocation of the personalty consistent with the prenuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">\u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). Shortly before their marriage in 1997, Leonard and Tonya Smith entered into a prenuptial agreement. On the issue of property acquired during the marriage, the agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\"><em>Future Property: </em>Except as otherwise set forth in this agreement, <em>all property\u2014real, personal and mixed\u2014which each party may hereafter acquire in his or her own name or possession shall remain the separate property of that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>person, </em>along with all future appreciation, increases and other changes in value of that property and irrespective of any contributions either party may make to the property of the marriage, directly or indirectly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">(Emphasis added). Wife\u2019s attorney drafted the agreement, and both parties signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">During their marriage, the Smiths maintained separate checking accounts and two separate credit card accounts. They each purchased various items of personal property and scrupulously retained receipts for each purchase. Their parents contributed equal sums for the couple to build and furnish a new home. A post-separation appraisal, paid for by husband\u2019s mother, Betty Smith, valued the home at $183,000. The parties lived together in the home until November 2, 2001, when wife moved out. A few days later, wife filed a bill of complaint for divorce alleging adultery and constructive desertion. Husband counterclaimed, alleging actual desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In the trial court, the parties agreed to resolve their dispute over ownership of the marital home by means of a judicial auction. Under their agreed protocol, each party would make bids for the home in $1,000 increments in an amount that party would pay the other for his or her equity interest. Husband won the auction, agreeing to pay wife $84,000. The trial court\u2019s decree required husband to refinance the home and pay off the existing mortgage. In reliance on this agreement, wife incurred moving and storage expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Husband, however, failed either to pay wife or to refinance the home. When challenged on this, husband assured the trial court that he could obtain financing and that, in fact, he had already submitted loan applications to four banks. He agreed to give wife copies of these applications after the hearing. He never did. Nor did he ever refinance the property or pay wife the $84,000 auction price.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">With regard to their personal property, both parties filed copies of the prenuptial agreement with the trial court. The court heard extensive <em>ore tenus </em>testimony regarding various items of personal property acquired during the marriage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Going item by item down a five-page list of property that husband declared to be his separate property, each party produced receipts or testified regarding the separate or marital nature of each item. Neither party challenged the validity of the prenuptial agreement or any of its provisions. During cross-examination, wife concurred that \u201cthe prenuptial agreement that everybody concedes is valid\u201d was in fact \u201cprepared by [her] lawyer.\u201d The trial judge clarified wife\u2019s understanding of the \u201cfuture property\u201d portion of the prenuptial agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">Q: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m asking you what this means, because you seem in your testimony to have taken the position that if you paid for the property, even if it was acquired during the marriage, that under this provision it means it\u2019s your property. It\u2019s your separate property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">Q: And is that the way you interpret this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Husband understood the prenuptial agreement to mean the same thing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">Q: Did I understand your position is if you pay for it, if it came with a cheek out of your checking account, it\u2019s yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Neither party argued that the prenuptial agreement should be declared void for indefiniteness or set aside as insufficient to overcome the presumption of marital property under Code \u00a7 20-107.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">In a final decree entered in August 2003, the trial court awarded a no-fault divorce to wife. The court awarded the marital home to wife, but ordered her to pay husband $26,250, an amount \u201crepresenting 35% of the equity in the property.\u201d The court valued the home at $183,000 and determined the mortgage indebtedness to be $108,000. The court also found that the stove, refrigerator and a dining room chandelier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>should be \u201cdeemed part of, and included with, the marital residence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">When distributing the personalty, the court disregarded the prenuptial agreement altogether on the ground that it was \u201cless than clear\u201d and \u201cimprecise and conflicting.\u201d The court characterized the parties\u2019 consensus interpretation of the agreement as a \u201cwhoever paid for it\u201d basis for separate ownership. That interpretation, the court held, conflicted with the \u201cin possession\u201d language of the agreement. As a result, the court reasoned, the agreement did not overcome the marital property presumption of Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Having found the agreement ineffectual, the court held that all items of personal property would be \u201chereby deemed marital property\u201d and divided among the parties pursuant to the discretionary factors of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Finally, the trial court found husband in contempt for his \u201cdeliberate misrepresentations to the Court\u201d and his \u201cwillful failure to abide by the orders of this Court.\u201d Characterizing husband\u2019s conduct during the litigation as \u201cobstructive and in bad faith,\u201d the court ordered him to pay wife $2,500 towards wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">On appeal, husband argues that the trial court (a) abused its discretion in failing to award him 50% of the equity in the home, (b) erroneously found the prenuptial agreement too indefinite to be enforced, and (c) awarded \u201cexcessive\u201d attorney\u2019s fees to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">(a) <em>Distribution of the Marital Home</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Husband\u2019s first argument\u2014that the trial court erred in awarding the marital home to wife and making her pay him 35% of its equity value\u2014has no merit. Husband made an in-court stipulation to submit the home to a judicial auction. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that auction, husband bought the property and agreed to pay wife $84,000. Husband defaulted on his agreement, leaving the trial court with a broad range of options to cure the default. The trial court chose to relieve husband of his contractual obligation and to order that wife pay him $26,500 (35% of the home\u2019s $75,000 equity). The net effect of the court\u2019s decision was to improve husband\u2019s financial position from what it would have been had he complied with the contractual duties he assumed under the judicial auction. The trial court\u2019s decision, therefore, was considerably more equitable to husband than he had a right to expect.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">That so, we cannot perceive any principled legal basis for husband\u2019s assertion that this benefit prejudiced his rights under the equitable distribution statute. <em>See generally </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(7) (authorizing court to consider \u201cdebts and liabilities\u201d of each spouse); Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(10) (permitting consideration of any additional \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d factors to determine a \u201cfair and equitable\u201d award). \u201cA decision involving the equitable distribution of marital property \u2018rests within the sound discretion of the trial court,\u2019 and can be overturned only by a showing of an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Owens v. Owens, </em>41 Va.App. 844, 853, 589 S.E.2d 488, 493 (2003) (citing <em>Mir v. Mir, </em>39 Va.App. 119, 125, 571 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2002)) (citation omitted). No such showing has been made on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">(b) <em>Enforcement of the Prenuptial Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Husband next contends that the trial court erred by refusing to enforce the prenuptial agreement when distributing the personal property of the parties. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The law presumes property acquired during a marriage to be marital, not separate, property. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2). The parties, however, may defeat that presumption by agreement. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(1); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 20-151(A). Contracts seeking to do this before marriage, like the prenuptial agreement in this case, should be interpreted and enforced no differently than any other type of contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>See King v. King, </em>40 Va.App. 200, 206, 578 S.E.2d 806, 809 (2003); <em>Rogers v. Yourshaw, </em>18 Va.App. 816, 819, 448 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1994); <em>Drewry v. Drewry, </em>8 Va.App. 460, 466, 383 S.E.2d 12, 14 (1989). Thus, we employ \u201crules of construction applicable to contracts generally, including the application of the plain meaning of unambiguous contractual terms.\u201d <em>Pysell v. Keck, </em>263 Va. 457, 460, 559 S.E.2d 677, 678 (2002); <em>King, </em>40 Va.App. at 206, 578 S.E.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Under settled contract principles, Virginia courts resolve contractual vagaries in one of three ways. First, if no patent or latent ambiguities exist, a court should enforce the plain meaning of the contractual language without resort to extrinsic evidence. <em>See Eure v. Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp., </em>263 Va. 624, 632, 561 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2002); <em>King, </em>40 Va.App. at 206, 578 S.E.2d at 810. Second, if an ambiguity exists, a court should still enforce the contract if the real meaning of the ambiguous provision can be discerned from extrinsic evidence. See <em>Cascades N. Venture Ltd. P\u2019ship v. PRC Inc., </em>249 Va. 574, 579, 457 S.E.2d 370, 373 (1995). Third, if an ambiguity renders the alleged agreement too indefinite\u2014 even after the consideration of extrinsic evidence\u2014for the court to determine the parties\u2019 intent, the contract cannot be enforced due to the absence of any discernable meeting of the minds. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety, </em>222 Va. 361, 364, 281 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In this case, the trial court set the prenuptial agreement aside on the ground it was \u201cless than clear\u201d and used \u201cimprecise and conflicting language.\u201d This finding, even if it were true, falls far short of the threshold standard for invalidating a contract for inscrutability. \u201cThe law does not favor declaring contracts void for indefiniteness and uncertainty, and leans against a construction which has that tendency.\u201d <em>Reid v. Boyle, </em>259 Va. 356, 367-68, 527 S.E.2d 137, 143 (2000) (citations omitted). \u201cWhile courts cannot make contracts for the parties, neither will they permit parties to be released from the obligations which they have assumed if this can be ascertained with reasonable certainty from language used, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.; see also City of Manassas v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>250 Va. 126, 134, 458 S.E.2d 568, 572 (1995); <em>High Knob, Inc. v. Allen, </em>205 Va. 503, 507-08, 138 S.E.2d 49, 53 (1964). Indefiniteness \u201cmust reach the point where construction becomes futile\u201d for a court to declare the contract \u201cmeaningless\u201d and to \u201cjustify the conclusion that in reality it accomplished nothing.\u201d <em>Heyman Cohen &amp; Sons, Inc. v. M. Lurie Woolen Co., </em>232 N.Y. 112, 133 N.E. 370, 371 (1921) (Cardozo, J.). Such a conclusion should be \u201cat best a last resort.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>see generally 1 Corbin, <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 4.1 (revised ed.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We see no ambiguity in the \u201cFuture Property\u201d provision of the prenuptial agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither did either of the parties when they presented their case to the trial court. Neither party argued that the contract included any latent or patent ambiguity\u2014much less one so fatal as to dispossess the agreement of its contractual status. Nor did either party argue that the contract failed to rebut the marital property presumption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court reached that erroneous conclusion <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The prenuptial agreement states that \u201call property\u2014real, personal and mixed\u2014which each party may hereafter acquire in his or her own name or possession shall remain the separate property\u201d of the acquiring party. Both parties agreed on what that provision meant: If one party <em>acquired </em>an item, it belonged to that party. With this understanding, they presented evidence of who bought what. The trial court rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>this evidence, reasoning that it \u201cignores altogether the \u2018in possession\u2019 language contained in the agreement.\u201d We fail to see why. The prepositional phrase \u201cin his or her own name or possession\u201d modifies the verb \u201cacquire.\u201d This provision thus focuses on the act of <em>acquiring </em>the property, not the act of later <em>maintaining </em>it. Acquisition can occur either by the acquirer receiving a document of title (as with realty and motor vehicles) or by receiving possession of the item at the time of purchase. In either instance, the phrase \u201cin his or her own name or possession\u201d merely describes how a person may \u201cacquire\u201d property.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In this case, the parties maintained separate checking accounts and two separate credit card accounts. They acquired most of their personalty through retail purchases and took possession at the time of the purchase. Because the act of acquisition was usually accompanied by the payment of a purchase price, they understandably focused on this aspect. As husband explained, \u201cif you pay for it, if it came with a check out of your checking account, it\u2019s yours.\u201d Wife agreed that \u201cif you paid for the property, even if it was acquired during the marriage, that under this provision it means it\u2019s your property. It\u2019s your separate property.\u201d That either party may have thereafter used, borrowed, or otherwise temporarily possessed any particular item (which had been previously acquired by the other party) did not change its character as separate property under the prenuptial agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The trial court, therefore, erred in concluding that the prenuptial agreement should be set aside as unenforceable because it was \u201cless than clear\u201d and used \u201cimprecise and conflicting language.\u201d On remand, the court should reconsider the evidence previously presented, take whatever additional evidence it deems prudent, and distribute the contested items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of personal property consistent with the prenuptial agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">(c) <em>Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees to Wife</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Finally, husband claims the trial court erred by awarding wife $2,500 in attorney\u2019s fees. Whether to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cis a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 375, 585 S.E.2d 349, 354 (2003) (quoting <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 199-200, 571 S.E.2d 912, 916 (2002)); see also <em>Graves v. Graves, </em>4 Va.App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1987). \u201cGiven the unique equities of each case, our appellate review steers clear of inflexible rules and focuses instead on \u2018reasonableness under all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 375, 585 S.E.2d at 354 (quoting <em>Joynes v. Payne, </em>36 Va.App. 401, 429, 551 S.E.2d 10, 24 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment of the \u201crelative equities of the parties in this case\u201d and its conclusion that husband\u2019s obstructive conduct compounded the costs of this litigation. The award of fees seems to us particularly appropriate given the effort required to litigate the issue of the marital home after husband breached his auction agreement and, in the midst of doing so, misrepresented his refinancing efforts to the trial court. For these reasons, we find no basis for husband\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In sum, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decisions regarding the marital residence and attorney\u2019s fees. We reverse the trial court\u2019s refusal to enforce the prenuptial agreement and remand with instructions to reconsider its allocation of personal property pursuant to that agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">.

Absent the necessity to consider extrinsic evidence, appellate courts review trial court interpretations of contractual texts <em>de novo </em>because we \"have an equal opportunity to consider the words within the four comers of the disputed provision.\u201d <em>Standard Banner Coal Corp. v. Rapoca Energy Co., </em>265 Va. 320, 324-25, 576 S.E.2d 435, 437 (2003) (citations omitted); see also <em>Shepherd v.

The trial court acknowledged in its letter opinion that \"both parties have taken the position that their Prenuptial Agreement, dated May 22, 1997, controlled the division of personal property....\u201d At no time in the trial court did either party argue that the agreement was unenforceable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. Even if the provision were ambiguous, the parties\u2019 shared interpretation, while not binding on the court, has considerable weight. <em>See Galloway Corp. v. S.B. Ballard. Constr.

The trial court should also reconsider its 50/50 apportionment of credit card debt to the extent necessary to be consistent with its post-remand distribution of separate items of personal property. Any third-party debt incurred by a spouse in the purchase of separate property should likewise be classified as separate debt outside the scope of equitable distribution. See <em>generally Stumbo </em>v. <em>Stumbo, 20 </em>Va.App. 685, 692-93, 460 S.E.2d 591, 595 (1995) (\"Thus, when property is acquired, and, similarly, when debt is incurred, a trial court must determine the purpose of expenditure in order to classify property as marital or separate or to 'allocate' debt as marital or separate.\u201d); <em>cf Hayes v.
