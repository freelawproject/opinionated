FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The Virginia Employment Commission/Commonwealth of Virginia (employer) appeals a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarding disability compensation and medical benefits to Rhonda Hale (claimant). On appeal, employer contends the commission erroneously concluded claimant\u2019s injury, which resulted from a lightning strike, arose out of the peculiar conditions of her employment. We find no credible evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s finding, and, therefore, we reverse and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Claimant worked for employer as an interviewer. That position required claimant to perform a variety of different tasks including the operation of the office\u2019s switchboard. On May 2, 2002, claimant and a co-worker, Barbara Reynolds, were assigned to work at the switchboard. This duty was \u201ca normal and necessary part of [their] job[s],\u201d and they did not have the option of refusing switchboard duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">When claimant returned from lunch, a \u201cbig storm was brewing.\u201d \u201c[I]t got real dark outside\u201d and was \u201c[t]hunder[ing]\u201d and \u201clight[ ]ning.\u201d Reynolds initially \u201cwas sitting in the main switchboard seat,\u201d but she did not feel comfortable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>there, so claimant \u201ctook that position.\u201d Reynolds moved to a second telephone within a few feet of claimant. Both women were \u201ctrouble shooting claims or answering questions from claimants.\u201d They continued to answer the phones during the storm because they \u201chad not been instructed not to answer the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">While claimant was on the telephone with a caller and had her hand on the computer keyboard, she heard \u201ca real loud noise in the telephone\u201d and saw \u201ca big blue ... transparent streak\u201d of light \u201cc[o]me right down beside [her] work station.\u201d Claimant thought \u201c[i]t looked like light[ ]ning.\u201d Claimant screamed or uttered some sort of exclamation. She thought she \u201cactually lost the call,\u201d and her computer \u201cflieker[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Claimant felt she had been shocked by the lightning. Her extremities began to tingle, and her speech became garbled. She immediately reported the incident to Reynolds, who confirmed that she, too, saw a streak of light and heard a loud noise. Claimant described her symptoms to Reynolds, including \u201ca tingling in her hands and arms, sort of like [she] had been electrocuted.\u201d Reynolds observed that claimant \u201cwas like shaking or nervous or tense.\u201d Reynolds then asked the assistant office manager \u201cif [they] could not answer the phones and he said that [they] had to.\u201d Claimant continued to answer the telephone, but said she \u201chung up on quite a few people because [her] speech was garbled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">About thirty minutes after the lightning strike, claimant became nauseous and began having chest pains. She told her immediate supervisor that they had \u201cwhat ... appeared to be light[ ]ning come in,\u201d and she described her symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The lightning did not damage either claimant\u2019s or Reynolds\u2019s telephone or computer. No damage was done to the building\u2019s roof, ceiling tiles, carpet, or furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Claimant worked through the end of her shift and then sought treatment at the hospital emergency room, where she was admitted as a precautionary measure. Emergency room notes indicate claimant told the staff that she \u201cwas working at her job on a computer and talking on the telephone, when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>saw a blue streak of light[]ning hit her computer.\u201d Later, claimant visited a sleep clinic and described to the personnel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A55\">an incident at her work suggesting that lightening had struck and come through the phone or computer line and affected the [claimant].... She was not actually struck directly by the light[ ]ning but said that it came through her equipment. She saw a blue streak of light[ ]ning behind a partition where she works. She was very close to the blue streak of light[ ]ning she saw.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Claimant was diagnosed with \u201c[e]leetrical shock secondary to light[ ]ning.\u201d She was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Her primary care physician found she was temporarily and totally disabled, but was able to return to work on August 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Employer denied claimant\u2019s request for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and claimant requested a hearing. After taking testimony, the deputy commissioner awarded benefits. He found claimant\u2019s evidence was credible and concluded, \u201cclaimant, because of her duties as an interviewer, was exposed to the causative hazard involved to a degree greater than others in the community.\u201d He noted, \u201cclaimant\u2019s duties [at employer\u2019s switchboard] were mandatory rather than discretionary, and, because [claimant] was assisting a customer over the telephone during a thunderstorm, [she] was as a result of her employment exposed to a danger which someone not similarly situated could have avoided.\u201d The deputy specifically rejected employer\u2019s \u201cinferential[ ]\u201d argument that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ4\">because the telephone and computer equipment involved [sustained no damage], the incident did not occur, and the claimant could not have been injured____ The fact that other employees at [employer]\u2019s facility were unaffected only proves the claimant\u2019s case that she was, by virtue of her operation of the switchboard, at greater risk of injury during the storm than anyone else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The full commission affirmed the award of benefits, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">From this record, we agree with the deputy commissioner that the injury arose out of the employment. The deputy commissioner explicitly found the claimant to be credible. She credibly testified that she was talking at a telephone while operating the employer\u2019s switchboard when she saw a lightning bolt and felt shocked. Her co-worker corroborated the incident. We agree with the deputy commissioner that the claimant\u2019s employment, and in particular, her use of the employer\u2019s switchboard equipment during a thunderstorm, brought into existence a special or peculiar risk of electrical shock through a lightning strike.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Employer concedes claimant was struck by lightning, but argues no evidence supports a finding that her employment placed her at greater risk of being struck. Based on the record and controlling precedent, we agree with employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In order for an employee to recover under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, she must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Hercules, Inc. v. Stump, </em>2 Va.App. 77, 79, 341 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1986), that she suffered an \u201cinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (definition of \u201cinjury\u201d for Workers\u2019 Compensation Act cases). \u201cThe phrase arising \u2018in the course of refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred. The phrase arising \u2018out of refers to the origin or cause of the injury.\u201d <em>County of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 183, 376 S.E.2d 73, 74 (1989). Our focus in this case concerns the latter inquiry\u2014whether claimant\u2019s injury arose \u201cout of\u2019 her employment. Under this prong of the test, \u201c[h]azards to which the general public is equally exposed are noncompensable.\u201d <em>Lucas v. Fed. Express Corp., 41 </em>Va.App. 130, 134, 583 S.E.2d 56, 58 (2003). In order to be entitled to compensation under the \u201carising out of\u2019 prong, an employee \u201cmust prove that the employment activity in which she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>engaged exposed her to the injurious risk to an extent to which people were not ordinarily exposed, and thus caused her injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 583 S.E.2d at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">This determination involves a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Mullins v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>10 Va.App. 304, 307, 391 S.E.2d 609, 611 (1990). Therefore, this Court is bound by the commission\u2019s factual findings so long as they are supported by credible evidence, even if \u201ccontrary evidence may be found in the record.\u201d <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A) (commission\u2019s award \u201cshall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We recently considered, in <em>Lucas, </em>41 Va.App. 130, 583 S.E.2d 56, the issue of whether injuries caused by a lightning strike arose out of the claimant\u2019s employment. We find <em>Lucas </em>compels our decision in this case and requires us to reverse the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Lucas </em>recites the rule for compensability of injuries flowing from natural disasters as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cIf an employee is injured by some natural force, such as ... [being] struck by hghtning during a storm, ... the event does not in and of itself fasten liability on the employer. The theory is that death or any incapacity to work resulting from some natural force operating directly upon the victim without the intervention of any other agency or instrumentality, arises not out of the employment but is due solely to an act of God. <em>However, when the nature of the employment, or some condition, or environment therein, brings into existence a special or peculiar risk to the disastrous forces of nature, the injury or death of an employee may be compensated as a risk of the employment. </em>The applicable test seems to be not whether the injury was caused by an act of God, but whether the employment collaborated in causing the injury or death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 134-35, 583 S.E.2d at 59 (quoting Elmer H. Blair, <em>Reference Guide to Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 9.02 (1974)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>In <em>Lucas, </em>the employee, a driver for Federal Express, was struck by lightning while she sat in her delivery truck with her left hand on the truck\u2019s metal steering wheel and with her right hand inserting the key into the truck\u2019s ignition. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 583 S.E.2d at 57-58. Lucas testified that the truck was made almost entirely of metal and contained an antenna, computer equipment, and a CB radio. <em>Id. </em>at 132 n. 1, 583 S.E.2d at 58 n. 1. The commission concluded no evidence established \u201c \u2018she suffered an injury which arose from a heightened risk of her employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 583 S.E.2d at 58. In affirming the denial of benefits, we noted that the record contained no evidence \u201crelating how [the truck\u2019s electrical and structural] characteristics caused [Lucas\u2019s] injury by exposing her to a particular risk of injury from lightning not otherwise experienced by any other person in the same vicinity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 583 S.E.2d at 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In deciding <em>Lucas, </em>we discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Scott County School Board v. Carter, </em>156 Va. 815, 159 S.E. 115 (1931). 41 Va.App. at 135-36, 583 S.E.2d at 59. <em>Carter </em>involved a teacher who was killed when a cyclone destroyed the schoolhouse in which she worked. 156 Va. at 816, 159 S.E. at 116. We noted the Supreme Court\u2019s focus in <em>Carter </em>on the commission\u2019s finding that the location of the schoolhouse \u201c \u2018on an eminence on a plateau, at a point where the wind blew more continually than at other points,\u2019 \u201d made the schoolhouse \u201c \u2018more susceptible to[ ] the hazard of storms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lucas, </em>41 Va.App. at 135, 583 S.E.2d at 59 (quoting <em>Carter, </em>156 Va. at 817, 159 S.E. at 116). As a result, the Supreme Court held credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s decision in favor of Carter, and it affirmed the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In the present case, while the commission expressly articulated a connection between the conditions of claimant\u2019s employment and an increased risk of being struck by lightning, no evidence in the record supports this conclusion. No evidence suggests claimant\u2019s use of the computer or telephone created a \u201cheightened risk of injury\u201d beyond the general risk to anyone in a building during a storm. No testimony or other evidence indicates that claimant, while working at her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>station, was at a greater risk of being struck by lightning than the average person.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">We find nothing that distinguishes <em>Lucas </em>from the instant case. Similar to <em>Lucas, </em>the claimant here was in close proximity to a computer. The evidence in <em>Lucas </em>included the additional factor that Lucas was sitting in a metal vehicle with an antenna. In denying her claim for compensation, the <em>Lucas </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">While Lucas provided testimony of the truck\u2019s electrical and structural characteristics, there is no competent evidence relating how these characteristics caused her injury by exposing her to a particular risk of injury from lightning not otherwise experienced by any other person in the same vicinity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">Absent competent testimony that the particular electrical or structural characteristics of the truck caused her injury, the commission was unable to determine that the injuries arose from her employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 136, 583 S.E.2d at 59-60. Here, as in <em>Lucas, </em>no evidence indicates that the characteristics of claimant\u2019s employment exposed her to a particular risk of injury not generally experienced by other people. Although she sat at a computer talking on the phone, nothing proves that this workplace \u201c \u2018corroborated in causing the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 583 S.E.2d at 59 (quoting Blair, \u00a7 9.02).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u201cFactual findings of the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Southern Iron Works, Inc. v. Wallace, </em>16 Va.App. 131, 134, 428 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1993). However, credibility of the evidence is not in issue here. It is uncontroverted that claimant was shocked by the lightning and was injured by the lightning. It is uncontroverted that claimant was on the switchboard when the accident occurred. Our inquiry is whether the commission had any evidence to support its conclusion that \u201cuse of ... employer\u2019s switchboard equipment during a thunderstorm[ ] brought into existence a special or peculiar risk of electrical shock through a lightning strike.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Here, no evidence was presented that claimant was at an increased risk of being struck during a lightning storm due to her working conditions that day. Because no evidence supports the commission\u2019s ruling on this point, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. At the hearing, claimant denied telling any of the doctors that she saw the lightning strike the phone or the computer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b434-5\">ELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHq\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The majority concludes our recent holding in <em>Lucas v. Federal Express Corp., </em>41 Va.App. 130, 583 S.E.2d 56 (2003), compels the conclusion no evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s employment placed her at a greater risk of being struck by lightning. I find <em>Lucas </em>distinguishable. In <em>Lucas, </em>the commission made no finding of causation. In claimant\u2019s case, by contrast, the commission expressly found claimant\u2019s frequent and sustained \u201cuse of ... employer\u2019s switchboard equipment during a thunderstorm[ ] brought into existence a special or peculiar risk of electrical shock through a lightning strike.\u201d Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">I would hold that \u201c[cjertain facts as to the operation of lightning have become matters of common knowledge, of which judicial notice may be taken.\u201d <em>Bauer\u2019s Case, </em>314 Mass. 4, 49 N.E.2d 118,120 (1943); <em>see also, e.g., Truck Ins.

Hume-Sinclair Coal Mining Co., </em>226 Mo.App. 1137, 49 S.W.2d 631, 634-35 (1932). \u201cJudicial notice permits a court to determine the existence of a fact without formal evidence tending to support that fact.\u201d <em>Scafetta v. Arlington County, </em>13 Va.App. 646, 648, 414 S.E.2d 438, 439, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g, </em>14 Va.App. 834, 425 S.E.2d 807 (1992). \u201cA trial court may take judicial notice of those facts that are either (1) so \u2018generally known\u2019 within the jurisdiction or (2) so \u2018easily ascertainable\u2019 by reference to reliable sources that reasonably informed people in the community would not regard them as reasonably subject to dispute.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 1, 7-8, 502 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1998) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>While \u201cthe fact of judicial notice must appear from the record,\u201d <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 878, 383, 368 S.E.2d 295, 298 (1988), \u201ca trial court need not intone the words \u2018judicial notice\u2019 in order to notice a fact,\u201d <em>Dillard v.

Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 446, 247 S.E.2d 698, 703 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In <em>Lucas, </em>the employee, a delivery driver for Federal Express, was struck by lightning while she sat in the seat of her delivery truck with her left hand on the truck\u2019s metal steering wheel and used her right hand to insert the key into the truck\u2019s ignition. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 583 S.E.2d at 57-58. Lucas testified that the truck was made almost entirely of metal and had an antenna, computer equipment and a CB radio. <em>Id. </em>at 132 n. 1, 583 S.E.2d at 58 n. 1. The deputy and commissioner concluded Lucas failed to establish \u201cany heightened risk of injury that stemmed from [Lucas\u2019s] employment as a delivery driver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 583 S.E.2d at 58. Absent such evidence, we held credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s finding that Lucas failed to meet her burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 583 S.E.2d at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In deciding <em>Lucas, </em>41 Va.App. at 135-36, 583 S.E.2d at 59, we discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Scott County School Board v. Carter, </em>156 Va. 815, 159 S.E. 115 (1931). <em>Carter </em>involved a teacher who was killed when a cyclone destroyed the schoolhouse in which she worked. <em>Id. </em>at 816, 159 S.E. at 116. We noted the Supreme Court\u2019s focus in <em>Carter </em>on <em>the commission\u2019s finding that the location of the schoolhouse </em>\u201c \u2018on an eminence on a plateau, at a point where the wind blew more continually than at other points,\u2019 \u201d <em>made the schoolhouse \u201c\u2018more susceptible to[] the hazard of storms.\u2019 \u201d Lucas, </em>41 Va.App. at 135, 583 S.E.2d at 59 (quoting <em>Carter, </em>156 Va. at 817, 159 S.E. at 116 (emphases added)). In <em>Carter, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court quoted or paraphrased these findings a total of four times, emphasizing that \u2018these are the declared facts to which we must give credence\u2019 and that, \u2018these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>being the conditions which obtained at the time, we are bound to say the employment subjected [Carter] to greater exposure than were those persons generally in that locality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lucas, </em>41 Va.App. at 135-36, 583 S.E.2d at 59 (quoting <em>Carter, </em>156 Va. at 821, 159 S.E. at 117 (citation omitted)). As a result, the Court held credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s decision, and it affirmed the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In claimant\u2019s case, like in <em>Carter, </em>and in contrast to <em>Lucas, </em>the commission expressly articulated a connection between the conditions of claimant\u2019s employment and the force of nature that caused her injury, stating claimant\u2019s frequent and sustained \u201cuse of ... employer\u2019s switchboard equipment during a thunderstorm[ ] brought into existence a special or peculiar risk of electrical shock through a lightning strike.\u201d The commission noted claimant\u2019s testimony that she heard a loud noise in the phone when the lightning struck; other evidence permitted a finding that claimant\u2019s telephone call was disconnected and that her computer may have flickered, as well, lending support to the conclusion that claimant\u2019s use of the switchboard and computer, required by her employment, heightened her risk of being struck by lightning. The deputy and commission expressly found credible the testimony of claimant and her co-worker. The fact that neither the switchboard phone nor the computer appeared to have sustained any damage from the lightning strike does not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Because the commission expressly articulated a connection between the conditions of claimant\u2019s employment and the force of nature that caused her injury\u2014a causal connection of a type which the Supreme Court has implicitly permitted the commission to take judicial notice, <em>see Carter, </em>156 Va. at 817, 821, 159 S.E. at 116, 117; <em>Lucas, </em>41 Va.App. at 135-36, 583 S.E.2d at 59\u2014I would conclude credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s award of benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
