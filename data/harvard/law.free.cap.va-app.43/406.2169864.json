Ellyson (claimant). Employer alleges the commission erred in finding that claimant\u2019s depression was a consequence of his earlier compensable injury and that claimant\u2019s treatment for pain was \u201creasonable, necessary, and causally related\u201d to his compensable injury. We disagree with employer and affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Claimant sustained a compensable injury to his right foot on April 24,2000. A dispute arose concerning whether claimant\u2019s depression was a compensable consequence of this injury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>whether the award required that employer pay for a spinal cord stimulator (SCS).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The commission held a hearing and accepted evidence on the issues. The deputy and the full commission found claimant was entitled to an award for his depression and for the SCS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">I. Claimant\u2019s Depression</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Employer argues the evidence did not support the commission\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s depression was causally related to his compensable injury. Determination of causation is a factual finding. <em>Thompson v. Brenco, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 617, 622, 567 S.E.2d 580, 583 (2002). When reviewing workers\u2019 compensation cases, we defer to these factual findings. Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Hawks v. Henrico County Sch. Bd., </em>7 Va.App. 398, 404, 374 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988). \u201cIf there is evidence, or reasonable inferences can be drawn from the evidence, to support the commission\u2019s findings, they will not be disturbed on review, even though there is evidence in the record to support a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986). The commission determines which medical evidence is credible, as the Court explained in <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Robinson, </em>32 Va.App. 1, 5, 526 S.E.2d 267, 268-69 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">Applying equally well-settled principles, the Supreme Court has held that the \u201cquestion [of causation] raised by \u2018conflicting expert medical opinions\u2019 is one of fact.\u201d <em>Eccon Constr. Co. v. Lucas, </em>221 Va. 786, 790, 273 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1981). Thus, the commission\u2019s \u201cfinding upon conflicting medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>evidence that a certain condition does or does not exist is ... a conclusive finding of fact.\u201d <em>McPeek v. P.W. &amp; W. Coal Co., </em>210 Va. 185, 188, 169 S.E.2d 443, 445 (1969). \u201cThe deference that we give to the commission\u2019s fact finding on medical questions is based upon the \u2018unwisdom of an attempt by ... [courts] uninitiated into the mysteries [of the medical science debate] to choose between conflicting expert medical opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stancill v. Ford Motor Co., </em>15 Va.App. 54, 58, 421 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1992) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Employer acknowledges the record contains medical evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding. Nevertheless, employer contends that evidence was incredible, as a matter of law, because these doctors did not have claimant\u2019s full medical history regarding his psychiatric and substance abuse problems. Employer argues its expert did have this knowledge and, therefore, was credible. This argument neglects the standard of review used on appeal. Employer claims <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Bowman, </em>229 Va. 249, 329 S.E.2d 15 (1985), and <em>Sneed v. Morengo, Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 199, 450 S.E.2d 167 (1994), necessitate a different approach to the evidence in this case. We find these cases are distinguishable from the instant case and do not change the traditional standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In <em>Clinchfield Coal, </em>the only medical expert, Dr. McIlwain, initially opined that the employee\u2019s knee injury was related to a 1978 workplace accident. 229 Va. at 250-51, 329 S.E.2d at 16. However, this opinion was made before Dr. McIlwain reviewed the employee\u2019s prior medical records, which included a 1975 knee injury. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 329 S.E.2d at 16. After reviewing those records, the doctor concluded the new complaints arose from the previous, non-workplace injury. Dr. McIlwain noted in his second report that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201cthis patient\u2019s symptomatic complaints about his right knee which ultimately led to the surgery I performed on him were the same complaints from 1975 to the present. Obviously at any point along the way a new injury could have occurred but it would appear in the context of his previous complaints that he has been experiencing a continuation of the 1975 injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_T\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Id. </em>The Court noted that Dr. McIlwain\u2019s earlier statement was \u201cmere opinion that the condition may have resulted from the accident [and] is not sufficient\u201d to support the commission\u2019s finding of causation. <em>Id. </em>Further, the Court explained, \u201cThis is not a case where the Commission simply resolves a doctor\u2019s conflicting evidence. Here, ... the treating physician rendered but one opinion based upon the facts. His original assumption rested upon a faulty premise, and the Commission erred in attributing any weight to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 329 S.E.2d at 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In the case before this Court, the treating physicians did not revise their opinions, but consistently related claimant\u2019s depression to his compensable injury. Employer claims these doctors did not have his full medical history; therefore, their opinions are not credible. However, <em>Clinchfield Coal </em>does not stand for the proposition that doctors must have the entire medical history of an individual before they can state a valid opinion about the cause of a condition. Instead, <em>Clinchfield Coal </em>requires that the commission ignore an earlier, \u201cmere opinion\u201d by an expert who revises and rejects that earlier opinion in favor of a new opinion which is based on a more complete review of the facts in the case. In this case, the doctors did not state \u201cassumptions\u201d initially, but instead made clear statements that claimant\u2019s depression was caused by this compensable injury. The doctors were not asked to and did not review the additional records that employer suggests were necessary to reach this conclusion. The doctors never rejected their statements on causation. <em>Clinchfield Coal </em>does not apply to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Additionally, the record does not support employer\u2019s allegations that the doctors did not examine crucial medical records. While an initial intake sheet did indicate claimant had \u201cno\u201d prior psychiatric history, the letters and later medical records indicate Drs. Brooks and Shield were aware of at least some of the treatment claimant underwent for psychiatric and drug problems. Dr. Kernodle, a colleague of Drs. Brooks and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Shield, indicated in a report that claimant had been hospitalized at Central State and had a history of substance abuse. A letter from Dr. Shield indicates that he knew claimant was treated at a psychiatric hospital and that his family had a history of psychiatric disorders. These doctors do not indicate that they needed additional information on claimant\u2019s psychiatric history to reach a conclusion regarding the causation of his depression. <em>Contrast Howell Metal Co. v. Adams, </em>35 Va.App. 184, 543 S.E.2d 629 (2001) (finding the commission erred in accepting the evidence as sufficient to meet a claimant\u2019s burden where all of the physicians who suggested Adams\u2019s disorder was related to his compensable injury also indicated that they needed more information on his prior mental state to reach a credible conclusion about causation). Even Dr. Levenson,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who employer argues had access to all of claimant\u2019s medical records, stated, \u201cthe injury may have been a contributing factor in [claimant\u2019s] recent bout of depression.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The record in this case does not suggest that claimant had ongoing problems with depression at the time of the compensable accident. In fact, the record suggests these problems were resolved, as claimant\u2019s last psychiatric treatment was in 1997, three years prior to his foot injury. Nothing suggests, as it did in <em>Clinchfield Coal, </em>that claimant\u2019s depression prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>lem was a continuing complaint unaffected by the workplace accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Likewise, <em>Sneed </em>does not support employer\u2019s position. In that case, this Court interpreted <em>Clinchfield Coal </em>as standing for the principle that \u201c[w]henever a physician\u2019s diagnosis flows from an assumption that <em>rests upon a faulty premise, such as misinformation provided by a claimant, </em>the commission <em>may refuse, </em>and often will be required to refuse, to attribute any weight to that opinion.\u201d <em>Sneed, </em>19 Va.App. at 205, 450 S.E.2d at 171 (emphasis added). This Court noted, \u201c[significantly, Sneed conceded ... he did not recall telling any of his treating physicians of his long history of physical and psychological problems____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, many of these problems were intervening factors, occurring between the time of the accident and the development of the disability. <em>Id. </em>at 201-08, 450 S.E.2d at 168-70. Finally, <em>Sneed affirmed </em>the commission\u2019s decision to disregard the opinion of Sneed\u2019s doctor. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 450 S.E.2d at 171. Under our standard of review, the Court deferred to the commission\u2019s determination as to the credibility of the evidence and found no error as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Here, in contrast, the commission found the treating physicians credible, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">The medical record reflects that the claimant has undergone extensive psychiatric treatment in the past. We recognize that he has been treated in the past for depression. The claimant\u2019s treating physicians, Dr. Shield and Dr. Brooks, have related his depression to the compensable injury. Considering their actual treatment of the claimant, we agree that their opinions are persuasive. Dr. Levenson only evaluated him on one occasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The evidence supports this finding. Even if Drs. Shield and Brooks did not have access to all of claimant\u2019s medical records from 1997 and before, their opinions are not incredible. The record does not indicate claimant lied to his doctors or that the doctors had rejected their earlier opinions and determined claimant\u2019s accident had no relationship to his current depres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>sion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nothing in the medical testimony suggested they believed more information on claimant\u2019s background was necessary before stating an opinion on causation. The commission found this evidence as credible and gave it significant weight in its decision. On appeal, we defer to the commission\u2019s determinations regarding the weight of the evidence. <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Honaker, </em>9 Va.App. 336, 339-40, 388 S.E.2d 271, 272-73 (1990). We find the commission properly exercised its authority to determine which opinions were credible and which opinions should be weighed more heavily in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">II. Compensability of SCS</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Claimant has complained of significant pain from his injury. He has both recurring pain directly from the injury and from arthritis that has developed in this foot as a result of the injury and its treatment. Several doctors diagnosed claimant as having complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Claimant received some physical therapy and underwent two lumbar sympathetic block treatments from Dr. Long, receiving some relief from both types of treatment. Dr. Jones, claimant\u2019s orthopedist, referred him to Dr. Decker after these treatments were attempted. Dr. Jones sent a letter to Dr. Decker explaining claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Dr. Decker recommended a SCS implant as a means to resolve claimant\u2019s CRPS. Dr. Rubin, who reviewed claimant\u2019s records, indicated, \u201cA spinal cord [sjtimulator is certainly appropriate for RSD/CRPS of the lower extremity.\u201d He did express concerns that the implant might not eliminate all the sources of claimant\u2019s pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Employer argues the SCS is \u201cunreasonable and medically unnecessary.\u201d Employer quotes the sentence of Dr. Rubin\u2019s statement, which notes that the SCS will not affect claimant\u2019s arthritic condition. Employer also contends claimant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>exhaust all more conventional therapies for pain relief before he can be compensated for SCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Employer does not cite any legal authority for the proposition that all conventional therapies must be tried before an employee can receive compensation for a more radical or innovative treatment. Additionally, claimant tried the more conventional therapy, although he did not complete it. His treating physician, who received information from Dr. Long after he attempted the lumbar sympathetic block treatments, concluded claimant would benefit most from the SCS implant.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Two doctors concluded claimant should receive the SCS. Employer offered no medical testimony to rebut this conclusion. Although Dr. Rubin said he believed the SCS would not resolve claimant\u2019s arthritis, he also said it was \u201ccertainly appropriate for RSD/CRPS of the lower extremity.\u201d Dr. Decker concluded the SCS was \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d Although claimant did not complete the lumbar sympathetic blocks, his attempt to undergo this treatment went badly. The commission could reasonably conclude claimant was not an appropriate candidate for that treatment based on the incidents surrounding this attempt and on Dr. Decker\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We cannot find as a matter of law that the commission erred in its factual findings, and we affirm the award to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">. At various points, claimant has argued the original award covered these issues, contending employer disobeyed an existing order of the commission by refusing to pay for these treatments, and has argued that he applied for a change of condition hearing with the commission in order to include these treatments in the award. The commission labels claimant\u2019s actions as a \"Claim[ ] for Benefits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">. While the deputy commissioner denied claimant\u2019s various requests for compensation related to other consequential injuries, he did not appeal those decisions to the full commission and does not raise them on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">. Dr. Levenson did not treat claimant. He simply reviewed the records at the request of employer. All of the other physicians did treat claimant at some point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">. The complete sentence in Dr. Levenson\u2019s report reads, \"While the injury may have been a contributing factor in his recent bout of depression, I do not believe it was a cause.\u201d This statement seems contradictory on its face, as a contributing factor is a cause. <em>See Henrico County Sch. Bd. v. Etter, </em>36 Va.App. 437, 446-47, 552 S.E.2d 372, 376 (2001) (\"The extent or degree to which the work-related cause contributed is not important. It matters only that the work-related cause contributed in some part to claimant\u2019s disability. <em>See Ford Motor Co. v. Hunt, 26 </em>Va.App. 231, 237-38, 494 S.E.2d 152, 155 (1997) (applying \u2018two causes\u2019 rule even though claimant\u2019s treating physician opined that disability was \u2018mainly\u2019 caused by non-work-related condition). Thus, under the 'two causes\u2019 rule, full benefits are allowed for claimant's disability.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">.
