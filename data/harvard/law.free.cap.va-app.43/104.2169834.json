Allman (appellant) appeals from his bench trial conviction for making an obscene telephone call with an intent to coerce, intimidate or harass in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-427. On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to prove his language was obscene or that he acted with the requisite intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was insufficient to prove his language was obscene. Thus, we reverse and dismiss his conviction without considering whether he acted with an intent to harass.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">At the time of the events upon which the instant charges are based, appellant operated a small trash company in Fair-fax County. One of appellant\u2019s competitors was a company called Triple A Trash, operated by Republic Services Incorporated (Republic). As part of appellant\u2019s advertising, he \u201ctarget[ed] [Republic] as [a] competitor\u201d and described Republic\u2019s fees as a \u201crip off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Appellant filed a civil action against Republic in the Fairfax County Circuit Court. Republic was represented in that action by Richmond attorney Douglas Nabhan. Nabhan filed a demurrer on Republic\u2019s behalf. Appellant contacted Nabhan seeking Nabhan\u2019s agreement to allow appellant to amend his motion for judgment to correct the defect challenged by the demurrer. By letter faxed to appellant on October 15, 2002, Nabhan refused to agree to appellant\u2019s request, indicating his client preferred to allow the court to rule on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">On October 25, an associate from the Fairfax office of Nabhan\u2019s law firm appeared in court to argue the demurrer. Appellant had \u201cexpect[ed] Mr. Nabhan to come argue the motion as to the demurrer.\u201d The court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, and appellant noted an appeal to the Supreme Court that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">On October 28, 2002, appellant telephoned Nabhan at his office and left a message on Nabhan\u2019s voice mail. The message contained numerous unflattering characterizations of Nabhan, referring to him as \u201ca pussy\u201d or \u201cpuss\u201d twenty times, and lasted approximately six minutes. Appellant\u2019s repeated use of the word, \u201cpussy,\u201d included references to female excretory functions. Appellant indicated his belief that Nabhan must be \u201csquatting to pee\u201d in \u201cthe ladies room\u201d of his law firm \u201c[be]cause [appellant believed Nabhan] is such a pussy.\u201d Appellant indicated he would send Nabhan\u2019s copy of his notice of appeal to the attention of the ladies\u2019 room at Nabhan\u2019s firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>because \u201cI know that\u2019s where you hang out all the time, because you are such a big pussy.\u201d Appellant said Nabhan should become more masculine and courageous by \u201cgrow[ing] a set of balls\u201d and said that, even if Nabhan \u201c[grew] a set of balls,\u201d left the ladies\u2019 room, and \u201cstart[ed] lifting weights,\u201d Nabhan would still need twelve to twenty other attorneys to accompany him to oral argument before the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Appellant was charged and tried for the instant offense. Testifying in his own behalf, appellant claimed his intent in calling Nabhan was merely \u201cto notify [Nabhan] that [appellant] had filed [his] appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u201d He admitted leaving the message he did was \u201can error in ... judgment\u201d and that he \u201cprobably should have been a little more gentlemanly.\u201d Appellant said he chose the words that he did because he \u201cjust really wanted [Nabhan] to know what I thought of him. I thought he was a sissy. I didn\u2019t appreciate the way things had taken place so far in the litigation. He doesn\u2019t like me and I don\u2019t like him.\u201d Appellant conceded that he could have informed Nabhan he had noted an appeal of the dismissal of the suit in seven or fewer sentences in a message lasting ten to twenty seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The court convicted appellant of the charged offense, reasoning in relevant part as follows: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether [the language] is obscene, vulgar, profane, or lewd, but I believe the use of the words in conjunction with the male anatomy along with the references to the bathroom, and all the context that it\u2019s used in certainly fits within the definition of those terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-427 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">\n<em>Use of profane, threatening or indecent language over public airways</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>If any person shall use obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, over any telephone or citizens band radio, in this Commonwealth, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Code \u00a7 18.1-238 was the predecessor to Code \u00a7 18.2-427. Code \u00a7 18.1-238 provided that \u201cIf any person shall curse or abuse anyone, or use vulgar, profane, threatening or indecent language over any telephone in this state, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d In <em>Walker v. Dillard, </em>523 F.2d 3 (4th Cir.1975), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held Code \u00a7 18.1-238 was facially overbroad. Thereafter, the legislature amended the statute to include its present language. <em>See </em>1976 Va. Acts ch. 312 (recodifying statute at \u00a7 18.2-427); <em>see also </em>1984 Va. Acts ch. 592 (amending statute to include use of such language over citizens band radio).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In <em>Perkins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 7, 14-15, 402 S.E.2d 229, 233-34 (1991), we considered a claim that the amended statute, codified at \u00a7 18.2-427, was unconstitutionally overbroad. In order to avoid such a finding, we interpreted \u201cthe phrase, \u201cwith the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass\u2019 as applying to the use of \u2018obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 402 S.E.2d at 233. We also concluded, \u201c[i]n view of the legislature\u2019s amendments to the statute following the decision in <em>Walker, </em>that the legislature [both (1) ] intended to address harassing conduct as the evil to be proscribed and [ (2) ] intended to narrow the scope of the speech phrases to that which is obscene.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>also Walker, </em>523 F.2d at 5-6 (noting words \u201cvulgar,\u201d \u201cprofane\u201d and \u201cindecent\u201d are \u201ccapable of overbroad interpretation\u201d but that when used with \u201cmore specific adjectives\u201d like \u201cobscene,\u201d \u201clewd,\u201d and \u201clascivious,\u201d rules of statutory construction allow the overbroad \u201cgeneral words [to be] restricted to [meanings] that are analogous to the more specific words\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Neither Code \u00a7 18.2-427 nor the chapter or article in which it appears\u2014Chapter 8, Article 5, of Title 18.2\u2014contains a definition of the word \u201cobscene.\u201d However, in interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 77, 79, 441 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1994) (quoting <em>King v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986))).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-372\u2014contained in a different chapter of Title 18.2\u2014defines the word, \u201cobscene,\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqU\">that [1] which, considered as a whole, has as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, excretory functions or products thereof or sadomasochistic abuse, and [2] which goes substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and [3] which, taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u201cTo be obscene, conduct must violate contemporary community standards of sexual candor.\u201d <em>Copeland v.

However, \u201cthe [appellate] court ... functions as a constitutional gatekeeper,\u201d by determining whether the speech \u201cqualifies as possibly obscene____ In other words, the appellate court must make an independent review of the first two prongs, but the question to be asked is not whether the materials <em>are </em>obscene, but, rather, whether the materials <em>create a jury issue </em>as to obscenity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Smith v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 291, 305-06, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1766, 52 L.Ed.2d 324 (1977); <em>Jenkins v.

Under any \u201ccontemporary community standards of sexual candor,\u201d the statement, \u201cconsidered as a whole,\u201d neither (1) \u201cha[d] as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, excretory functions or products thereof or sadomasochistic abuse,\u201d nor(2) \u201c[went] substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-372.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The word, \u201cpussy,\u201d is defined by <em>Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>as <em>\u201cvulg[ar] slang\u201d </em>for either (1) the female genitals or (2) sexual intercourse. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>1571 (2d ed.1998); <em>see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1849 (1981). However, as appellant argues, appellant used the word \u201cpussy\u201d in the context of his voice mail message to Nabhan merely to characterize Nabhan as \u201ca weak, cowardly or ... effeminate man.\u201d Appellant\u2019s use of the word, \u201cpussy,\u201d \u201cnever made any reference to a sexual act\u201d and had \u201cno sexual connotations attached to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">It is true that appellant\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201cpussy\u201d included references to female excretory functions. Appellant indicated his belief that Nabhan must be \u201csquatting to pee\u201d in \u201cthe ladies room\u201d \u201c[be]cause [appellant believed Nabhan] is such a pussy.\u201d Appellant indicated he would send Nabhan\u2019s copy of his notice of appeal to the attention of the ladies\u2019 room at Nabhan\u2019s firm because \u201cI know that\u2019s where you hang out all the time, because you are such a big pussy.\u201d Appellant said Nabhan should become more masculine and courageous by \u201cgrow[ing] a set of balls\u201d and said that, even if Nabhan \u201c[grew] a set of balls,\u201d left the ladies\u2019 room, and \u201cstart[ed] lifting weights,\u201d Nabhan would still need twelve to twenty other attorneys to accompany him to oral argument before the Supreme Court. These references to \u201cexcretory functions or products thereof,\u201d though utterly tasteless and rude, merely served to emphasize appellant\u2019s belief in Nabhan\u2019s cowardice. <em>Cf. Yeagle v.

They do not establish that the message, <em>\u201cconsidered as a whole,\u201d </em>either (1) <em>\u201c[had] as its dominant theme </em>... an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, ... excretory functions or products thereof\u2019 or (2) <em>went \u201csubstantially beyond the customary limits of candor </em>in description or representation of such matters.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-372 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Thus, we hold as a matter of law that appellant\u2019s language was not obscene.

On appeal to this Court, Perkins contended only that Code \u00a7 18.2-427 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 402 S.E.2d at 231. He argued it was (1) unconstitutionally overbroad because (a) it does not require any criminal <em>mens rea </em>and (b) criminalizes a threat to destroy even one's own property and (2) unconstitutionally vague because \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>uncertain ... exactly what conduct is prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16, 402 S.E.2d at 234.
