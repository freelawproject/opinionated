The Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund contends the commission erred in finding that the Fund\u2019s unilateral suspension of Peters\u2019s benefits on September 27, 2001 was arbitrary and erred in levying a penalty of three months of benefits against the Fund. By cross-appeal, Peters contends the commission incorrectly suspended his benefits after finding that the Fund failed to comply with Code \u00a7 65.2-510.1 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>it improperly and prematurely terminated his benefits in violation of Rule 1.4(C). We hold that the commission erred in terminating Peters\u2019s benefits as of December 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The essential facts are undisputed. Peters suffered a compensable injury December 21, 1993, which resulted in several awards of benefits. On September 12, 2001, the commission entered an award in favor of Peters that required the Fund to pay temporary partial disability benefits at the weekly rate of $226.27, beginning February 27, 2001 and continuing. By letter dated September 28, 2001, Peters\u2019s attorney notified the Fund that he had recently learned Peters was incarcerated and that he had \u201cno other details at this time.\u201d Without seeking an order from the commission, the Fund ceased paying Peters his benefits. A later letter from Peters\u2019s attorney\u2019s office on October 12, 2001 notified the Fund that \u201cPeters advised ... he was incarcerated on September 27, 2001, \u201d that they \u201canticipate^] ... he will be released shortly,\u201d and that they will \u201ckeep [the Fund] posted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">A senior claims examiner at the commission notified the Fund on June 20, 2002 that the commission\u2019s records indicated an award was outstanding and that the commission assumes payments are continuing. The letter also advised that if \u201cpayments have ceased, an executed Termination of Wage Loss Award or an Employer\u2019s Application for Hearing must be filed to end the award.\u201d The record does not reveal any response from the Fund to this letter; however, in October 2002, the Fund and Peters\u2019s attorney exchanged correspondence regarding Peters. The Fund sent to Peters\u2019s attorney a proposed stipulation to terminate the award, which was not returned by Peters or his attorney. On February 28, 2003, the Fund filed an application for hearing to suspend Peters\u2019s benefits, noting that it had paid compensation through September 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The deputy commissioner found that the Fund delayed filing an application for hearing based upon the representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>that Peters would be soon released from incarceration and that Peters waited a year and a half before complaining about the suspension of benefits. Based primarily on these factors, the deputy commissioner ruled that \u201c[a] manifest injustice would result ... [if Peters was] unjustly enriched by the payment of an additional eighteen months of compensation benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The deputy commissioner also found that the Fund \u201cviolated the body and spirit of the act\u201d by arbitrarily suspending Peters\u2019s benefits without filing an application. Finding that \u201cthe policy of Rule 1.4 is overridden by the windfall that will result from its strict application,\u201d the deputy commissioner ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">We will order the [Fund] to pay an additional three months of compensation benefits, and suspend the outstanding award as of December 27, 2001. In this manner, we limit the claimant\u2019s windfall to three months of benefits. We also punish the [Fund] for its negligence in failing to file a timely application and for its unilateral and arbitrary suspension of benefits by, in effect, imposing a penalty of three months of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On review, the commission noted that Code \u00a7 65.2-510.1 did not give the Fund \u201cthe unilateral right to cease paying compensation benefits [due] to a disabled employee under an outstanding award\u201d and also noted that \u201cRule 1.4(C) operates as a method of policing the \u2018tendency of employers and insurers to terminate first and litigate later.\u2019 \u201d The commission found, however, that Peters would be unjustly enriched by strictly enforcing Rule 1.4(C) and \u201cthat the parties reasonably expected [Peters\u2019s] award to be suspended due to his incarceration.\u201d The commission then ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">[W]e previously recognized that there may ... be [a] case where it would be appropriate, when applying the equitable concept of imposition, to penalize an employer/carrier for the unilateral action of terminating compensation by requiring the employer/carrier to pay compensation beyond the date that compensation could have been properly terminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ed if the employer/earrier had filed a timely application. <em>See Merino v. Dittmar Company/Tyson Westpark Hotel, </em>VWC File No. 143-57-63 (1995). We find this to be such a case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-4\">Here, the Fund stopped paying benefits to the claimant immediately after being advised of the claimant\u2019s incarceration and before it received more information regarding the nature and duration of the claimant\u2019s imprisonment. In its position statement filed for consideration of the Deputy Commissioner, the Fund asserted that it had been \u201clulled by a suggested early release, and then it was forgotten\u201d\u2014 implying that it intended to wait until receiving more information regarding the claimant\u2019s information before submitting the appropriate documentation to the Commission. However, the Fund had no right to stop paying the claimant compensation until after it had already filed its application, and we agree with the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the Fund\u2019s decision to immediately terminate benefits was \u201carbitrary\u201d\u2014particularly when, as here, counsel for the claimant initially advised the Fund that he did not believe the claimant would be imprisoned for a substantial length of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the Deputy Commissioner did not err by requiring the employer to pay temporary partial disability compensation to the claimant through to December 27, 2001, such benefits to be paid by the Fund with the right to indemnification from the uninsured employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Both the Fund and Peters appealed from these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 65.2-510.1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">A. Whenever an employee is imprisoned in a jail, state correctional facility, or any other place of incarceration and (i) the imprisonment resulted from the employee\u2019s conviction of a criminal offense and followed his sentencing therefor by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) the employee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>receiving compensation for temporary total incapacity pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-500 or temporary partial incapacity under \u00a7 65.2-502, and (iii) the employee is medically released to perform selective employment, compensation benefits for wage loss shall be suspended under \u00a7 65.2-708 upon filing of a proper application to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">B. If benefits are suspended for incarceration pursuant to this section and the employee\u2019s conviction is subsequently reversed on appeal and no further appeals or prosecutions concerning such prior conviction are had, the employee\u2019s benefits shall be restored under \u00a7 65.2-708 upon filing of a proper application to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Commission Rule 1.4 governs the filing of applications for hearing. It requires, absent certain exceptions not applicable here, that an employer filing an application for a hearing based on a change in condition must pay \u201c[c]ompensation ... through the date the application was filed.\u201d Rule 1.4(C). On numerous occasions, we have noted that the commission enacted Rule 1.4(C) to control the tendency of some employers and insurers to unilaterally terminate awards and litigate later. <em>See Odin, Inc. v. Price, </em>23 Va.App. 66, 72, 474 S.E.2d 162,164 (1996); <em>Specialty Auto Body v. Cook, </em>14 Va.App. 327, 330, 416 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1992). The object of this salutary rule is to limit that tendency, but the rule also has the secondary effect of protecting the sanctity of the commission\u2019s awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The general principle is well established that an employee becomes vested with the right to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits under an award in his favor so long as the award remains outstanding. <em>Sargent Electric Company v. Woodall, </em>228 Va. 419, 425, 323 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1984). Equally well established is the principle that the commission\u2019s rules are \u201cbinding in law upon the parties and the Commission as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 323 S.E.2d at 105. These principles are of long standing and are designed to eliminate unilateral failures to comply with awards.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">The employer and the insurance carrier were charged with knowledge of the rule, and the harsh result here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>complained of is of their own making. It is brought about by their failure or refusal to make application for a hearing ... [when] claimant resumed work.... Instead of filing for a hearing on the ground of a change of condition they took the matter into their own hands and terminated the compensation payments in the face of the pre-existing award. The rule was adopted to require prompt payment of compensation to all claimants entitled thereto. One of its purposes was to eliminate the result which took place in this case, that is, the arbitrary discontinuance of compensation by the employer and the insurance carrier without legal sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><em>Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co. v. Parker, </em>201 Va. 328, 331-32, 111 S.E.2d 453, 456 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">An example of the application of these principles is found in <em>Woodall, </em>where an employee returned to work for his preinjury employer at an average weekly wage higher than his pre-injury wage. 228 Va. at 422, 323 S.E.2d at 104. The deputy commissioner ruled that the employer unilaterally terminated the award and, therefore, assessed a penalty against the employer and benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 323 S.E.2d at 104. The employer appealed, \u201crequesting that the award be modified by deleting benefits and penalties for those weeks in which Woodall earned in excess of his pre-injury average weekly wage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The commission upheld the award \u201con the ground that the carrier\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 13 [the predecessor to Rule 1.4] was the reason the award remained outstanding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423, 323 S.E.2d at 104. Affirming the commission\u2019s award, the Supreme Court held in <em>Woodall </em>that an employer cannot complain about the harshness of the result of the commission\u2019s rules if the employer\u2019s failure to follow the rules leads to that result. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 323 S.E.2d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Without reference to these principles, the commission in this case \u201capplied the equitable doctrine of imposition when concluding that [Peters] was not entitled to temporary partial compensation through February 28, 2003\u2014the date that the Fund filed its application to suspend [Peters\u2019s] outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>temporary partial award.\u201d <em>See Harris v. Diamond Constr. Co., </em>184 Va. 711, 720, 36 S.E.2d 573, 577 (1946) (holding that the commission has \u201cjurisdiction to do full and complete justice in each case,\u201d and, thus, recognizing that \u201cthe commission [has] the power and authority not only to make and enforce its awards, but to protect itself and its awards from fraud, imposition and mistake\u201d). The record is undisputed, however, that the Fund unilaterally ceased paying Peters temporary partial disability benefits in contravention of Rule 1.4(C). The commission found that the Fund did so on September 28, 2001 after receiving a letter from Peters\u2019s attorney informing it that Peters was incarcerated. Nevertheless, citing several of this Court\u2019s opinions, including <em>Washington v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., </em>39 Va.App. 772, 576 S.E.2d 791 (2003), and <em>Lam v. Kawneer Co., Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 515, 566 S.E.2d 874 (2002), the commission ruled that Peters would be unjustly enriched because \u201che no longer suffered a wage loss related to his compensable injury\u201d and that the Fund\u2019s failure to comply with the Rule could be excused because \u201cthe parties reasonably expected the ... award to be suspended due to [Peters\u2019s] incarceration.\u201d We hold that this reasoning and the facts of this case do not support the use of the doctrine of imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The Supreme Court recently reversed our decision in <em>Washington </em>and discussed again the issue of an employer unilaterally terminating benefits. <em>See Washington v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., </em>267 Va. 539, 593 S.E.2d 229 (2004). In that case, the employee had filed a \u201crequest to assess a 20% penalty against the employer\u2019s insurance carrier for its failure to pay the ... benefits as provided in an open award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 593 S.E.2d at 230. Addressing the penalty issue, the Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-524, dealing with payment of workers\u2019 compensation, provides, as pertinent, that \u201c[i]f any payment is not paid within two weeks after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to twenty percent thereof____\u201d Commission Rule 1.4(C)(1) requires compensation to be paid through the date an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>er\u2019s application for a hearing is filed unless \u201c[t]he application alleges the employee returned to work, in which case payment shall be made to the date of the return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\">... [T]he carrier failed to file a change in condition application with the Commission alleging the claimant had returned to work and requesting termination of the ... open award. Rather, the carrier unilaterally terminated payment of benefits after it learned that the claimant had returned to work without restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">... [T]he relevant statutes do not give an employer or carrier the unilateral right to cease paying compensation benefits to a disabled employee under an outstanding award, when that employee returns to work and the employer or carrier does not file an application or agreed statement of facts along with a supplemental memorandum of agreement.... [T]he \u201claudable purpose\u201d of the foregoing Commission rule ... [is] a method of policing the tendency of employers and carriers to terminate first and litigate later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 545, 593 S.E.2d at 232 (citations omitted). Holding that the doctrine of imposition was improperly applied, the Court reversed the commission\u2019s refusal to assess a 20% penalty and ruled that the award of benefits remained valid. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47, 593 S.E.2d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Although the commission correctly noted our observation in <em>Lam </em>that \u201c[i]t is \u2018neither logical, reasonable, nor within the spirit of the Act\u2019 to award benefits when a worker is not entitled to them,\u201d 38 Va.App. at 518, 566 S.E.2d at 875-76 (citation omitted), we made that observation in the context of a record which proved the worker \u201cneglected to comply with [a] notice requirement\u201d of the Act and the employer had not \u201cflaunted the Commission\u2019s requirements\u201d as prescribed by the rules. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 566 S.E.2d at 876. Recently, in <em>Genesis Health Ventures, Inc. v. Pugh, </em>42 Va.App. 297, 591 S.E.2d 706 (2004), we explained the rationale for our decision in <em>Lam. </em>In the following passage, we quote extensively from <em>Pugh </em>to reiterate that rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Notwithstanding its clear violation of the commission\u2019s rule, [the employer] contends that our <em>Lam </em>decision required the commission to disregard [the employer\u2019s] failure to comply with the rules. We disagree with [the employer\u2019s] reading of <em>Lam.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">Unlike Pugh, who returned to work for ... her pre-injury employer, Lam did not return to work for his pre-injury employer. Highlighting the circumstance of Lam\u2019s return to work for another employer, we noted that when \u201cthe insurer requested [Lam] to provide the name of his current employer, the date he started working, and copies of his pay stubs ... [, Lam] did not respond.\u201d 38 Va.App. at 517, 566 S.E.2d at 875. Lam\u2019s failure to respond to the request was a significant factor in the commission\u2019s decision for three reasons. First, the employer\u2019s \u201capplication for [a hearing to] terminate] ... benefits must be based on documentation \u2018sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to believe [the] ... grounds for relief are meritorious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519 n. 3, 566 S.E.2d at 876 n. 3. Because Lam\u2019s employer lacked specific information about where he was employed and his rate of pay, the employer had insufficient documentation to support its application. Second, Lam \u201cdid not dispute that he neglected to comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 65.2-712.\u201d <em>Lam, </em>38 Va.App. at 519, 566 S.E.2d at 876. In pertinent part, this statute imposes upon an employee \u201ca duty immediately to disclose to the employer ... [the employee\u2019s] return to work\u201d and authorizes the commission to remedy a breach of that duty. Code \u00a7 65.2-712. Third, in <em>Lam </em>the employer sought information from Lam that would have permitted it, had Lam cooperated, to timely file an agreement to terminate the award. Thus, the commission found no evidence to suggest the employer had \u201cflaunted\u201d the rules by its delay. 38 Va.App. at 519, 566 S.E.2d at 876.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 300, 591 S.E.2d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">As in <em>Pugh, </em>the Fund had sufficient information to support an application for hearing in this case but, instead, unilaterally terminated compensation benefits it was required to pay un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>der an outstanding award contrary to the commission\u2019s rules. Similar to the circumstances in <em>Pugh, </em>the Fund also later failed to file an application for hearing after receiving notice from the commission inquiring about the outstanding award. On the other hand, the record contained no evidence that Peters violated any duty required of him by the commission\u2019s rules or the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">It is true that, if the Fund had complied with the commission\u2019s rules after the Fund learned of Peters\u2019s incarceration, the compensation payments to Peters could have been properly terminated pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-510.1. It does not follow from this proposition that the commission could invoke the doctrine of imposition, reasoning \u201cthat the parties reasonably expected the ... award to be suspended due to his incarceration\u201d and that Peters \u201cdid not deny that his award was subject to suspension due to his incarceration.\u201d Imposition cannot be invoked to reward a party who blatantly contravenes the Act\u2019s requirements on the rationale that the outcome would have been the same if the Act\u2019s requirements had been followed. The commission\u2019s \u201cadoption of ... rules [for carrying out the provisions of the Act] is a legislative act, and the enactment is binding in law upon the parties and the Commission as well.\u201d <em>Woodall, </em>228 Va. at 424, 323 S.E.2d at 105. Thus, the commission\u2019s authority to do full and complete justice must be exercised \u201c[w]ithin the principles established by statutes and rules construing them.\u201d <em>Avon Products, Inc. v. Ross, </em>14 Va.App. 1, 7, 415 S.E.2d 225, 228 (1992). One of the purposes of Rule 1.4 was to eliminate the result which took place in this case, the pattern of terminating benefits and litigating later. <em>See Washington, </em>267 Va. at 545, 593 S.E.2d at 232; <em>Woodall, </em>228 Va. at 424, 323 S.E.2d at 104; <em>Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co., </em>201 Va. at 331-32, 111 S.E.2d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Upon entry of the temporary partial disability award, Peters \u201cbecame vested with the right to receive compensation benefits so long as the award remained outstanding\u201d and he violated no duty imposed by the commission\u2019s rules and the Act. <em>Woodall, </em>228 Va. at 425, 323 S.E.2d at 105. For these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>reasons, we hold that the commission improperly invoked the doctrine of imposition to uphold the Fund\u2019s unilateral suspension of benefits in violation of Rule 1.4(C). Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s ruling that the Fund was only required \u201cto pay temporary partial disability compensation to [Peters] through December 27, 2001,\u201d and we remand to the commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
