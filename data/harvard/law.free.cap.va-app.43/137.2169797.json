Artis (claimant) appeals a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) denying his claim for temporary partial disability benefits following his termination from selective employment provided by Ottenberg\u2019s Bakers, Inc. (employer). Claimant contends the commission erred in finding that he failed to prove his post-termination wage loss was attributable to his compensable work-related psychiatric disorder. We agree and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. On October 2, 1999, claimant was employed as a route salesman for employer. On that day, at approximately 3:45 a.m., while en route in a delivery truck to one of employer\u2019s customers, claimant came upon an apparent \u201croad rage\u201d incident on Interstate 66 in Fairfax County. Several people involved in the incident exited their vehicles and ran across the highway in front of claimant\u2019s truck. The last person attempting to cross the highway darted directly in the path of claimant\u2019s vehicle. Although claimant attempted to avoid hitting that person, he was unable to do so. Claimant\u2019s vehicle struck and killed the individual. Claimant, who was in a \u201cdaze\u201d and hyperventilating after the accident, called employer to report the accident. He informed employer\u2019s representative that he was too distraught to finish his shift, but was told he had to because employer had no one available to replace him. Claimant finished his route, completed his paperwork, and drove himself home.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Claimant missed some work after the accident. He testified that, following the accident, he began to experience flashbacks and fear \u201cthat it would happen again\u201d and that he would be \u201cthought of as a killer.\u201d Those feelings, he testified, caused him to experience \u201cdepression to the point ... [he] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>suicidal.\u201d His children, he further testified, \u201cwanted to know why [he] was not getting out of bed or why [he] couldn\u2019t take them certain places.\u201d Eventually, claimant returned to work in a selective duty capacity, riding with other drivers at first and then driving different routes, sometimes with a co-driver along to assist him. Claimant testified he \u201cwas returned to full duty with the stipulation if I need help, ask the night manager and that would be provided, and that was refused on a few occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The medical records in this case indicate that, on October 4, 1999, claimant sought medical treatment for back pain at the Providence Hospital Wellness Institute. He was diagnosed with a thoracic strain and excused from work through October 10, 1999. As of October 21, 1999, claimant\u2019s back pain had resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On October 11, 1999, claimant returned to the Providence Hospital Wellness Institute for a follow-up evaluation. He reported that he was unable to drive and was suffering from emotional distress due to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">On October 12, 1999, claimant came under the care of Dr. Cecil Harris, a clinical psychologist, for his emotional problems stemming from the fatal accident, including flashbacks of the accident, fear of driving and crossing the street, anxiety attacks, feelings of being a killer, trouble sleeping and getting out of bed, and problems maintaining an erection. Claimant\u2019s initial mental status examination by Dr. Harris \u201crevealed a nervous, tense/anxious, depressed, agitated, phobic male who was fully oriented with sad, hopeless, and depressed affect, and depressed/irritable mood\u201d and who \u201cdenied suicidal and homicidal ideation and was having trouble containing paranoid, hostile, and violent urges secondary to his anxious, agitated feelings.\u201d Claimant indicated in his intake questionnaire with Dr. Harris that he had received prior psychological treatment for \u201crage\u201d in 1996 from Dr. Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Dr. Harris diagnosed claimant as suffering from \u201cPTSD\u201d (posttraumatic stress disorder) and \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood.\u201d Dr. Harris initi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ated a \u201ctreatment plan of twice weekly, or as needed psychotherapy.\u201d Claimant received \u201cgenerally weekly and sometimes bi-weekly\u201d counseling treatment from Dr. Harris through at least July 2000. As part of his treatment, claimant also took Zyprexa, which was provided, on Dr. Harris\u2019s referral, by Dr. Walker Lyerly. Dr. Harris recommended that, in returning to work as a delivery truck driver, claimant should initially ride with another driver, then have another driver ride with him, and ultimately, \u201cwhen ready,\u201d drive by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Dr. Harris saw claimant for treatment five more times in October 1999. On October 14, 1999, Dr. Harris wrote in his contemporaneous treatment notes that claimant was \u201cagain unable to drive to session\u201d and felt \u201cangry, hostile[,] resentful, critical [and] competitive.\u201d On October 19, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant \u201cpresented] [with] anxious, depressed affect.\u201d On October 22, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant \u201cpresented [with complaints of] \u2018difficulty falling asleep, depressed, unable to get up in morning and loss of interest in sex.\u2019 \u201d On October 25, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was \u201cback to work\u201d with a rider. He further noted that claimant was feeling a \u201clack of support from [employer].\u201d On October 26, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was feeling employer was unsupportive because \u201cthey think I\u2019m a killer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On November 1, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that, while claimant was \u201cmaking progress,\u201d he was \u201canxious [regarding his] driving/riding situation.\u201d Dr. Harris further noted that claimant was concerned employer was \u201cnot patient [with] him\u201d and that claimant had \u201c[f]ears [and] concerns [regarding his] ability to take care of his family.\u201d On November 15, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant had \u201cdifficulty sleeping [secondary to] recurrent intrusive thoughts[:] leaves him tired, irritable [and] depressed.\u201d On November 19, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was experiencing increased fear at work because he was now riding with another driver \u201cthrough D.C. traffic,\u201d but was \u201cvery pleased he was able to drive to [appointment with Dr. Harris] for first time using Beltway.\u201d On November 26, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was \u201cfeeling paranoid [regarding] job\u2019s support of his recovery efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>On December 17, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant had been \u201cserving as a co-driver since\u201d mid-November 1999 and driving with a co-driver since December 8, 1999. On December 23, 1999, Dr. Harris noted that claimant had \u201c[ijssues related to driving assignment, symptomatic behavior [and] anger [regarding] perceived lack of full support by [employer].\u201d On January 6, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was feeling \u201crage, agitation, depression and] hopeless[ness]\u201d and admitted \u201csome suicidal ideations.\u201d On January 13, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was driving \u201csolo,\u201d but continued \u201cto feel lack of support at\u201d work. On January 28, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was angry with \u201cH.R. Dir. B.W. [and] Plant Mgr. J.G. for lack of support\u201d because he was \u201cnot getting sick days approved\u201d for his therapy sessions and was \u201cassigned [a] route too difficult for his level of recovery at this time.\u201d On February 11, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant felt employer was not supporting him because it was pressuring him to schedule his medical appointments \u201con his days off\u2019 and was failing to pay sick leave. On February 15, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was \u201cstill angry\u201d and feeling \u201cset up\u201d to fail by employer. On February 18, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was \u201cfeeling better\u201d and slept the \u201clast few nights [with] no flashback of seeing accident victim run in front of vehicle in his dreams.\u201d Dr. Harris further noted that claimant had been riding with another driver on a new route to Baltimore and would be driving \u201csome on his own for next few months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In addition to documenting claimant\u2019s feelings that employer was not being supportive, Dr. Harris\u2019s treatment notes also contain several references to claimant\u2019s concerns about caring for his family. Throughout the sessions, Dr. Harris indicated in his notes that his treatment of claimant\u2019s condition consisted of providing \u201cventilation,\u201d encouragement, support, and reinforcement of claimant\u2019s strengths and progress, and focusing on claimant\u2019s troubles with problem solving, anger and stress management, and \u201cthought stopping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On March 3, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant, having begun driving the new route on his own, felt his symptoms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>were increasing and he was \u201ctaking a step backward.\u201d Dr. Harris further noted that claimant was thinking negative thoughts, including \u201cmore about violence,\u201d and was \u201cworried\u201d about his ability to control his anger. Dr. Harris also noted that claimant felt he would need a rider to assist him on his route. On April 7, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant\u2019s request for a rider was denied and claimant was having \u201c[i]ntrusive recollections of [a] man running in front of truck.\u201d On April 27, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was feeling \u201crage\u201d and was again feeling unsupported by employer. Dr. Harris further noted that claimant requested a change in his medication prescription and would \u201cterminate\u201d his current medication, pending referral to a medical doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On May 4, 2000, Dr. Harris noted claimant was upset because employer had assigned him to drive the route where the fatal accident had occurred on October 2, 1999, and insisted that he do so even though claimant explained to employer that he was \u201chaving trouble sleeping,\u201d was \u201chaving flashbacks,\u201d and was off his prescription medication at that point. Dr. Harris further noted that claimant was feeling \u201cpushed, trapped like [a] cornered animal [and] rage.\u201d That same day, Dr. Harris wrote to William Walker, employer\u2019s human resources director, stating that claimant was \u201cgreatly stressed and somewhat regressed, secondary to being scheduled to service the route where his accident occurred on October 2, 1999.\u201d Claimant, Dr. Harris wrote, \u201cis clinically not ready to service that particular route at this time. He has made much progress in his therapy and his rehabilitation is progressing well. It is however important that we continue to work closely together towards supporting his fuH recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On May 9, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant reported \u201csuicidal ideation\u201d and was feeling \u201cprovoked into his rageful feelings\u201d because employer was \u201cmessing\u201d with him. On June 1, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant had increased \u201cconfidence to move forward now [without] a rider,\u201d but also noted that claimant described himself as homicidal. On June 7, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant \u201cfeels he is coping [with] new route,\u201d but again noted claimant was experiencing symp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>toms, including homicidal feelings. On June 14, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant had been \u201cgiven a rider on Monday, which helped,\u201d but was told by the new dispatcher \u201cthat there would be no new approval for a new rider.\u201d Dr. Harris further noted that he would call or write employer regarding claimant\u2019s \u201cneed for a rider from time to time\u201d and that he recommended to claimant that he continue with his medication. Dr. Harris\u2019s June 14, 2000 report indicated that claimant was feeling homicidal and that claimant could not function at his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Claimant testified that, at the time, he blamed Walker for denying him a \u201cride along helper.\u201d Claimant further testified that he believed, at the time, that Walker \u201cwas operating to get [him] out of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On June 29, 2000, claimant \u201cfaked\u201d a robbery of the delivery truck he was driving and filed a false police report indicating he had been robbed of approximately $250. Claimant was arrested and subsequently pled guilty to the charge of filing a false police report. Following his arrest, claimant was fired by employer. Claimant subsequently procured a series of jobs with various other employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Claimant testified he faked the robbery and filed the false report because he expected Walker to respond to the scene of the reported robbery, at which time he intended to kill him. His intention at the time, claimant testified, was \u201cto do the same harm [to Walker that Walker] was doing to my family.\u201d He wanted to \u201cget even\u201d with Walker because Walker failed to adequately respond to his difficulties in performing his job after the October 2, 1999 accident. Claimant further testified that he staged the robbery attempt because \u201cthe bills were mounting\u201d and he was having difficulty with child support issues at the time because employer \u201cwas delinquent on [his] child support that was being taken out every week and not being sen[t].\u201d Claimant also testified that none of the factors that led to his wanting to kill Walker occurred prior to the October 2,1999 accident and that he had never before suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>symptoms similar to those he suffered as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">On July 18, 2000, Dr. Harris wrote a letter to claimant\u2019s union president, in which he summarized his diagnosis and treatment of claimant for \u201cPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\u201d and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">[Claimant] discussed in detail the incident of 06/29/00 in therapy. It is my opinion, based on the information I have, that [claimant\u2019s] involvement in this incident is related to his diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">On October 2, 2001, claimant filed a claim for benefits arising out of the accident on October 2, 1999. He alleged he \u201cinjured his back and suffered psychological injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder as a direct result\u201d of the compensable accident. Claimant sought medical benefits, an award of temporary total disability compensation from October 2, 1999, through December 17, 1999, and temporary partial disability compensation for various periods following the termination of his employment with employer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In responding to a questionnaire sent to him by claimant\u2019s counsel on September 24, 2002, Dr. Harris wrote that his \u201caccident-related diagnoses\u201d of claimant was \u201c(PTSD)\u2014Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\u2014chronic.\u201d Asked if the work restrictions placed on claimant\u2019s employment because of his accident-related condition were permanent, Dr. Harris noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">No, early return to driving alone was [and] is the goal. Periodically, depending on the situation there may be times when he may need to temporarily self-modify his own driving exposure. Consequently, he is not ready at this time to return to the type of driving he did at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>trauma. Over the course of our continued contact in his therapy off [and] on he has brief periods of higher level driving function followed by trauma-triggered dangerous aggressions in his driving skills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Asked to explain the basis for his conclusion that \u201cthe feigned robbery resulted directly from [claimant\u2019s] accident-related psychiatric condition,\u201d Dr. Harris further noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiv\">I still hold the opinion that the feigned robbery of 06/29/00 resulted directly from [claimant\u2019s] accident-related psychiatric condition. [Claimant] was still actively traumatized by his 10/02/99 fatality, on 06/29/00. He was also frustrated, angry, fearful and problem-solving very poorly at that time. He was sleep deprived [with] suicidal ideation as well. In his mind this was not an act of robbery, but one of symbolically regaining his loss of control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">At the December 9, 2002 evidentiary hearing before the deputy commissioner, employer stipulated that claimant had experienced a compensable accident arising out of and in the course of his employment on October 2, 1999, when he unavoidably struck and killed a pedestrian on the highway. Employer also acknowledged that there was some injury to claimant\u2019s back and some psychological injury resulting directly from that accident. Employer further agreed that some compensation was voluntarily paid and that \u201cpsychiatric treatment [was] authorized and paid for at least up until a certain point.\u201d Employer defended the claim on the grounds that claimant was not disabled in the nature or to the extent alleged, that there was no causal relationship between the injury by accident and the subsequent periods of disability alleged by claimant, and that claimant was not entitled to any partial disability compensation after he was terminated for cause from his employer-supplied selective duty employment on June 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In addition to the parties\u2019 stipulations, the evidence before the deputy commissioner consisted, in relevant part, of claimant\u2019s testimony and the reports and opinions of Dr. Harris regarding his treatment of claimant\u2019s psychological condition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Based on the parties\u2019 stipulations, the deputy commissioner found that claimant \u201cexperienced a compensable injury by accident on October 2, 1999, as alleged, resulting primarily in a post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d The deputy commissioner also determined that \u201cclaimant carried his burden of proving entitlement to temporary [total] disability compensation from October 4, 1999, through October 10,1999,\u201d only. The deputy commissioner further held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">We further conclude that the employer\u2019s termination of the claimant on June 29, 2000, based upon his fabrication of a robbery and the filing of a false police report, was for justified cause sufficient to permanently bar the claimant\u2019s entitlement to partial wage loss compensation thereafter.... We further conclude that the claimant\u2019s wage loss after June 29, 2000, is properly attributable to his own conduct, and not to any disability resulting from the October 2, 1999 injury by accident. We reach this conclusion notwithstanding Dr. Harris\u2019[s] opinion that on June 29, 2000, the claimant remained \u201cactively traumatized\u201d by the events of October 2, 1999, and that his action in feigning the robbery attempt was \u201cone of symbolically regaining his loss of control.\u201d To the extent the claimant then felt pressured by the employer to resume his normal work activities, a conclusion we doubt based upon our assessment of the claimant\u2019s credibility, the claimant had various other options available to him other than feigning a robbery so that he might attempt a murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Upon review, the full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">The evidence in this case establishes that the claimant was under some restrictions at the time of his discharge. He was discharged after he feigned a robbery with the intent to harm an individual employed by the employer. Dr. Harris implicated a variety of factors which led to this behavior, including the claimant\u2019s frustration and anger. A close review of Dr. Harris\u2019s contemporaneous treatment notes, as well as the claimant\u2019s testimony, demonstrates that the claimant\u2019s main problems were not directly related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>his accident. The claimant\u2019s problems involved anger at his employer, and frustration over his financial status and his ongoing situation relative to perceived problems with accommodations and other employment issues not directly related to the initial trauma. These problems are of a nature more akin to stress resulting from an employee\u2019s interaction with his supervisors, which is not compensable. <em>See Teasley v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>14 Va.App. 45, 415 S.E.2d 596 (1992). We also note that the documentary [evidence] reveals pre-existing problems with anger or \u201crage,\u201d despite the claimant\u2019s denials to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">We find that the totality of the evidence shows that the claimant was responsible for his wrongful actions on June 29, 2000. Under the circumstances presented, we agree that the claimant was discharged for justified cause, supporting the forfeiture of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">This appeal by claimant followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">On appeal, claimant does not challenge employer\u2019s right to terminate him for feigning the robbery. He argues, however, that his termination from selective employment did not justify a forfeiture of subsequent workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The uncontradicted medical evidence in the record, he asserts, clearly demonstrates that his action in feigning the robbery on June 29, 2000, was caused by his psychiatric disability, which directly resulted from his October 2, 1999 compensable industrial accident. Hence, he contends the commission erred, as a matter of law, in finding that he failed to meet his burden of proving that his termination and resulting wage loss were causally related to his accident and in ruling, based on that finding, that his discharge \u201cfor justified cause\u201d precluded him from receiving post-termination temporary partial disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Employer concedes on appeal, as it did below, that claimant suffered a compensable psychiatric injury, diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder, as a result of claimant\u2019s industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>accident on October 2,1999. Employer asserts, however, that the credible evidence demonstrates that, having recovered from his accident-related mental disorder and having been released to work by Dr. Harris, claimant feigned the robbery on June 29, 2000, \u201cin an attempt to obtain money to pay his bills\u201d and because of his \u201canger at his employer, frustration over his financial status and child support payments, and perceived problems with employment issues not directly related to the Claimant\u2019s work accident.\u201d Such reasons, employer maintains in reliance on <em>Teasley, </em>14 Va.App. 45, 415 S.E.2d 596, are unrelated to the compensable accident and, thus, do \u201cnot provide a basis for awarding compensation\u201d following claimant\u2019s termination from selective employment. Moreover, employer asserts, the credible evidence demonstrates that claimant \u201chad pre-existing mental health issues prior to the accident of October 2, 1999.\u201d Thus, employer argues, the commission correctly found that claimant \u201cwas wholly responsible for his wrongful acts on June 29, 2000\u201d and that those acts were not related to his October 2,1999 accident. Because the record contains credible evidence supporting the commission\u2019s factual findings, employer\u2019s argument continues, this Court is bound by those findings. Accordingly, employer concludes, the commission\u2019s ruling, based on those findings, that employer was not responsible for claimant\u2019s post-termination wage loss \u201cmust be affirmed.\u201d We disagree with employer\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In <em>Timbrook v. O\u2019Sullivan Corp., </em>17 Va.App. 594, 597, 439 S.E.2d 873, 875 (1994), we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">an employee on selective employment offered or procured by the employer, who is discharged for cause <em>and for reasons not concerning the disability, </em>forfeits his or her right to compensation benefits like any other employee who loses employment benefits when discharged for cause. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 833, 252 S.E.2d 310, 312-13 (1979); <em>Marval Poultry Co. v. Johnson, </em>224 Va. 597, 601, 299 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1983). The reason for the rule is that the wage loss is attributable to the employee\u2019s wrongful act <em>rather than the disability.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(Emphases added.) Thus, a discharge from selective employment does not \u201ccreate a forfeiture of workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d if \u201cthe reason for the discharge ... concern[s]\u201d the employee\u2019s disability. <em>Id. </em>at 598-99, 439 S.E.2d at 876.

McReynolds, </em>157 Va. 468, 471, 162 S.E. 8, 9 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we conclude that, as a matter of law, there is no credible evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s finding that claimant was discharged from selective employment for reasons unrelated to his compensable work-related accident. To the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>trary, we find that all of the relevant credible evidence in the record plainly supports the conclusion that claimant\u2019s action in fabricating the robbery was directly related to his October 2, 1999 work-related accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">On October 2, 1999, claimant was involved in a traffic accident in which he unavoidably struck and killed a pedestrian with his delivery truck while working for employer. Because of that accident, claimant suffered from numerous emotional problems, including flashbacks of the accident, fear of driving and crossing the street, anxiety attacks, feelings of being a killer, trouble sleeping and getting out of bed, and problems maintaining an erection. Dr. Harris, a clinical psychologist who first treated claimant ten days after the accident and continued treating him several times a month thereafter through at least July 2000, noted at intake that, having suffered the accident, claimant was a \u201cnervous, tense/anxious, depressed, agitated, phobic male who was fully oriented with sad, hopeless, and depressed affect, and depressed/irritable mood,\u201d and who \u201cwas having trouble containing paranoid, hostile, and violent urges secondary to his anxious, agitated feelings.\u201d Dr. Harris specifically diagnosed claimant as suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood\u201d directly caused by the October 2, 1999 industrial accident. Dr. Harris was positive in his diagnosis and no evidence from any other mental health expert was provided to contradict that diagnosis. Employer accepted claimant\u2019s psychological injury as compensable and voluntarily authorized and paid for treatment of that condition, \u201cup until a certain point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">At no point between October 12, 1999, and June 29, 2000, did Dr. Harris release claimant to full employment or otherwise indicate that claimant had recovered from his accident-related psychological injury, as employer claims. To the contrary, as Dr. Harris noted, although claimant was able to achieve \u201cbrief periods of higher level driving function\u201d at times, he continued to \u201cneed to temporarily self-modify his own driving exposure\u201d when the symptoms of his disorder affected his ability to drive safely. Indeed, the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>noted that claimant was still on selective employment at the time of the feigned robbery. Moreover, Dr. Harris\u2019s contemporaneous treatment notes indicate that claimant\u2019s underlying mental disorder continued throughout that period and adversely affected his ability to problem solve, control negative thoughts, and manage stress and anger during that entire time.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">As late as March 3, 2000, Dr. Harris wrote that, having started driving a new route on his own, claimant was thinking \u201cmore about violence\u201d and had concerns about his ability to control his anger. Dr. Harris further noted that claimant would need a rider to assist him on the route. On April 7, 2000, Dr. Harris indicated in his notes that claimant was having flashbacks of a \u201cman running in front of [his] truck.\u201d On April 27, 2000, Dr. Harris wrote that claimant was feeling \u201crage\u201d and was going to terminate his medication. On May 4, 2000, Dr. Harris noted claimant was upset because employer had assigned him to drive the route where the fatal accident had occurred on October 2, 1999, and insisted that he do so even though claimant explained to employer that he was \u201chaving trouble sleeping,\u201d was \u201chaving flashbacks,\u201d and was off his prescription medication at that point. Dr. Harris further noted that claimant was feeling \u201cpushed, trapped like [a] cornered animal [and] rage.\u201d That same day, Dr. Harris sent a letter to employer, stating that claimant was \u201cgreatly stressed and somewhat regressed, secondary to being scheduled to service the route where his accident occurred on October 2, 1999.\u201d Dr. Harris further stated in his letter that claimant was \u201cclinically not ready to service that particular route at this time. He has made much progress in his therapy and his rehabilitation is progressing well. It is however important that we continue to work closely together towards supporting his full recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Dr. Harris\u2019s records from June 7, 2000, indicate that claimant was experiencing symptoms, including homicidal feelings. On June 14, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that claimant was told by employer that he could not get any more riders to assist him on his routes. Dr. Harris further noted that he would call or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>write employer regarding claimant\u2019s \u201cneed for a rider from time to time\u201d and that he recommended claimant continue with his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On July 18, 2000, less than three weeks after claimant\u2019s fabrication of the robbery, Dr. Harris opined that claimant\u2019s involvement in the June 29, 2000 incident was \u201crelated to\u201d claimant\u2019s diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. Dr. Harris further opined on September 24, 2002, that, as a result of the October 2,1999 accident, claimant suffered from chronic posttraumatic stress disorder. Dr. Harris also opined on September 24, 2002, that \u201cthe feigned robbery of 06/29/00 resulted directly from [claimant\u2019s] accident-related psychiatric condition. [Claimant] was still actively traumatized by his 10/02/99 fatality, on 06/29/00. He was also frustrated, angry, fearful and problem-solving very poorly at that time. He was sleep deprived [with] suicidal ideation as well.\u201d Again, Dr. Harris was positive in his diagnosis and opinion, and no other mental health professional\u2019s opinion was offered to refute them.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We find nothing in the record, particularly in Dr. Harris\u2019s treatment notes and claimant\u2019s testimony, that is inconsistent with Dr. Harris\u2019s diagnosis and opinion. Despite rejecting Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion, the commission identified no such specific inconsistency in the record. Clearly, claimant never testified that his feigning of the robbery was unrelated to his October 2, 1999 accident. Nor does anything in Dr. Harris\u2019s extensive records suggest that the two incidents were not causally related. Indeed, Dr. Harris\u2019s notations and claimant\u2019s testimony regarding claimant\u2019s \u201canger at his employer, and frustration over his financial status and his ongoing situation relative to perceived problems with accommodations and other employment issues not directly related to the initial trauma\u201d are entirely consistent with some of the symptoms documented by Dr. Harris that claimant experienced in connection with his accident-related mental disorder: his inability to problem solve, control negative thoughts, and manage stress and anger. As such, Dr. Harris\u2019s notations and claimant\u2019s testimony comport with Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s involvement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the June 29, 2000 incident was causally related to his accident-related psychological disorder. Dr. Harris\u2019s unequivocal expert opinion may not, therefore, be disregarded by the commission as \u201cinherently incredible\u201d or \u201cinconsistent with other facts in the record.\u201d <em>Hercules, </em>13 Va.App. at 361, 412 S.E.2d at 187. Accordingly, the commission could not properly rely solely on isolated portions of Dr. Harris\u2019s notes and claimant\u2019s testimony that were not inconsistent with Dr. Harris\u2019s expert opinion to arbitrarily discount that opinion and to conclude on its own that \u201cclaimant\u2019s main problems were not directly related to his accident.\u201d To do so on this record, despite the egregious nature of claimant\u2019s conduct in feigning the robbery, undermines the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Likewise, the commission\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Teasley, </em>14 Va.App. 45, 415 S.E.2d 596, to resolve the issue presented in this case is misplaced.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">In <em>Teasley, </em>the employee, <em>following an ongoing series of disagreements, </em>had a confrontation with his supervisor over his work assignments. He broke down emotionally and was diagnosed with [posttraumatic stress disorder due to the workplace confrontation]. He sought benefits, contending that his [posttraumatic stress disorder] was an occupational disease.

Holding that \u201cpurely psychological disability\u201d resulting from \u201cdisagreements over managerial decisions and conflicts with supervisory personnel that cause stressful consequences ... ordinarily are not compensable,\u201d we affirmed that decision. <em>Teasley, </em>14 Va.App. at 49, 415 S.E.2d at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Here, unlike in <em>Teasley, </em>it is undisputed that claimant\u2019s posttraumatic stress disorder arose from his October 2, 1999 work-related accident when he unavoidably killed a pedestrian, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and not because of any disagreements or conflicts with employer. Claimant\u2019s problems with employer subsequently arose and grew progressively worse as a result of his psychological disorder, not vice versa. Indeed, claimant\u2019s testimony that none of the problems with employer that led to his feigning the robbery existed before the accident was uncontradicted. Hence, <em>Teasley </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Furthermore, the commission\u2019s vague reliance on the fact that claimant had a prior problem with rage as a dispositive factor in this case is also misplaced. While claimant indicated in his intake questionnaire with Dr. Harris that he had received prior psychological treatment for \u201crage\u201d in 1996, no evidence was presented showing the precise nature or severity of that problem or the treatment therefor. Moreover, no evidence was presented to show that such a condition persisted three years later in 1999 or was related in any way to claimant\u2019s posttraumatic stress disorder arising from the October 2,1999 industrial accident. To the contrary, claimant testified that he had not previously suffered any symptoms similar to those he suffered as a result of the fatal accident. Claimant\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted. Clearly, Dr. Harris was aware of that notation by claimant in the questionnaire when he opined that claimant\u2019s conduct on June 29, 2000, was directly related to the October 2, 1999 accident. Dr. Harris drew no causal connection, in his treatment notes or elsewhere, between the prior condition noted by claimant and claimant\u2019s psychiatric disorder resulting from the accident. Nor, as previously noted, did any other health care professional do so in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Even were we to assume that claimant\u2019s prior treatment for rage was relevant to the issue before us, \u201c[i]t is well established that the employer takes the employee as the employer finds the employee, even where the employee suffers some [pre-existing] infirmity.\u201d <em>Williams Indus., Inc. v. Wagoner, </em>24 Va.App. 181, 187-88, 480 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1997). \u201cA finding that a pre-existing condition \u2018was accelerated or aggravated\u2019 by an injury sustained in an industrial accident estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>lishes a causal connection between the injury and disability[,] and the \u2018disability resulting therefrom is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southern Iron Works, Inc. v. Wallace, </em>16 Va.App. 131, 134, 428 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1993) (quoting <em>Olsten of Richmond v. Leftwich, </em>230 Va. 317, 320, 336 S.E.2d 893, 895 (1985)). Plainly, if claimant had a pre-existing psychological condition, the evidence in this case is sufficient to show that the psychological impact of claimant\u2019s traumatic October 2, 1999 accident was severe enough to have \u201caccelerated or aggravated\u201d that condition. Therefore, the mere, undeveloped fact that claimant received treatment for a prior psychological condition in 1996 is not persuasive evidence to show that claimant\u2019s discharge from selective employment was not properly attributable to the psychiatric disability he suffered as a direct result of his October 2, 1999 compensable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Thus, based on the record in this case, we hold, as a matter of law, that no credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding of fact that claimant\u2019s post-termination wage loss was causally related solely to his misconduct on June 29, 2000, and not to his October 2, 1999 compensable injury by accident, such that claimant forfeited his right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits after June 29, 2000. We further hold that claimant met his burden of proving his entitlement to disability compensation for his post-termination wage loss. Dr. Harris\u2019s unequivocal expert opinion was that claimant suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder resulting from his October 2, 1999 compensable accident and that claimant\u2019s actions on June 29, 2000, resulted directly from that disorder. No other evidence contradicts Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion, and we find no internal conflict in it. This evidence supports the conclusion that claimant\u2019s termination from selective duty employment was causally related to his compensable disability. Thus, consistent with the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, employer is responsible for claimant\u2019s resulting post-termination wage loss. <em>See Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 338, 482 S.E.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that the commission erred in denying claimants claim for post-termination temporary partial disability benefits.

Instead, the record demonstrates that the employer terminated Artis because of his volitional, criminal acts\u2014acts, which Artis himself testified would have culminated in homicide, had the circumstances occurred according to Artis\u2019s criminal plan. Thus, I believe the commission\u2019s denial of Artis\u2019s request for post-termination temporary partial disability benefits was supported both in law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">As the majority notes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">[w]ell established principles of workers\u2019 compensation law [must] guide our decision in this case. First, \u201c[t]he purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to provide compensation to an employee for the loss of his opportunity to engage in work, when his disability is occasioned by an injury suffered from an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The Act should be liberally construed in harmony with its humane purpose.\u201d <em>Barnett v. D.L. Brom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>well, Inc., </em>6 Va.App. 30, 33-34, 366 S.E.2d 271, 272 (1988) (en banc) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><em>Potomac Edison Co. v. Cash, </em>18 Va.App. 629, 631-32, 446 S.E.2d 155, 156 (1994). \u201cUnder the Act, an employee who is properly terminated from selective employment procured by the employer for cause consisting of willful misconduct forfeits his or her entitlement to future temporary partial disability benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In such circumstances, we have been \u201cunable to find any provision within the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act which evidences an intent by the legislature to place such an employee in a better position than an uninjured employee who is terminated for cause and by his wrongful act suffers a loss of income.\u201d <em>C &amp; P Telephone v. Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. 633, 640, 406 S.E.2d 190, 193, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>13 Va.App. 304, 411 S.E.2d 444 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Thus, in determining whether to impose a forfeiture, the commission must \u201cconsider the nature of [the] conduct,\u201d which is alleged to constitute the cause or to justify the dismissal. <em>Eppling v. Schultz Dining Programs, </em>18 Va.App. 125,129, 442 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1994). In conducting this analysis, the commission must be mindful that not every \u201ctype of willful conduct or misbehavior [rises to the level] that, upon termination, justifies a forfeiture of workers\u2019 compensation benefits [under <em>Murphy].\u201d Id. </em>at 130, 442 S.E.2d at 222. Although we have yet to specify the type of conduct falling within this category, we have held that \u201cin order to work a forfeiture, the \u201cwage loss [must be] properly attributable to [the employee\u2019s] wrongful act ... <em>[for which t]he employee is responsible.\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. at 639-40, 406 S.E.2d at 193) (emphasis added). Accordingly, as noted by the majority, because \u201c[t]he purpose of the [Act] is to compensate employees when they lose an opportunity to engage in work after suffering work-related injuries,\u201d <em>Arlington County Fire Dep\u2019t v. Stebbins, </em>21 Va.App. 570, 572, 466 S.E.2d 124, 125-26 (1996), a factual analysis of each individual case must prove that the termination at issue was not \u201cattributable to the employee\u2019s [injury].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Simply put, we liberally construe the Act so as to protect those employees who are no longer able to work because of a work-related accident, even in the face of some types of misconduct\u2014particularly conduct for which the employee cannot be held responsible. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In finding that Artis\u2019s termination was \u201cattributable\u201d to his injury, the majority relies upon Artis\u2019s psychologist\u2019s opinion that Artis\u2019s conduct was caused by his PTSD.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that despite its decision to terminate benefits, the commission necessarily accepted this opinion as true, I believe the majority gives short shrift to the crucial fact that no evidence established this \u201ccausal relationship\u201d affected Artis to such an extent that his actions were \u201cbeyond [his] control.\u201d <em>Walter Reed Convalescent Center v. Reese, </em>24 Va.App. 328, 338-39, 482 S.E.2d 92, 97-98 (1997). Indeed, the case at bar is inapposite to <em>Timbrook v. O\u2019Sullivan Corp., </em>17 Va.App. 594, 439 S.E.2d 873 (1994), and <em>Eppling. </em>In <em>Timbrook, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 129-30, 442 S.E.2d at 222 (discussing <em>Timbrook, </em>17 Va.App. at 598, 439 S.E.2d at 876) (emphasis added). In <em>Eppling, </em>\u201cwe held that the claimant\u2019s excessive absenteeism caused by a non-work-related injury <em>beyond the employee\u2019s control </em>was not the type of wrongful act which, upon termination, justified a forfeiture of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 338, 482 S.E.2d at 98 (discussing <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 129-30, 442 S.E.2d at 222) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>[we] held that the <em>Murphy </em>forfeiture rule does not apply to an employee who was discharged for failing to notify her employer that she would be absent <em>from selective employment that she had refused. </em>Because the employee had refused, or not accepted, the employer\u2019s offer of selective employment, her termination following three consecutive absences was \u201cnot for cause or for misconduct, as in <em>Murphy, </em>[which would] justify a forfeiture of her compensation benefits that could never be cured.\u201d <em>[Timbrook, </em>17 Va.App. at 598, 439 S.E.2d at 876].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Here, Artis\u2019s conduct was not related to a refusal of selective employment, nor was it in any way related to the procedural aspects of his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Artis could not perform the duties of his selective employment for reasons, related to his injury, that were beyond his control. In fact, the evidence demonstrates that Artis was fully capable of performing his duties and that he did so. Thus, there is simply no evidence that Artis was terminated because of his work-related injury or its residual effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Instead, the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that Artis was terminated as a direct result of his volitional, criminal acts. Specifically, because Artis was frustrated and angry toward his supervisor, as well as other aspects of his personal life, he staged a robbery, misappropriating $200 of the employer\u2019s funds, with the intent of murdering his supervisor once he arrived at the scene. Even were we to give more weight to Artis\u2019s psychologist\u2019s opinion than that given to it by the commission, the evidence still falls short of establishing that Artis\u2019s \u201ccausally related\u201d actions were beyond his control. To the contrary, Artis himself testified that he acted with premeditation, and with knowledge of his actions and the consequences thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Accordingly, I would find that the commission correctly determined Artis was terminated, not for reasons related to his injury or its residual effects, but for misconduct for which he was fully \u201cresponsible.\u201d In fact, to carry the majority\u2019s analysis to its logical conclusion, what we hold today is that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Artis had been successful, and murdered his supervisor, the employer would still be required to provide him with the benefits at issue because such conduct would be, at least in part, causally related to his PTSD and therefore, not the type of misconduct or misbehavior envisioned by our decision in <em>Murphy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Because I believe that Artis\u2019s volitional conduct amounted to precisely the type of \u201cwrongful act\u201d that would \u201cjustiffy]\u201d a forfeiture of compensation benefits, I simply cannot agree with such a conclusion. <em>Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. at 639, 406 S.E.2d at 193. I would thus affirm the decision of the commission. <em>See Marval Poultry Co. v. Johnson, </em>224 Va. 597, 598, 299 S.E.2d 343, 344 (1983) (holding that a disabled employee on selective work status was no longer entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits when \u201che [was] discharged by his employer for dishonest\"); <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 833, 252 S.E.2d 310, 313 (1979) (holding that a partially disabled employee\u2019s rights to compensation benefits were properly terminated when the employee was discharged because he had been \u201can exceedingly poor worker during the entire period of his employment ... he had a great number of absences from work, and ... several times he left his job without authorization\u201d); <em>Richfood, Inc. v. Williams, </em>20 Va. App. 404, 410, 457 S.E.2d 417, 420 (1995) (\u201cWhere passing drug and alcohol screening is made a clear and unequivocal condition of employment, ... failure to pass the screening is tantamount to misconduct ... for which an employee can be terminated.\u201d); <em>Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. at 639, 406 S.E.2d at 193 (holding that an employee\u2019s conduct constituted \u201ccause\u201d for discharge, justifying a forfeiture of benefits, where he was guilty of fraudulent misrepresentations in his attempt to obtain compensation benefits).</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-10\">. I find it particularly troubling that the employer forced Artis to complete his route immediately after this tragic accident occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">. I must conclude from the majority\u2019s rather sparse analysis that it has either invaded the province of the commission as fact finder to reach the conclusion that Artis\u2019s criminal actions were non-volitional, or the majority is implicitly holding today that misconduct of any kind, obviously including criminal activity up to the level of a homicide, does not justify a termination of benefits if there is <em>any </em>nexus between the misconduct and the injury irrespective of any public policy considerations the General Assembly may have had in mind in placing limitations on the continuation of benefits. Although I am unsure which is the case, I cannot embrace either scenario.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
