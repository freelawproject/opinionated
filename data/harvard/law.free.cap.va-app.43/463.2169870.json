McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Angela Hodges appeals a circuit court order affirming an administrative support order issued by the Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Social Services, Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE), requiring reimbursement of a public assistance debt incurred on behalf of her minor child. She contends that Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 precludes DCSE from assessing the debt against her. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Angela M. Hodges and Ronald R. Hodges are the parents of N., born in 1989. From 1990 to 1995, N. resided with her paternal grandmother, Phyllis Hodges. During that time, Phyllis Hodges received Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits from the Department of Social Services for the care of N. Ronald Hodges reimbursed the Department of Social Services for all but $2,860 of the TANF monies paid for N\u2019s benefit. In 1995, N. returned to her parents\u2019 home and continues to reside there.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In 2002, DCSE issued an administrative support order seeking reimbursement from Angela Hodges for the balance of the TANF moneys paid on behalf of N. The order allowed for a payment of $65 per month for each of the months TANF benefits were received for N.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Angela Hodges is not currently receiving any public assistance moneys, including TANF. However, the household does receive food stamps in the form of an electronic benefit card, and Medicaid assistance for the benefit of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Angela Hodges appealed the administrative support order to the juvenile and domestic relations district court, which dismissed the order. DCSE appealed the decision to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>circuit court, which found that the code section did not bar DCSE from collecting the debt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On appeal, questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed <em>de novo </em>by this Court. Issues of \u201cpure statutory interpretation [are] the prerogative of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Sims Wholesale Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 404, 468 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1996). \u201cThis axiom stems from basic principles of separation of powers. \u2018It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 635, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 (2004) (quoting <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. 137 (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). Therefore, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (citing <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 provides that payment of public assistance money for a child constitutes a debt to DCSE by noncustodial parents. In pertinent part, the statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aba\">Debt created by an administrative support order under this section shall not be incurred by nor at any time be collected from a noncustodial parent who is the recipient of public assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children for the period such person or persons are in such status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The issue in this appeal is simply whether, in the context of the statute, the term \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d includes food stamps and Medicaid assistance. The appellant contends that because her household receives these two forms of public assistance for the benefit of her children DCSE is prohibited by the statute from collecting the outstanding TANF debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cIn construing statutes, courts are charged with ascertaining and giving effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum, Corp. v. Hill, 254 </em>Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997) (citing <em>City of Winchester v. American Woodmark Corp., </em>250 Va. 451, 457, 464 S.E.2d 148, 152 (1995)). In Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, the legislature chose to use the phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d rather than simply \u201cpublic assistance.\u201d In some parts of the statute, the phrase \u201cpublic assistance\u201d is used; in other parts, \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d is used. The question then becomes what the legislature meant by including the word \u201cmoneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u201cIt is a basic rule of statutory construction that a word in a statute is to be given its everyday, ordinary meaning unless the word is a word of art.\u201d <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991) (citing <em>Lovisi v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 848, 850, 188 S.E.2d 206, 208, <em>cert. denied, </em>407 U.S. 922, 92 S.Ct. 2469, 32 L.Ed.2d 808 (1972)). The ordinary use of the word money, or moneys in plural, is cash or currency. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>695 (abridged 6th ed. 1991) (defining money as \u201ccoins and paper currency used as circulating medium of exchange\u201d). Money, including forms other than cash or currency (i.e. cheeks, debit cards, credit cards), is a medium of exchange that is universally accepted across the country for the purpose of purchasing, or paying for, a wide variety of commodities, which includes both goods and services. In the two code sections of the Act where the legislature used the words \u201cpublic assistance moneys,\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1908 and 63.2-1909, it is placed in the context of a payment, or money being paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u201cProper construction seeks to harmonize the provisions of a statute both internally, and in relation to other statutes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Wallace, </em>29 Va.App. 228, 233, 511 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999). In <em>Wallace </em>this Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">The words chosen by the legislature in drafting a statute derive meaning from both definition and context and, therefore, we divine legislative intent by construing an enactment as a whole, together with companion statutes, if any. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>legal maxim, <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>instructs that \u201ca word takes color and expression from the purport of the entire phrase of which it is a part, and ... must be read in harmony with its context.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 460, 309 S.E.2d 337, 339 (1983). Similarly, legislative purpose can best be \u201c \u2018ascertained from the act itself when read in the light of other statutes relating to the same subject matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 197, 480 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1997). The doctrine of <em>pari materia </em>teaches that \u201c \u2018statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great, connected homogenous system, or a simple and complete statutory arrangement.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 480 S.E.2d at 796.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An6\"><em>Id. </em>at 233-34, 511 S.E.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Some forms of public assistance are provided as cash transfers<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and others are not. Code \u00a7 63.2-100 provides definitions for some of the applicable terms. \u201cPublic assistance\u201d is defined as \u201cTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); auxiliary grants to the aged, blind and disabled; medical assistance; energy assistance; food stamps; employment services; child care; and general relief.\u201d TANF is defined as a program in which a \u201crelative can receive monthly cash assistance for the support of his eligible children.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-100. On the other hand, food stamps are distributed in the form of coupons or an electronic benefit card in order to obtain nutritional food <em>(see </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 <em>et seq. </em>(2004)). Food stamps are food-only assistance and by law are not to be used to purchase or pay for anything other than foodstuffs that are approved by the food stamp program. Medicaid consists of reimbursements to medical providers for eligible services they have rendered to eligible patients (see, <em>e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-310). Neither food stamps nor Medicaid assistance provide a cash payment to the recipients that allows them to use that benefit to purchase or pay for goods or services other than those approved by the respective programs. In the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>of Medicaid, recipients do not receive the benefit directly. The government pays the medical providers directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">If the legislature intended to include all forms of public assistance as defined by Code \u00a7 63.2-100, it would have only used the phrase \u201cpublic assistance.\u201d To interpret the phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d to mean all forms of public assistance, the word \u201cmoneys\u201d would add nothing to the term \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and would be deprived of any effect. The word \u201cmoneys\u201d would be rendered superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Virginia Supreme Court has long held that \u201cwhen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose with care, the words it used ... and we are bound by those words when we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (quoting <em>Barr v. Town and Country Props., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)); <em>see also Huffman v. Kite, </em>198 Va. 196, 199, 93 S.E.2d 328, 330-31 (1956); <em>Frazier v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 131, 135, 497 S.E.2d 879, 881 (1998). Virginia courts are bound, where possible, to give meaning to every word of a statute. <em>See, e.g., Monument </em>Assoc. <em>v. Arlington County Bd., </em>242 Va. 145, 149, 408 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1991); <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 306, 504 S.E.2d 394 (1998). A word or clause contained in a statute may only be rejected as surplusage if it \u201cappears to have been inserted through inadvertence or mistake, and which is incapable of any sensible meaning,\u201d or is otherwise repugnant to the rest of the statute. <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 788-89, 75 S.E.2d 482, 484-85 (1953). \u201c[N]o part of an act should be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Garrison v. First Federal Savings and Loan of South Carolina, </em>241 Va. 335, 340, 402 S.E.2d 25, 28 (1991) (citing <em>Raven Red Ash Coal Corp. v. Absher, </em>153 Va. 332, 335, 149 S.E. 541, 542 (1929)).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">To ensure that the word \u201cmoneys\u201d is given meaning this Court must interpret the phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d to exclude non-monetary public assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>When the legislature exempted recipients of monetary public assistance from the obligation of repaying prior support, it intended to avoid a meaningless and inefficient exercise of giving money to those in need with one hand while requiring it to be paid back with the other. That would be the result if the noncustodial parent received monetary public assistance at the time DCSE sought repayment of prior public assistance. However, in the case of non-monetary support, no such result is reached. Neither food stamps, Medicaid benefits, nor other forms of non-monetary assistance, can legally be converted to cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The Court finds that holding recipients of non-monetary assistance subject to the obligations of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 does not frustrate the purpose of that statute. The \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d exception applies only to those receiving actual monetary assistance from the Commonwealth. Food stamps and Medicaid assistance are not \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d as contemplated in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. The legislature did not exempt noncustodial parents receiving those forms of public assistance from reimbursing DCSE for moneys expended on behalf of their children. As a result, Hodges does not come under the statutory exception, and, as N.\u2019s parent, must repay the support obligation pursuant to the administrative support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision upholding the administrative support order requiring the appellant to reimburse DCSE for benefits extended on behalf of her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. The trial court also found that Angela Hodges was not a noncustodial parent as contemplated in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, but appellant does not appeal that part of the trial court's finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-5\">. \"Cash\u201d in this context should also be understood to include other forms of universally accepted currency, such as checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b517-8\">COLEMAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Agn\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">I agree with the majority that when we are called upon to interpret a statute we are not bound by a trial court\u2019s construction of the statute and that upon our <em>de novo </em>review and determination we are required to give \u201ceffect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Central Petroleum Corp. v. Hill, </em>254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997) (citing <em>City of Winchester v. American Woodmark Corp., </em>250 Va. 451, 457, 464 S.E.2d 148, 152 (1995)). Moreover, I agree with the majority that a word in a statute is to be given \u201cits everyday, ordinary meaning unless the word is a word of art.\u201d <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991) (citing <em>Lovisi v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 848, 850, 188 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1972)). However, by construing the word \u201cmoney[s]\u201d so narrowly as to include only \u201ccoins and paper currency\u201d the majority disregards the \u201ceveryday, ordinary meaning\u201d of the word \u201cmoney\u201d in the modern world of business and government and fails to give \u201ceffect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Here, the obvious intent of the legislature in enacting the part of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 under review was to relieve a noncustodial parent of having to repay a debt created by an administrative support order during such time that the parent \u201cis the recipient of public assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children.\u201d As appellant noted, \u201cthe obvious reason for the statutory exception to assessment and collection is to prohibit the Commonwealth from depleting the extremely limited financial resources of families with children as needing and receiving public assistance.\u201d The legislature merely acknowledged the unfairness of collecting a debt for TANF benefits paid from the noncustodial parent during the time that the parent is receiving \u201cpublic assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children.\u201d Here, the public assistance moneys paid for the minor dependent children were food stamps and Medicaid benefits. In other words, public policy did not condone taking \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d paid to a parent for a minor dependent child during the time the parent is receiving such benefits to repay other public assistance funds that were paid on behalf of the noncustodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Furthermore, in today\u2019s world I seriously doubt that any public assistance benefits or \u201cmoneys\u201d are paid in \u201ccoins and paper currency\u201d or cash. Proper government accounting would require that such public assistance benefits be paid by check, voucher, coupon, etc.; not by \u201ccoins or paper currency.\u201d The majority has adopted the most narrow and restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>meaning of the word \u201cmoneys,\u201d in disregard of the \u201ceveryday, ordinary\u201d meaning of the word in the context of the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1021 (7th ed. 1999) defines \u201cmoney[s]\u201d as \u201cassets that can be easily converted to cash.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>1160 (2d ed. 1983) variously defines \u201cmoney[s]\u201d as \u201cany substance or article used as money, as bank notes, checks, etc.;\u201d and as \u201cproperty, possessions, wealth.\u201d This broader definition of \u201cmoney[s]\u201d was clearly what the legislature intended by enacting Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 and is the only construction that achieves a reasonable and meaningful result.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I dissent and I would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision upholding the administrative support order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
