On appeal, appellants contend (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove they constituted a mob; (2) the trial court erred in not giving a self-defense instruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons stated, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">On June 30, 2002, Arthur Leonard hosted a party at his home to celebrate a Mend\u2019s birthday. Appellants, who are brothers, and several of their Mends heard about the party and decided to go \u201cparty crashing.\u201d While talking prior to leaving for the party, one of the Mends, Christopher Gittens, noticed Shannon had a 2-1/2 inch knife \u201cfolded\u201d in his hand. When Gittens asked why he had the knife, Shannon replied, \u201c[Y]ou never know when you might need it____\u201d Appellants drove to the party in a red Honda Civic.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">At approximately 1:30 a.m., Leonard attempted to bring the party to an end. Leonard kept repeating himself because \u201cnobody really paid attention and some of them got a little argumentative.\u201d A group of people, including appellants, came to the front door. Leonard and Ryan Kernutt told them that the party was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Richard \u201cgot in\u201d Leonard\u2019s face and said, \u201c[Y]ou don\u2019t know me.... I\u2019m a killer, I\u2019m a killer, you don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d Richard then pulled out a black switchblade knife. Shawn was standing with Richard and looked angry. Richard was told that no one wanted a fight; they were just trying to end the party. Richard and Shawn turned and walked away. Leonard and Kernutt went back inside the house. Jeffrey Zirkle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>another person at the party, heard Richard tell his brother Shawn, \u201cdo the dance\u201d and Shawn began jumping around, \u201cacting silly.\u201d A few minutes later, a fight erupted outside. There were approximately fifteen to twenty people there at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Daniel McLaughlin, an occupant of the house, saw \u201ca couple of guys\u201d come up to the door and attempt to enter. He testified, \u201cThe same guys that had been sitting across the parking lot for probably an hour\u201d in a red Civic. When McLaughlin asked them to leave, Shawn said to \u201cgo F\u201d himself. McLaughlin replied, \u201c[W]e don\u2019t need that in here, we don\u2019t [sic] any knives.\u201d Shawn said \u201cokay\u201d and walked out. McLaughlin went inside the house and then noticed that outside a fight \u201cbroke out.\u201d While McLaughlin saw all three brothers during this confrontation, he could not positively identify them as being involved in the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As Amber Phillips was leaving the party, she observed Richard arguing with one of her girlfriends outside. She asked Richard to leave, indicating that they \u201cweren\u2019t looking for any kind of confrontation and it would just be better if they just left.\u201d Richard told her he had \u201cnever been kicked out of anywhere\u201d and she should not \u201cshow [her] face anywhere\u201d in town because he would have her \u201cpersonally escorted out.\u201d Richard then walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Michael McLaughlin heard someone asking people to leave the party. He heard people responding they would not leave. McLaughlin walked out the back door and announced, \u201cyes you are leaving.\u201d Shawn then swung at McLaughlin, but missed him. As McLaughlin leaned back, Richard hit him in the face. Prior to the assault, McLaughlin had not lunged at anyone nor spit in anyone\u2019s face. Phillips observed McLaughlin being hit in the head by two men that she could not identify. Phillips grabbed McLaughlin and \u201cpulled him in towards the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Reid Adams heard the commotion, saw Michael McLaughlin being attacked, and went outside the house. As he stepped out the back door, he was attacked by Shawn. Shawn \u201cthrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>toward [Ms] stomach.\u201d Adams thought Shawn had punched him. As Adams and Shawn \u201cwrestled around,\u201d Shannon joined the attack, smashing a bottle on the side of Adam\u2019s head. Shawn then left the fight. Shannon and Adams continued to struggle on the ground until Shannon left. Adams began havmg trouble breathing and realized that he had been stabbed four times in Ms chest and stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Dustin Furlough testified that several uninvited people were at the party. When they were asked to leave, \u201cproblems started.\u201d Richard, who was standing in the parking lot, yelled, \u201cwe\u2019re killers.\u201d Furlough then saw Shawn and Shannon attacking Michael McLaughlin. Furlough went to break up the fight, but he was attacked by Richard, who threw Furlough to the ground. Richard then jumped on Furlough\u2019s back. Shawn joined Richard, and the two brothers started hittmg Furlough in the back. Richard wrapped Ms hand around Furlough\u2019s head and tried to gouge Furlough\u2019s eyes out.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Domimc Binetti observed Shawn approach Furlough from the rear and stab him m the back. Binetti saw the knife in Shawn\u2019s hand. He then tried to jump Shawn. Shawn pulled the knife, swung it, and \u201cMcked\u201d Binetti\u2019s forearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Kernutt also went to Furlough\u2019s aid, grabbing Richard in a bear hug and saying, \u201ccalm down, calm down.\u201d Richard told Kernutt he had a knife and threatened to kill him if Kernutt did not let him go. Kernutt let go of Richard\u2019s arms and tried to get away from him. Richard then raised Ms hands over his head, clenching both of Ms fists, with the blade of a knife sticking out from his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Megan Pritchard also came to Furlough\u2019s assistance. She grabbed Richard\u2019s shirt. He flipped her over, and she saw a knife in Ms hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">James Griffenhagen went outside while other people were asking appellants to leave. While he was outside, he saw Richard and either Shawn or Shannon punch another person from the party. Griffenhagen tried to push them away and told them \u201cto relax.\u201d Richard came up behind Griffenhagen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>and placed a knife against his neck. He told Griffenhagen to let go of his \u201cMend\u201d or he would slice his throat. Richard pressed the knife against Griffenhagen\u2019s neck and cut him.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Appellants eventually \u201cconvened together\u201d and left in their car. Jeffrey Zirkle and Casey Mork left with appellants and went to Mork\u2019s garage where they discussed the fight. While in the garage, Richard ground down the blade of a knife on a bench grinder, explaining he was grinding it to \u201cget rid of the evidence.\u201d When the police arrived at the house to speak with them, they turned off the lights in the garage because they \u201cdidn\u2019t want the cops to come over and bother [them].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Mork testified about the events at the party that night. He claimed appellants were \u201cmaking their way to the parking lot\u201d when an unidentified person \u201cgot in their face.\u201d That person spit on one of the brothers. A fight then ensued. Mork did not see any of the brothers with a knife during the fight nor did he see anyone get stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Detective Jim Fetterman interviewed Richard. Richard told the detective that appellants were asked to leave the party and did. As they walked to the parking lot, they were \u201cjumped,\u201d beaten, and one of their attackers spit on Shannon. Richard denied having a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Shawn told Detective Fetterman that, as they were leaving the party, they were \u201cbum rushed\u201d in the parking lot. Shawn indicated he was choked by one of the assailants. Shawn admitted that he, Richard, and Shannon were all involved in the fight, but denied stabbing anyone. Shawn exhibited two injuries to the detective, \u201ca darkened eye area and also something across his chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Shannon told Investigator Rick Warford that, as appellants were leaving the party, an \u201cunknown male\u201d \u201cjust walked over and spit\u201d on him. Richard then responded, \u201cMan, he spit on you. Let\u2019s go.\u201d As they walked to their car, they were \u201cjumped\u201d by unknown individuals. At that point, Shannon said he lost sight of Richard and Shawn. He claimed he was \u201ckicked and punched all over his body.\u201d Shannon said he broke free and then saw \u201can unknown man who appeared who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>was holding a knife and said someone just got cut.\u201d Shannon saw this man after he and his brothers \u201cwere back together and got back in the car.\u201d Appellants then left. The investigator testified he saw only two very small, faint marks on Shannon.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">A. Evidence of a Mob</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Appellants argue the evidence is not sufficient to prove they were members of a mob. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-38, a \u201cmob\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]ny collection of people, assembled for the purpose and with the intention of committing an assault or a battery upon any person or an act of violence as defined in \u00a7 19.2-297.1, without authority of law____\u201d We find the evidence was sufficient to prove appellants acted as members of such a mob.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">\u201cit is our duty to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. We should affirm the judgment unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). Moreover, \u201c[i]f there is evidence to support the conviction, an appellate court is not permitted to substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact, even if the appellate court might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Presley, </em>256 Va. 465, 466, 507 S.E.2d 72, 72 (1998).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. In its role of judging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Marable v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Snow v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 766, 774, 537 S.E.2d 6, 10 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">To prove the crime of battery or maiming by mob, the Commonwealth must \u201cestablish beyond a reasonable doubt that the group of persons were at the time of the battery [or maiming] assembled as a mob with a purpose and intention of committing an assault or battery [or maiming].\u201d <em>Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 4, 396 S.E.2d 680, 681 (1990). \u201cThe statutory definition of a mob requires that the act of assembling be done for a specific purpose and with a specific intent\u2014to commit an assault or a battery without lawful authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 396 S.E.2d at 682. <em>Harrell </em>sets forth the basis for this analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">[W]e are concerned not just with the subjective intention of the individual, [a defendant], but with whether the group assembled and collectively formed with a purpose and intention to assault and batter any person. Code \u00a7 18.2-38. Not every incidence of group violence or assaultive conduct which involves a number of people collectively involved in assaultive conduct constitutes a \u201cmob\u201d assault and battery. In order for group behavior by individuals to become mob behavior, thereby making \u201c[a]ny and every person composing a mob\u201d culpable for the criminal acts of the other mob members, the group must have \u201cassembled for the purpose and with the intention of committing an assault or a battery upon any person.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-38. The criteria which distinguishes individual behavior while part of a group from \u201cmob\u201d behavior is assembling for the specific purpose and with the specific intent of committing an assault and battery upon any person. That is not to say that the purpose for which the group initially came together must have been for the purpose of committing an assault and battery before a \u201cmob\u201d may be said to have \u201cassembled.\u201d It is possible that individuals who are lawfully assembled may become members of a \u201cmob\u201d without great deliberation and for them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>become part of a group which is moved or controlled by those impulsive and irrational forces which perpetuate mob violence. For a group of persons lawfully gathered for whatever purpose to \u201cassemble\u201d as a mob within the intendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-38, they need only to collectively band together with the common purpose and intention of committing an assault and battery upon a person. Whether a group of individuals has been so transformed into a \u201cmob\u201d depends upon the circumstances; no particular words or express agreements are required to effect a change in a group\u2019s purpose or intentions. Events or emotionally charged circumstances suddenly may focus individuals toward a common goal or purpose without an express or stated call to join forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 396 S.E.2d at 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Within this framework, we examine the facts of the instant case. We must determine if the evidence permitted the fact finder to conclude appellants acted individually or as a \u201cmob.\u201d More specifically, we must determine whether the appellants collectively banded together with the specific intent and purpose to commit an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The three brothers initially assembled and decided to \u201ccrash\u201d a party. Until appellants and their entourage arrived, the party was peaceful. At least one of the brothers carried a weapon with him. When appellants were asked politely to leave, Richard responded, \u201cI\u2019m a killer, I\u2019m a killer, you don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d He pulled out a switchblade knife. Shawn, standing next to Richard, \u201clooked angry.\u201d Shawn told McLaughlin to \u201cgo F himself\u2019 when he was told to leave. Several fights then ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Shawn swung at Michael McLaughlin, who had told the brothers to leave, but missed. Richard then hit McLaughlin in the face. The brothers acted in concert to attack McLaughlin. Shawn then attacked Adams, thrusting toward Adams\u2019s stomach. As Adams and Shawn struggled, Shannon smashed a bottle over Adams\u2019s head. Again, appellants were acting in concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>During the melee, Richard attacked Furlough, throwing him to the ground. Shawn and Shannon joined the attack on Furlough. Richard tried to \u201cgouge\u201d out Furlough\u2019s eyes. Shawn stabbed Furlough in the back. As Binetti tried to assist Furlough, Shawn swung a knife at him, nicking his arm. Kernutt also went to Furlough\u2019s aid. Richard threatened to kill Kernutt if he would not release him. Again, appellants were acting in concert to assault someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Griffenhagen saw Richard and one of his brothers attacking a guest. Griffenhagen then grabbed one of the assailants. In response, Richard placed a knife against Griffenhagen\u2019s neck and cut him.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">As we said in <em>Harrell, </em>the group could initially be assembled lawfully, but may become a mob \u201cwithout great deliberation.\u201d 11 Va.App. at 7, 396 S.E.2d at 683. The evidence here supports a finding that the appellants \u201ccollectively band[ed] together with the common purpose and intention of committing an assault and battery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Their actions in attacking various individuals clearly indicate that they were acting collectively with the intent to assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Appellants arrived at the party together, uninvited and armed. When asked to leave, they became angry and aggressive. Systematically, they attacked a number of the party\u2019s hosts and guests. Each brother assisted the other brothers in the attacks. Each brother fought off people who were trying to assist the victims. Appellants, agitated when asked to leave the party, collectively attacked a number of victims and did not act as independent aggressors. The jury properly found, based on this evidence that appellants acted as a mob.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">B. Self-Defense Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Appellants next contend the trial court erred in not granting their offered instructions on self-defense. They argue the trial record supports a self-defense instruction based on testimony that, as appellants were leaving the party, an unidentified person \u201cgot in their face\u201d and spit on one of the brothers. They claim a group of people began attacking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>them. Shawn was choked by one of these assailants. They also claim they were unarmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">Because the trial court refused to grant the instruction proffered by the accused, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v. Alexander, </em>260 Va. 238, 240, 531 S.E.2d 567, 568 (2000). However, an instruction is proper only if supported by more than a scintilla of evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Donkor, </em>256 Va. 443, 445, 507 S.E.2d 75, 76 (1998). If the instruction is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case, it should not be given. <em>Hatcher v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 811, 813-14, 241 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1978) (citing <em>Banner v. Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 640, 647, 133 S.E.2d 305, 310 (1963)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><em>Commonwealth v. Sands, </em>262 Va. 724, 729, 553 S.E.2d 733, 736 (2001). In evaluating whether the trial court erred in failing to grant an instruction, the appellate courts review the record for \u201caffirmative evidence\u201d that supports the instruction, rather than basing the review upon \u201cthe jury\u2019s ability to reject evidence that is uncontroverted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Vaughn, </em>263 Va. 31, 37, 557 S.E.2d 220, 223 (2002). <em>See Donkor, </em>256 Va. at 446-47, 507 S.E.2d at 77 (finding the Court of Appeals erred \u201cin treating the jury\u2019s ability to reject evidence as a substitute for the evidentiary support required to grant a defendant\u2019s request for an instruction\u201d and reinstating the conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201cSelf-defense excuses or justifies a homicide or assault committed while repelling violence arrayed against the defendant. It is a response to the threat of death or serious bodily harm. It is a defense to an act of violence that repels violence directed at the defendant.\u201d <em>Graham v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 662, 672, 525 S.E.2d 567, 572 (2000).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWE\">\u201c[S]elf-defense may be either justifiable or excusable. If it is either, it entitles the [accused] to an acquittal.\u201d In either case, he is deemed to be innocent and guiltless of any crime. <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 92, 96, 104 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1958) (citations omitted). Assessing whether a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>act was committed in self-defense is distinct from determining whether its commission was intentional. In making a plea of self-defense, an accused <em>\u201cimplicitly admits the killing [or wounding] was intentional.\u201d McGhee [v. Commonwealth], </em>219 Va. [560,] 562, 248 S.E.2d [808,] 810 [(1978)] (emphasis added). Instead, the issue in a plea of self-defense is whether the accused\u2019s admittedly intentional act was either justifiable or excusable. <em>See id.; cf. Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 106, 341 S.E.2d 190,192 (1986) (stating that \u201c[a] plea of self-defense and a claim of provoked heat of passion do not conflict with each other\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Peeples v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 626, 642-43, 519 S.E.2d 382, 390 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (Lemons, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Our inquiry begins by considering whether more than a scintilla of evidence supports the contention that appellants stabbed the victims while under reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm. If not, then the self-defense instruction was properly denied. Simply claiming they acted in self-defense is insufficient. Some affirmative evidence must suggest appellants were under reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">No evidence suggests appellants stabbed the victims in self-defense. Examining the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants, the record establishes that someone spit on Shannon and that a group of people attacked appellants as they were leaving the party. To infer these attackers were the victims is pure speculation. No one identified any of the victims as a member of the group that allegedly attacked appellants. To support a self-defense instruction, appellants must point to affirmative evidence that these victims were physically threatening them. <em>See Vaughn, </em>263 Va. at 37, 557 S.E.2d at 223 (a defendant must have affirmative evidence to support a self-defense instruction); <em>Graham, </em>31 Va.App. at 672, 525 S.E.2d at 572 (a self-defense instruction is justified when the defendant repels a threat of death or great bodily harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Appellants claim that evidence in the record supports their theory that the victims were injured during the attack on appellants. However, that testimony was given by someone who did not see anyone stabbed or cut. The witness merely speculated that \u201cif it would have happen [sic], probably [it occurred] while everyone was fighting.\u201d The witness was not clear about who was probably injured during the fighting\u2014the victims or appellants. The question to which he responded did not specify whether the injuries were to the victims or to appellants, and the witness did not see for himself who was injured or how anyone was injured. This evidence is not more than the scintilla necessary to support a jury instruction on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">While some evidence supports appellants\u2019 claim that they were attacked in the parking lot, no evidence supports a claim that they acted in self-defense. Although the jury could have believed appellants\u2019 statements that they did not have any weapons, and thereby could have found appellants not guilty, that evidence does not alternatively support the contention that appellants acted in self-defense. <em>See Vaughn, </em>263 Va. at 37, 557 S.E.2d at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We find the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. We also find the trial court did not err when it rejected appellants\u2019 self-defense instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\">.
