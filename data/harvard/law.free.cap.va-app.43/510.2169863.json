Pamela A. Spriggs contends that the express terms of the divorce decree, which provides that the court retains jurisdiction, controls. We hold that the trial judge erred, and we reverse the orders and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">The evidence proved that on June 30, 1997 a judge of the circuit court entered a divorce decree, terminating the marriage between Pamela A. Spriggs and Darrell Spriggs. As requested by the wife\u2019s amended bill of complaint, the divorce decree \u201cADJUDGED, ORDERED, and DECREED that the Court doth reserve to the [wife], equitable distribution rights to marital assets of the parties and permanent spousal support for the [wife].\u201d The husband did not object to the divorce decree and did not appeal after the judge entered the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Six years later, the trial judge reinstated the proceeding on the docket upon the wife\u2019s motion. When the wife filed a \u201cmotion for equitable division of marital assets,\u201d the husband responded, in part, \u201cthat the Decree was not entered in conformity with the statute applicable to such proceedings and, therefore, the [wife] is not entitled to equitable distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tion.\u201d Supporting these pleadings, the parties filed memoranda and later argued the issues. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge found to be persuasive the husband\u2019s argument that <em>Christensen v. Christensen, </em>26 Va.App. 651, 496 S.E.2d 132 (1998), requires the divorce decree to contain \u201ca finding that [bifurcation] is clearly necessary,\u201d and the trial judge ruled that the divorce decree \u201chas to be very specific as to why we need to bifurcate [the proceeding] in light of [the] overall policy of resolving disputes.\u201d On this basis, the trial judge denied the wife\u2019s motion seeking a decree as to the property of the parties. The wife appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Our decision in <em>Erickson-Dickson v. Erickson-Dickson, </em>12 Va.App. 381, 404 S.E.2d 388 (1991), is dispositive of the issue in this case. There, a trial judge entered a divorce decree, \u201cretained the matter on the docket and \u2018reserved\u2019 the issues of equitable distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 404 S.E.2d at 389. The husband \u201cdid not object to or appeal the decree of divorce or the ruling in the decree which deferred adjudication of the equitable distribution issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 404 S.E.2d at 389-90. We held that when the trial judge failed to make the finding that the action \u201cis clearly necessary,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-107.3, and \u201cerroneously ruled to retain equitable distribution jurisdiction after granting a final divorce, the ruling is voidable and subject to challenge on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 404 S.E.2d at 392-93. We further held that because the husband failed to appeal \u201ca ruling which the [judge] had the power to make ... [, the judge] validly retained jurisdiction to adjudicate equitable distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 404 S.E.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">As in <em>Erickson-Dickson, </em>the divorce decree in this case was not void. Thus, the husband\u2019s challenge in this case to the propriety of the judge\u2019s decision \u201cto retain equitable distribution jurisdiction after granting a final divorce ... [was proper only] on direct appeal.\u201d 12 Va.App. at 389, 404 S.E.2d at 392-93. However, when the divorce decree was entered in 1997, neither party challenged its verity by objecting or appealing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u201cUnder such circumstances, the decree became and remains the law of the case.\u201d <em>Walt Robbins, Inc. v. Damon Corp., </em>232 Va. 43, 49, 348 S.E.2d 223, 228 (1986). <em>See Norris v. Mitchell, </em>255 Va. 235, 240, 495 S.E.2d 809, 812 (1998) (holding that when an unappealed decree becomes \u201cthe final order ... and the law of this case ..., we treat the order as correctly entered\u201d); <em>Hastie v. Hastie, </em>29 Va.App. 776, 782, 514 S.E.2d 800, 804 (1999) (holding that \u201cbecause wife did not appeal the trial court\u2019s divorce decree as it related to [the matter at] issue, the decree became a final order and the law of this case not subject to later modifications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Our decision in <em>Christensen </em>was based on a procedural posture different than this case because <em>Christensen </em>involved a <em>direct appeal </em>from the divorce decree. This procedural fact is significant because the judge\u2019s erroneous ruling in <em>Christensen </em>was subject to correction on appeal. Indeed, we noted that the trial judge \u201cmade no express finding that bifurcation of the proceedings was <em>\u2018clearly </em>necessary\u2019 [as required by] Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) ... and the record [did] not support such a finding.\u201d 26 Va.App. at 655, 496 S.E.2d at 134. Thus, while reaffirming the import of our holding in <em>Erickson-Dickson, see </em>26 Va.App. at 656, 496 S.E.2d at 134, we held that the judge\u2019s error in <em>Christensen </em>did not cause to be void or voidable \u201cthe decree dissolving the bond of matrimony between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 496 S.E.2d at 134. Simply put, we recognized the bifurcation error, but we refused to set aside the divorce decree, which was the only relief the appellant sought in <em>Christensen. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial judge erred in ruling that the portion of the divorce decree, which provides that the court retained jurisdiction to decree as to the property of the parties and which was not appealed, was rendered invalid and unenforceable by the absence of language in the divorce decree finding that bifurcation was necessary. The provision of the divorce decree reserving jurisdiction for the judge to adjudicate as to the property is a verity and is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>law of the case. Accordingly, we reverse the orders and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
