On appeal, Emerson contends the trial court erred (1) in denying his motion to suppress his statement during a custodial interrogation admitting ownership of a pair of shorts that contained cocaine and (2) in finding the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sufficient to sustain his conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 540, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence established that, on May 9, 2002, Detective M.C. Pederson and Corporal Francis B. Mazzio, Jr., joined by other police officers of the Vice and Narcotics Division of the City of Norfolk Police Department, executed a search warrant for narcotics and weapons at 1538 East Ocean View Avenue, Apartment 10, in the City of Norfolk. Emerson was named in the search warrant. When the officers entered the small, one-room apartment, Emerson, the sole occupant, was in bed. In order \u201cto clear the apartment\u201d for the search, the officers handcuffed Emerson and took him outside to Mazzio. Mazzio had him sit on the front porch of the apartment, an area \u201clike a motel room balcony,\u201d while the other officers conducted the search. Emerson, who was in public view while sitting on the porch, was wearing only boxer shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Knowing that Emerson would need to be transported to police headquarters if any illegal narcotics or weapons were found in the apartment and that it was department \u201cpolicy to dress the subject\u201d before transporting him, Corporal Mazzio asked Emerson \u201cwhat clothing he wanted\u201d to wear. In response, Emerson described the specific clothes he wanted, including a particular shirt, a particular pair of shoes, and a pair of jean shorts that were on the floor beside the bed. Mazzio then \u201cstuck [his] head through the [open] door\u201d of the apartment and asked for the clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Detective Pederson was inside the apartment preparing to start the search when she heard Mazzio \u201cyell[] in\u201d that he needed certain items of clothing from the apartment so that Emerson could get dressed, including \u201ca pair of shorts that [were] on the floor ... beside the bed.\u201d Pederson found a pair of jean shorts lying on the floor beside the bed. She picked them up and, pursuant to department policy, searched them \u201c[t]o make sure there\u2019s no weapons or narcotics or anything in the shorts or evidence that we may need before we release it from the apartment.\u201d Inside the pockets of the shorts, Pederson found a video-store card in Emerson\u2019s name, a \u201cNewport cigarette box,\u201d and \u201csome U.S. currency.\u201d Removing those items from the pockets of the shorts, Pederson took the requested shorts and other clothing outside and handed them to Mazzio.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u201c[A]ssum[ing]\u201d that, pursuant to department policy, Pederson had already searched the jean shorts and other items of clothing before giving them to him, Corporal Mazzio did not search the clothes himself. He did not, however, see Pederson conduct such a search and was unaware that she had retrieved anything from the jean shorts Emerson had requested. It was only later that Mazzio was informed that Pederson had recovered various incriminating items from the shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Upon receiving the jean shorts and other clothing from Pederson, Mazzio asked Emerson \u201cif these were the ones he wanted, and he said yes.\u201d Mazzio gave the clothes to Emerson, and he put them on.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Inside the \u201cNewport cigarette box\u201d removed from the jean shorts, Detective Pederson discovered what she \u201csuspected to be cocaine and marijuana.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The cigarette pack contained seven plastic-bag corners, each containing off-white powder, which was later determined by laboratory analysis to be cocaine. In total, the cocaine weighed 4.01 grams. The cigarette pack also contained a cellophane wrapper containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>4.2 grams of plant material, which was later determined by laboratory analysis to be marijuana. The money found in the shorts amounted to $845 and consisted of fourteen $20 bills, six $10 bills, and one $5 bill. During the search of the closet in the apartment, the police found a shoebox containing a vehicle registration and bank envelopes bearing Emerson\u2019s name, thirty .38-caliber bullets, twenty-seven 9-millimeter-caliber bullets, and a gun holster. A small electronic scale was also found inside a shoe in the same closet. The police also recovered a glass pipe that had \u201csome residue in the bottom of\u2019 it and found \u201cmarijuana seeds and residue all over the place\u201d inside the apartment. No other \u201csmoking devices\u201d were found in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Prior to trial, Emerson moved to suppress his identification of the shorts as his, arguing that his <em>Miranda </em>rights had been violated because he was in custody when the police asked about the shorts and he had not been advised of his rights before that questioning. Conceding Emerson was in custody when Corporal Mazzio asked him about the shorts, the Commonwealth argued that Mazzio\u2019s question whether the shorts Detective Pederson had given him were the shorts Emerson wanted was not an interrogation. The trial court denied Emerson\u2019s motion, finding that, although Emerson was in custody, Mazzio\u2019s question regarding the shorts did not constitute an interrogation requiring the giving of <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">At trial, Detective Pederson was qualified as an expert in the investigation, use, and distribution of illegal narcotics. She testified that, based on the residue in the bottom of the glass pipe that was found in the apartment and the fact that \u201cthere was no screening in the pipe to show that it would be for cocaine use,\u201d the pipe was used exclusively \u201cas a marijuana pipe.\u201d She further testified that the 4.01 grams of cocaine had a street value of at least $400 and that the denominations of the money found in Emerson\u2019s shorts were consistent with the sale of cocaine because dealers usually sell cocaine in $5, $10, $20, or $50 amounts. She also testified that those who buy cocaine for personal use typically purchase only $20 to $50 worth of cocaine each \u201ctime that they go to buy it,\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>police typically \u201cfind weapons, ammunition, [and] holsters inside locations where narcotics are being sold,\u201d and that scales are used to \u201cweigh out the amount of cocaine ... for resale.\u201d Pederson opined that, in light of the lack of any evidence in the apartment of cocaine use, Emerson\u2019s possession of the cocaine, cash, electronic scale, ammunition, and holster was inconsistent with personal use of the cocaine. On cross-examination, Pederson testified that a cocaine user \u201ccould consume seven packets of cocaine in a period of an hour\u201d if he had \u201cthat bad of a habit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">At the conclusion of trial, Emerson argued the evidence was insufficient to prove he intended to distribute the cocaine. Finding the evidence sufficient, the trial court found Emerson guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">II. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">On appeal, Emerson contends his statement while in custody to Corporal Mazzio that the jean shorts retrieved by Detective Pederson were \u201cthe ones he wanted\u201d was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). He asserts that his acknowledgment of ownership of the jean shorts was central to the determination that he possessed the drugs found in those shorts. He further asserts that, given the fact that Pederson had already searched the jean shorts and removed the illegal drugs from them, Mazzio\u2019s question regarding those shorts was designed to elicit an incriminating response. Thus, he argues, Mazzio\u2019s questions regarding his clothes were the functional equivalent of a custodial interrogation and should have been suppressed because the police did not advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before questioning him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is on the appellant to show that the denial of the motion constituted reversible error. <em>See Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980). In reviewing such a denial, \u201cwe consider the evidence adduced at both the suppression hearing and the trial.\u201d <em>Blevins v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 412, 420, 579 S.E.2d 658, 662 (2003), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>267 Va. 291, 590 S.E.2d 365 (2004). Moreover, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the Commonwealth all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). In addition, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the \u201ctrial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case.\u201d <em>Watts v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 206, 213, 562 S.E.2d 699, 703 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">It is well established that \u201c\u2018[t]he prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination,\u2019 commonly known as <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 194, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612). \u201cFailure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to custodial interrogation requires suppression of any illegally obtained statements.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 13, 371 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1988). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cBefore <em>Miranda </em>is triggered, however, an individual must be both in \u2018custody<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and subjected to \u2018interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The Commonwealth concedes, on appeal, that Emerson was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to his statement about the jean shorts. In addition, the Commonwealth conceded at the suppression hearing that Emerson was in custody when he made the statement \u201cand is bound by that concession here.\u201d <em>Timbers, </em>28 Va.App. at 194, 503 S.E.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The dispositive question before us, then, is whether Emerson was being subjected to \u201cinterrogation\u201d when he essentially admitted to Mazzio that the jean shorts were his.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018interrogation\u2019 means either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Watts, </em>38 Va.App. at 214, 562 S.E.2d at 703. \u201cThe \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 of an interrogation is \u2018any words or actions on the part of the police <em>(other than those normally attendant to arrest and </em>custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (emphasis added)). \u201cThe test is \u2018 \u201cwhether an objective observer would view an officer\u2019s words or actions as designed to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Gates v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 352, 355-56, 516 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1999) (quoting <em>Timbers, </em>28 Va.App. at 196, 503 S.E.2d at 237 (quoting <em>Blain, </em>7 Va.App. at 15, 371 S.E.2d at 841)). If the objective observer concludes that \u201c\u2018the police are trying to get [the suspect] to make an incriminating response,\u2019 \u201d then the officer\u2019s words and actions constitute the functional equivalent of interrogation, and <em>Miranda </em>applies. <em>Timbers, </em>28 Va.App. at 196, 503 S.E.2d at 237 (quoting Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Jerold H. Israel, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 6.7(a) (1984)). Conversely, the <em>Miranda </em>requirements do not apply when the objective observer \u201c \u2018perceives the officer\u2019s purpose to be something other than eliciting [incriminating] information from the suspect.\u2019 \u201d 2 Wayne R. LaFave et al., <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 6.7(a), at 547 (2d ed.1999) (quoting Welsh S. White, <em>Interrogation Without Questions: Rhode Island v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>Innis and United States v. Henry, 78 </em>Mich. L.Rev. 1209, 1235 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Applying this standard to the facts before us, we conclude that an \u201cobjective observer\u201d would not perceive Corporal Mazzio\u2019s words and actions related to Emerson\u2019s clothes as being intended to elicit incriminating information from Emerson regarding the ownership of the jean shorts and their contents. Rather, the \u201cobjective observer\u201d would perceive that Mazzio\u2019s only purpose was to get Emerson dressed, in furtherance of the officer\u2019s assigned duty. Moreover, nothing in the record concerning Detective Pederson\u2019s conduct would cause the same \u201cobjective observer\u201d to perceive Corporal Mazzio\u2019s words and actions any differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">When the police arrived at Emerson\u2019s apartment to execute the search warrant, Mazzio\u2019s assignment was to detain Emerson outside the apartment on the porch while other police officers searched the apartment. When brought out of the apartment to the porch, Emerson was dressed only in boxer shorts. Knowing that Emerson was exposed in a public area and that, pursuant to department policy, he would need to be dressed before he could be transported to police headquarters if any illegal drugs or weapons were found in the apartment, Mazzio asked Emerson \u201cwhat clothing he wanted\u201d to wear. Emerson identified the specific items of clothing he wanted, including a pair of jean shorts on the floor by the bed, and Mazzio relayed that information to the officers inside the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Upon hearing Mazzio\u2019s request, Pederson found the requested jean shorts on the floor of the apartment and, acting in accordance with department policy, searched the shorts and emptied the pockets before giving them to Mazzio. Pederson removed a video-store card, a \u201cNewport cigarette box,\u201d and some money from the shorts. In giving the shorts to Mazzio, Pederson did not inform him about the search, and Mazzio was unaware that anything had been found in the pockets of the jean shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Upon receiving the requested clothes, including the jean shorts, from Pederson, Mazzio asked Emerson \u201cif these were the ones he wanted, and [Emerson] said yes.\u201d Mazzio gave the clothes to Emerson, and he put them on.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The objective purpose of Corporal Mazzio\u2019s two questions\u2014 to allow Emerson, who was wearing only boxer shorts, to get dressed\u2014\u201cwas entirely legitimate\u201d and Mazzio \u201cdid not deviate from that purpose.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 353, 360, 416 S.E.2d 669, 672-73 (1992) (holding that, when the purpose of the police\u2019s encounter with defendant is entirely legitimate and the police do not deviate from that purpose, there is no \u201cinterrogation\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda). </em>Indeed, the only viable alternative would have been to leave Emerson out in public view and transport him to the police station in his exposed condition, which, under the circumstances was neither necessary nor acceptable. Moreover, except to find out what clothes Emerson wanted to wear and to confirm that he had indeed gotten the clothes Emerson had asked for, Mazzio made no attempt to gain information from Emerson about the clothing or its contents, or about anything else related to the search inside the apartment for illegal drugs and weapons. \u201cWe also note the total absence of any evidence that the questioning here was intended or designed to produce an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 743, 746, 348 S.E.2d 9, 12 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We conclude, therefore, that, viewed objectively, Corporal Mazzio\u2019s conduct manifests no deliberate design on the part of the police other than to allow Emerson, who was wearing only boxer shorts at the time, to get dressed. Thus, we find that Mazzio\u2019s conduct merely amounted to \u201cwords or actions by the police which are normally attendant to ... custody\u201d when the person in custody is not fully clothed. <em>Wright, </em>2 Va.App. at 746, 348 S.E.2d at 12. Consequently, we hold that, despite the incriminating outcome of Mazzio\u2019s words and conduct, Emerson was not subjected to the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of \u201cinterrogation\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda, </em>and <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were not implicated. <em>Cf. Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 303 n. 10, 100 S.Ct. at 1691 n. 10 (noting \u201cby way of example,\u201d that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>where the police, in furtherance of their attendant duties, do \u201cno more than ... drive past the site of the concealed weapon while taking the most direct route to the police station\u201d and the suspect, upon seeing that site, \u201cblurt[s] out that he would show the officers where the gun was located, it could not seriously be argued that this \u2018subtle compulsion\u2019 ... constituted \u2018interrogation\u2019 within the meaning of the <em>Miranda </em>opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Emerson\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Emerson contends the evidence, which was entirely circumstantial, was insufficient to prove he intended to distribute the cocaine found in his jean shorts. Specifically, he argues the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was not sufficiently convincing to exclude the reasonable hypothesis of innocence that he possessed the cocaine found in his shorts for his own personal use. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Bright v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 248, 250, 356 S.E.2d 443, 444, (1987). \u201c \u2018In so doing, we must ... regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019\u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, 26 </em>Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998) (quoting <em>Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 295, 373 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1988)). We are further mindful that the \u201ccredibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Crawley v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 372, 375, 512 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1999). We will not disturb the conviction unless it is plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Sutphin v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 241, 243, 337 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cWhere an offense consists of an act combined with a particular intent, proof of the intent is essential to the conviction.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). \u201cBecause direct proof of intent [to distribute drugs] is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). \u201cHowever, the Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that flow from the evidence, not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In considering an appellant\u2019s alternate hypothesis of innocence in a circumstantial evidence case, we must determine \u201cnot whether there is some evidence to support\u201d the appellant\u2019s hypothesis of innocence, but, rather, \u201cwhether a reasonable [fact finder], upon consideration of all the evidence, could have rejected [the appellant\u2019s] theories in his defense and found him guilty of [the charged crime] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 513, 578 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2003) (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, \u201ccircumstantial evidence is not viewed in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 578 S.E.2d at 786. \u201c While no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the \u201ccombined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>\u201dDerr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 425, 410 S.E.2d 662, 669 (1991) (quoting <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 273, 257 S.E.2d 808, 818 (1979) (quoting <em>Karnes v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 758, 764, 99 S.E. 562, 564 (1919))). \u2018Whether an alternate hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact and, therefore, is binding on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Archer v.

Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 20, 37, 502 S.E.2d 122, 130 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc), \u201cthe absence of any paraphernalia suggestive of personal use,\u201d <em>id., </em>the presence of \u201cequipment related to drug distribution,\u201d <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 493, 545 S.E.2d 541, 547 (2001), and the presence of firearms, <em>see Glasco v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 763, 775, 497 S.E.2d 150, 156 (1998), <em>aff'd, </em>257 Va. 433, 513 S.E.2d 137 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Here, the evidence showed that Emerson possessed 4.01 grams of powder cocaine packaged in seven plastic bag corners and $345 in denominations of fourteen $20 bills, six $10 bills, and one $5 bill. He also had a small electronic scale and a large quantity of .38-caliber and 9-millimeter-caliber ammunition and a gun holster in his apartment. Emerson also possessed marijuana and a pipe used exclusively for smoking marijuana. However, no devices for consuming cocaine were found in the apartment. The Commonwealth\u2019s narcotics expert, Detective Pederson, testified that the denominations of the money Emerson had were consistent with the sale of cocaine. She further testified that the cocaine Emerson possessed had a street value of approximately $400 and that cocaine users typically purchase only $20 to $50 worth of cocaine each time they buy it. Pederson concluded that, based on these factors, along with the presence of the ammunition and gun holster and the scale to weigh the cocaine prior to distribution, and the absence of any devices with which Emerson could personally consume the cocaine, the cocaine recovered from Emerson\u2019s shorts was inconsistent with personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The trial court could properly conclude from this evidence that Emerson intended to distribute the cocaine found in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>possession. Although Detective Pederson also testified that a cocaine user \u201ccould consume seven packets of cocaine in a period of an hour\u201d if he had \u201cthat bad of a habit,\u201d there is no evidence in the record that Emerson used cocaine or that he possessed it for his personal use. We hold, therefore, that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Emerson possessed the cocaine with the requisite intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\">. Emerson was also charged with possession of marijuana, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1. After the trial court denied his motion to suppress, Emerson pled guilty to this charge and was convicted of it. He does not challenge this conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\">. It is unclear from the record whether Pederson discovered the suspected drugs inside the cigarette pack before or after giving the jean shorts to Mazzio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">. Although Coxporal Mazzio specifically <em>asked </em>Emerson \"what clothes he wanted\u201d and later <em>asked </em>Emerson if the jean shorts Pederson had given him were the shorts he wanted, Emerson does not argue that Mazzio\u2019s questions constituted \u201cexpress questioning\u201d in violation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights. Instead, he claims solely that Mazzio's questions were the \"functional equivalent of express questioning\u201d amounting to an illegal interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
