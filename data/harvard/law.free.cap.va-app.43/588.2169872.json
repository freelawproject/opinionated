Styles, Jr. appeals from the November 25, 2003 circuit court order denying his petition for enforcement of a grievance hearing decision by the Personnel Board for the City of Colonial Heights (the City). On appeal, Styles contends (1) \u201cthe procedural violations by [the City] are a sufficient basis to reinstate [him] to his former position,\u201d (2) \u201cthe decision of the Personnel Board is final and binding on the City,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe City Manager\u2019s determination is appeal-able.\u201d The City asserts this case \u201cmust be dismissed because it is not an appeal from a final order\u201d and that \u201cthis Court does not have jurisdiction over an appeal from a determination made under [] Code \u00a7 15.2-1507.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we agree this Court does not have jurisdiction over this matter and, therefore, dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Styles was a police officer employed by the City. On November 17, 2002, Styles fell asleep while on duty in his marked police vehicle. On December 5, 2002, he was terminated from his job. Styles challenged his termination by filing a grievance with the City. On March 17, 2003, a three member panel of the City\u2019s Personnel Board conducted a hearing on his grievance. On March 31, 2003, the panel decided to reinstate Styles. On April 10, 2003, the City Manager notified Styles that the Board\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the law and City policies and, accordingly, the City would not reinstate Styles. Styles appealed the City Manager\u2019s decision to the circuit court. The circuit court noted that, under Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u00a7 15.2-1507, the City Manager is empowered to make the final decision whether the relief granted by a grievance panel is consistent with the City\u2019s written policy and concluded that the City Manager\u2019s decision was therefore \u201cnot appealable.\u201d From that decision, Styles appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 17.1-405 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">Any aggrieved party may appeal to the Court of Appeals from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">1. Any final decision of a circuit court on appeal from (i) a decision of an administrative agency, or (ii) a grievance hearing decision issued pursuant to \u00a7 2.2-3005;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">^ ^ i{i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">3. Any final judgment, order, or decree of a circuit court involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">h. A final grievance hearing decision issued pursuant to subsection B of \u00a7 2.2-3007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Code \u00a7 2.2-3000, <em>et seq., </em>set forth the State Grievance Procedure, \u201ca system for handling state employee complaints arising in the workplace. . . .\u201d <em>Pound v. Dept, of Game and Inland Fisheries, </em>40 Va.App. 59, 64, 577 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2003). Grievance hearing decisions appealable to this Court arise only under the State Grievance Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">\u201cThe General Assembly also requires every city with over fifteen employees to provide all of its non-probationary employees, with certain listed exceptions, access to an employee grievance procedure.\u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Hay, </em>258 Va. 217, 220, 518 S.E.2d 314, 315 (1999). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.2-1506. \u201cUnder Code \u00a7 15.2-1507, grievance procedures adopted by a local governing body must include certain components of the state grievance procedure.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Norfolk Community Services Board, </em>260 Va. 334, 339, 533 S.E.2d 922, 924 (2000). Although Code \u00a7 15.2-1507 requires grievance procedures established by localities to be \u201cconsistent with the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of Chapter 10 (\u00a7 2.2-1000 et seq.) of Title 2.2,\u201d the locality procedures are distinct from the state procedures and arise under a separate statutory structure. A decision rendered under the locality procedure simply is not a \u201cdecision issued pursuant to \u00a7 2.2-3005\u201d or a \u201cfinal grievance hearing decision issued pursuant to subsection B of \u00a7 2.2-3007.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Accordingly, while not adopting the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the City Manager\u2019s decision is \u201cnot appealable,\u201d we determine only that this Court does not have jurisdiction over this matter and we dismiss Styles\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
