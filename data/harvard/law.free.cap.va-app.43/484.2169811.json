The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the trial court erred in refusing to enter the proposed QDRO as being inconsistent with the final decree of divorce. We hold that the trial court erred in denying wife\u2019s request for entry of the QDRO. Thus we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">The facts are undisputed. The parties were married August 30, 1972, and a final decree of divorce was entered May 10, 2000. It provided that wife \u201cis awarded fifty percent of the marital share of [husband\u2019s] interest in the WMATA [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] pension if, when and as received by him from WMATA.\u201d Effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>January 29, 2001, husband was permanently disqualified from his position at WMATA due to an eye injury. WMATA approved a \u201cdisability allowance\u201d of $1,728 on January 18, 2002 \u201cin accordance with the ... Retirement Plan.\u201d Husband did not pay wife any share of this allowance. On April 25, 2002, wife requested a QDRO that she alleged in her pleadings had been pre-approved by the WMATA on March 27, 2002. The trial court requested that wife make specified changes to this QDRO, which she did. On July 1, 2002, the trial court entered this amended QDRO, which was endorsed by both parties, but it was later rejected by the WMATA pension plan administrator because it used language other than that approved by the plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wife filed a second Motion for Entry of a QDRO on August 8, 2003. In her accompanying memorandum, she argued that husband\u2019s disability allowance was part of his \u201cWMATA pension\u201d described in the final decree of divorce and that she was entitled to receive her marital share of this allowance. By letter opinion, the trial court denied wife\u2019s motion for entry of this QDRO, ruling that husband\u2019s \u201cdisability as distinguished from his pension is not authorized by the Final Decree of Divorce.\u201d Wife appeals from this ruling. On September 11, 2003 the trial court also denied wife\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration and to Stay the Ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(l) provides that \u201c[t]he court may direct payment of a percentage of the marital share of any pension ... or retirement benefits, whether vested or nonvested, which constitutes marital property and whether payable in a lump sum or over a period of time.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Because the meaning of \u201cany pension ... or retirement benefits\u201d is a question of law involving the construction of Code \u00a7 20-107.3, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo. See Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003); <em>Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (\u201cAlthough the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">On appeal, wife contends that the language in the final decree of divorce awarding her one half the marital share of husband\u2019s \u201cWMATA pension\u201d also encompasses husband\u2019s payments from the WMATA \u201cTotal and Permanent Disability Allowance\u201d and that she is entitled to the same share of this allowance. In her memorandum submitted with the motion for the entry of the QDRO, wife contended that husband\u2019s \u201cTotal and Permanent Disability Allowance\u201d is one of three types of awards provided by the \u201cWMATA pension.\u201d She argued that because \u201c[t]here are multiple ways for an employee, who is vested in The WMATA Plan, ... [to] draw an \u2018allowance\u2019 from The WMATA Plan,\u201d either by normal retirement, early retirement, or disability, the language of the final decree should be construed to include husband\u2019s disability allowance. We hold that husband\u2019s \u201cTotal and Permanent Disability Allowance\u201d is part of the \u201cpension\u201d contemplated by the final decree. By the express terms of the WMATA Plan the disability allowance supplants any other retirement allowance, and is calculated in the same way as the normal retirement allowance. Thus, the trial court erred in denying wife her share of the disability allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The trial court has limited authority to modify a final decree of divorce pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">The court shall have the continuing authority and jurisdiction to make any additional orders necessary to effectuate and enforce any order entered pursuant to this section, including the authority to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Modify any order ... intended to affect or divide <em>any pension, </em>profit-sharing or deferred compensation plan or retirement benefits pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code or other applicable federal laws, only for the purpose of establishing or maintaining the order as a qualified domestic relations order or to revise or conform its terms so as to effectuate the expressed intent of the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A86\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Additionally, a \u201cQDRO may not modify a final divorce decree simply to adjust its terms in light of the parties\u2019 changed circumstances but must be consistent with the substantive provisions of the original decree.\u201d <em>Hastie v. Hastie, </em>29 Va.App. 776, 780, 514 S.E.2d 800, 803 (1999) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Applying this standard, we must decide whether the QDRO effectuates the intent of, and is consistent with, the final decree. Specifically, we must decide whether the words \u201cWMATA pension\u201d in the final decree apply to the provision of husband\u2019s WMATA \u201cRetirement Trust Agreement and Plan\u201d that is denoted \u201cTotal and Permanent Disability Allowance.\u201d We addressed the issue of whether a disability allowance could effectively be a pension in <em>Asgari v. Asgari, </em>33 Va.App. 393, 533 S.E.2d 643 (2000). In that case, the husband contested an award of his Virginia Retirement System (VRS) disability benefits to wife at divorce, arguing that they were \u201cdistinguishable from the \u2018extra\u2019 benefit of retirement \u2018earned as a result of longevity.\u2019 \u201d We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">A pension, by definition, is a retirement benefit paid regularly, with the amount of such based generally on the length of employment and amount of wages or salary of pensioner. It is deferred compensation for services rendered. Clearly, the \u201call inclusive language of ... Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) permitting the court to direct payment of a percentage of the marital share of \u2018any pension\u2019 \u201d does not suggest the exclusion of \u201cdisability pensions\u201d from the statutory scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_4\"><em>Id. </em>at 401, 533 S.E.2d at 647 (quoting Peter N. Swisher et al., <em>Virginia Family Law </em>\u00a7 11-17, at 451 (2d ed.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>We further reasoned that the VRS plan contemplated the disability benefit as a retirement benefit because it was computed as a function of husband\u2019s employment service, and was earned and accrued during the marriage. We held that \u201cthe court correctly distributed the benefit as a \u2018pension.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 533 S.E.2d at 648; <em>see also Knies v. Knies, </em>96 Wash.App. 243, 979 P.2d 482, 486 (1999) (holding that husband\u2019s disability payments were effectively a retirement benefit and subject to division in accordance with the original decree); <em>Newsom v. Petrilli </em>919 S.W.2d 481, 484 (Tex.App.1996) (holding that disability benefits earned during marriage were \u201cpension and retirement benefits\u201d and subject to division); <em>Simmons v. Simmons, </em>568 S.W.2d 169, 170 (Tex.Civ.App.1978) (holding that husband\u2019s disability benefits were a function of his compensation during marriage and thus properly divisible).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we hold that the WMATA disability allowance is a retirement benefit, and contemplated by the language \u201cWMATA pension\u201d in the final decree of divorce. The WMATA \u201cTransit Employees\u2019 Retirement Trust Agreement and Plan\u201d is a pension plan providing \u201cretirement income and disability payments for eligible employees of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\u201d Section 8 of the Plan designates three different types of \u201callowances\u201d that the Plan provides for employees: a \u201cNormal Retirement Allowance,\u201d an \u201cEarly Retirement Allowance,\u201d and a \u201cTotal and Permanent Disability Allowance,\u201d with eligibility based on the circumstances surrounding retirement. The Plan specifies eligibility for the disability allowance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">Any employee under this Plan who shall become totally and permanently disabled by reason of an accident or sickness before becoming eligible for benefits in accordance with Subsection (a) hereof ... shall be entitled to receive a disability allowance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The WMATA approved husband for the \u201cTotal and Permanent Disability Allowance\u201d on January 18, 2002 following a disabling eye injury which permanently terminated his employment. In effect, husband\u2019s disability allowance was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>replacement for the normal retirement allowance he would have received had he not been injured. Under the Plan guidelines, employees are entitled to receive only one type of allowance under the WMATA pension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">No employee shall be entitled to a disability allowance at the same time that the employee receives either a normal retirement allowance under Subsection (a) or an early retirement allowance under Subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Similar to the VRS plan in <em>Asgari, </em>the WMATA Plan provides that \u201cthe amount of the disability allowance shall be computed in the same manner as provided above for the normal retirement allowance,\u201d based on the number of employee\u2019s years of service and wages earned. Like the other allowances provided under the Plan, husband\u2019s disability allowance was earned and accrued during the marriage. Awarding wife one half of the marital share of husband\u2019s disability allowance is consistent with, and effectuates the intent of the final decree award from husband\u2019s \u201cWMATA pension.\u201d We therefore hold that the trial court erred in denying wife\u2019s motion for entry of the QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, and order that the QDRO be entered consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">. The plan requested that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">Total and Permanent Disability Allowance. In the event that the Participant receives a Total and Permanent Disability Allowance under Section 8(c) of the Plan, the Alternate Payee shall be entitled to a monthly payment in the portion defined in Paragraph 5 above, beginning when the Participant begins to receive the Disability Allowance and ending when Disability Allowance payments from the Plan to the Participant cease, and shall be subject to all the conditions of the Disability Allowance in the Plan.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
