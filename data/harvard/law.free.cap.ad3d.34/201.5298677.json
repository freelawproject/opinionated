Yates, J.), rendered December 1, 1999, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of murder in the second degree, attempted murder in the second degree, criminal use of a firearm in the first degree (two counts), criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degrees and reckless endangerment in the first degree, and sentencing him to an aggregate term of 26 years to life, modified, on the law and as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, to the extent of vacating the sentences and remanding for resentencing, and otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Defendant\u2019s challenges to the People\u2019s summation are unpreserved and we decline to review them in the interest of justice. Were we to review these claims, we would find the challenged remarks generally constituted fair comment on the evidence made in response to defense arguments, which challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the credibility of the People\u2019s witnesses, and that the summation did not deprive defendant of a fair trial (see <em>People v Overlee, </em>236 AD2d 133 [1997], <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 976 [1998]; <em>People v D\u2019Alessandro, </em>184 AD2d 114, 118-119 [1992], <em>lv denied </em>81 NY2d 884 [1993]).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s contrary contention, the court appropriately exercised its discretion in admitting a photograph of the location of the fatal entrance wound, which was relevant to the trial issues of intent and cause of death (see <em>People v Pobliner, </em>32 NY2d 356, 369-370 [1973], <em>cert denied </em>416 US 905 [1974]). However, even were we to accept defendant\u2019s claim that the photograph was improvidently admitted, we would, in any event, find the error harmless because the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, given the incriminating testimony of six eyewitnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Finally, we agree with defendant that the court improvidently exercised its discretion when it denied substitute counsel\u2019s request for a one-day adjournment of sentencing to allow trial counsel to appear. The court had conducted a postverdict competency hearing in which a new attorney represented defendant so that his trial attorney would be available as a witness, if necessary. When, after finding defendant competent, the court proceeded with sentencing, substitute counsel unsuccessfully complained that he was unprepared to represent defendant at sentencing, was not sufficiently familiar with the case, and had not spoken to defendant\u2019s family. We conclude that, given the circumstances in which substitute counsel found himself, it is reasonable to conclude that he could not have effectively represented defendant at sentencing (see <em>People v Jones, </em>15 AD3d 208 [2005]). Although, in these circumstances, trial and substitute counsel should have made proper arrangements for one or the other to be ready to represent defendant at sentencing immediately upon conclusion of the hearing\u2014and it would have been preferable had substitute counsel been more specific about his inability to proceed effectively or had expressed his reasons moments earlier\u2014the requested single-day delay was unquestionably minimal and the court lacked reasonable grounds to deny it <em>(see People v Stella, </em>188 AD2d 318 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We believe that substitute counsel\u2019s statement that trial counsel was then unavailable, but would be available the very next morning to represent defendant at his sentencing, compels the reasonable interpretation that he was requesting a one-day adjournment. Our dissenting colleagues maintain that defendant\u2019s complaint on appeal\u2014to wit, his challenge to the court\u2019s direction to proceed immediately\u2014is unpreserved and unworthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>of review in the interest of justice because defendant did not specifically request an adjournment and belatedly objected to proceeding that day. We respectfully disagree. Although the underlying procedural issue was somewhat different, in <em>People v Mezon </em>(80 NY2d 155 [1992]) the Court of Appeals gave attorneys and trial judges general guidance about how to interpret the type of circumstances that often accompanies the issue of preservation, as we now face on this appeal. The Court said (80 NY2d at 160-161): \u201cOnce the trial court stated unequivocally that it would permit an oral motion, any further objection by the People would have been futile. The law does not require litigants to make repeated pointless protests after the court has made its position clear. Nor does the law require litigants who have unsuccessfully sought a ruling to boycott the remainder of the proceeding in order to avoid forfeiture of their claims. In this case, the People\u2019s conduct made it clear that they did not voluntarily intend to forgo their right to a written suppression motion. No further protest was required.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">We believe this language discourages a hypertechnical interpretation of circumstances where the words used by courts and lawyers, while inexact, are clear enough to convey the parties\u2019 obvious intentions. We also disagree with the notion that the record bespeaks gamesmanship when substitute counsel\u2019s entire and legitimate goal was to have someone with greater knowledge speak on defendant\u2019s behalf about sentencing (which in this case totaled 26 years to life) merely one day later. We thus choose to interpret what happened here as a preserved request. Concur\u2014Buckley, PJ., Marlow and C\u00e1tterson, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Sullivan and McGuire, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part in a memorandum by McGuire, J., as follows: I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s determination to vacate the sentences and remand for a new sentencing proceeding. In the first place, defendant never protested that the court should have granted a one-day adjournment so that trial counsel could be present. To be sure, hearing counsel voiced his objection to proceeding with sentencing in the absence of trial counsel and stated he had spoken that very day with trial counsel, who \u201cindicated he would be available\u201d the next morning \u201cto be heard.\u201d But the fact remains that hearing counsel never asked for an adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Even assuming this protest should be construed as a request for a one-day adjournment, defendant\u2019s claim that the request should have been granted is not preserved in any event and should not be reviewed in the interest of justice. An objection, of course, must be timely <em>(see People v Albert, </em>85 NY2d 851 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>[1995]). As discussed below, defendant\u2019s protest was untimely and was inexcusably so. Permitting him to press this claim on appeal encourages the gamesmanship and waste of public resources that preservation rules are designed to prevent (see <em>People v Dekle, </em>56 NY2d 835 [1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Unquestionably, defendant\u2019s objection was belated, coming as it did not only after the sentencing proceeding had commenced, but after the prosecutor had finished her presentation on sentencing. Moreover, before proceeding to sentencing the court stated on the record \u201csince we have had the minutes for a long period of time and the sentencing has already been delayed several months I think we should proceed directly to sentencing.\u201d Defendant still did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The tardiness of the eventual objection is all the more inexcusable given that the record makes clear that an earlier, off-the-record discussion occurred in which, at the very least, the subject of proceeding to sentencing was discussed. As the court stated to hearing counsel in response to his tardy objection, \u201cand you were reminded about that conversation and you said okay.\u201d Although the record is equivocal with respect to precisely which conversation hearing counsel had been reminded about, the point is that counsel not only voiced no objection about proceeding to sentencing, he \u201csaid okay.\u201d For counsel to voice no objection until after hearing everything the prosecutor had to say about sentencing is inexplicable. Its timing (and, as discussed below, its content) suggests, moreover, that counsel did not take seriously his own objection. Even if counsel was not seeking to obtain an unwarranted advantage by waiting until after the prosecutor had concluded, counsel was wasting the court\u2019s time. As the trial court stated, moreover, on a previous date it had given notice to counsel of the possibility that sentencing would take place that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">For all these reasons, the trial court stated it was \u201cpretty astonished\u201d to hear the objection. The majority does not take issue with anything stated by the trial court in this regard, yet nonetheless concludes that the record does not \u201cbespeak[ ] gamesmanship.\u201d However counsel\u2019s conduct properly is characterized, it cannot be thought commendable and should not be countenanced. Although the majority states that it \u201cchoose[s] to interpret what happened here as a preserved request,\u201d it does not offer any explanation of how such an untimely objection can preserve a question of law for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">With its reference to \u201cthe circumstances in which substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>counsel found himself,\u201d the majority suggests that hearing counsel was something of a hapless victim. This suggestion is refuted by the record, and the majority\u2019s tendentious use of the phrase \u201csubstitute counsel\u201d is also at odds with the record. Moreover, this suggestion is inconsistent with the majority\u2019s own recognition that \u201ctrial and substitute counsel should have made proper arrangements for one or the other to be ready to represent defendant at sentencing immediately upon conclusion of the hearing.\u201d In stating that \u201cit would have been preferable had substitute counsel been more specific about his inability to proceed effectively,\u201d the majority seems to recognize the utterly conclusory character of counsel\u2019s claim. Nonetheless, the majority not only swallows this claim whole, it asserts, also without explanation, that it is \u201creasonable to conclude that he could not have effectively represented defendant at sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">In any event, on this record, I would not conclude that defendant\u2019s right to counsel of his choice was violated. As the Supreme Court has recently stated, it has \u201crecognized a trial court\u2019s wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness and against the demands of its calendar\u201d <em>(United States v Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US \u2014, \u2014 ,126 S Ct 2557, 2565-2566 [2006] [citation omitted]; <em>see also People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264, 271 [1980] [\u201cAlthough a defendant has the constitutionally guaranteed right to be defended by counsel of his own choosing, ... a defendant may not employ such right as a means to delay judicial proceedings\u201d]). Here, the court had good reasons to avoid further delays. Sentencing in this exceptionally serious case had already been delayed for more than six months. The reason for this protracted delay was the postverdict competency proceedings, which concluded with the court agreeing with the prosecution\u2019s witnesses that defendant\u2019s ostensible mental incapacity reflected malingering. Accordingly, even if counsel\u2019s objection implicitly sought a one-day adjournment, the court could only have been skeptical about defense requests entailing any additional delay. Moreover, the court stated without contradiction that on the date of the last proceeding hearing counsel advised the court that trial counsel was off the case and hearing counsel was going to represent de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>fendant. Although the record is somewhat equivocal, it appears as well that hearing counsel also did not take issue with the court\u2019s statement that it had called and given counsel \u201cseveral days notice\u201d of the possibility that sentencing would take place on the next court date. The court, of course, \u201c[o]bviously . . . must set its own calendar\u201d <em>(People v Goss, 87 </em>NY2d 792, 797 [1996]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">That hearing counsel stated at sentencing he was at a \u201cdisadvantage\u201d because he was not trial counsel and asserted that he did not have anything prepared in mitigation is of no moment. These statements simply do not establish either that counsel did not have an adequate opportunity to prepare for sentencing or that he was ineffective. The vacuous generality of the statements also undermines defendant\u2019s claim. If some specific reason why trial counsel\u2019s presence was necessary had been given, the court undoubtedly would have considered it despite the prior and lengthy delays. Additionally, neither the extent of counsel\u2019s preparation nor the issue of whether defendant was prejudiced in any way by the absence of trial counsel can be determined on this record <em>(see People v Lopez, </em>28 AD3d 234, 235 [2006], <em>lv denied </em>7 NY3d 758 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Finally, against the \u201cunquestionably minimal\u201d nature of the additional delay the majority believes the trial court should have accepted, the court was entitled to weigh in the balance something that busy trial courts unquestionably know: for some unexpected reason all parties might not be available the next day. In this regard, moreover, the trial court was entitled to be concerned that defendant\u2014whose malingering already had caused more than six months of delay\u2014might take advantage of the \u201cminimal\u201d delay and cause a longer delay. In sum, the majority does an injustice to the trial court with its assertion that the court \u201clacked reasonable grounds to deny\u201d the ostensible request for a one-day delay. For good reasons, the court was \u201cpretty astonished\u201d at counsel\u2019s objection and the majority should explain why, by its lights, the trial court did not act reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">I concur fully in the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s arguments for reversal of the judgment of conviction are without merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">. The majority\u2019s suggestion that counsel\u2019s objection was late by a mere matter of \u201cmoments\u201d is not defensible. The transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>sentencing presentation runs some seven pages. However long it took for the prosecutor to make her presentation is not decisive in any event. The point is that no objection was voiced earlier, not when the trial court stated \u201cwe should proceed directly to sentencing\u201d given the extensive delays that already had occurred, and not earlier still, during the off-the-record discussion. Indeed, on this record the only fair conclusion is that counsel not only failed to object, he actually said \u201cokay\u201d when the trial court discussed proceeding directly to sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">. If defendant disputes the court\u2019s statements (i.e., that hearing counsel had advised the court that trial counsel was off the case and that the court had provided \u201cseveral days notice\u201d), defendant is free to seek to develop a record supporting his position by moving pursuant to CPL 440.20 to set aside the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
