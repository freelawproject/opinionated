According to his version of the occurrence, a lady was standing with a little child on the crosswalk, apparently dazed by the noise, confusion, and turmoil incident to the alarm, and he, after hallooing to them without effect, ran to them and pushed them out of danger, but was immediately struck himself. He is corroborated by three witnesses, who are apparently disinterested. On behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>defendant, however, a great number of witnesses testified that there was no woman or child in jeopardy at all, but that the plaintiff stood upon the crosswalk with his back toward the defendant\u2019s wagon,' beckoning with his club to the driver of the wagon to come on, and that he was struck and injured because he not only failed to get out of the way, but actually backed in front of the horses. The witnesses all agree that the wagon was driven as fast as the horses could gallop, and that no attempt was made to slacken their speed until the collision was imminent. The case was submitted to the jury in a careful and accurate charge, and the verdict must be deemed to establish the issue of fact in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The defendant is not absolved from liability for negligence merely because, by the terms of the act incorporating it (section 2, c. 1016, p. 2064, Laws 1895), it is given \u201cthe right of way in the streets of Brooklyn.\u201d Such right of way is necessarily subject to the preservation of the safety of those who may be lawfully upon the streets at the time of a fire, and, while the emergency under which the defendant\u2019s servants are called upon to act undoubtedly justifies speed in driving to the scene of disaster, such speed must be exerted with reasonable care and a due regard to the lives and limbs of those who may be met upon the way. In the eagerness to save property, the value of human life is sometimes lost sight of. The evidence indicated that there was no difficulty in seeing the plaintiff on the evening of the occurrence complained of, and is sufficient to justify the jury in concluding that the defendant\u2019s servants were negligent in the manner in which the horses were driven upon the occasion in question. It was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to endeavor to save the woman and child, and the consequent exposure of himself to danger in so doing was not contributory negligence as matter of law. Eckert v.
