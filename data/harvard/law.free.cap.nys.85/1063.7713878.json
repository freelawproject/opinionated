But one question is presented, viz., is proof of residence within the state essential to confer jurisdiction ? We think it is. The order was made pursuant to section 435 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>of the Code of Civil Procedure. The language of this section designating the status of the person upon whom its provisions may become operative is \u201cupon a defendant residing within the state.\u201d The record is barren of such proof. The court was within jurisdiction, and the order is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Order reversed, with $io costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
