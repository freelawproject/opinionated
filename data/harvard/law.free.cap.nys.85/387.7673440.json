On the trial there was some evidence which tended to show that $37 worth of the goods were <em>&lt; </em>purchased by the defendant in person, but concededly the remainder f was supplied to a coachman in the employ of the Mar\u00f3n Stable Com- j pany, upon the authority of the defendant\u2019s wife, for use in the main- \u25a0 tenance of an equipage which she had hired of the stable company with her husband\u2019s knowledge and consent. There was no pretense that the defendant had in any way expressly authorized or consented to the supply of the materials delivered to the coachman, nor was there any evidence which tended to show that the defendant had by any course of dealing or previous transaction with the plaintiffs clothed his wife with inferential authority to bind him- by her purchases. The defendant\u2019s liability was therefore sought to be predicated wholly of a supposed agency of the wife for her husband arising from the fact of the marital relation above, and to that effect was the: trial justice\u2019s charge to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiffs. That such is not the law, and that the question of the wife\u2019s agency for her husband is in every case one of fact, arising either from his neglect to- supply her sufficiently with necessaries, or from: his authority expressly given or fairly to be inferred from the circumstances, was recently clearly ruled by our court of last resort. Wanamaker v. Weaver, 176 N. Y. 75, 68 N. E. 135. It may not be unfairly urged that, since the defendant .had indulged an equipage for his wife, he had impliedly consented also to the supply of materials reasonably necessary to its use and proper maintenance. But even so, the defendant had provided his wife with a weekly allowance of $150 for her personal expenses, and there was not a scintilla of evidence that this sum was not reasonably sufficient for every purpose. Until the husband\u2019s neglect to supply his wife with necessaries appears, the constituent of the right to recover against him by one who supplies her without- the husband\u2019s assent, express or implied, is wanting. Wanamaker v. Weaver, supra. The trial justice, however, instructed the jury, in effect, that they were to constitute themselves the censors of the defendant\u2019s liberality, and without anything to show his means, or his wonted manner of keeping his family, to speculate in this respect, and to pronounce the defendant liable to the plaintiff, if they (the jury) opined that the defendant\u2019s allowance to his wife fell short of that it ought to have been. The repugnance of this to the law and reason is apparent without argument. There was evidence which tended to show that the goods were supplied to the coachman upon the wife\u2019s personal credit, and, if such was found to have been the fact, the defendant was not liable, although the goods may have been necessaries. Tiemeyer v. Turnquist, 85 N. Y. 516, 39 Am. Rep. 674; O\u2019Connell v. Shera, 66 App. Div. 467, 73 N. Y. Supp. 231; Ehrich v. Bucki, 7 Misc. Rep. 118, 27 N. Y. Supp. 247. Whether or not there was evidence which tended in the direction stated was a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tion of law to be determined by the court, and it was error therefore to permit the jury to \u201csay whether or not there was any such evidence in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
