Y., and doing business under the firm name of Smith &amp; Rogers. The defendant resided, and still resides, at Syracuse, N. Y. Upon 12th February, 1800, the plaintiffs and defendant entered into the following contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-13\">\u201cMemorandum of agreement entered into this 12th day of February, 1900, between Smith &amp; Rogers, of Binghamton, New York, party of the first part, and Joseph R.

Thereafter plaintiffs furnished cigars to the defendant to the amount of $281, upon which the defendant had paid the sum of $80. These cigars had all been sold by the defendant, and the accounts therefor collected. This action is brought to recover the moneys which the defendant had received upon these accounts, claimed to be held by the defendant in a fiduciary capacity. At the trial the plaintiffs recovered a verdict for $210.06. From the judgment entered upon this verdict, and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the order denying a motion for a new trial, the defendant has here appealed. Further facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b540-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Rogers, who now is the owner and holder of the claim. This further defense is based upon the agreement dissolving the partnership. In' that agreement the partnership of Smith &amp; Rogers was declared dissolved, except as therein specified, and it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201cThat the said parties have adjusted all their financial matters between themselves except as to certain book accounts against divers parties aggregating $712.65, a list of which each party has giving the names of the parties and the several amounts owing by them which said accounts are left open for collection, and the avails of which, when collected, or any part thereof, shall be divided equally between said parties, share and share alike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">There is in this agreement no assignment of the claim to the plaintiff Rogers. For the purpose of collecting this claim and others, the partnership was deemed still existing. There is no proof whatever to sustain the defendant\u2019s further defense that the plaintiff Smith has no interest in the event of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">There is another defense urged upon the trial and urged here, although not pleaded, to the effect that the plajntiff Smith had released the defendant from, his moiety of this claim, and that therefore he was not interested in this action, and was not a proper plaintiff. Prior to the contract which forms the basis of this action, the plaintiff Smith had had dealings with one Cora B. Raynor, the daughter of the defendant Williams. There was a dispute as to whether the defendant or Cora B. Raynor was the party liable in those dealings. The amount of the indebtedness of one or the other to Smith was the sum of $826. This claim was, after the dissolution of the partnership, settled by Smith upon the payment by Mrs. Raynor of $500. Smith thereupon gave a general release, which recited that, in consideration of $500 paid by Cora B. Raynor, the said Smith released her and Joseph R. Williams from all claims which he had or ever had had, or which his heirs, executors, or administrators shall have, against said parties. At this time, by the partnership dissolution agreement, the plaintiff Rogers had in charge the collection of the partnership accounts. The moneys paid were $326 and some interest\u2014less than the amount of Smith\u2019s individual claim against Mrs. Raynor. Under such circumstances, in consideration of $500 received from Mrs. Ray-nor, this release must be construed as releasing only the individual claims which the plaintiff Smith had, and cannot operate to release partnership claims in which he had a joint interest, but which were apparently in no way contemplated by this release.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">The main insistence of the defendant, however, is that these moneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>were not received in a fiduciary capacity, that the contract was simply a conditional sale, and that the defendant at no time became the agent of the plaintiffs for the sale of these goods. The plaintiffs, however, upon this, argument, claimed that this was a simple consignment to an agent to sell goods for the plaintiffs, with a provision for compensation as whatever might be received by him over and above the sum mentioned as the price of the article. I cannot agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of this contract. It is clear to my mind that these goods were in any event to be paid for by the defendant at a price named. If any purchaser of the goods from the defendant should prove insolvent, the loss \"would fall upon the defendant, and not upon the plaintiffs. As to the goods themselves, there was no such confidence placed in the defendant by the plaintiffs as characterizes an agency. No right was reserved to control or in any way to interfere with the sales which the defendant should make of cigars, when once obtained. The usual indicia of agency are wanting. The sale is a conditional one, with title remaining in the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">There is, however, another provision in the contract which is most significant. It is provided not only that the title of the property shall remain in the plaintiffs until the price named is paid, but also that the accounts for the sales are until that time to be the property of the plaintiffs. It is apparent that these accounts were to be collected by the defendant. In making that collection the defendant acted as the agent of the plaintiffs, and the moneys collected he held as their trustee until the price of these cigars should be paid to the plaintiffs. With any other construction, this stipulation in the contract becomes ineffective. If defendant may convert plaintiffs\u2019 collateral in his hands, and not be liable for breach of trust, those collaterals are valueless to the plaintiffs. The law presumes the intent of the parties to make effective every word of their contract. This action is brought, not upon his covenant to pay for the cigars, but for the moneys which the defendant has received upon the sale of these cigars under the clause of the contract that those accounts, and, by inference, the proceeds thereof, were to belong to the plaintiffs. These moneys I think the defendant clearly held in a fiduciary capacity. In the case of Weston v. Brown, 158 N. Y. 360, 53 N. E. 36, the question decided was simply as to the right to bring an action at law in a parallel case, rather than an action in equity for an accounting. There were other clauses in the contract in that case which distinguish it somewhat from the case at bar. When the opinion is read, however, in view of the question there to b\u00e9 decided, it contains, I think, no rule of law antagonistic to the rule which we now hold. The case of German Bank v. Edwards, 53 N. Y. 541, is distinguished from the case at bar in the case of Kelly v. Scripture, 9 Hun, 283. There is no doubt that a creditor may intrust his collateral with his debtor to sell or collect the same for him. Conkling v. Shelley, 28 N. Y. 360, 84 Am. Dec. 348. The proceeds of the collection, when once made, however, are held in trust for the creditor, and must be paid over to the creditor upon his demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In tEe case at bar I think there were but two questions for the jury. The first question was the question of fact as to whether the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ant had collected the full amount of the moneys. He claimed upon the trial that he had collected all except $40. The plaintiffs claimed to have his admission that he had collected the full amount. This issue was submitted to the jury, who found for the plaintiffs thereupon. The second question arises upon the defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiffs are entitled to no compensation, under the contract, until they have wholly fulfilled by delivering to the defendant the full amount of the first consignment. It will be noticed that in the contract the plaintiffs were to ship to the defendant cigars as ordered and selected. At the time of the execution of that contract a memorandum was made which recited that it was a memorandum of the first consignment under the agreement of February 12, 1900\u2014Smith &amp; Rogers to Joseph R. Williams. In this memorandum were specified 20,000 cigars of different kinds to be shipped. The plaintiffs, however, upon the stand, swore that the goods mentioned in this memorandum were not to be shipped at once, but were to be made up ready for shipment. This evidence is complained of by the defendant as contradictory of the written memorandum made at the time that the contract was made. This written memorandum, however, was not made a part of the contract. It was not signed by the parties. The plaintiffs were at liberty, therefore, to contradict it or explain it by parol evidence. The jury were, in substance, told that if this agreement was an entire one, and these cigars mentioned in the memorandum were to be at once shipped, the plaintiffs could not recover in the action. Upon this question also the jury has found with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">I agree with the defendant\u2019s counsel that the original contract cannot be varied by parol, and that the letters were not admissible as explanatory thereof While much was submitted to the jury that probably was for the court to decide, nevertheless, upon the two questions which we here hold were properly submitted, their verdict is for the plaintiffs, and there is no apparent reason for disturbing their verdict because other questions were submitted to them which could not in any way influence their finding upon the questions properly submitted. We think, therefore, the judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
