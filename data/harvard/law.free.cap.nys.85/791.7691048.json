According to his testimony, he approached the track of the defendant\u2019s railroad in Third avenue, near Twelfth street, intending to board a car and go downtown. As the car approached, he put up his hand for the motorman to stop. The motorman was looking toward the plaintiff. He turned on the brake and stopped the car, or, as the plaintiff puts it subsequently: \u201cWhen I tried to get on the car, it was going as slow as it could go, almost. It was to a stop.\u201d The plaintiff put his foot on the running board and grasped a stanchion, when the conductor rang the bell and the car started at such a rate of speed that the plaintiff lost his balance, struck an elevated railroad pillar with his right shoulder, tumbled off the car, and became unconscious. The fall resulted in injuries which necessitated the amputation of his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>The first point of the appellant is that there is no evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. This is based chiefly on the argument that there was no invitation from the motorman to the plaintiff to enter the car, the mere slackening of speed being no proof of such invitation. But there was something more. The plaintiff gave a signal to the motorman indicating his desire to board the car, and he tells us that the motorman was looking toward him at the time. This was enough to warrant an inference that the motorman saw the plaintiff, and slowed up his car still further for the purpose of allowing the plaintiff to take passage on it, especially when we consider that the motorman, who could have disproved this inference if it were incorrect, was not called as a witness by the defendant. There is, it seems to me, absolutely no basis in the proof for the suggestion that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">In his opening to the jury, Mr. Baldwin, counsel for the plaintiff, said he would show that \u201cattempts had been made, and witnesses spirited away in this case.\u201d Mr. Yonge, for the defendant, objected to this as improper and manifestly unfair, whereupon the court said: \u201cUnless he proves it, I will instruct the jury to disregard the statements.\u201d Testimony was introduced in behalf of the plaintiff to the effect that an agent of the defendant corporation had attempted to bribe one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses to absent himself from the trial. The matter did not come up again, nor was the court\u2019s attention called to it in any manner. No exception was taken by defendant\u2019s counsel to the ruling of the trial judge at the time Mr. Baldwin made his statement. In view of these facts and the proof offered in support of that statement, it affords no warrant for a reversal. The judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Judgment and order unanimously affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
