To support his claim of an actual agreement, the plaintiff testified that he presented a written estimate to one of the defendants, placing the cost at $850, that the defendant said it was too high, but that he (plaintiff) \u201ccame to an agreement with him for $750.\u201d It appears, however, from the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, that this estimate was at that time returned to him by the defendant, who had written upon it, in his presence, \u201cIf writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ten contract satisfactory, agree to take at $750,\u201d and this very clearly supports the defendant\u2019s testimony that the whole matter was understood to be in abeyance until a definite contract in writing should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">No such contract was made, and a recovery upon a cause of action having its foundation in nothing except the plaintiff\u2019s base characterization of the negotiations as an \u201cagreement,\u201d which they were not, is difficult to uphold. Moreover, the only proof of loss of profits was sought to be furnished by evidence that the plaintiff had made a subcontract with one Holst, whereby the latter undertook to erect this structure for $400, the evidence being admitted over objection. The difference between the price to be paid by the- defendants to the plaintiff, and that to be paid by the latter to the subcontractor, upon a contract wholly executory, was not an available measure of damages, and the evidence was not admissible for the purpose of charging the defendants. Devlin v. Mayor, 63 N. Y. 25, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
