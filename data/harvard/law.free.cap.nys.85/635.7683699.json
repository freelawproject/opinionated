The fact that there was an ostensible partnership as to third persons did not, of course, \u201e conclude upon the actual relation, where the question arose between the parties; and, while it was some evidence bearing upon the question, it became of no importance if the jury accepted the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as true. Aided by their observation of the witnesses, and by the corroboration afforded the plaintiff, the jury were justified in finding that he and his witness were entitled to the greater credit; and the appeal, therefore, does not present a case for our interference with the result upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements.
