The trial court, under its view of the nature of the action, had the discretion to direct that it be transferred to the calendar for the trial of issues by jury. Where an issue is tendered as one in equity, and the plaintiff insists upon \"the right of trial at Special Term, and objects to the cause being sent to a jury,' but the case is one in which the defendant is entitled to a trial by jury as matter of right, it is competent to the court to send <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the case to the jury calendar. Everett v. De Fontaine, 78 App. Div. 219, 79 N. Y. Supp. <em>692; </em>Hart v. Garrett Co. (App. Div., Nov. 20, 1903) 84 N. Y. Supp. 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur, except VAN BRUNT, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
