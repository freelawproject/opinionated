The work was done by defendant in connection with the construction of the subway or underground railroad. The defense is that the acts complained of were necessarily done by defendant in connection with a great municipal work; that they were done in a skillful and proper manner, without any negligence on the part of the defendant; and that whatever injury the plaintiff sustained by reason thereof was necessarily incidental to the character of the work, and unavoidable. The evidence establishes the fact that the said work was necessary. The only question in the case relating to this work is whether, in doing it, the defendant used reasonable and proper care to prevent injury to the plaintiff\u2019s business and property. Upon this question the testimony was conflicting, and the decision was properly left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge that defendant was under no obligation to build .a partition to separate plaintiff\u2019s kitchen from the opening in the front wall. The court replied, \u201cI decline to charge as requested, and leave it to the jury.\u201d To this ruling the defendant excepted. This ruling was correct. This was a public work, instituted and carried oil by virtue of authority vested in the city of New York, through its board of rapid transit railroad commissioners. Such a work should be carried on with due care for the rights and property of private individuals, if those responsible for the work wish to escape liability for injuries occasioned thereby. It was therefore necessary for the defendant to adopt every reasonable measure to protect the business and property of the plaintiff from damage, in order to free itself from liability to the plaintiff for such injuries as its work might occasion. Sammons v. City of Gloversville, 175 N Y. 346, 67 N. E. 622; Sadlier v. City of New York, 40 Misc. Rep. 78, 81 N. Y. Supp. 308; Hill v. Mayor, etc., 139 N. Y. 495, 34 N. E. 1090. It is also the fact that the defendant regarded it as its duty to protect the plaintiff\u2019s premises from injury. Holbrook, the president of the defendant corporation, testified :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201cI think it was my duty to use every means to prevent the inside o\u00a3 those \"buildings becoming damaged, or the contents o\u00a3 the building. I did it in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The defendant\u2019s contract, under the terms of which this work was done, contained this agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">\u201cThe subcontractor [defendant] agrees to he responsible for and to protect the contractor from all suits or actions from any source for or on account of -= &lt;= * damages to adjoining or other property which may be sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>any one or to any property * * * by reason of the carelessness or negligence or acts of the subcontractor or of any employ\u00e9.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The plaintiff gave testimony showing loss of profits, besides loss of the property used by him in his business, and computed the amount of such loss in money.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The exceptions of the defendant are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
