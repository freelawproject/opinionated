When moved for trial in that court, the defendants withdrew their plea of not guilty, and demurred to the indictment on the ground that the facts stated did not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>stitute a crime. The court, on motion of the district attorney, overruled the demurrer, and allowed the indictment to be amended by striking out the word \u201cfourteen\u201d therein, and inserting in lieu thereof the word \u201csix,\u201d so that thereafter the indictment charged that the child abandoned was under six years of age. Such amendment was allowed under the objection and exception of the defendants. The defendants were thereupon required to plead to, and proceed to trial under, such amended indictment; and, the jury having rendered a verdict of guilty against them, they were sentenced to state prison for a term of years. Upon the trial the defendants further objected to the amendment of such indictment by motion for a discharge upon all the evidence, and also in arrest of judgment. From the judgment so rendered against them, the defendants take this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b88-4\">\u2022 Argued before PARKER, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzN\">At the time this indictment was found by the grand jury it was a crime to desert a child, by those who had the care or control of it, only in the event that the child was under the age of 6 years. See section 287 of the Penal Code. By chapter 376, p. 867, Laws 1903, that section was amended so as to make it a crime if the child deserted was under 14 years of age; but prior to September 1, 1903, when that amendment took effect, it was no crime to desert a child under 14 unless it was also under 6 years of age. Therefore the indictment which the grand jury presented charged no crime against the defendants. If the people had proven \u2022the desertion of a child 10 years of age, they would have established every fact stated in the indictment, and yet they would not have proven that the defendants had committed any crime. \u201cThe settled rule of criminal pleadings requires that all the elements which enter into the definition of an offense must be stated in the indictment.\u201d People v. Albow, 140 N. Y. 134, 35 N. E. 438; People v. Kane, 161 N. Y. 386, 55 N. E. 946. So the question is presented whether, when the facts stated in the indictment do not constitute any crime, the trial court may amend it by inserting therein further and other facts, which, if proven, would show that the defendants have committed a crime. I am of the opinion that such an amendment cannot be allowed. The indictment must be found by. a grand jury, and, if the one which it presents does not state any act of the defendant which constitutes a crime, then no conviction can be had thereon; in other words, the trial court has no authority to find an indictment against the accused. That seems to have been the proceeding in this case. The trial court adopted the statement of the district attorney that the child was under six years of age, and so the indictment was made to conform to that fact. It was the trial judge, and not the grand jury, that found that fact, and we have no reason whatever to presume that the grand jury ever passed upon that question. These defendants were in fact tried, not upon an indictment found, but upon an information presented by the trial judge and the district attorney. That method of proceeding is not tolerated in this state, and so the judgment rendered thereon must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The argument urged by the respondent on this appeal that the amendment was to an immaterial matter, and was within the provisions of section 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, is clearly not correct. Nor can the amendment be sustained'under any of the provisions of section 284. As shown above, the indictment fails entirely to charge any crime, and the one upon which the defendants were tried was never presented by a grand jury. The judgment and sentence thereon should be reversed, and, inasmuch as no conviction can lawfully.be had upon the indictment as presented by the grand jury, no new trial should be ordered thereon. The defendants should be discharged from custody, and the order entered herein should so direct. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
