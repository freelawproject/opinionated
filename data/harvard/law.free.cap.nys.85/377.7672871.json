There was ample evidence to charge both defendants upon the contract for services, and the justice in the judgment rendered has appropriately fixed their personal liability (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3404, 3408), while also establishing the lien. The notice of lien, however, was defective, because of the alternative statement of the \u201cagreed price or value\u201d of the labor performed. Bradley &amp; Currier Co. v. Pacheteau, 71 App. Div. 148, 75 N. Y. Supp. 531. But, while the defect defeats the lien, a personal judgment (Code, \u00a7 3412) is properly to be rendered in such a case, and a dismissal of the action is not to be the result. 175 N. Y. 492, 67 N. E. 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">The judgment appealed from will be modified so far as to direct personal judgment against the defendants, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
