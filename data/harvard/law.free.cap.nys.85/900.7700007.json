In that month, however, the defendant was incorporated under the same name in this state, with a capital stock of $500, for the expressed purpose of engaging in the manufacture, sale, and installation of watchmen\u2019s clocks, thereby anticipating and forestalling the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed incorporation, and the use of such corporate name for that purpose by the defendant has been enjoined by the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">The evidence indicates quite clearly that the incorporators of the defendant company knew at the time of the incorporation of the fact that the plaintiffs were conducting the branch of their business in question under the same designation as that selected by the incorporators, and also that the selection of the corporate name by the latter was made with a view of obtaining some part, at least, -of the plaintiffs\u2019 business, and of selling and installing the same articles of manufacture in the borough of Manhattan as those dealt in by the plaintiffs. The learned trial court has found as facts upon sufficient evidence that the further purpose of the organizers of the defendant company was to appropriate to their own use the partnership name which the plaintiffs had chosen for this branch of their business, and to prevent the plaintiffs from incorporating in this state under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">While the question is not free from doubt, I am inclined to the view that the facts recited serve to remove this case from the operation of the class of cases cited by the learned counsel for the appellant, and to present a situation in which a court of equity may grant injunctive relief. It may be that the words \u201cAmerican Watchman\u2019s Clock Company\u201d do not contain the essential elements of a trademark which will be protected as the exclusive property of the person who first makes use of them. See Koehler v. Sanders, 122 N. Y. 65, 25 N. E. 235, 9 L. R. A. 576; Cooke &amp; Cobb Co. v. Miller, 169 N. Y. 475, 62 N. E. 582; Barrett Chemical Co. v. Stern, 176 N. Y. 27, 68 N. E. 65; Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co., 179 U. S. 665, 21 Sup. Ct. 270, 45 L. Ed. 365. The words \u201cwatchman\u2019s clock\u201d are in common use, and, even when joined with the word \u201cAmerican,\u201d may not, perhaps, be lawfully monopolized as a trade-mark under the doctrine of these cases. But a different principle applies where a partnership name is infringed, and especially where, as in this instance, the infringement is for the purpose of selling identical property or articles in the same locality, and under circumstances which are certainly calculated, if not actually designed, to deceive the public. The precise principle was applied in Higgins Co. v. Higgins Soap Co., 144 N. Y. 462, 39 N. E. 490, 27 L. R. A. 42, 43 Am. St. Rep. 769, and it was held in that case that an exclusive right may be acquired in the name in which a business may be carried on, and that an injunction lies to restrain the simulation and use by one corporation of the name of a prior corporation which tends to ere-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>ate confusion, and to enable the later corporation to obtain the business of the prior one. The court said (page 469, 144 N. Y., page 491, 39 N. E., 27 L. R. A. 42, 43 Am. St. Rep. 769):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">\u201cThe principle upon which courts proceed in restraining the simulation of names in the nature of trade-marks, which have come to designate the business of a particular person or company, is stated in Lee v. Haley, L. R. 5 Ch. App. 155, an action to restrain the use by the defendant of the name of \u2018The Guinea Coal Co.,\u2019 in his business. T quite agree,\u2019 said Gifford, L. J., \u2018that they [the plaintiffs] have no property in the name [Guinea Coal Co.], hut the principle upon which the cases on the subject proceed is, not that there is property in the word, but that it is a fraud on a person who has established a trade and carries it on under a given name that some other person should .assume the same name, or the same name with a slight alteration in such a way as to induce persons to deal with him in the belief that they are dealing with the person who has given a reputation to the name.\u2019 The cases are not infrequent in which the use of corporate names has been restrained on the principle of the trade-mark cases.
