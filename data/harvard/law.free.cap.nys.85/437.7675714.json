Walter, 83 App. Div. 254, 82 N. Y. Supp. 37), wherein the terms upon which the plaintiff should be allowed to serve an amended complaint were fixed. We think that the learned judge at Special Term did not correctly construe our order. Thereby it was, in addition to other terms, provided that the defendant should be allowed 20 days' in which to answer the amended complaint, \u201cthe case upon service of the answer to take its regular place on the calendar, and not to be restored to the day calendar.\u201d We think that the order appealed from, which directed that it should be placed upon the call calendar preparatory to its being set down on the day calendar, was in viola-* tion of the terms of our order, and for that reason should not have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The order accordingly should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
