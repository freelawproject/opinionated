The ordinance upon which the action is based, and to which the proof of the existence of any ordinance is confined, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201cIf any person shall use in the city of New York, in weighing or measuring as aforesaid, any weight, measure, scale-beam, patent balance, steelyard or other instrument which shall not conform to such standard, or shall use, in weighing as aforesaid, any scale-beam, patent balance, steelyard or other \u25a0instrument, which shall be out of order or incorrect or which shall not bal\u25a0ance, he, she, or they shall forfeit and pay for every such offense the sum of twenty five dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">To prove a violation, evidence was given that certain scale weights found at defendant\u2019s grocery store were \u201cshort,\u201d and that they were \u201cused there.\u201d Whether this proof of use proved a case, within the ordinance, is impossible to determine where the very provisions of the ordinance showing what use was prohibited were omitted from the evidence. The words \u201cas aforesaid\u201d left the whole subject open, and by failing to give proof of the matter to which they referred the plaintiff simply failed to establish the ordinance upon which it relied. The same defect is apparent in the proof of shortness of weight, tested by something which the fragment of the ordinance in evidence refers to as \u201csuch standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
