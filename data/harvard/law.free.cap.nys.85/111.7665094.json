The article complained of sets forth the career of Giuseppe Musolino, an Italian bandit, brigand, and murderer, and in connection therewith is printed a photograph of the plaintiff, referred to in the article as that of the outlaw whose name appears beneath it. The article in part is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-14\">\u201cMusolino, the Famous Italian Brigand, Coming to America, but not, He Says, until His Revenge is Complete.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-15\">\u201cCharacter Sketch of the Man Who for Nearly Three Years Has Kept Nearly 20,000 Soldiers Busy Seeking Him, Dead or Alive.

The defendant demurred to the complaint as not stating facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and from the interlocutory judgment entered sustaining such demurrer the plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b144-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

In connection with this article we have a reproduction of the plaintiff\u2019s photograph, and underneath it the name of the bandit, which is not the plaintiff\u2019s name. Although the name beneath the photograph is different from the plaintiff\u2019s, and there is a statement that the bandit is still in Italy, while the plaintiff lives here, we have still the fact that the likeness is that of the plaintiff, and that the photograph is referred to as that of the person of whom the article was written. Stripped of extraneous statements and considerations, therefore, the subject may be narrowed down to the question whether the person responsible for the publication of a photograph in connection with an article which is libelous, and which refers specifically to the photograph which accompanies it, can escape liability for the wrongful act by placing underneath the picture a name different from that of the person of whom the picture is a likeness, and by stating in the article some facts which, standing alone, would tend to negative the inference that the article was published of and concerning the plaintiff.. We think it would be a reflection upon the law if it were powerless to afford some remedy for such grievous wrong. It is said that there is some remedy other than by an action of libel; but, whether that be so or not, we think that upon the proposition as to whether an action for libel can be maintained for the reproduction of a person\u2019s picture or likeness in connection with a libelous article this court is to a certain extent committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">In Clary-Squire v. Press Publishing Co., 58 App. Div. 362, 68 N. Y. Supp. 1028, a woman whose stage name was \u201cMary Louise Clary\u201d brought an action of libel based upon the fact that the defendant published in its newspaper, in connection with an account of the marriage of one Louise Cleary with Eugene Cowles, which event actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>happened, a picture said to be that of \u201cMrs. Louise Cleary Cowles,\u201d but which the plaintiff contended was her picture. The opinion of the court proceeded upon the theory that, if the latter proposition could have been sustained by plaintiff\u2019s showing that it was her picture, she could have recovered. In that case the trial judge left it to the jury to say whether the picture that was published was that of the plaintiff, and charged that, if they should find it was, and its publication with the article was harmful to her, then \u201cthe defendant has been guilty, whether unwittingly or not, of spreading broadcast a libel upon the plaintiff.\u201d Upon this question of fact the jury found against the plaintiff, and there being evidence to sustain the verdict, the judgment was here affirmed by a divided court; the majority being of the opinion that the verdict was conclusive, but the minority being of the view that the weight of evidence was in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and she had made out a cause of action for which she was entitled to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In Morrison v. Smith, 83 App. Div. 206, 82 N. Y. Supp. 166, the plaintiff alleged that in defendant\u2019s magazine'was printed an advertisement reading: \u201cIllustrated New Book. Up to date. The experience of a giddy typewriter girl in New York. Type-written. Good is no name for it,\u201d etc.; and accompanying this advertisement was the picture of a young woman, which was a likeness of the plaintiff. The complaint in that case was dismissed\u2014and this court affirmed the dismissal\u2014solely upon the ground that the plaintiff by innuendo attributed a particular meaning to the libelous article, and that because she failed to establish that the publication was susceptible of that interpretation, even though the article was in and of itself libelous per se, she could not recover. No name was attached to the photograph, but the photograph was referred to as that of the person mentioned in the article. Upon the question of liability for the publication of1 the libelous article published in connection with her photograph this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201cWere we called upon to determine whether or not the advertisement and picture, apart from the meaning which the plaintiff in the complaint ascribed to them, were libelous per se, our inclination would be so to regard them, or a.t least to conclude that the interpretation to be given them is so doubtful as to present on this subject a question for the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">It is suggested, however, that persons who knew plaintiff\u2019s real name, and who read the article through, would be led to the conclusion that the article does not refer to the plaintiff. These considerations may go to mitigate the damages, but they in no sense destroy the libelous character of the act in producing the plaintiff\u2019s photograph in connection with an article which is libelous per se, and which refers to the photograph as that of the person to whom the article relates. It is pure assumption to assert that all who see it will read the article, or th.at all who may read it will be acquainted with the real name of the plaintiff. Many will look only at the picture and the head lines of the article, and thus associate the man whose photograph is given with an article describing him as a bandit and a murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Thinking as we do, therefore, that the publication of one\u2019s photograph, whether accompanied by his own or another\u2019s name, or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>no name, in connection with an article referring to the photograph, and which is libelous per se, entitled a plaintiff to maintain an action for libel, and that this complaint states a good cause of action, the interlocutory judgment sustaining the demurrer to the complaint for insufficiency should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled, with costs, with leave to defendant to withdraw demurrer and to answer upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">VAN BRUNT, P. J., and HATCH and LAUGH LIN, TJ., concur. PATTERSON, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
