J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGn\">The plaintiff has recovered a verdict against 'the defendant for personal injuries occasioned to her while she was :a passenger on its road. She was seated on the north side of a car \u25a0running west through Thirty-Fourth street, Manhattan, and crossing Fifth avenue, when the shaft of an express wagon going south along Fifth avenue punctured the side of the car and injured her. The only \u2022question which it is necessary to consider is the charge of the learned court. In the principal charge, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-18\">\u201cNow, while the railroad company are not insurers or guarantors of the \u25a0safety of passengers upon their cars, it is their recognized duty to use the highest degree of care for the safety of persons who become passengers upon iheir cars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">Defendant\u2019s counsel specifically excepted\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-20\">\"\u201cTo that portion of your honor\u2019s charge wherein you say that the defendant company was bound- to exercise the highest degree of care to insure the safety of the plaintiff. The Court: Yes. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I ask your honor to modify that part of the charge, and to charge the jury that they were only required to exercise a high degree of care. (The court declines so \"to charge, and defendant excepts.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>I think the refusal was error, under Stierle v. Union Ry. Co., 156 N. Y. <em>70, </em>50 N. E. 419, and Id., 156 N. Y. 684, 50 N. E. 834. We held this doctrine in Regensburg v. Nassau Elec. R. Co., 58 App. Div. 566, 69 N. Y. Supp. 147, and in Conway v. Brooklyn Heights R. Co., 82 App. Div. 516, 81 N. Y. Supp. 878. There are circumstances where the rule stated by the court may be applicable, but it is not a rule of universal application, and certainly not in the case at bar. The judgment and order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">WOODWARD and JENKS, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b875-7\">HIRSCHBERG, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AVGq\">Independent of the question whether or not the charge of the learned trial justice, to the effect that the defendant was bound to exercise the highest degree of care, is correct, I am of opinion that the ultimate charge in response to the two final requests made by the defendant\u2019s counsel was equivalent to instructing the jury that the measure of duty on the part of the defendant was limited to the exercise of the utmost care possible under the circumstances of the case, and that therefore there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">HOOKER, J., concurs in dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
