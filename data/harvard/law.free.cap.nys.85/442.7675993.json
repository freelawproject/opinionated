The decree was entered in October, 1901. The divorce was granted on the ground of the wife\u2019s adultery with one Davis, with whom she is now living ; thus continuing the illicit relations which were made the foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of the judgment against her. In May, 1903, she made an application to the Supreme Court, at Special Term, to modify the decree so that she might be permitted to see the children at stated times, and her application was granted. From the order entered thereupon, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We think the order should be reversed. Where the guilty wife continues her illicit relations with her paramour, and leads an immoral and degrading life, there is no propriety in interfering with the judgment which has separated her from her children, nor should they be again brought under her influence in any way, until she has given evidence of contrition and reformation. Were the defendant\u2019s life now blameless, a different view would be taken, but, as it is, we cannot allow such a precedent to stand, as would be made by an affirmance of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to amend the decree denied, with $10 costs. All concur; VAN BRUNT, P. J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
