The defendants deny that the lands on which they are building is a public street, and that the plaintiff has any interest or easement therein. The issue was tried by a referee, who reported that the land, 50 feet wide by 150 feet deep, upon which defendants were commencing to build, was a public street, and that the plaintiff, as owner of the adjoining lot, was entitled to an injunction restraining the defendants from building upon such lot and requiring them to remove the foundation walls and other portions of their building therefrom. From the judgment entered upon that report the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">The premises owned by the plaintiff, as well as the alleged street lot, both formerly belonged to one Charles P. Sanders, the father of Charles P. Sanders, Jr., and L. Ten Broeck Sanders. In December, 1890, the lot occupied and owned by the plaintiff, with other premises, was conveyed by a referee\u2019s deed in foreclosure to L. Ten Broeck Sanders, and the premises upon which the defendants are building, with other premises, were conveyed by another referee\u2019s deed in foreclosure to Charles P. Sanders, Jr. The division line between the lands of L. Ten Broeck Sanders and the lands of Charles P. Sanders, Jr., which they respectively acquired under such referees\u2019 deeds, is the westerly line of the premises claimed by the plaintiff to be a street, and the easterly line of the premises owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff and his wife derived their title in February, 1899, from one Osborne, who procured it from one Hardin, who received it under a deed from L. Ten Broeck Sanders, dated March 27, 1897. No one of these deeds referred in any way to the property being bounded by a street on the easterly side, but.each of the deeds referred to the lot as being a portion of lot 46, as designated on a map of the C. P. Sande'rs property in the village of Scotia, filed in the Schenectady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>county clerk\u2019s office. The plaintiff\u2019s wife having died, he is the sole owner of the premises, as survivor. Charles P. Sanders, Jr., conveyed the lot claimed by the plaintiff to be a public street to the defendants by warranty deed dated November 26, 1900. L. Ten Broeck Sanders never owned the lot so conveyed, and Charles P. Sanders, Jr., never owned lot No. 46. The plaintiff seeks to show that the lot occupied by the defendants has been dedicated to the public as a street, and that the plaintiff is entitled to have it kept open as such. It is urged that it was designated as a street on certain maps filed as public records, and that the owner has made conveyances of lots designated upon such maps with reference to such a street thereon. This claim is based upon two maps and two deeds. One map, designated \u201cMap of Lots Belonging to the C. P. Sanders Property in the Village of Scotia,\u201d was filed January 26, 1891; and the other, bearing the same designation, was filed March 21, 1892. In each of these maps an open space 50 feet wide by 150 feet deep is indicated upon the easterly side of the premises now owned by the plaintiff. Although this open space is not called a street, and is not named as such on either of the maps\u2014notwithstanding on each of them streets are designated by name\u2014yet an inspection of the maps would naturally indicate to an observer that the open space was intended by the draftsman to represent a street. However, to1 show that the open space was intended to represent a street, and not a lot, as claimed by the defendants, the surveyor who made the map was permitted to swear over the objection of the defendants that the open space was intended to show a street. Two deeds, each of a lot shown upon the first of these maps, were received in evidence\u2014one made in 1892, and one in 1893. They were each given by L. Ten Broeck Sanders, and located the lots conveyed by reference to this alleged street. Neither of them, however, were given to the plaintiff or his predecessor in title.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">It cannot be doubted that when the owner of land lays it out into distinct lots, with intersecting streets, and sells the lots with reference to such streets, his grantee or successors cannot afterwards be deprived of the benefit of having such streets kept open, and the purchaser and his grantees have an easement in the street for the purposes of access, which is a property right. Lord v. Atkins, 138 N. Y. 184, 33 N. E. 1035. But that is not this case. That is where the owner makes the dedication in that way, but I know of no authority holding that an owner may, by making and filing a map showing a street over his neighbor\u2019s land adjoining his property, dedicate such-neighbor\u2019s land to a public use. L. Ten Broeck Sanders never owned the land now claimed to be a public street lying easterly of plaintiff\u2019s lot, and hence could not dedicate any of that land as a street by mapping, and selling with reference to the map. On the other hand, Charles P. Sanders, Jr., never owned plaintiff\u2019s lot, and never made any conveyances of property with reference to the maps filed or referring to the open space shown on the maps as a public street.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">It is not seriously contended, however, that L. Ten Broeck Sanders could dedicate his brother\u2019s property to a public use by filing maps and making conveyances with reference to such maps. But it is urged that the conduct of Charles P. Sanders, Jr., with reference to the maps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>iand the conveyances made by his brother is effectual as an estoppel as against him and his grantees, and the referee undoubtedly decided the case in favor of the plaintiff upon that theory. The proof in support of that view on the part of the plaintiff is substantially that Charles P. Sanders, Jr., acted as attorney for his brother, and drew -some of the deeds under the employment of his brother, where ref- \u2022 erence has been made to the lot occupied by the defendants as a street; that he took the acknowledgment to some of them as a notary; that he employed the surveyor to make one of the maps, and that he filed \u2022one of them in the clerk\u2019s office. The referee found as a fact that L. Ten Broeck Sanders caused the plot of land to be laid out in building lots and streets, and caused the map thereof to be filed in the \u2022 clerk\u2019s office. Charles testified that he acted for his brother in whatever he did concerning the maps; that he never authorized his brother to make a map which would embrace any part of his lands, or the lot in question, or designate it as a public street; and that he never consented to a street being opened there. More than this, the evidence is \u2022clear that the lot was always fenced, and was never in fact open to or -used by the public or any one else as a street. The dedication, to be effectual, must be by the owner of the land., Dillon, Munic. Corp. (4th Ed.) \u00a7 635. An intent on the part of the owner to dedicate is \u2022absolutely essential, and, to deprive the proprietor of his land, the intent to: dedicate must clearly and satisfactorily appear. Id. \u00a7 636; Niagara Falls Susp. Bridge Co. v. Bachman, 66 N. Y. 261. In the case last cited it was said: \u201cThe acts and declarations of the landowner indicating the intent to dedicate his land to the public \u2022use must be unmistakable in their purpose, and decisive in their character, to have the effect of a dedication.\u201d. Here there has been no \u2022dedication by Charles, the owner, and the evidence upon which an estoppel is claimed as against him is altogether insufficient, in the absence of dedication by him, in my opinion, to deprive his grantees of' the title to the premises he conveyed to them, or to subject their \u25a0premises to the easement claimed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The judgment should be reversed on the law and on the facts, the \u2022referee discharged, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur, except SMITH and HOUGHTON, JJ., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
