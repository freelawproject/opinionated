Some questions were objected to, and the examination was adjourned in order that the parties might go before a justice of the court sitting in chambers to obtain rulings upon the objections. On appearing before a justice in chambers, an oral motion was made by defendant\u2019s attorney to vacate the order. The motion was heard and granted, over the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. We think it was error for the court to entertain the motion, for the reason that defendant, without objection, had been sworn and had submitted to examination, and thereby waived the right to make the motion. Moreover, it does not appear from the record that any defect in the papers upon which the order was made was pointed out, or that any irregularity was indicated. Under the circumstances, the motion was erroneously granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>Rule 37, General Rules of Practice; German-American Bank v.
