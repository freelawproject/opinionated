The plaintiff had judgment, and.the defendant.,appeals, and urges this court to review its decision in the case of City of Brooklyn v. Nassau El. R. Co., 44 App. Div. 462, 61 N. Y. Supp. 33. We believe that the affirmance of the judgment in the Nassau Case was correct, and a reconsideration of the principles involved in the examination of the statute does not convince us that we should in any particular modify the rule announced in that case. We find nothing in the opinions of the Court of Appeals announced since the Nassau Case was decided which conflicts with the rule which this court there adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The appellant, in addition,- claims that the use of merely 20 per cent, of soft coal did not make but a violation of the statute. The stipulation upon this subject reads as follows: \u201cAt the time of the alleged violation a certain percentage of soft coal was being used \u2014about twenty per cent.\u201d It is not made to appear whether unadulterated soft coal was used a one-fifth part of the time, or whether coal, 20 per cent, of which was soft, was being used' all the time. If the former is a fact, there certainly was a violation of the statute; if the latter, appellant\u2019s proposition is raised. The evident purpose of the statute was to prevent what has been called the \u201csmoke nuisance,\u201d But the \"court is not advised, even had such evidence been proper, whether this comparatively small admixture of soft coal would burn without smoke. While it may be true that the inadvertent burning of an inappreciable amount of soft coal mixed with a bulk of hard coal might be insufficient upon which to predicate a violation of the statute, our attention has not been directed to any rule of law which holds that 20 per cent, of the whole is not, for all usual intents and purposes, to be considered as a substantial part thereof; and we think that the trial court was correct in holding that the burning of 20 per cent, of soft coal was a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The appellant\u2019s remaining\" point\u2014that, inasmuch as the city of Brooklyn has passed out of existence, and there is no longer a city hall of Brooklyn from which measurements of four miles may be taken, the act is inoperative\"\u2014cannot prevail. The building designated in the act remains, and has outlived the consolidation of the former city of Brooklyn into the present city of New York. The territory of the former city of Brooklyn also continues, and possesses the same characteristics, and in this territory the former city hall-\u25a0of Brooklyn is still the center of the circle whose radius of four miles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>is described in the statute. Section 1609, c. 466, p. 652, of the Laws of 1901, specifically provides that special acts of this character shall remain in force after consolidation, and pursuant to section 1614 (page 653) the right to collect the penalty is in this plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
