The court modified this by adding that the defendant\u2019s acceptance of benefit must have proceeded from its volition, and not merely from plaintiff\u2019s insistence on performance after defendant\u2019s repudiation of the agreement. <em>[Held, </em>that there was no error of which plaintiff could complain.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-13\">Appeal from City Court of New York, Trial Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-14\">Action by Frank V.

Thus we are precluded from all inquiry into the weight of the evidence. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1344, 1346, 1347; Boos v. World Mut. L. Ins. Co., 64 N. Y. 236, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">The evidence was conclusive that the person who solicited the contract sued upon was employed by the plaintiff for such purpose. Such was the plaintiff\u2019s attitude upon the trial, and consistently therewith the fact was assumed by the trial justice in his charge to the jury. By no objection or request did the plaintiff raise any question concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>such agency or the sufficiency of the evidence to support the defense that the contract was induced by the misrepresentations of such agent,\" and it is too late to raise either of these questions for the first time on appeal. Osgood et al. v. Toole et al., 60 N. Y. 475. We are, therefore, only to review the objections and exceptions taken to rulings upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">The action was upon a contract in writing whereby, in terms, the defendant promised to make monthly payment, at the rate of $20 per week, for the insertion of its business advertisement in certain theatrical programs for the season of 1901-1902, a period of about 25 weeks; and the defendant, admitting an oral agreement for 4 weeks, contended that its manager was induced to sign the writing by the representation of the plaintiff\u2019s soliciting agent that it conformed to the oral understanding. Upon the direct examination of the defendant\u2019s manager he was asked: \u201cWould you have signed the contract' if you had known that it was a contract for the theatrical season? Did you, or didn\u2019t you, sign it relying on the statement that it was a contract for only a month?\u201d These questions were severally objected to and allowed, and properly so. They called for proof of a subjective fact\u2014the mental attitude of the manager respecting the statement made to him, his reliance upon the representation concerning the contents of the writing; and, though his answers were not conclusive, the fact was material to the defense. Thorn v. Helmer, 2 Keyes, 27, 4 Abb. Dec. 408; Trankla v. McLean, 18 Misc. Rep. 221, 41 N. Y. Supp. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The trial justice charged the jury: \u201cNow, if you believe that that statement [referring to the plaintiff\u2019s agent\u2019s representations that the writing called for an advertising period of four weeks only] was made by the canvasser to the defendant\u2019s representative [the manager], the defendant\u2019s representative had a perfect right to rely on that statement, and it was not necessary for him to read the terms of the contract\u201d\u2014to which exception was taken; but this is equally unavailable for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The contract was prepared by the plaintiff\u2019s canvasser. He therefore was properly assumed to have been familiar with its contents. When he misrepresented these, he intended that his statements should be credited by the defendant\u2019s manager. He succeeded, and it did not thereafter rest with him or his principal to urge that the defendant\u2019s manager should have suspected his veracity. The law has not\u2019 yet given, and is not likely to give, an abiding place to any doctrine that the victim should do penance in his deceiver\u2019s triumph. Conceding that the defendant\u2019s manager was guilty of overweening confidence, yet he did only what the plaintiff\u2019s agent intended he should, and, since he was under no duty to suspect, he had a right to rely upon the agent\u2019s statements. We know of no- rule of law which compels distrust. \u201cA person deceived by the fraudulent misstatements of another owes him no duty of active vigilance in the discovery of the fact that they are false. Where, by means of that character, he deceives another to his prejudice, there is nothing in the law requiring him to be protected against the consequence of his wrong because the person imposed upon did not suspect him and adopt some means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>discover the imposition.\u201d Brown v. Post, 1 Hun, 303, affirmed 62 N. Y. 651; Baker et al. v. Lever et al., 67 N. Y. 304, 309, 23 Am. Rep. 117; Delano v. Rice, 23 App. Div. 327, 48 N. Y. Supp. 295. Obviously, this case is to be distinguished from a case where the representations made were understood to be not within the personal knowledge of the person making them. Schumaker v. Mather et al., 133 N. Y. 590, 30 N. E. 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">It appeared in evidence that the defendant, upon discovery that the writing called for an advertising period excessive of four weeks, repudiated the contract, but that notwithstanding the plaintiff proceeded to act under it by continuing the advertisement, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge \u201cthat, if the defendant received and accepted any benefit\u201d under the contract \u201cafter they had information as to any fraud existing in it, they would be held to confirm it.\u201d Since the record fails to show support for any other, the claim of benefit presumably related to possible business advantages to the defendant as incidental to the continuance of the advertisement after the defendant had directed its discontinuance. The exception to the court\u2019s refusal to charge as requested is not urged for reversal, and, indeed, it is without merit, the instruction asked for having been plainly pointed to permit the jury to speculate as to the defendant\u2019s receipt of benefit. The court, however, did charge as requested, with the amendment that the defendant\u2019s acceptance of benefit must have proceeded from its volition, and not merely from the plaintiff\u2019s insistence of performance after the defendant\u2019s repudiation of the contract ; and, as so made, the accuracy of the charge is not open to debate, unless, perhaps, on the ground of irrelevancy, as to which, however, the plaintiff is precluded, since the charge only stated in perfected form that which the plaintiff had requested to be imperfectly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
