Boon, 61 N. Y. 322; Wilson v. Doran, 110 N. Y. 101, 17 N. E. 688; Taylor v. The Brooklyn Elevated R. R. Co., 119 N. Y. 561, 23 N. E. 1106. It is apparent, therefore, that the tender before suit was not available to the defendants in this case, and the trial court should have so held as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Though the entire charge to the jury is not contained in the record before this court, sufficient appears to show that the question of the sufficiency of the tender was left to the jury. This was manifest error. Plaintiff having sued for $118.80, and it not appearing what was submitted to the jury besides the question of sufficiency of the tender, the judgment for the defendant should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
