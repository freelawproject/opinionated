The relator was appointed a patrolman of the police force of the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of New York in 1891, and by virtue of the consolidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>became on January I, 1893, a member of the police force of the city of New York, as patrolman. On the 2d day of August, 1900, the chief of police notified the police board of the city of New York that he had transferred, detailed, and assigned the relator to duty in the telegraph bureau, and he has since continued there as an operator. The appellant urges that this action was in fact an appointment of the relator as a telegraph operator, and carried with it the rights and privileges thereof, including the rank and pay of a sergeant of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The view taken at Special Term is correct. The learned justice \u2022deciding the motion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">\u201cA patrolman made a telegraph operator becomes thereby of the rank of -sergeant, and entitled to sergeant\u2019s pay. This is a promotion, and cannot be \u25a0made except from an eligible list prepared by the civil service commissioners. The petitioner was never on such a list, and was not promoted from the office -of patrolman, but was only assigned as a patrolman to do duty as a telegraph \u25a0operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Section 9, art. 5, of the Constitution of the state of New York, -provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-7\">\u201cAppointments and promotions in the civil service of the state, and of all the civil divisions thereof, including cities and villages, shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, so far as practicable, by examinations, which, so far as practicable, shall be competitive: provided however, that honorably discharged soldiers and sailors from the army and navy of the United States in the late Civil War, who are citizens and residents of this \u25a0state, shall be entitled to preference in appointment and promotion without regard to their standing on any list from which such appointment or promotion may be made. Laws shall be made to. provide for the enforcement of \u25a0this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Laws have been enacted to carry this section into effect (chapter 370, p. 795, Laws 1899), and the inquiry, so far as. this case is concerned, resolves itself into the question, was the detail or designation of the relator as a member of the telegraph bureau a promotion ? It is provided that telegraph operators of the city of New York shall have the rank and receive the salary of sergeants of police. The term \u201cpromotion\u201d is defined as \u201can advancement, or the act of ex.alting in rank or honor\u201d (Webster\u2019s Dict.), and as \u201cadvancement to a higher position, grade, class, or rank; preferment in honor or dignity.\u201d Standard Dict. 1898. In the police department of the city of New York a patrolman receives an annual compensation of $1,400 .\u2022or less; those who'rank as roundsmen receive an annual compensation of between $1,400 and $1,500; while those who rank as sergeants receive an annual compensation of not less than $1,500 nor more than $2,000. Patrolmen and roundsmen are not eligible to appointment as captains. The selection of those officers is made from the list of sergeants, or those who rank as sergeants, namely, detective sergeants and telegraph operators. The designation of the relator, a patrolman, as telegraph operator, was intended to be permanent, and was therefore a promotion, for it carried with it advancement in rank and class, together with an advancement in the salary to be received by him. Under the provisions of the Constitution and the civil service law, therefore, the relator\u2019s promotion could not \u2022be effected without an examination; and as there is no claim that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>name was ever upon an eligible list, or any of the civil service rules complied with in his designation, we think that the order was properly denied, and should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
