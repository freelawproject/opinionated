That every effort was seasonably made to bring him from St. Louis, agreeably to his promise, was made to appear, as was the fact that, on the day that the default was taken, the witness was on his way to attend the trial. Rule 7 of the Special Rules for the Regulation of Trial Terms requires that a case, when it appears upon the day calendar, shall be tried, \u201cunless it appears * * * that in consequence of the happening of an event since the case was set down for trial, the trial can not with justice to one of the parties proceed.\u201d Although the defendant did not bring itself strictly within the letter, it did within the spirit, of the rule, by furnishing proof that the absent witness, when seasonably notified, did not, according to promise, immediately respond; and, to obtain his presence, a short adjournment was asked, to which the plaintiff was willing to assent. Upon these facts we think it would be a harsh enforcement of the rule to mulct the defendant in the sum of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The order is accordingly reversed, upon condition that the defendant pay the taxable costs, including a trial fee and the disbursements of the trial, and that the case be put back on the call calendar, and set down for trial at such time as the justice holding that term shall direct. No costs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
