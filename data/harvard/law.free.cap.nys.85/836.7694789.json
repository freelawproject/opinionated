CITY OF NEW YORK.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b868-9\">(Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AFAI\">December 30, 1903.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b868-10\">1. Defective Sidewalk\u2014Liability of City.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b868-11\">An action against a city for injuries from a hale in the sidewalk cannot be maintained unless the defect is sufficient to suggest danger to a person of ordinary prudence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b868-12\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Richmond, First District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b868-13\">Action by Mary Vandeskie against the city of New York. From a judgment for plaintiff, and from orders denying motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AJX\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b868-14\">Argued before BARTLETT, JENK.S, HIRSCHBERG, and HOOKER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b868-15\">Albert E.

Plaintiff complains of injuries consequent to her slip into a hole or depression in the street. The defendant requested the court to charge the following, which was refused, under exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-18\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge that there is no evidence that the hole into which the plaintiff claims to have fallen was dangerous, or such holes [sic] would have required any affirmative action on the part of the city.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-19\">I fail to find any evidence to warrant any finding as to the character or dimensions of the hole. For aught that appears, the hole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>if it existed, may have been similar to that considered in Hamilton v. City of Buffalo, 173 N. Y. 72, 65 N. E. 944, or even a lesser defect. I take it that it was essential to a recovery that there should have been some evidence to free the case from the rule laid down in Hamilton\u2019s Case, supra. See, too, Schall v. City of New York (Sup.) 84 N. Y. Supp. 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The judgment and orders should be reversed, and a new trial ordered ; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
