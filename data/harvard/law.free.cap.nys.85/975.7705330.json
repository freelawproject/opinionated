If so, the law may imply a promise of payment. Davidson v. Westchester Gaslight Co., 99 N. Y. 558, 2 N. E. 892. The parties are not akin. The plaintiff is apparently a man in humble circumstances. The defendant is the owner of considerable property, and apparently well to do. The many services detailed by the plaintiff were of divers kinds, and of a character often required of a man on the practical side of a well to do woman\u2019s affairs. In fine, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony shows him as the factotum of the defendant. Further, the plaintiff testifies that the defendant specifically requested the services from him; told him she required-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>some one to look after her affairs, and that she knew none better than him. The version of the defendant is that the services were neighborly, voluntary, and gratuitous; that, in any event, she made full return by gifts, benefactions, and the payment of $25; and that, protesting that he expected nothing, the plaintiff acknowledged requital. Likely enough, the defendant did not realize that the plaintiff would ever charge for the services;' and yet the plaintiff may have had reasonable ground for the expectation that so many services asked or accepted, which required his time, labor, and trouble, and which broke\" in upon his personal affairs, would be paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The plaintiff, though a layman, advised the defendant as to her last will. The record of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-6\">\u201cA. I told Mm [Mr. Barnes, the defendant\u2019s attorney] that she was to make me executor. Q. Of her will? A. Yes. Q. And didn\u2019t you state to Mr. Barnes that you expected to get your compensation in that way? A. Yes; I expected to charge for the services I performed what they were worth. There was never anything said to Mrs. Ganung,\u201d etc. \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">On argument the learned counsel for the respondent called to our attention that after the final \u201cYes\u201d the record was misleading, in that the words \u201cI expected,\u201d etc., should be paragraphed as the resumption of the narrative form, and I do not recall that the opposing counsel disputed the typographical correction thus suggested. The plaintiff admitted that he did not present any bill until after he learned that he had not been named as executor. From these statements and this admission the learned counsel for the appellant insists that it is clear that the plaintiff had no intention to charge for the services rendered. But the plaintiff testifies that he did intend to charge. If he thought that the fees and commissions of an executor would be full compensation, and therefore withheld any charge until he learned' that he was not to be named executor, such nonaction, is not inconsistent with his expectation of remuneration. The defendant testifies that there was nothing said as to who was to be her executor, though she discussed the fitness of two persons other than the plaintiff. But she does testify that she made the plaintiff executor of what she supposed \u201cwas a valid will later, when I finished it.\u201d This lends credence to the plaintiff\u2019s version that, so long as he supposed that his compensation was to come from an executorship with which he was satisfied, he did not look for other payment, or press for it. Baxter v. Gray, 4 Scott, N. R. 374, is in point. It was held that plaintiff\u2019s forbearance to assert his claim, in the expectation of a legacy, did not militate against assumpsit for work done; Erskine, J., saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-8\">\u201cBut unless It is shown that the plaintiffs services were rendered upon the distinct understanding that he was to receive no remuneration except what the testatrix might think fit to leave him by will, there is no answer to the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">I think that the finding of the jury is warranted by the evidence; that the law was correctly laid down by Dickey, J.; and that therefore the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
