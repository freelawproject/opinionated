If it had been, and the motion had been denied on that ground, the court would undoubtedly have granted leave to renew upon proper papers. Mo.re than this, the affidavit which the attorney made shows that he had personal knowledge on the question of laches, which we think was excused, and the proposed amended answer was verified by an officer of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-16\">We do not think that upon this appeal we should consider the sufficiency of the counterclaim contained in the amended answer, nor undertake a discussion of the merits of the controversy. These can better be disposed of on the trial than upon the affidavits appearing in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-17\">The granting of the order allowing the amendment rested in the sound discretion of the court at Special Term, and, unless there was a clear abuse of that discretion, it should be affirmed.
