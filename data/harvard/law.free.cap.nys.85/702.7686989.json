Balmat, for value received, hereby agree to sell and- convey to O. J. David * * * all the right, title and interest which I individually or as trustee have, in and to all the talc, talcous rock and soapstone in and upon all that tract or parcel of land * * * containing about 150 acres, at any time within three months from the date hereof for fifteen thousand dollars, to be paid as hereinafter provided: Such sale to be made subject to the term of a certain lease heretofore given by me to said David and now held by the Union Talc Company, which lease said David is to assume and fulfill on my part; and provided, however, that a certain suit now pending' between Mary A. Smith as plaintiff, and myself and others as defendants, has, at the time of the acceptance of this option been fully terminated without restricting my right to convey said premises; and in case said suit is not terminated within said term o.f three months, then this option may he extended until thirty days after said suit is finally terminated and decree entered therein and right of appeal expired. * * *\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-9\">The complaint also alleges \u201cThat on or about the 20th day of May, 1902, and before the suit referred to in said option or agreement was terminated, this plaintiff accepted said option to purchase, serving a notice of said acceptance on defendant,\u201d and that the plaintiff tendered performance of said agreement on his part, but that the defendant refused to perform said agrees ment on his part.

Clearly there was nothing to prohibit the defendant from including in the agreement a provision postponing the plaintiff\u2019s right to enforce the option until a time subsequent to the\" final termination of the pending litigation. Such provision in the agreement is for the protection of the defendant, individually and as trustee, as well as the plaintiff. That the right of the plaintiff to insist upon a conveyance under the agreement was expressly postponed until the final termination of the pending litigation, and the time to appeal from the judgment entered therein had fully expired, seems to us to be clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and certain. The meaning of the contract is not obscure, ambiguous, or doubtful, and the court was right in sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
