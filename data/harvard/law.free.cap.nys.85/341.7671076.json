Jackson (the consignor) by the Bath and Hammondsport Railroad Co., the property described below * * * consigned and destined as indicated below, which said company agrees to carry to the said destination, if on its road, otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to ;said destination. \u25a0'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201cIt is mutually agreed, as to each carrier and as to each party interested in said property, that every service to be performed hereunder shall be subject to all conditions whether printed or written herein or endorsed hereon, and which are hereby agreed to by the shipper and by him accepted for himself .and his assigns as just and reasonable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201cConsignees and Destination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cTo order A. Jackson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201cNotify Am. Hay Co., Long Dock, J. C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">\u201cVia Bath, N. Y. and Erie R. R.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">\u25a0\u201cArticles\u2014Baled Hay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">\u201cNo carrier shall be liable for loss or damages not occurring on its own road, or its portion of the through route, nor after said property is ready for delivery to the next carrier or consignee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">\u201cThe amount of loss or damage for which any carrier becomes liable shall be computed at the value of the property at the place and time of shipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">This bill of lading was delivered by the defendant to the shipper Jackson, and was accepted by him, and then by him transferred to the plaintiff.
