The defendant attempted to prove that the material was required for a special purpose, and that there was an understanding that, as to quality, it should be fit for that purpose, the defense being that it was not so fit. This evidence was excluded, and the ruling is the main subject of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The words, \u201cI hereby accept your offer,\u201d as used in this written contract, do not suggest that something not expressed in the writing was embodied by reference, in view of the particularity with which the paper purports to cover every detail of the agreement. The only reasonable construction of the writing is that the words were used as a colloquial form, and parol evidence would not therefore be admissible as in and of completion of the terms of an agreement left apparently incomplete. Brantingham v. Huff, 174 N. Y. 62, 66 N. E. 620; Engelhorn v. Reitlinger, 122 N. Y. 76, 25 N. E. 297, 9 L. R. A. 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The defense of a breach of warranty, not depending upon the performance of the written agreement, was not within the issues, so far as the defendant sought to prove an independent collateral agreement of warranty. The written agreement being complete, performance within its terms entitled the plaintiff to a recovery, and an independent agreement of warranty could at best be availed of only by way of counterclaim (Chapin v. Dobson, 78 N. Y. 74, 83, 34 Am. Rep. 512), which was not pleaded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The plaintiff was entitled to maintain the action for the agreed installment due upon delivery under the contract (Moore v. Taylor, 42 Hun, 45, 56), and whatever question arose as to the fact of a delivery within the contract was submitted to the jury, to the apparently complete satisfaction of both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
