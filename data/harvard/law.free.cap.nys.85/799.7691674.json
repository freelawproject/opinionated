The plaintiff\u2019s wrist was broken by the fall, and the jury awarded her $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">There is no suggestion that the damages were excessive. The only serious question relates to the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of care. The accident occurred on Sunday morning when the plaintiff was returning from church. On her way to church, three-quarters of an hour before, she had perceived the accumulation of ice and walked around it. Going home, as she reached this point, she looked up at the house where she lived on the opposite side of the street, which had previously been obscured from view by intervening objects, and while thus looking she slipped and fell. I do not think that her momentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>forgetfulness of the presence of the obstruction in the street can be deemed contributory negligence as matter of law. Weed v. Ballston Spa, 76 N. Y. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The case is one of a large and familiar class, and involves no other question requiring notice. I advise the affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Judgment and order of the County Court of Westchester County unanimously affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
