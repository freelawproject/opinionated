Otto upon <em>the </em>defendant\u2019s promise that, if a \u25a0sale or lease of his property grew out of the introduction, Turner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>should receive a commission; performance upon \u00a3he part of the latter involving no services beyond and after the introduction itself. From this introduction a lease resulted, followed a year later by a sale, the lessee and the vendee being corporations each controlled and practically owned by Otto, and the evidence would have justified a finding by the jury that the agreed commission had accrued upon the sale. The dismissal at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case proceeded upon the ground that a defense had been disclosed in the fact that Turner at the time of the sale was a director of the vendee corporation, and, further, that a prior recovery of his commission upon the lease, without the assertion of the claim of a commission upon the sale, which had accrued at the time when the prior action was commenced, operated to preclude a recovery upon this latter claim, because the items of damages under the same contract were not severable. The claim in suit had been assigned to this plaintiff before Turner\u2019s action for his commission upon the lease was brought, and, assuming that the demands were not legitimately the subject of distinct actions, at his instance, because growing out of an entire contract, this did not affect the right of his assignee to maintain an action upon the claim assigned, notwithstanding the assignor\u2019s recovery for the remaining item. Miller v. Union Signal Co. (Sup.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 711. This ground for dismissal of the complaint, therefore, ctiuld not suffice; and the result reached by the court below must depend for its accuracy upon the question whether Turner\u2019s connection with the cor-; poration invalidated his contract for commissions, as a matter of law, upon the facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">When this contract was made, and Turner\u2019s services performed, the vendee corporation was not in existence, but, since his commission depended upon the fact of a sale, his interest under the contract was in possible conflict with his duty as director, assumed at the time of sale; and the rule which forbids an officer of a corporation to profit by a transaction in which his interests are or may be inconsistent with the corporate interests would apply, although the contract itself, when made, was valid. Koster v. Pain, 41 App. Div. 443, 58 N. Y. Supp. 865. The policy of the law is to avoid the possibility of prejudice to stockholders through a director\u2019s assumption of an interest inconsistent with the trust reposed in him; and the presence or absence of a wrongful intent, or of actual prejudice to the corporation in the transaction, does not affect the rule which renders the contract, if executory, unenforceable by the director (3 Thompson on Corporations, \u00a7 4011, and cases cited), and voidable at the instance of the corporation (Barr v. R. Co., 125 N. Y. 263, 274, 26 N. E. 145). The rule discussed, however, applies only to secret agreements for the director\u2019s own profit, and does not invalidate an agreement, openly made, to the knowledge of the body of the stockholders, whereby the profit is to be enjoyed. 3 Thompson on Corporations, \u00a7 4025.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">It appears from the evidence that Otto was the actual owner of the vendee corporation, as he was also of its predecessor, the lessee of the defendant\u2019s property, during the period intervening the contract for commissions and the sale. Whatever openness and fair dealing upon the part of Turner was required to make this contract valid could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>due from him to Otto only, for there was no other interest represented. The directors were nominal holders of stock, to qualify them; but, as appears, Otto was, and properly, in substance and in fact, during all the time when Turner\u2019s connection with the corporations could have had a bearing, nominally or otherwise, upon the corporate interests to be affected by the proposed purchase of the defendant\u2019s property. This being the situation, Turner\u2019s testimony that before going to see the defendant he told Otto of his intention to procure a sale of this property, and to make a commission, if he could, and that Otto said, \u201cAll right,\u201d was, in our view, sufficient to take the case to the jury upon the question of this party\u2019s fair dealing, and of the consequent validity or invalidity of the agreement for commissions. Having the consent, in advance, to just such an agreement as was made, of the only person whose interests could be absolved from the charge of concealing anything which bore upon the fulfillment of his official duties, and with this evidence in the case, the court\u2019s determination that the contract in suit was invalid, as matter of law, cannot be supported. Upon proof that other interests had intervened before the sale, and while Turner was acting as director, it may well be that he would be required to justify this contract by something more than Otto\u2019s consent; but, as the case stands, there is no proof of intervening interests, and, at best, there is but a suggestion that stock was issued after the sale, or at the very time, but after all steps towards its completion had been taken in behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
