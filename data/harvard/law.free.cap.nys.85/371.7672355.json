Proc. \u00a7 2469, providing that where a receiver\u2019s title to personal property has become vested, and an order requiring the judgment debtor to attend and be examined has been served before the appointment of a receiver, his title extends back, so as to include the debtor\u2019s personal property at the time of the service of the order, but that this shall not affect the title of a \u201cpurchaser in good faith without notice,\u201d etc., the fact that money due the judgment debtors, in the hands of a third person, was assigned in good faith, and for value, after the service of an order in supplementary proceedings upon such third person directing the payment of the money to the receiver, did not necessarily affect the rights of the assignee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b403-12\">2.

The fact that the assignment was made after service of the order in supplementary proceedings upon the comptroller did not necessarily affect the rights of the assignee. Code, \u00a7 2469; Droege v. Baxter, 69 App. Div. 58, 74 N. Y. Supp. 585. And so far as there was room for reasonable dispute as to the bona fides of the assignment, which affected a question of title, asserted or to be asserted by a person not a party to the proceedings, the determination of the issue by an order in supplementary proceedings could well be resisted by the party directed to make the payment to one rather than to the other claimant. Krone v. Klotz, 3 App. Div. 587, 38 N. Y. Supp. 225. The only party affected by this order, however, was .the comptroller, who did not resist the direction to pay, and does not appeal. The appellants (the judgment debtors) have'no interest in the priority of these conflicting claims against the fund, and the assignee\u2019s right, as against the comptroller, are not made greater nor less by the order in a proceeding to which he was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
