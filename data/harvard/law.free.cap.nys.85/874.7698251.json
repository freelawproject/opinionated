He had just crossed from the northeast to the southwest corner of the two avenues for the purpose of talcing a De Kalb avenue car going eastwardly. The \u25a0car had, however, started eastwardly across Nostrand avenue, and the conductor called to him to \u201ccome on\u201d to the east Nostrand ave<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>\"irae crossing. As he was crossing Nostrand avenue, about abreast \u2022\u25a0of the rear of the De Kalb avenue car, and while on the first or southerly bound track of the Nostrand avenue line, operated by the defendant, a car of that line shot rapidly over the crossing, and, striking the plaintiff, inflicted personal injuries, for which he has recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The defendant offered no evidence in defense, but insists on the appeal that the complaint should have been dismissed for the plaintiff's assumed failure to establish freedom from contributory negligence. It is true that the plaintiff did not testify that he looked for a car from the north before stepping on the Nostrand avenue track, but he distinctly testified that he could not see the car until it struck him, 'because his vision was obstructed by the intervening De Kalb avenue \u25a0car. The situation -was therefore within the line of authorities which absolve the pedestrian from the exercise of a caution which would necessarily be futile in results, and is distinguishable from the situation presented in the cases cited by the appellant, where a glance would have disclosed the peril. There is no question but that the Nostrand avenue car was run over the'crossing in this instance at a very high rate of speed, and without regard to the rule of diligence, \u25a0which requires care to be taken at such a place to keep the car well \u25a0 under control, and upon which rule travelers are certainly entitled \u2022to rely to some extent. In view of all the circumstances, it seems -clear that the case was properly disposed of, and the judgment should :be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
