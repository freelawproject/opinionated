The district court denied their motion. The Pangang Companies petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to vacate its order, arguing that the delivery of the summonses did not effect service on the Pangang Companies under Rule 4(c)(3)(D) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (which we refer to as the Criminal Rules). We conclude that where such delivery provides actual notice to a foreign organization, it satisfies Criminal Rule 4. Because the evidence established that the Pangang Companies had actual notice of the summonses, the district court did not err, let alone clearly err, in denying the\n   Pangang Companies' motion to quash. Therefore, we deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This petition requires us to review the intertwined history of the 2016 amendments to Criminal Rule 4 and the government's repeated attempts at service on the Pangang Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 7, 2012, the government indicted the Pangang Companies on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201831\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), and attempted economic espionage, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201831\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) and (4). The Pangang Companies are enterprises owned and controlled by the Chinese government. According to the indictment, the Pangang Companies conspired with individuals to illegally obtain trade secrets from E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company related to chloride-route titanium dioxide production technology.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A federal magistrate judge issued summonses to each of the Pangang Companies. The government served the summonses at the New Jersey office of a U.S. subsidiary of one of the Pangang Companies, Pan America, Inc., and mailed copies to the same location. At the time, the government attempted service pursuant to the 2011 version of Criminal Rule 4, which provides the process for issuing and executing an arrest warrant or summons to a defendant if a criminal complaint establishes probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it. Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(a). A summons \"require[s] the defendant to appear before a magistrate judge at a stated time and place.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(b)(2). The 2011 version of Criminal Rule 4 provided that a summons is served on an organization \"by delivering a copy to an officer, to a managing or general agent, or to another agent appointed or legally authorized to receive service of process.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(3)(C) (2011). A copy must also \"be mailed to the organization's last known address within the district or to its principal place of business elsewhere in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201831\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 29, 2012, the Pangang Companies made a special appearance in district court through two attorneys from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP (the \"Quinn Emanuel attorneys\"), and filed a motion to quash service of the summonses on the grounds that service on Pan America was defective under Criminal Rule 4. On July 23, 2012, the district court granted the motion, reasoning that service had not complied with the delivery requirement of Criminal Rule 4 for three of the Pangang Companies, and had not satisfied the mailing requirement as to all four Pangang Companies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(3)(C) (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Between August 2012 and November 2012, the government attempted to serve the Pangang Companies by mailing and delivering the summonses to various individuals and addresses within the United States that were associated with the Pangang Companies. In addition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) formally requested that an agency of the Chinese government serve the Pangang Companies. The Chinese government refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 7, 2013, the Pangang Companies made a second special appearance in district court through the Quinn Emanuel attorneys, and filed another motion to quash. The district court granted the motion, holding that none of the agents and addresses bore the requisite connection to the Pangang Companies required under Criminal Rule 4(c)(3)(C). The government asked the district court to reconsider its rulings, arguing that the service of the summonses had substantially complied with Criminal Rule 4. The court denied the government's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While the government was struggling to serve the Pangang Companies, the DOJ asked the Advisory Committee on the Criminal Rules to make changes to Criminal Rule 4. For those unfamiliar with the rulemaking process, we provide a brief overview. The Rules Enabling Act of 1934,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202071\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2077, authorized the Supreme Court to promulgate rules of procedure which have the force and effect of law. The work of formulating and revising such rules has been delegated to the Judicial Conference of the United States (the principal policy-making body of the U.S. Courts).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202071\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2073.

On April 24, 2017, the Pangang Companies made a special appearance through the Quinn Emanuel attorneys, moving to quash service and opposing the government's motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At a hearing on the motions, one of the Quinn Emanuel attorneys conceded that\n   \"[m]y client has authorized me to be here so they plainly know about these proceedings.\" The attorneys nevertheless argued that their receipt of the summonses was not equivalent to service on the Pangang Companies, even under amended Criminal Rule 4. Alternatively, they argued that the 2016 amendments to Criminal Rule 4 should not be applied to the government's pending complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court denied the motion to quash and deferred ruling on sanctions. The court found that the Pangang Companies \"received notice of the summonses from the Quinn Emanuel firm, even if they did not receive the actual documents.\" Based on the Quinn Emanuel attorneys' 2012 and 2013 special appearances, as well as their 2015 comment letter on the proposed amendments to Criminal Rule 4, the district court found that the Quinn Emanuel attorneys had \"a pre-existing relationship\" with the Pangang Companies, and had also conceded at the hearing that the Pangang Companies had received actual notice. Therefore, the court concluded that delivery of the summonses to the Quinn Emanuel attorneys satisfied Criminal Rule 4(c)(3)(D)(ii) 's requirement to serve a summons using a \"means that gives notice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the district court held that it was \"just and practicable\" to apply amended Criminal Rule 4 to this case because the Pangang Companies had not been prejudiced other than by having to defend against the charges on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Pangang Companies timely appealed, and then filed this petition for a writ of mandamus.

For instance, there would be no need to list \"stipulated by the parties\" as a means that gives notice, because by the time the government and the criminal defendant agreed to a stipulated means of service, the criminal defendant would necessarily have notice. Turning to the canon of ejusdem generis, the Pangang Companies argue that because all three enumerated means \"are formal processes that respect domestic and foreign law and procedure, and are otherwise legal and equitable,\" we should construe the rule to extend only to other processes that share these characteristics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We disagree. As explained above, the words \"by any other means that gives notice\" are not ambiguous, and we disfavor efforts to use canons of construction to introduce ambiguity into straightforward text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Germain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225793\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/249/#p253\">\n    503 U.S. at 253-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6513849,6225793\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/1146/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Moreover, the Pangang Companies' argument that the Advisory Committee intended Criminal Rule 4 to be read narrowly in accordance with the canons of construction is thoroughly undercut by statements of the Advisory Committee itself. First, the Advisory Committee Notes indicate that the enumerated list of means of service is non-exhaustive, thereby dissolving the inference that it is superfluous both to provide an enumerated list and to allow other means of service. Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(3)(D)(ii) advisory committee's note to 2016 amendment. It is well established that drafters may include specific examples \"out of an abundance of caution\" or to \"remove any doubt\" that certain cases fall within the rule's scope.\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p223\">\n    552 U.S. at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p223\">\n    128 S.Ct. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Here, the enumerated list of examples has a purpose: it gives the government the benefit of a presumption that using the means in the list give notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(3)(D) advisory committee's note to 2016 amendment. No such presumption applies to alternate means. Accordingly, the argument that the rule's broad catchall provision makes the list of enumerated means superfluous is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Moreover, the Advisory Committee was well aware of the Pangang Companies' argument based on the superfluity canon, and rejected it. The Quinn Emanuel attorneys raised the identical argument in their comment letter on the draft rule, asserting that the phrase \" 'any other means that gives notice' might be said to trump and render superfluous the limitations imposed in other subsections.\"\n   <em>\n    Quinn Emanuel Comment Letter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2. The Advisory Committee flatly rejected this contention,\n   <em>\n    Final Advisory Committee Report\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 7, and made clear that the list of means presumed to give notice did not limit the government's options; rather, the purpose of subdivision (D)(ii)'s catch-all provision was to give the government flexibility,\n   <em>\n    Initial Advisory Committee Report\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5;\n   <em>\n    Final Advisory Committee Report\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 3. In one instance, the Advisory Committee directly rejected the inference that the enumerated list limited the government. Criminal Rule 4(c)(3)(D)(ii)(c) indicates notice may be given by a means \"permitted by an applicable international agreement,\" but the Advisory Committee's report explained that the rule would also allow service by means that were not permitted by international agreement, so long as the service gave notice.\n   <em>\n    Final Advisory Committee Report\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 3 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the same reason, any inference that the Advisory Committee intended to limit service to \"formal processes that respect domestic and foreign law,\" pursuant to the canon of ejusdem generis, is baseless. To the contrary, the Advisory Committee's final report contemplated the possibility that the government might accomplish service \"on an organizational defendant in a foreign nation without its consent, or in violation of international agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Further, the Quinn Emanuel attorneys' comment letter raised the same concern they raise in their petition before us, that the amended rule could be read to authorize service through a letter or email notifying the organization of the indictment, or other informal means.\n   <em>\n    Quinn Emanuel Comment Letter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2. Despite being aware of these concerns, the Advisory Committee chose to make no changes in the rule.\n   <em>\n    Final Advisory Committee Report\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 5-7. Accordingly, the canons of statutory construction present no barrier to giving effect to the clear text of Criminal Rule 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Pangang Companies also argue that the district court erred in holding that the government could effect service by delivering summonses to the Quinn Emanuel attorneys after they had made prior special appearances; such a ruling, they argue, would effectively eliminate the possibility of a special appearance by a foreign corporation to contest service. Given the important and longstanding role of special appearances for challenging defects in the service of summons, the Pangang Companies assert, the Advisory Committee did not intend the amendments to Criminal Rule 4 to make such a break with historical practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We disagree. As an initial matter, the Pangang Companies have not offered any evidence of a longstanding historical practice of allowing special appearances in criminal cases. The Pangang Companies have pointed only to a handful of district court cases-all within the last 30 years-which have, without explanation or critical examination, permitted criminal defendants to enter special appearances to raise threshold objections.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Advisory Committee was aware, contrary to the Pangang Companies' contentions, that the change in Criminal Rule 4 would prevent certain foreign organizations from making a special appearance to argue that they had not been properly served. In its comments on the draft rule, Quinn Emanuel\n   argued that \"the rule creates a situation in which any institutional defendant that appears to contest service has in effect admitted it had been served.\" Advisory Comm. on Criminal Rules, March 2015 Minutes, at 11 (March 16-17, 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Advisory Committee's minutes, the subcommittee tasked with considering the proposed amendments to Criminal Rule 4 recommended that the Advisory Committee reject this argument, reasoning that \"the point of the amendment is to provide a means of service that gives notice, and there is no legitimate interest in allowing a procedure in which an institutional defendant can feign lack of notice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546253\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/137/15/#p20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the amendment, the subcommittee explained, an institutional defendant could no longer make a special appearance to argue that the defendant lacked notice, but could still use a special appearance to assert other objections, \"such as a constitutional attack on Rule 4, an objection to a retroactive application of the amendment, or a claim that an institutional defendant has been dissolved.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546253\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/137/15/#p20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Criminal Rule 4 would not eliminate the possibility of special appearances entirely. The Advisory Committee agreed and voted unanimously to approve the amendment as initially published,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, stating in its report that \"nothing in the proposed amendment addresses or limits any authority of the court to allow a special appearance to contest service on other grounds,\"\n   <em>\n    Final Advisory Committee Report\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To the extent the Pangang Companies argue that delivering a summons to an attorney who previously represented an institutional defendant does not necessarily constitute serving a summons on that defendant, we agree. Criminal Rule 4 does not list delivery of a summons to the foreign organization's attorney. Therefore it is not a method that is presumed to provide notice, and \"whether actual notice has been provided may be challenged in an individual case.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(c)(3)(D) advisory committee's note to 2016 amendment. This issue is not relevant here, however, because the Quinn Emanuel attorneys made a special appearance on the Pangang Companies' behalf in 2017, and conceded that the Pangang Companies had notice of the government's most recent summons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Pangang Companies argue alternatively that, even if the district court correctly interpreted Criminal Rule 4, the court erred by applying the amended version in their case because it was unjust to apply it retroactively. According to the Pangang Companies, had they anticipated that amended Criminal Rule 4 would allow the government to serve them by delivering the summonses to the attorneys who had previously made special appearances on their behalf, the Quinn Emanuel attorneys could have withdrawn their 2012 and 2013 special appearances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We disagree. Even assuming that the district court's application of amended Criminal Rule 4 to the Pangang Companies was retroactive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   the district court did\n   not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was \"just and practicable\" to apply the rule and deny the Pangang Companies' motion to quash.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The amendments to Criminal Rule 4 became effective in December 2016, and the government delivered the summonses to the Quinn Emanuel attorneys a month later, in January 2017. As explained above, under the plain language of amended Criminal Rule 4, service is effective if it gives notice, and the district court could reasonably conclude that the Pangang Companies had notice of the summonses when their attorneys made a special appearance on their behalf in April 2017. This was sufficient evidence for the district court to conclude that the Pangang Companies had been appropriately served. The government did not rely on the Quinn Emanuel attorneys' previously entered special appearances in 2012 and 2013 to demonstrate notice, and therefore the Quinn Emanuel attorneys' inability to withdraw such earlier special appearances was not prejudicial. Had the Pangang Companies not made a special appearance through the Quinn Emanuel attorneys in April 2017, and had the Quinn Emanuel attorneys maintained that they did not give their clients notice of the 2017 summonses, the government would have had to find other means to prove that the Pangang Companies had actual notice. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Pangang Companies had not demonstrated any prejudice from the application of amended Criminal Rule 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err, let alone clearly err, in denying the Pangang Companies' motion to quash service.

By contrast, the district court here applied amended Criminal Rule 4 to events (e.g., the 2017 service of summonses on the Quinn Emanuel attorneys and the Pangang Companies' motion to quash) that occurred after the rule's effective date of December 1, 2016. But because the Supreme Court authorized the application of the amended rule to proceedings pending on its effective date \"insofar as just and practicable,\" and the district court did not clearly err in concluding that it was just and practicable to apply the amended rule in this case, we need not decide whether proceedings against the Pangang Companies were \"pending\" for purposes of the Supreme Court's transmittal memo when the district court ruled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
