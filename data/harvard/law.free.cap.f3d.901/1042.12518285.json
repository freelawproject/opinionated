FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 24, 2014, detectives from the Medford Police Department were called to investigate the robbery of a local U.S. Bank branch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After interviewing eyewitnesses and further police work, the detectives had probable cause to believe that Schram was responsible. A records check showed, among other things, that there was a no-contact order prohibiting Schram from contacting his girlfriend, Zona Satterfield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The detectives began their search for Schram at Satterfield's residence, as it was the only address the detectives had that\n   was associated with him. Without a warrant (and, for the purposes of this appeal, we assume without Satterfield's consent), the detectives entered the residence, found Schram inside, and arrested him. They then obtained a search warrant and searched Satterfield's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Schram was later indicted for bank robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and he moved to suppress the evidence obtained in the search. The district court denied the suppression motion, concluding that Schram could not \"object to the entry into [Satterfield's] house\" because \"[h]e has no expectation of privacy in a residence that he is legally barred from entering.\" Schram pled guilty, conditioned on his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

He relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gamez-Ordu\u00f1o\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170058\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/453/\">\n    235 F.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2000), to argue that a property owner's invitation grants an individual a legitimate expectation of privacy on a premises, even if the individual is there for illegal purposes. This principle sweeps far broader than the holding of\n   <em>\n    Gamez-Ordu\u00f1o\n   </em>\n   . In that case, we held that narcotics smugglers had a legitimate expectation of privacy as overnight guests in a home.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170058\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/453/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170058\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/453/\">\n    at 458-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the narcotics smugglers' criminal conduct was not the act of being on the premises in question: their criminal conduct was narcotics smuggling. Thus while a defendant does not lose his Fourth Amendment rights simply by engaging in illegal acts, a defendant still may lack Fourth Amendment rights to challenge the search of a residence when the law prevents him from being there in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that a defendant who had not signed a rental car agreement may still have a legitimate privacy expectation in the rental car to challenge its search.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611477\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1518/#p1526\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To explain the difference between the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   and a car thief, the Court likened a car thief to\n   <em>\n    Rakas\n   </em>\n   's hypothetical \"burglar plying his trade in a summer cabin during the off season,\" thus reaffirming\n   <em>\n    Rakas\n   </em>\n   's teaching that, like a defendant who may not challenge a search of stolen property, a defendant whose presence on a premises violates the law may not \"object to the legality of [the premises'] search.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rakas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p133\">\n    439 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   141 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p133\">\n    99 S.Ct. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Like a burglar, trespasser, or squatter, an individual violating a court no-contact order is on property that the law prevents him from entering. We therefore hold that such an individual lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in that place and may not challenge its search on Fourth Amendment grounds.
