We hold that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gonzalo Vasquez-Gonzalez, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted under \u00a7 245(a)(1) in 1995. He was removed from the United States because that conviction was determined to be a crime of violence. He later returned to the United States and was eventually convicted of illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He now appeals that illegal reentry conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A valid removal order is a predicate element of a conviction for illegal reentry under \u00a7 1326. A defendant may therefore challenge a conviction for illegal reentry by collaterally attacking his underlying removal. Vasquez brings two collateral attacks on his removal. In his first collateral attack, he argues that his removal was invalid because his California conviction was not a crime of violence within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 16 contains two subsections, (a) and (b), and the Supreme Court held \u00a7 16(b) void for vagueness in\n   <em>\n    Sessions v. Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Thus, we must look only to \u00a7 16(a) in determining whether Vasquez's conviction was for a crime of violence. We conclude that his prior conviction was for a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his second collateral attack, Vasquez argues that he was eligible for discretionary relief from removal at the time of his deportation and that the immigration judge failed to inform him of that eligibility. The failure to inform Vasquez of his eligibility for relief can serve as a basis to collaterally attack a removal order if Vasquez can establish that it was plausible that he would have been granted relief from removal. Based on the facts of his case, however, we conclude that it is not plausible that he would have been granted relief at the time of his removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We affirm Vasquez's conviction for illegal reentry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Vasquez was brought by his mother to the United States when he was five years old, and he became a legal permanent resident when he was fourteen. He graduated from high school in 1993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1994, Vasquez was arrested for felony grand theft from a person. The same day, he was arrested for misdemeanor battery arising out of a separate incident with a different victim. He was convicted of both crimes and sentenced to 180 days of imprisonment and 36 months of probation. Just over six months after his conviction, Vasquez stabbed a man on the street after stealing two bottles of beer from him. He was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon pursuant to California Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1), and he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While incarcerated, Vasquez was involved in eight gang-related fights, and he was found guilty of being in possession of a stabbing instrument. According to Vasquez, the guards at Corcoran State Prison forced him to fight other inmates. He acknowledges, though, that he was charged with involvement in a fight before his transfer to Corcoran. He also admits that two fights and the charge for weapons possession occurred after he was transferred away from Corcoran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1998, while Vasquez was in prison, he was placed in removal proceedings following the issuance of a notice to appear which alleged that he was removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) for being convicted of an aggravated felony. Vasquez was removed to Mexico on September 7, 1999. He re-entered the United States without inspection or permission thirteen days later. After his reentry, Vasquez worked full-time as a furniture deliveryman and furniture assembler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   He also helped to raise two daughters, a biological daughter who is now 17 and a step-daughter who is now 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 13, 2014, Vasquez was charged with one count of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by illegally reentering the United States. Prior to his charge for illegal reentry, Vasquez had not been charged with any crime since his arrests in 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Vasquez filed a motion to dismiss the information, arguing that the 1999 removal order was invalid because the immigration judge failed to advise him that he was eligible for relief from removal under former section 212(c) of the INA. The district court denied the motion, and Vasquez was convicted of illegal reentry following a stipulated facts bench trial. Vasquez was sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As detailed above, Vasquez compiled an unfortunate record as a young adult, starting at age 19 when he was convicted of felony grand theft from a person and misdemeanor battery, two separate crimes committed upon different victims. Later that year, while still on probation for his prior convictions, he stabbed a man in the stomach after stealing two bottles of beer from him, resulting in the conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A stabbing is a \"single serious crime.\" Likewise, a stabbing, a felony grand theft, and a misdemeanor battery constitute a \"pattern of serious criminal misconduct\" when those crimes were all committed within one year of each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Vasquez does not point to any cases in which a court has looked at similarly serious conduct and expressly declined to apply the requirement of a heightened showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We conclude that Vasquez would not have nearly met the burden of a heightened showing at the time of his deportation in 1999. The equities in Vasquez's favor would have included his family ties within the United States and the fact that he had been brought to this country at a young age.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yepes-Prado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515338\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/10/1363/#p1366\">\n    10 F.3d at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Vasquez has not demonstrated any other potentially positive equities. He did not serve in the armed forces, and he had no business or property ties. He argues that he worked after graduating high school, but given that he was convicted at age 19, his employment history could not have been substantial. He argues that he was a value to the community because he graduated high school and played sports while there, but that did not establish value to the community as an adult, and his criminal conduct started very soon after graduation. Vasquez offers no specific evidence of rehabilitation or good character that he could have presented to the IJ at the time of his removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While Vasquez argues that his family will suffer hardship without him, his family circumstances were different when he was deported in 1999. Our role is to determine whether Vasquez would plausibly have been granted a discretionary waiver at the time of his removal. Thus, we may only consider the facts as they would have been when the IJ considered Vasquez's case. At that time, Vasquez was not supporting his family because he had been incarcerated for four years. He may have provided some support prior to his incarceration, but speculation about that prior support would not have constituted a heightened showing of unusual or outstanding equities at the time of Vasquez's deportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Vasquez cites a declaration by an immigration attorney filed on his behalf. The attorney declared that, in her opinion, Vasquez would have had a high probability of being granted relief under section 212(c) at the time of his removal. The attorney cites some cases in her declaration, but she does not discuss any case in which an alien was convicted of three crimes within a year, one of which was a stabbing. The declaration does not persuade us that it was plausible that Vasquez would have been granted a discretionary form of relief from removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Vasquez also cites the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    INS v. St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   for the statistic that between 1989 and 1995, 51.5 percent of applications for relief were granted under section 212(c).\n   <em>\n    INS v.

We find this statistic in particular to be of little help to Vasquez. The statistic does not capture the correct time frame because Vasquez was not removed until 1999. More importantly, the statistic does not distinguish between aliens whose criminal histories required them to make a heightened showing of equities versus those not required to make such a showing. Given these limitations, the statistic does not persuade us that it was plausible that Vasquez would have been granted relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
