We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thompson is a semitruck dealership, whose principal offices are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Thompson sells trucks equipped with diesel particulate filters (filters). The filters collect particulate matter from a truck's exhaust and turn it into a less harmful substance. Each filter increases a truck's retail sales price by approximately $8,000. Under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 4051(a)(1), Thompson must pay a twelve percent excise tax on the trucks it sells. From April 1, 2011, to September 30, 2011, Thompson paid the excise tax on the full retail sales price of each truck sold, which included tax on the $8,000 value of each filter. On July 30, 2014, Thompson sought a refund of $387,840 from the Internal Revenue Service, arguing that-based on its interpretation of a federal regulation-the filters should not have been taxed. The Internal Revenue Service denied Thompson's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We review \"\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the grant of a motion to dismiss, taking all facts alleged in the complaint as true.\"\n   <em>\n    Owen v.

A \"part\" is \"[a]ny of the manufactured objects that go to make up a machine or instrument, now esp. a motor vehicle; a component.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And an \"accessory\" is \"[a] subordinate or auxiliary thing; an adjunct; an accompaniment; (now)\n   <em>\n    esp.\n   </em>\n   a minor fitting or attachment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying these definitions, we conclude that the filters are parts or accessories of the trucks sold by Thompson because they are components of the trucks or minor fittings or attachments included with the trucks. This interpretation of \u00a7 4051(a)(1) is consistent with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as a whole. For example, \u00a7 4053 exempts specific items from taxation such as camper coach bodies for self-propelled mobile homes; feed, seed, and fertilizer equipment; house trailers; ambulances and hearses; concrete mixers; trash containers; mobile machinery; and idling reduction devices.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204053\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress possesses the authority to exempt the filters under \u00a7 4053, but has chosen not to include such an exemption. Because the plain meaning of the words \"parts or accessories\" involves no absurdity or contradiction when considered in light of the code as a\n   whole, the section must be given its ordinary or natural meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thompson argues that such an interpretation of \"parts or accessories\" is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court held that the term \"student\" was ambiguous under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act when applied to medical residents who took classes and worked full time.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439771,5924534\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/44/\">\n    562 U.S. at 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5914617,12439770,12439771,5924534\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/704/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable, however, because it involved dueling classifications-whether medical residents should be considered students or employees, with students being exempt from the tax. No similar ambiguity exists here, because there is only one reasonable interpretation in this case: the filters are either parts or accessories, both of which the statute subjects to tax.\n   <em>\n    Cf. id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Mayo Found. for Med.
