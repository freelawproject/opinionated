Second, can plan participants in such a lawsuit recover more than their statutorily defined benefits under Title IV of ERISA?

Because we conclude that \u00a7 1344(c) prevents the pilots from recovering any post-termination increase in the value of Delta Plan assets, disgorgement is not an available remedy in this case and we do not address the other questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin by examining the text of \u00a7 1344(c), which provides in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring during the period beginning on the later of (1) the date a trustee is appointed under section 1342(b) of this title or (2) the date on which the plan is terminated is to be allocated between the plan and the [C]orporation in the manner determined by the court (in the case of a court-appointed trustee) or as agreed upon by the [C]orporation and the plan administrator in any other case.\n   <em>\n    Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring after the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    date on which the plan is terminated shall be credited to, or suffered by, the [C]orporation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The two halves of this subsection are in tension. The first half of \u00a7 1344(c) explains that any change in the value of plan assets occurring after \"a trustee is appointed under \u00a7 1342(b)\" or \"the plan is terminated,\" whichever comes later, should be allocated \"in a manner determined by the court (in the case of a court-appointed trustee) or as agreed upon by the [C]orporation and the plan administrator.\" This seems to conflict with the second, italicized half of \u00a7 1344(c), which clearly assigns all post-termination gains and losses to the Corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kinek v.

One of the two events referenced in the first half of \u00a7 1344(c) is the appointment of a\n   <em>\n    pre-termination\n   </em>\n   trustee under \u00a7 1342(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (providing \"for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan ... pending the issuance of a decree ... ordering the termination of the plan\"). There was no such trustee in this case. Indeed, the Corporation became the statutory trustee by an agreement with Delta only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the parties terminated the Delta Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1342(c) (providing for appointment of a trustee when a plan terminates). And there was no court determination-which is contingent on a court-appointed trustee-nor agreement between the Corporation and the plan administrator-previously Delta, now the Corporation itself-to supply competing instructions as to the allocation of any post-termination increase or decrease in the value of plan assets. In short, the first half of \u00a7 1344(c) does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, although we do not decide the question, the reference to \u00a7 1342(b) suggests the first half of \u00a7 1344(c) was meant to govern changes in the value of assets pending plan termination, while the second half allocates post-termination gains and losses to the Corporation. The pilots acknowledge as much, explaining that \u00a7 1344(c)\"is properly treated as a measure giving necessary guidance on the thorny issue of whose accounts are to be 'credited'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   with the gains or losses during the lengthy period when a plan is in the process of being terminated ... with the monies going to the Corporation's account (for the then-terminated plan) after termination.\" Pilots' Br. 47-48. The increase in the value of plan assets at issue in this case occurred after, not before, the plan terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Recognizing that \u00a7 1342(b) governs the appointment of pre-termination trustees also reveals a potential defect in the first half of \u00a7 1344(c) itself. The first half of \u00a7 1344(c) applies \"on the later of\" the appointment of a pre-termination trustee or when the plan terminates. But a pre-termination, statutory trustee will by definition be appointed before plan termination, rendering meaningless the question of which event comes later. This suggests the first half of \u00a7 1344(c) contains a drafting error, as both parties agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. at 8-9, 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We thus apply the second half of \u00a7 1344(c), which by its express terms governs the allocation of post-termination gains at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Corporation argues that it is entitled under \u00a7 1344(c) to any post-termination increase in the value of pension plan assets.

They reason that the Corporation should not be able to escape the liability for its misdeeds that would otherwise apply to a private trustee. Underlying this argument is an assumption that the pilots would be entitled to any post-termination increase in the value of plan assets if a private party, and not the Corporation, were the trustee in this case. But nothing in \u00a7 1344(c) suggests that the identity of the statutory trustee affects who takes\n   gains and losses after the plan terminates. They all go to the Corporation. The pilots cannot have the increase, and they presumably would not want the decrease, regardless of who acts as statutory trustee of the terminated Delta Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The pilots' request for post-termination investment gains is fundamentally flawed. Because \u00a7 1344(c) does not depend on whether the Corporation acts as statutory trustee of the terminated plan, any post-termination change in the value of plan assets must be \"credited to, or suffered by\" the Corporation in its capacity as\n   <em>\n    guarantor\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). This makes sense: Each participant's benefits are calculated at the time of plan termination and shielded from additional loss by the Corporation. If plan assets increase in value, the Corporation is likewise credited with that gain. The Corporation assumes this responsibility as guarantor of certain plan benefits. But the pilots sue the Corporation for fiduciary breach in its capacity as statutory\n   <em>\n    trustee\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

If the statutory trustee retains plan assets improperly, the argument goes, \u00a7 1344(c) simply does not apply and plan participants can recover any post-termination increase. The pilots repeat that argument here, suggesting it avoids any tension between the broad wording of \"appropriate equitable relief\" in \u00a7 1303(f)(1) and the directive in \u00a7 1344(c) that any post-termination increase or decrease in the value of plan assets goes to the Corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We do not see this distinction in \u00a7 1344(c).
