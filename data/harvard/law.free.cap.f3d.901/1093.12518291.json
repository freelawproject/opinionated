This form of relief is a discretionary benefit that requires an immigration judge (\"IJ\") to balance the applicant's \"adverse factors ... with the social and humane considerations presented on his (or her) behalf to determine whether the granting of relief appears in the best interest of\" the United States.\n   <em>\n    Ridore v.

First, when a noncitizen is placed in removal proceedings, the burden of proof shifts depending on whether he is subject to inadmissibility or removability. An \"applicant for admission\" bears the burden of proving he is not inadmissible under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while the government bears the burden of showing removability when a noncitizen has been lawfully admitted to the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)-(3). Adding further to the statutory scheme's complexity is the fact that the grounds for inadmissibility and deportability do not perfectly match, as some conduct and offenses can render a person inadmissible but not deportable, and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C) (creating removability for \"[c]ertain firearm offenses,\" a ground which is not present in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) );\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (allowing an exception to controlled substance offense removability for \"a single offense involving possession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (allowing no such exception in the parallel\n   inadmissibility ground). And admission to \"committing acts which constitute the essential elements of\" a specified offense can make an applicant inadmissible, while, in most cases, a conviction is required to make a noncitizen deportable for commission of a crime.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lawful permanent residents-who have been \"admitted\"-are under most circumstances subject to the grounds of removability, not inadmissibility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1227(a) (subjecting a noncitizen \"in and admitted to the United States\" to the grounds of deportability). This is precisely what occurred in Nguyen's case. As a lawful permanent resident, Nguyen was charged with removability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Nguyen was not charged with being inadmissible-and indeed, he could not have been. A noncitizen \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States\n   <em>\n    shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States for purposes of the immigration laws\n   </em>\n   \" except under one of six narrow exceptions, none of which applies here.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With this statutory structure as the backdrop, the effect of the stop-time rule on a lawful permanent resident is clear. Under the plain text of the stop-time rule, Nguyen was not rendered inadmissible by his possession of cocaine in 2005 because he is not subject to the grounds of inadmissibility. We can find no provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\")-and the government has pointed us to none-where inadmissibility is divorced from the context of seeking admission. There is no reason to conclude that inadmissibility should function differently for the purposes of the stop-time rule than it does elsewhere in the INA. We therefore hold that because Nguyen was not rendered inadmissible by his admitted use of cocaine in 2005, he did not trigger the stop-time rule and is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The government presents several arguments to the contrary, none of which is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, the government argues that Nguyen was rendered inadmissible because he\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be inadmissible if he ever sought admission to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(II). This reading, however, renders the second part of the stop-time rule entirely superfluous. \"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\"\n   <em>\n    Reiter v.
