The primary issue is whether proceeds of the debtor's liability policy are property of the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy court found the proceeds were property of the estate. We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of this case are tragic yet uncomplicated. In May 2016, a bus owned by OGA Charters, LLC rolled over while on its way to the Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino in Eagle Pass, Texas. The single-vehicle crash killed nine passengers and injured more than 40 others. The accident gave rise to personal-injury, wrongful-death, and survival claims against OGA. However, OGA owned only two busses and had limited resources. As is often the case, the search for assets began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Through New York Marine &amp; General Insurance Company (\"NYM\"), OGA owned an insurance policy that provided $5 million in liability coverage for \"covered autos.\" The policy also provided collision and comprehensive coverage. A small group of victims and their representatives (the \"Settled Claimants\") quickly entered into settlements with NYM that-if valid and enforceable-would exhaust the $5 million in liability coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Less than two months after the accident, the victims without settlements (the \"Unsettled Claimants\") filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against OGA. The Unsettled Claimants also initiated an adversary proceeding against OGA and NYM. The Settled Claimants intervened in the adversary proceeding, and the bankruptcy court preliminarily enjoined NYM from paying out any policy proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, disagreeing over\n   whether the proceeds of the insurance policy were property of the bankruptcy estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the Trustee and Unsettled Claimants, ruling that the proceeds were property of the estate. The Settled Claimants sought a direct appeal to this court, and the bankruptcy court certified the following question under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Are proceeds of a debtor-owned liability insurance policy property of the debtor's bankruptcy estate when: (1) the policy covers the debtor's liability to third parties; (2) the debtor cannot make a legally cognizable claim against the policy; and (3) the claims by third parties exceed the coverage limits of the policy[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Settled Claimants argue that the policy proceeds are not property of the estate, meaning they should be allowed to recover the full $5 million despite OGA's pending bankruptcy proceedings. Conversely, the Unsettled Claimants argue that the proceeds should be subjected to the bankruptcy court's process of equitable distribution amongst creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims against OGA's estate exceed $400,000,000. Other than the accident victims and their representatives, OGA has one other creditor, with a claim for less than $9,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When directly reviewing an order of the bankruptcy court on appeal, we apply the same standard of review that would have been used by the district court.\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest Diving, LP v.
