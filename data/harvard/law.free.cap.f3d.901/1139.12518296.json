(collectively, \"Appellants\"), appeal the district court's order affirming the bankruptcy court's dismissal of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy court dismissed the petition because it found that the petition lacked the requisite authority from the corporation's board of directors. The district court agreed, ruling that the individuals attempting to file the petition lacked authority where a receiver appointed by the Nevada state court already had removed them from the corporation's board of directors. We affirm. The bankruptcy court correctly dismissed the action because Appellants lacked corporate authority when they filed the rogue bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sino Clean Energy, Inc. (\"SCEI\"), is a Nevada holding company that, through various subsidiary entities, produces coal-water slurry in China. SCEI wholly owns Wiscon Holdings Limited which, in turn, owns 100% of the interests in Tongchuan Suoke Clean Energy Company. Both subsidiaries are entities of the People's Republic of China.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Until the legal troubles described here, SCEI had been under control in major part by former chairman and CEO Baowen Ren. Starting in 2011, SCEI became the subject of much legal controversy. In May 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission deregistered SCEI after it abruptly stopped filing certain required forms and financial information. In September 2012, SCEI was suspended from the NASDAQ stock exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By October 2013, a group of forty-three shareholders had filed a Nevada state-court petition in an attempt to acquire financial information from SCEI, including books and records regarding the money invested with SCEI. The shareholders also sought certain declaratory relief under Nevada Revised Statute section 78.345. SCEI was properly served with the complaint, but SCEI opted not to offer any responsive pleadings in the Nevada state-court action. After more than a year of SCEI's disregard for the Nevada state-court action, the plaintiffs filed for entry of default, which the state court granted. A few months after an entry of default, on March 17, 2014, the shareholder plaintiffs filed a motion for the appointment of a receiver. The Nevada state court granted the motion on May 12, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The order appointing a receiver held that SCEI, through its board of directors (at that time), was liable for nonfeasance and gross mismanagement pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes section 78.650. After finding that SCEI's board of directors \"failed to properly manage SCEI's\n   affairs,\" the state court appointed a receiver and granted him many powers, including the power to reconstitute SCEI's board of directors. The receiver eventually replaced the SCEI board of directors, effective in December 2014, with current and sole director, Gregg Graison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2015, former chairman and CEO Ren purported to \"reconstitute\" the former SCEI board of directors, and thereafter attempted to file a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on behalf of SCEI. The bankruptcy court dismissed the action on August 26, 2015, holding that, at the time the petition was filed by Ren and the former board members, the petition \"was filed without corporate authority\" because SCEI's board of directors \"had been replaced by the Receiver.\" The district court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review de novo the district court's decision on an appeal from bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    Educ.

Here, however, SCEI was and is fully able to file for bankruptcy through valid filings made by its eligible board of directors.\n   <em>\n    Corporate &amp; Leisure\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
