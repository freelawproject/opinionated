The Plaintiffs are twenty-seven individuals who are atheists or children of atheists and two atheist organizations who \"definitely do not trust in God.\" They brought this action against the United States and officials from the United States Mint, Treasury, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing (collectively \"the Government\"), raising various constitutional and statutory challenges. In the complaint, the Plaintiffs allege that the statutes requiring the inscription of the national motto on U.S. coins and currency,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205112\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) &amp; 5114(b), violate the Establishment Clause, the Free Speech Clause, and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment; the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"); and the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment. They seek declaratory relief and a permanent injunction barring the Government from minting coins or printing currency with the phrase \"In God We Trust.\" The Government filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim, which the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted.

In upholding the practice, the Court first looked to historical practices as evidence that the town's prayer was permitted by the Establishment Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1818-24.

Here,\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   is best suited to the challenge before us because both the prayer at issue in that case and the inscription of the national motto at issue here represent Government acknowledgments of religion that \"strive for the idea that people of many faiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Where \"history shows that the specific practice is permitted,\" we typically need go no further; the Establishment Clause claim fails.\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1819 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n    at 1834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Alito, J., concurring).
