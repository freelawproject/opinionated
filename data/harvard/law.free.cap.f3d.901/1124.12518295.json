Defendant receives federal funding-in\n   the form of federal financial aid to its students-through various funding programs available under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. To qualify for that funding, Defendant entered into a program participation agreement with the Department of Education (\"Department\"), in which it pledged to follow various requirements, including the incentive compensation ban. The incentive compensation ban prohibits schools from rewarding admissions officers for enrolling higher numbers of students.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201094\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20668.14\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 668.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2006, Defendant's admissions department instituted a new policy to encourage admissions representatives to enroll more students. The policy established an enrollment goal for each admissions representative. If a representative succeeded in enrolling that number of students, he or she would receive a salary increase of up to $30,000. Conversely, a representative could have his or her salary decreased by as much as $30,000 for failing to reach the assigned enrollment goal. Defendant characterized those adjustments as dependent on both quantitative success, meaning a representative's enrollment numbers, and qualitative success, meaning the representative's non-enrollment performance. But, in practice, the employees understood that their salary adjustments rested entirely on their enrollment numbers. Defendant rewarded one team of representatives with an expense-paid trip to Hawaii. The team received that reward solely because of their enrollment numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That enrollment incentive policy remained in place until 2009, when Defendant instituted new enrollment goals and a \"scorecard\" system for calculating salary adjustments. The scorecard system involved separate salary adjustment calculations for qualitative and quantitative performance. An admissions representative could receive an adjustment of as much as $23,000 for quantitative performance alone; adjustments related to qualitative performance topped out at $6,000. Managers were told not to share those scorecards with admissions representatives because of concerns about compliance with the participation agreement. The scorecard policy remained in effect until 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relators Scott Rose, Mary Aquino, Mitchell Nelson, and Lucy Stearns, who are former admissions representatives for Defendant, brought this False Claims Act action in 2010, claiming that Defendant violated the incentive compensation ban from 2006 through 2010. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court denied on May 4, 2016. But on June 16, 2016, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court clarified the law surrounding falsity and materiality in False Claims Act claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1999, 2001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , which the district court likewise denied. But the district court granted in part Defendant's motion for an interlocutory appeal, certifying to this court several questions relating to\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   's effect on our precedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Department of Education oversees the grant of Title IV funds to colleges and universities. To qualify for such funds, schools must comply with a number of statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements. One such requirement is the incentive compensation ban, which is mandated by statute, regulation, and contractual program participation agreements. The incentive compensation ban prohibits schools from providing \"any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201094\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20668.14\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 668.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(22). If individuals become aware of a school's violation of the incentive compensation ban, they can bring a qui tam action on behalf of the United States under the False Claims Act. When the Department becomes aware of such violations, it also can take direct action against noncompliant schools by, among other things, mandating corrective action; reaching a settlement agreement; imposing fines; or limiting, suspending, or terminating a school's participation in federal student aid programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The False Claims Act imposes liability on anyone who \"knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). We articulated the four elements of a False Claims Act claim in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Hendow v. University of Phoenix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n    461 F.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2006), another case that involved alleged violations of the incentive compensation ban. Under\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   , a successful False Claims Act claim requires: \"(1) a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct, (2) made with scienter, (3) that was material, causing (4) the government to pay out money or forfeit moneys due.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n    at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   has unsettled the state of this circuit's law with regard to two of those elements: falsity and materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Implied False Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The falsity requirement can be satisfied in one of two ways. The first is by express false certification, which \"means that the entity seeking payment [falsely] certifies compliance with a law, rule or regulation as part of the process through which the claim for payment is submitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Ebeid ex rel. United States v. Lungwitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768119\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/993/#p998\">\n    616 F.3d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 998 (9th Cir. 2010). The other is by implied false certification, which \"occurs when an entity has\n   <em>\n    previously\n   </em>\n   undertaken to expressly comply with a law, rule, or regulation [but does not], and that obligation is implicated by submitting a claim for payment even though a certification of compliance is not required in the process of submitting the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768119\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/993/#p998\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ebeid\n   </em>\n   , we clarified that, to establish a claim under the implied false certification theory, a relator must show that \"(1) the defendant explicitly undertook to comply with a law, rule or regulation that is implicated in submitting a claim for payment and that (2) claims were submitted (3) even though the defendant was not in compliance with that law, rule or regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768119\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/993/#p998\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Ebeid\n   </em>\n   , a relator bringing an implied certification claim could show falsity by pointing to noncompliance with a law, rule, or regulation that is necessarily implicated in a defendant's claim for payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Supreme Court subsequently addressed implied false certification in\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   . There, the Supreme Court held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [t]he implied certification theory can be a basis for liability,\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   where two conditions are satisfied: first, the claim does not merely request payment, but\n   also makes\n   <em>\n    specific representations\n   </em>\n   about the goods or services provided; and second, the defendant's failure to disclose noncompliance with material statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements makes those representations misleading half-truths.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We have addressed\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   in two cases that create uncertainty about the ongoing validity of\n   <em>\n    Ebeid\n   </em>\n   's test for falsity in implied false certification cases. First, in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Kelly v. Serco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125932\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/325/#p332\">\n    846 F.3d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (9th Cir. 2017), we considered only\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   's two-part test in determining that the plaintiff's implied false certification claim failed; we did not consider whether the claim met the lower standard for falsity enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Ebeid\n   </em>\n   . Then, in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Campie v. Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , we noted that\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   \" 'clarif[ied]\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the circumstances in which the False Claims Act imposes liability' under [an implied false certification] theory.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276000\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/890/#p901\">\n    862 F.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901 (9th Cir. 2017) (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1995 ),\n   <em>\n    petition for cert. filed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20U.S.L.W.%203519\">\n    86 U.S.L.W. 3519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (U.S. Dec. 26, 2017) (No. 17-936). But we then stated that the \"Supreme Court held that although the implied certification theory can be a basis for liability, two conditions\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20U.S.L.W.%203519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (citing\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2000 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Were we analyzing\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   anew, we doubt that the Supreme Court's decision would require us to overrule\n   <em>\n    Ebeid\n   </em>\n   . The Court did not state that its two conditions were the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   way to establish liability under an implied false certification theory. But our post-\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   cases-without discussing whether\n   <em>\n    Ebeid\n   </em>\n   has been fatally undermined-appear to\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   's two conditions nonetheless. We are bound by three-judge panel opinions of this court.\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Gammie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533829\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/889/#p899\">\n    335 F.3d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). We conclude, therefore, that Relators must satisfy\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   's two conditions to prove falsity, unless and until our court, en banc, interprets\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On this record, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Defendant's actions meet the\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   requirements for falsity. In the Federal Stafford Loan School Certification form, Defendant specifically represented that the student applying for federal financial aid is an \"eligible borrower\" and is \"accepted for enrollment in an eligible program.\" Because Defendant failed to disclose its noncompliance with the incentive compensation ban, those representations could be considered \"misleading half-truths.\" That is sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact and, therefore, to defeat summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the False Claims Act, \"the term 'material' means having a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). In\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   , we held that the relators had alleged adequately that the University of Phoenix \"engaged in statements or courses of conduct that were\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   to the government's decision with regard to funding.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n    461 F.3d at 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In concluding that the alleged violations of the incentive compensation ban were material, we relied on the fact that the statute, regulation, and program participation agreement all explicitly conditioned payment on compliance with the incentive compensation ban.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We did not explicitly consider any other factors in determining that the relators properly pleaded the materiality of the university's violations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We noted, with regard to materiality, that\n   \"the question is merely whether the false certification ... was relevant to the government's decision to confer a benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n    at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court elaborated on what can and cannot establish materiality in the context of the False Claims Act. The Court clarified that \"[w]hether a provision is labeled a condition of payment is\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   to but not\n   <em>\n    dispositive\n   </em>\n   of the materiality inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). Therefore, \"even when a requirement is expressly designated a condition of payment, not every violation of such a requirement gives rise to liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    at 1996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the Court explained, \"materiality looks to the effect on the likely or actual behavior of the recipient of the alleged misrepresentation,\" meaning the government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    at 2002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Supreme Court then laid out three scenarios that may help courts determine the likely or actual behavior of the government with regard to a given requirement. First, \"proof of materiality can include, but is not necessarily limited to, evidence that the defendant knows that the Government consistently refuses to pay claims in the mine run of cases based on noncompliance with the particular statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    at 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true that\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   explicitly considered only the facts that the defendant had violated a statute, regulation, and contract-by not complying with the incentive compensation ban-and that payment was conditioned on compliance with the ban.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672543\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1166/\">\n    461 F.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   did not state that noncompliance is material in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   cases. For instance,\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   itself may have been decided differently had there been countervailing evidence of immateriality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that noncompliance with the incentive compensation ban is not material per se. Nor does noncompliance automatically revoke institutional eligibility. Rather, we must examine the particular facts of each case. In other words, we view\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   as creating a \"gloss\" on the analysis of materiality. But the four basic elements of a False Claims Act claim, set out in\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   , remain valid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   p. 1129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   standard of materiality to the facts here, we conclude that Defendant has not established as a matter of law that its violations of the incentive compensation ban were immaterial. A reasonable trier of fact could find materiality here because the Department's payment was conditioned on compliance with the incentive compensation ban, because of the Department's past enforcement activities, and because of the substantial size of the forbidden incentive payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Funds Conditioned on Compliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We consider first the same factor that\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   did: the government conditioned the payment of Title IV funds on compliance with the incentive compensation ban through statute, regulation, and contract. Had Defendant not certified in its program participation agreement that it complied with the incentive compensation ban, it could not have been paid, because Congress required as much.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   After\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , that triple-conditioning of Title IV funds on compliance with the incentive compensation ban may not be sufficient, without more, to prove materiality, but it is certainly probative evidence of materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Past Department Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We next consider how the Department has treated similar violations. We look to the three scenarios bearing on materiality that the Supreme Court enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , though none of them is necessarily required or dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2003-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (laying out scenarios that can constitute proof of materiality or immateriality, but noting that such proof \"is not necessarily limited to\" those scenarios).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, we ask whether there is \"evidence that the defendant knows that the Government consistently refuses to pay claims in the mine run of cases based on noncompliance\" with the incentive compensation ban, because such a showing can help establish that the requirement was material.\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no such evidence in this case and, therefore, that inquiry does not factor into our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, we ask whether the Department has paid \"a particular claim in full despite its\n   <em>\n    actual knowledge\n   </em>\n   that\" the incentive compensation ban was violated, because \"that is very strong evidence that [the incentive compensation ban is] not material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The record does not establish that, during the relevant time period, the Department had actual knowledge that Defendant was violating the incentive compensation ban. We cannot, therefore, analyze the Department's behavior here to determine whether compliance with the incentive compensation ban was material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Third, we examine whether the Department \"regularly pays a particular type of claim in full despite\n   <em>\n    actual knowledge\n   </em>\n   that certain requirements were violated, and has signaled no change in position, [because] that is strong evidence that the requirements are not material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    at 2003-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). To show that the Department does regularly pay claims in full despite knowing about violations of the incentive compensation ban, Defendant points to two 2010 Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\") reports. The first report identifies 32 instances in which schools violated the incentive compensation ban between 1998 and 2009, and the second documents the Department's responses to those 32 violations. Because the Department \"did not limit, suspend, or terminate any [of those] school[s'] access to federal student aid,\" Defendant argues, the Department regularly paid claims in full despite actual knowledge of violations of the incentive compensation ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant's argument does not tell the whole story. Of the 32 schools with substantiated violations, the Department ordered 25 of them to take corrective action, which included terminating bonus payments to recruiters and ending referral fees to students. And 2 of those 25 schools were required to pay fines as a penalty, which together totaled $64,000. The Department also identified a liability of more than $187 million in misspent student aid funds at 1 of the 32 schools, meaning that the Department required the school to repay improperly awarded federal funds. The Department recouped more than $16 million of the total liability. The GAO reports also show that the Department took no further enforcement action at six schools with violations. But, of those six schools, three of them closed, two were terminated for other reasons, and one school's violations fell within a \"safe harbor provision.\" The GAO reports further reveal that the Department reached settlement agreements with 22 additional schools, which allowed it to recoup funds totaling more than $59 million in payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There is evidence, then, that the Department\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   care about violations of the incentive compensation ban and did not allow schools simply to continue violating the ban while receiving Title IV funds. And in many cases, through one means or another, the Department recouped many millions\n   of dollars from the violating schools, showing that it was not prepared to pay claims \"in full\" despite knowing of violations of the incentive compensation ban. The Department can demonstrate that requirements, such as the incentive compensation ban, are material without directly limiting, suspending, or terminating schools' access to federal student aid. A full examination of the Department's past enforcement habits in similar cases, therefore, reveals that a reasonable trier of fact could find that Defendant's violations of the incentive compensation ban were material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Magnitude of Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As mentioned, the Supreme Court also noted in\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   that materiality does not exist \"where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, were a school to offer admissions representatives cups of coffee or $10 gift cards for recruiting higher numbers of students, there would be no viable claim under the False Claims Act. That is not the case here. Under Defendant's 2006-2008 compensation scheme, admissions representatives stood to gain as much as $30,000 and a trip to Hawaii simply by hitting their enrollment goals. And under Defendant's 2009-2010 scorecard compensation scheme, representatives' salaries could be adjusted by as much as $23,000 for meeting their enrollment goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Those large monetary awards are quite unlike a small, occasional perk. Rather, those awards are precisely the kind of substantial incentive that Congress sought to prevent in enacting the ban on incentive compensation. Therefore, the tremendous bonuses that Defendant's admissions representatives could receive by achieving their enrollment goals (and the similar decreases that could result from falling short of the targets set by Defendant) also counsel against a finding that Defendant's noncompliance was immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Overall, then, when we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to Relators, we conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could find that Defendant's noncompliance with the incentive compensation ban was material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Safe Harbor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that, even if there is a question of fact as to one or more of\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   's four requirements for claims under the False Claims Act, it should win on summary judgment because any violations of the incentive compensation ban fell within the Department's safe harbor provision. The now-repealed safe harbor provision was in effect from 2003 through 2010.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Federal Student Aid Programs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C048\">\n    67 Fed.

But, caring is not enough to make it material under the\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   standard.

Significant materiality questions remain, for example: Does a fine for noncompliance represent a \"material\" aspect?

If the fines are material, were they imposed for more or less egregious behavior than the alleged Stephens Institute behavior?

Indeed, to reach its conclusion, the Majority appears to invoke the all or nothing\n   <em>\n    Hendow\n   </em>\n   analysis, which the Supreme Court squarely rejected. And, the Majority steps beyond such evidence being \"relevant\" and concludes that the Government's triple-conditioning of ICB compliance is \"probative evidence of materiality.\" Maj. Op. at 1132-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, the sole fact that compliance is a condition of payment is not enough.\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In sum, when evaluating materiality under the False Claims Act, the Government's decision to expressly identify a provision as a condition of payment is relevant, but\n   <em>\n    not automatically dispositive\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added)). Yes, certification of compliance with the ICB is required for payment, but so is certification of compliance with a\n   <em>\n    host\n   </em>\n   of additional statutes, regulations, and contractual requirements. There is no indication that the Government holds the ICB out as an exceptionally important requirement and, under\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , misrepresentations regarding compliance \"must be material to the Government's payment decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    at 1996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Plaintiffs alleged Stephens Institute knowingly paid significant compensation to recruiters for meeting certain enrollment goals. Yet, the record also indicates that the ICB is only one of many (if not hundreds) of the regulations with which the Department of Education (DOE) requires schools to comply and that the DOE has generally doled out only minor penalties for ICB violations-particularly for several seemingly significant violations. In this light, I think a jury would be left to speculate\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n    important the alleged misrepresentations actually are.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Majority faults my dissent for stating that answers to these questions are required before \"liability ... may be imposed.\" Maj. Op. at 1132, n.5. Particularly, it argues that on summary judgment, we must only determine whether there are questions of material fact, not whether \"liability ... may be imposed.\" The Majority's argument misreads my dissent and confuses the standard. Like we must on summary judgment, I am \"view[ing] the evidence in the light\n    <em>\n     most favorable to the non-moving party\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Vos v. City of Newport Beach\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517170\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1024/#p1030\">\n     892 F.3d 1024\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1030 (9th Cir. 2018) (emphasis added) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Lal v. California\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239603\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1112/#p1115\">\n     746 F.3d 1112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1115-16 (9th Cir. 2014) ). In this case, there is no real dispute about\n    <em>\n     what\n    </em>\n    the evidence is, but whether the evidence proffered is-viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party-sufficient to even go to trial, i.e., impute liability in the best case Plaintiffs have. Here, the evidence proffered is simply not enough under\n    <em>\n     Escobar\n    </em>\n    -there is\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    evidence about\n    <em>\n     what\n    </em>\n    the Government would actually do in this case (or even in a similar case). \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.
