Flores moved to dismiss the indictment because the underlying basis of his deportation was a 2001 conviction of three counts of receiving stolen property under California Penal Code \u00a7 496(a), which the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") deemed an aggravated felony theft offense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G).

We nonetheless hold that California's receipt of stolen property offense is a categorical match for the generic federal crime of receipt of stolen property and that it is therefore not unreasonable for the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") to construe it as a felony \"theft offense (including receipt of stolen property),\" that is, as an aggravated felony as defined in the INA. For that and other reasons discussed below, we conclude that the district court properly denied Flores's motion to dismiss the indictment, and we affirm his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Born in 1977 and brought to the United States by his grandmother when he was five, Flores attended school and eventually studied radio communications at Los Angeles Trade-Tech.

In 2002, while incarcerated, Flores was charged by the INS as deportable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) because his convictions\n   were for aggravated felonies as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G), that is, \"a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property).\" He was ordered removed on that basis; the order was executed on September 3, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between 2002 and 2009, this administrative removal order was reinstated three times. However, in 2009, Flores was subject to expedited removal proceedings after he presented a counterfeit Resident Alien Card, I-551, to border officers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Flores signed sworn admissions that he had purchased the counterfeit I-551 in Tijuana, presented it at the Port of Entry hoping to make it to Los Angeles, was previously deported, and failed to apply for permission to reenter the United States. He was removed to Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal stems from Flores's January 6, 2015, re-entry and indictment for violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Flores argued that the 2002 removal was invalid because receipt of known stolen property, California Penal Code \u00a7 496(a), is not an aggravated felony and that the 2009 expedited removal was invalid because his due process rights were violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Flores subsequently moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude the government's fingerprint expert, David Beers, on\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   grounds, which the district court denied.

App. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1. The Meaning of the Word \"Including\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Flores's argument rests on the express language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G),\n   which defines aggravated felonies to include \"a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property).\" He contends that if \"theft\" includes receipt of stolen property, and California's definition of theft is not a categorical match for generic theft, receipt of stolen property must also be deemed overbroad. This argument, however, fails to address the inherent ambiguity in the word \"including.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Flores is right that, on the one hand, \"including\" could mean a subset: the generic federal offense of \"receipt of stolen property\" must satisfy the elements of a generic federal \"theft offense,\" that is, the property must have been stolen through a generic theft offense, meaning without the owner's consent. California Penal Code section 496(a), however, lacks such a requirement. Instead, it criminalizes receipt of property taken from its owner through any theft, with or without consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, if we conclude that \"including\" has only the one meaning of \"subset,\" receiving known stolen property under California law would not be a categorical match with the generic federal offense of \"receipt of stolen property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the other hand, however, the word \"including\" could have been used by Congress to add a theft-related crime, receipt of stolen property, into the list of qualifying offenses even though it may not otherwise technically be a generic \"theft offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres v.

The government counters with public interest concerns, arguing that Flores's \"egregious\" criminal record going back twelve years and including multiple theft and burglary offenses and a firearms conviction outweighs Flores's assorted humanitarian considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Consideration of the unique humanitarian and public interest concerns related to Flores's circumstances leads us to conclude that this factor also weighs against the plausibility of an immigration officer's grant of withdrawal.

In\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   , the \"other humanitarian or public interest concerns\" weighed significantly in Raya's favor because his partner, their children, and his mother, siblings, and much of his extended family lived in the United States and his criminal history was \"fairly minimal,\" comprising three misdemeanors resulting in thirteen days in jail.\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   , 771 F.3d at 1198-99, 1208-09.

The second, that of Omar Argueta-Rosales, omits details of his criminal history and indicates only at least two prior deportations. Both these cases involved fraud, a circumstance where relief is ordinarily not available. But otherwise, those cases do not present circumstances analogous to Flores's situation, given Flores's significantly more serious criminal history and his more numerous, repeated deportations. As for the statistics, the evidence Flores presents demonstrates that in 2013, 9,387 individuals with fraudulent documents were subject to expedited removal.
