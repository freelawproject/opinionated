Because the Department had, at best, only limited additional data for 2008 and 2009, and because the 2009 data suggested that hospitals were paid more than expected, the Department's decision to wait a bit longer before reevaluating its complex predictive model was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, the Hospitals also challenge the Department's failure to publish a proposed, but later abandoned, draft rule during the 2003 rulemaking process.

Charges below the threshold are not. For that reason, the latter half of the above formula-the generic prospective payment, adjustments, and additional buffer (or \"outlier threshold\")-is collectively referred to as the \"fixed-loss cost threshold.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Fed.%20Reg.%2047%2C130\">\n    72 Fed.

The Department can control the threshold (and thus the number of cases eligible for outlier payments) by adjusting the additional buffer amount up or down at the start of the year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The first figure in the formula, \"charges, adjusted to cost,\" represents the estimated cost of care for the patient at issue. Since the Department will not know the hospital's actual cost of care at the time of payment, it can only estimate the hospital's costs using historical information about the hospital's past costs in relation to its prior charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department estimates costs as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-27\"><em>Historical Costs</em> <em>Charges, Adjusted to Cost = Actual Charges</em> \u00d7 __________________ <em>Historical Charges</em></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C476\">\n    53 Fed. Reg. 38,476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38,503 (Sept. 30, 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The final piece of this formula-historical costs/historical charges-is known as the hospital's \"cost-to-charge ratio.\" It reflects the percentage of that hospital's charges attributable to actual costs. To illustrate: If a hospital submits a bill for $1,000, the Department will look to see whether the hospital's estimated costs (or, as the Department refers to them, \"charges, adjusted to cost\") exceed the fixed-loss cost threshold. To do so, it will first need to know the costs embedded in that $1,000 charge. That is where the cost-to-charge ratio enters in. If the hospital charged $500 for this procedure in prior years, and its costs were $375, the hospital would have a cost-to-charge ratio of $375/$500 or .75. Put another way, in the past, 75% of the hospital's charges reflected its costs of care. Knowing that, the current costs of care can be estimated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-30\">$1,000 \u00d7 .75 = $750</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this instance, the hospital's \"charges, adjusted to costs\" would be $750, and that number can be weighed against the fixed-loss cost threshold for that patient's diagnosis-related group to determine whether the hospital should receive an outlier payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the statute provides that the total outlier payment for a given hospital \"shall be determined by the Secretary and shall * * * approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the [applicable] cutoff point.\" 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(A)(iii). To implement this objective, the Department currently pays 80% of all costs above the applicable threshold.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.84\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Continuing the previous example: If the fixed-loss cost threshold was $500, but the estimated cost of a patient's care was $750, the hospital would be eligible for an outlier payment of $200 (or 80% of $250, the amount falling above the $500 threshold). If, however, the threshold was $1,000, the hospital would receive no payment at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Over the years, the Department has taken various approaches to the cost-to-charge ratio data used to calculate the cost-adjusted charges in this formula. Originally, it employed a nationwide ratio for all hospitals. In the late 1980s, it shifted to hospital-specific ratios that more accurately reflected the costs at a given facility.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Fed.%20Reg.%2038%2C476\">\n    53 Fed. Reg. at 38,503, 38,507-38,509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified at 42 C.F.R. pts. 405, 412, 413 &amp; 419). But even after making that change, the Department had difficulties aligning its projections with actual costs of care. Prior to 2003, it used cost and charge data from the \"latest available settled cost report\" without any forward projections.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C494\">\n    68 Fed. Reg. 34,494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34,495 (June 9, 2003) (codified at 42 C.F.R. pt. 412).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But cost reports take several years to settle. And that time lag generated opportunities for abuse. Hospitals could manipulate their outlier payments by inflating current charges so that the historic cost-to-charge ratio employed to calculate outlier payments did not reflect the hospital's true costs. In those situations, the hospital's cost-to-charge ratio would overstate actual costs, resulting in an inflated cost estimate for the current year's claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C494\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C494\">\n    at 34,496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To use another example: If a hospital charged $2,000 for a certain procedure ($1,500 of which reflected the hospital's\n   costs), it would have a historic cost-to-charge ratio of 75%. If the hospital wanted to increase its chances of obtaining an outlier payment, it could simply increase the charge for that procedure to $4,000. Using the now outdated cost-to-charge ratio, the Department would calculate the hospital's estimated costs as $3,000 ($4,000 * .75), though, in reality, the costs were likely much closer to the original $1,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To make matters worse, prior to 2003, if a hospital's cost-to-charge ratio fell outside a specified window, the Department would substitute a statewide cost-to-charge ratio in lieu of the hospital-specific ratio.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010%2C420\">\n    68 Fed. Reg. 10,420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10,424 (March 5, 2003). That compounded the benefit of charge inflation because hospitals could reap the rewards of inflated charges in the short term without feeling the effects of a deflated cost-to-charge ratio in subsequent payment periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Unsurprisingly, this approach led to rampant inflation in hospital charges, a problem that came to be known as \"turbo-charging.\"\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/\">\n    867 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department later identified 123 hospitals that had engaged in the practice of turbo-charging starting in the 1990s. 68 Fed. Reg. at 10,423.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 2003, when the turbo-charging problem came to light, the Department issued a regulation that addressed the problem in two key ways. First, the Department sought to close the gap between cost-to-charge ratios and current costs by using more recent data-specifically by permitting the use of \"either the most recent settled or the most recent tentative settled cost report, whichever is from the later cost reporting period.\" 68 Fed. Reg. at 34,499. Second, the Department reserved the right to recalculate a hospital's eligibility using actual cost data at the time of settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34,501. Through this process, known as reconciliation, the agency could claw-back undue outlier payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At that same time, the Department also considered immediately adjusting the 2003 outlier threshold, which had been set at the beginning of the year, to account for the effect of the reforms on 2003 outlier payments. To that end, the Department drafted a rule proposing to decrease the existing outlier threshold for the remainder of the 2003 fiscal year. The Department ultimately abandoned that effort, opting instead to maintain the existing threshold until the year's end to allow rates to settle. 68 Fed. Reg. at 34,506. So the draft rule was never published. The Hospitals later obtained a copy of the draft through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To add complexity to the complexity, the Medicare statute also limits the total amount of all outlier payments the Department can make in a given fiscal year-setting both a floor and a ceiling. Under the Act, the \"total amount of\" outlier payments made in a fiscal year \"may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on [diagnosis-related group] prospective payment rates for discharges in that year.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(A)(iv). Of course, that requires the Department to estimate certain numbers at the start of the year before it has actual claims information. Because the statutory target is tied to \"projected or estimated,\" not actual, payments,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., the Department has interpreted the statutory directive to mean that the fixed loss threshold must be set at a level that, \"when tested against historical data, will\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   produce aggregate outlier payments totaling between five and six percent of projected or estimated [diagnosis-related\n   group] payments.\"\n   <em>\n    County of L.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870708,11572678\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/1005/\">\n    192 F.3d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Fed.%20Reg.%2035%2C646\">\n    50 Fed. Reg. 35,646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35,710 (Sept. 3, 1985). For every year since 1989, the Department has aimed to set the fixed-loss cost threshold so that the total outlier payments will be 5.1% of all Medicare payments, or:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-43\"><em>Total Outlier Payments</em> = 5.1% (<em>Total Projected Medicare Payments</em>)</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But, alas, this is a predictive enterprise. The Department must set the outlier threshold at the start of each year before it knows how many hospitals will actually have outlier patients. In other words, the agency must estimate the number of outlier cases for the upcoming year and set a threshold that it believes will result in outlier payments of 5.1%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As a result, to compute an appropriate outlier threshold, the Department must estimate the total outlier costs for all hospitals for the upcoming year. In practice, the Department uses a formula similar to the one it uses to calculate actual outlier payments, inputting projected and historical cost and charge information to fill in the gaps. More specifically, the agency takes historical charges and projects them forward to reflect the upcoming year's charges.

Commenters also faulted the agency for not using more recent cost-to-charge ratio data, and suggested applying the cost-to-charge ratio adjustment factor over different periods of time (longer or shorter than one year) based on individual hospital's fiscal calendars.

Second, they challenge the Department's failure to account for the possibility of reconciliation claw-backs in setting the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 thresholds.

In the wake of the turbo-charging scandal and persistent cost containment problems, it was not unreasonable for the Department to be wary of an industry-specific inflation metric. Plus, as the Department explained, a method accounting for general inflation \"is more accurate and stable\" than the industry-specific alternative.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Fed.%20Reg.%2047%2C130\">\n    72 Fed.

In light of the short pattern of missed targets, the limited and inconsistent data available to the Department at the time of its rulemakings, and the lengthy time lag in finally determining the actual payments made for a preceding year, we conclude that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   To be sure, a methodology used for prediction \"can look more arbitrary the longer it is applied.\"\n   <em>\n    American Petroleum Inst. v.

Cir. 2013). But that line was not crossed for the years at issue here. In 2008, the Department had only one year's worth of yet unsettled data to test the validity of its new model. By the time the Department had to develop its 2008 outlier payment amount, it had not definitively settled on the 2007 results, a cost-resolution process that can take several years. The tentative 2007 results were not so far off base as to suggest the need for immediate abandonment of the newly adopted system. Even by 2009, the Department had only a slightly more settled 2007 estimate and a tentative number for 2008. The time-lag inherent in obtaining accurate payment data underscores the reasonableness of the Department's deliberative and cautious approach to evaluating the operation and accuracy of its methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Putting some proof in the pudding, the Department's calculations indicated that it not only met, but exceeded, the 5.1% mark in 2009, resulting in payments to the Hospitals that exceeded the Department's 5.1% target. Even considering the Hospitals' contrary estimation of 4.9%, the 2009 payments nearly reached the Department's intended target. For that reason, we cannot conclude that the Department acted arbitrarily in continuing to employ its predictive model for the next two years while accumulating additional data points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For all its complexity and labyrinthine mathematical formulae, this case turns on\n   a simple concept: Some things take a bit of time to sort out. The Department's efforts to predict Medicare costs for patients across the Nation each fiscal year is fraught with variables, estimates, and uncertainties. The Medicare statute recognizes that difficulty by requiring the Department to model results that fall between 5% and 6% of total projected payments, without mandating that the Department actually hit the bullseye each year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(A)(iv). Though the Department has an obligation to act reasonably and to account for the actual results of its decisions, the need for time both to study the results and to determine how to improve accuracy must inform any evaluation of the appropriateness of the Department's actions in these years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For those reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Unlike other payments, outlier payments are typically made based on the data available at the time the Department processes the hospital's claim.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C494\">\n     68 Fed.
