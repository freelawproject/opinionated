For decades, Seven Counties has\n   participated in Kentucky's public pension plan, the Kentucky Employees Retirement System (KERS or the System). But because the rate set for employer contributions has drastically increased in recent years, Seven Counties now seeks to use these proceedings to reject its relationship with KERS. The bankruptcy court and the district court both held that Seven Counties is eligible to file under Chapter 11 and that the relationship between Seven Counties and KERS is based on an executory contract that can be rejected in bankruptcy. Because the Commonwealth of Kentucky does not exercise the necessary forms of control over Seven Counties, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the conclusion that Seven Counties is eligible to file. But, lacking guidance from the Kentucky state courts, we\n   <strong>\n    CERTIFY\n   </strong>\n   the question of the nature of the relationship to the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Seven Counties is a Kentucky nonprofit that has provided mental health services in the area surrounding Louisville, Kentucky since 1978. In its role as a community mental health center (CMHC), Seven Counties provides services to approximately 33,000 people, serving as a safety net for adults and children with mental illnesses, emotional or behavioral disorders, developmental or intellectual disabilities, and alcohol or drug addictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CMHCs like Seven Counties have provided mental health services in Kentucky since the 1960s. In 1963, Congress passed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, which provided federal funding to establish CMHCs. Pub. L. No. 88-164,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Stat.%20282\">\n    77 Stat. 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). Before that time, mental health services in Kentucky, like in most states, were largely provided by the state government. With the newly available federal funding, Kentucky embarked on a plan to provide services through CMHCs, including by passing laws that enabled their creation and regulation. Seven Counties' predecessor in the Louisville area, a nonprofit that eventually became known as River Region Mental Health-Mental Retardation Board, was founded at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When River Region and the other new CMHCs formed in 1966, they began providing local services that had previously been provided by the Kentucky Department of Mental Health. Many of the CMHCs' new employees had previously been Department employees. Those employees were reluctant to leave the state system and thereby give up the retirement benefits they had been accruing in the state public pension system, KERS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to the employees' dilemma, the Governor issued an executive order declaring that \"community mental health boards are permitted to become and are participating agencies in the Kentucky Employe[e]s Retirement System.\" Ky. Exec. Order No. 66-378 (June 23, 1966). The order did not distinguish between newly hired employees and those who were transitioning from state employment. Three CMHCs declined to participate; the remainder became part of KERS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1978, River Region filed for reorganization and then for bankruptcy under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. That same year, Seven Counties was incorporated and became the designated\n   CMHC for the area formerly served by River Region. As the bankruptcy court concluded, \"[e]xcept for adopting its separate corporate identity and not assuming debt, Seven Counties was the direct successor to River Region for all business and regulatory purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Seven Ctys. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Ky. Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Seven Ctys.

Ky. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But Seven Counties was not automatically pulled into KERS. Approximately six months after Seven Counties formed, its executive director sent a letter to the Kentucky Retirement Systems-the body that administers KERS-about Seven Counties' participation in KERS. Seven Counties then sent a letter to the Attorney General asking whether it was eligible to participate in KERS. The Attorney General's response cited the provision in Kentucky law that allows an entity to become a participating \"department\" in KERS upon issuance of an executive order, Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 61.510(3), and concluded that because Seven Counties \"appears to be [River Region's] newly created successor, it is our opinion that [Seven Counties] employe[e]s may begin to participate in the KERS upon the issuance of an Executive Order from the Governor to that effect.\" Ky. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 78-685,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1978%20WL%2026239\">\n    1978 WL 26239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 4, 1978). According to the minutes from a Seven Counties board meeting the following month, Seven Counties then \"petition[ed] ... the Governor to sign an Executive Order to allow [Seven Counties] to join KERS.\" In January, the Governor issued an executive order \"designat[ing] Seven Counties Services, Inc. as a participating department in the Kentucky Employe[e]s Retirement System.\" Ky. Exec. Order No. 79-78 (Jan. 24, 1979).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In recent years, participation in KERS has become a heavy financial burden for Seven Counties. A brief summary suffices to explain the nature of a complex problem. KERS is a defined benefit plan. Participating employers and their employees pay into the System at a set rate and then, upon retirement, the System pays out the defined benefit at a rate determined by multiplying the employee's final compensation, the \"benefit factor,\" and the number of years of service credit. If the rates at which employees and employers pay into the System are not set appropriately, KERS can become underfunded. The subset of KERS in which Seven Counties participates (known as the \"non-hazardous plan\") was fully funded as recently as 2000. But as of 2013, when Seven Counties' petition was filed, the General Assembly had failed for years to budget sufficient funds to make the actuarially required contribution that would ensure the financial health of KERS. To make the situation worse, KERS's assets declined substantially in value during market downturns in 2000-01 and 2008-09, and the legislature approved but did not fund cost-of-living adjustments to respond to inflation. The burden of this shortfall falls on the employers participating in KERS. (Employee contribution rates, KERS's other source of income aside from investment returns, are capped by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 61.560(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Recognizing the funding crisis in its public pension system, Kentucky's General\n   Assembly phased in increased employer contribution rates starting in 2008, and then, in 2013, began requiring employers participating in KERS-including the State itself-to contribute at the full, actuarially required rate going forward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 61.565. Aware of the burden this placed on some participating employers, the legislature provided assistance to CMHCs, keeping their rates somewhat lower than those of other employers in the System. Nonetheless, Seven Counties' contribution rates rose well above their historic single-digit range. By the time Seven Counties filed its petition in April 2013, its contribution rate was just under 24% of wages-and was set to increase to almost 27% in a few months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the bankruptcy court, at an employer contribution rate of 24%, \"Seven Counties can perform its charitable mission or pay System contributions that will force it to terminate operations. It cannot do both.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Seven Ctys. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4299572\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/511/431/#p443\">\n    511 B.R. at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And as of 2013, there was no statutory mechanism by which Seven Counties could withdraw from KERS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   So Seven Counties filed a Chapter 11 petition, seeking a way to shed its ongoing obligation to participate in KERS. If Seven Counties is permitted to withdraw, KERS estimates that it will leave behind a shortfall of over $90 million to be picked up by other employers in the System-and, ultimately, Kentucky taxpayers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The proceedings since filing have been lengthy and convoluted. In the instant matter, KERS appeals the dismissal of its complaint in an adversary proceeding. In that complaint, KERS made two basic arguments: (1) that Seven Counties is a \"governmental unit\" and therefore ineligible to file under Chapter 11, and (2) that Seven Counties should be required to comply with its statutory obligations to make contributions and reports to KERS during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings. In the same proceeding-and addressed by the bankruptcy court in the same ruling-Seven Counties filed a motion seeking to reject its obligation to contribute to KERS as an executory contract. The bankruptcy court found in favor of Seven Counties on all counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Seven Ctys. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4299572\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/511/431/#p443\">\n    511 B.R. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This exclusion is logical because governments are not like traditional debtors. The taxation powers of governments are only indirectly analogous to individual or corporate sources of income; their obligations to their citizens have no private analogue. And federal interference with state and local governance via bankruptcy raises unique constitutional concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bekins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10810\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/27/#p51\">\n    304 U.S. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51-52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10810\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/27/#p51\">\n    58 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10810\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/27/#p51\">\n    82 L.Ed. 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938). Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, which governs municipal bankruptcy, is designed to operate in those unique circumstances,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (allowing municipal bankruptcy only if specifically authorized by state law); Chapter 11 is not. Thus, if Seven Counties is a \"governmental unit,\" it is not eligible for relief under Chapter 11 and its petition must be dismissed. By definition, any \"department, agency, or instrumentality of ... a State\" is a \"governmental unit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (27).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, KERS argues that Seven Counties is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Kentucky; Seven Counties responds that it is not. Neither this court nor any of our sister circuits has developed a test to determine whether an entity is a state instrumentality within the meaning of \u00a7 101(27). The parties point to a number of sources to aid in developing such a test here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, Seven Counties invites us to follow our decision in\n   <em>\n    Halikas v. River Region Mental Health-Mental Retardation Board\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    River Region\n   </em>\n   \"), No. 80-5433,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20F.2d%201026\">\n    667 F.2d 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. Oct. 22, 1981) (order). The bankruptcy and district courts in that case both squarely held that River Region, Seven Counties' predecessor, was not a state instrumentality and so was eligible to file for bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re River Region Mental Health-Mental Retardation Bd.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    , Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Greenberg v. River Region Mental Health Mental Retardation Bd., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ), No. BK 78-00193-L, slip op. at 40-43 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. Jan. 8, 1980),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   , No. BK 78-00193-L, slip op. at 8 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 11, 1980). Our affirmance was unpublished and did not explain its reasoning; the statutory scheme at issue there was also different from the scheme here. (The term \"governmental unit\" was not introduced into law until the 1978 Bankruptcy Code was passed several months after River Region filed its petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 95-598,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%202549\">\n    92 Stat. 2549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). ) The case is therefore not binding. Nonetheless, in light of \"the Supreme Court's directive not to 'read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure,' \"\n   <em>\n    Ice House Am., L.L.C. v. Cardin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070515,4319916\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/734/\">\n    751 F.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

We look first to the text of the statute, but the Bankruptcy Code does not define the term. Common definitions provide some help, but do not decisively resolve the issue. For example,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines an instrumentality as either \"[a] thing used to achieve an end or purpose\" or \"[a] means or agency through which a function of another entity is accomplished, such as a branch of a governing body.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014);\n   <em>\n    see also Webster's New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1172 (3d ed. 1961) (defining instrumentality as \"something by which an end is achieved\" or \"something that serves as an intermediary or agent through which one or more functions of a controlling force are carried out\"). Seven Counties concedes, albeit in a slightly different context, that its work\n   providing a safety net of mental health care serves a public purpose, so at least one aspect of these definitions would seem to be satisfied. But these definitions also contemplate an entity \"us[ing]\" or \"controlling\" its instrumentality. Governmental control therefore plays a critical role in identifying state instrumentalities. In this conclusion, we are not at odds with the dissent, which acknowledges that the plain meaning of the word \"instrumentality\" requires \"a degree of sovereign control.\" Dissenting Op. at 734-35. The core of the dissent's disagreement appears to be with what \"degree\" of control is required-a question that is not plainly answered by the Bankruptcy Code and to which we will turn shortly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Governmental Control\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A number of sources confirm the emphasis on governmental control. The legislative history report accompanying the 1978 Bankruptcy Act explained that the new act\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   defines \"governmental unit\" in the broadest sense.... \"Department, agency, or instrumentality\" does not include entities that owe their existence to State action such as the granting of a charter or a license but that have no other connection with a State or local government or the Federal Government. The relationship must be an active one in which the department, agency, or instrumentality is actually carrying out some governmental function.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 311 (1977). This explanation is not entirely clear. There is some tension between requiring an \"active\" relationship and urging that the definition be read \"in the broadest sense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641675,12454861\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/505/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, control is inherent in the distinction between an \"active\" relationship and one characterized by merely granting a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    River Region\n   </em>\n   likewise supports a focus on state control. We did not delve into the details of why River Region was not a state instrumentality. The district court decision that we affirmed, however, did, explaining that state instrumentalities, unlike CMHCs, are \"entirely subject to governmental control.\"\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    River Region\n   </em>\n   , No. BK 78-00193-L, slip op. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Emphasizing control is consonant with tests imposed in related areas. The Internal Revenue Service has explained that \"the degree of control that the federal or state government has\" over an entity is \"[o]ne of the most important factors\" in determining whether it is a government instrumentality and so tax exempt. Rev. Rul. 89-49, 1989-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20C.B.%20117\">\n    1 C.B. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rev. Rul. 57-128, 1957-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20C.B.%20311\">\n    1 C.B. 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing public control and supervision as one of six factors to be considered). Similarly, we have explained that \"[a]n entity is a political subdivision of a state if it is a creation of the state, if its power to act rests entirely within the discretion of the state, and if it can be destroyed at the mere whim of the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Greater Heights Acad. v.

Creation and destruction are exercises of control.

In determining if Seven Counties is a \"governmental unit\" ineligible for Chapter 11 relief in bankruptcy, we begin with an evaluation of these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, Kentucky did not create Seven Counties. Private individuals incorporated Seven Counties as a nonprofit. As we have previously noted in a different context, that Kentucky recognizes a corporation as a CMHC after its incorporation does not mean that the entity was created by the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ky.

The Board and Officers of Seven Counties are selected internally without input from the state government. The lone state official who attends some Seven Counties' board meetings, a governmental liaison, has no vote and is excluded from executive sessions. However, if the Secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services finds that \"an emergency situation exists with regard to the financial stability\" of a CMHC, the Secretary may, upon giving the CMHC thirty days' notice, appoint a \"caretaker administrator\" for a CMHC and make other necessary \"personnel changes.\" Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.440(3) - (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, although Seven Counties is subject to governmental regulation and recognition, it does not function pursuant to an enabling statute. Kentucky statutes lay out a scheme for recognizing-and withdrawing recognition of-CMHCs as eligible to provide regional mental health services.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302009\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/706/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 210.380, .440. To receive state funding for the provision of those services, each CMHC must annually submit a plan, budget, and description of the membership of its board.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302009\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/706/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 210.430. Though this statutory scheme involves governmental oversight that bears some analogy to an enabling statute, being subject to regulation is not synonymous with functioning pursuant to an enabling statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Eastside Mental Health Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1161519\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/669/671/#p679\">\n    669 F.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679 (11th Cir. 1982) (concluding that a heavily regulated CMHC was not a political subdivision of a state because state licensing regulations \"are normal means by which states effectuate public policies through the regulation of private entities ...

Moreover, unlike the traditional governmental agency whose actions may not exceed the bounds of its enabling statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n    569 U.S. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297-98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), Seven Counties can and does undertake projects unrelated to its role as a regional provider of mental health services, such as entering contracts to staff state medical facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Conditioning receipt of governmental funding on satisfaction of certain conditions is even less invasive. When identifying federal agencies and instrumentalities for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, the Supreme Court held: \"Grants of federal funds ...

Unlike direct appropriations (which neither Seven Counties nor any other CMHC receives), these types of funding sources are generally available to state and non-state entities alike. Even if we assumed that the bankruptcy court was incorrect to conclude that Seven Counties does not have a statutory right to request a special ad valorem tax to fund its programs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.480(1), requesting a tax is a far cry from assessing one, and Seven Counties has never taken even the limited step of making such a request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   And fifth, Kentucky cannot destroy Seven Counties, although the State could impair Seven Counties' ability to function. If certain named statutory preconditions (such as failing to comply with an approved service plan or state regulations) occur, the State may withdraw its recognition of a CMHC and thereby render it ineligible for the main service provision contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky.

But Kentucky may not withdraw recognition of a CMHC at a \"mere whim,\"\n   <em>\n    Greater Heights Acad.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761756\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/678/#p680\">\n    522 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   680 ; the CMHC must take or fail to take certain actions listed in the statute to trigger these consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.440(2). And while withdrawal of recognition would create financial difficulties because that contract accounts for more than 20% of annual revenue, Seven Counties would not thereby cease to exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skills Dev. Servs., Inc. v. Donovan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57525\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/294/#p300\">\n    728 F.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300 (6th Cir. 1984) (concluding that nonprofit corporations that contracted with the State of Tennessee to provide services to the mentally disabled were not state instrumentalities for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act even though the contracts could be terminated at any time).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As this analysis makes clear, Seven Counties is an unusual entity. In the early 1960s, its predecessor began providing mental health services in Kentucky, and its evolution over the following decades included a filing for reorganization and then completion of bankruptcy in the late 1970s. These changes led to the present day Seven Counties, a unique entity with some features that might seem to belong to a state agency and others that would be entirely inconsistent with a governmental designation. Consideration of all factors involved, however, suggests that Seven Counties is not a governmental entity: The Commonwealth of Kentucky did not create Seven Counties, does not in the normal course of events choose its leadership, does not govern its operations through an enabling statute, does not fund it through a mechanism that is normally reserved for public entities, and cannot unilaterally destroy it. We therefore conclude that Seven Counties is not a state instrumentality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Other Considerations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It does not follow from this analysis that governmental control is the only factor that could distinguish a private entity from a government instrumentality. A showing that Seven Counties possessed commonly recognized governmental attributes, for example, would give pause. But Seven Counties has not been shown to have any such attributes. There is no suggestion in the record that Seven Counties has the power of eminent domain. It cannot levy taxes. And while Seven Counties may have attempted to claim the defense of sovereign immunity in litigation, that claim has never been adjudged in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Likewise, we would hesitate to second-guess a state's classification of its own governmental entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tobkin v. Fla. Bar\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Tobkin\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276960,4229996\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/578/962/\">\n    578 F. App'x 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (11th Cir. 2014) (relying in part on Florida Supreme Court rules designating the bar association an agency of that court to conclude that the bar association is a governmental unit);\n   <em>\n    In re Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859541,6509566\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/948/1122/\">\n    948 F.2d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1124 (9th Cir. 1991) (same). But the evidence that Kentucky makes such a claim as to CMHCs is not persuasive. In a 1974 decision explaining why CMHCs should not be eligible to participate in KERS, Kentucky's highest court explained that \"[t]he mental health-mental retardation corporations here involved are not claimed to be state agencies for any purpose other than retirement system participation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ky. Region Eight v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10129792\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/507/489/#p491\">\n    507 S.W.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491 (Ky. 1974). The legislature responded in part by adding new statutory language affirming that any entity appropriately designated by the Governor for participation in KERS \"shall be deemed to be a department, notwithstanding whether said body, entity, or instrumentality is an integral part of state government.\" Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 61.510(3). That response confirmed CMHCs' statutory eligibility to participate in KERS, but did nothing to establish CMHCs as part of the state government. To the contrary, the \"notwithstanding\" clause implicitly acknowledges that CMHCs like Seven Counties are not \"an integral part of state government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10129792\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/507/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, again, CMHCs' unusual nature is on display: Kentucky statutes mention them, but do not explicitly claim them as governmental bodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   KERS presents no persuasive evidence that the situation has changed in the intervening years. KERS makes much of the legislature's recently added requirement that CMHC boards \"[c]omply with the provisions\" governing \"special purpose governmental entities.\"\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7\u00a7 210.400(8), 65A.010-.090.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But complying with regulations for special purpose governmental entities is not the same as\n   <em>\n    being\n   </em>\n   a special purpose governmental entity.

Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We are next tasked with determining the legal nature of the relationship between Seven Counties and KERS. Seven Counties characterizes the relationship as a contractual one, such that, to the extent it is executory, it may be rejected in bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . KERS argues the relationship is purely statutory, in the nature of an assessment, such that it cannot be rejected under \u00a7 365 and must be faithfully maintained throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20959\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Both sides present persuasive arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   KERS asks us to certify this issue to the Kentucky Supreme Court. Under Kentucky rules, federal courts may certify \"questions of law of this state which may be determinative of the cause then pending before the originating court and as to which it appears to the party or the originating court that there is no controlling precedent\" in state court decisions. Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.37(1). In other words, we may certify a question if (1) it presents a question of Kentucky law, (2) it is possibly determinative, and (3) there is no controlling precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To the first point, deciding the nature of the relationship between KERS and Seven Counties requires interpreting both Kentucky statutes governing participation in KERS and Kentucky caselaw about the nature of a contract. In each circumstance, the key problem is one of Kentucky law. We do not understand this rule to forbid the certification of mixed questions of law and fact; the Kentucky Supreme Court has previously accepted the certification of questions that apply Kentucky law to facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Beverly Hills Fire Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9955999\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/672/922/#p922\">\n    672 S.W.2d 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 922 (Ky. 1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, the Kentucky Supreme Court's decision on this issue \"may be\"-although will not necessarily be-determinative of almost all of this cause. To be clear, the \"cause\" is KERS's adversary proceeding, not the entirety of Seven Counties' bankruptcy filing. If the Kentucky Supreme Court determined that the relationship is statutory in nature, the relatively minor issue of whether that obligation must be faithfully maintained during the pendency of proceedings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20959\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) would remain; Seven Counties' cross appeal (assuming for the sake of argument that it is properly presented in this proceeding) would also remain. But Seven Counties would be unable to reject its obligation to participate as an executory contract, which would resolve the core claim raised in KERS's adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, and most important, we are not aware of any precedent from Kentucky courts that provides clear guidance in answering this question.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We conclude that because the Commonwealth of Kentucky does not exercise the requisite degree of control over Seven Counties, Seven Counties is not a state instrumentality within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. We therefore\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's decision that Seven Counties is eligible to file under Chapter 11. But lacking state court precedent characterizing the nature of the relationship between Seven Counties and KERS, we\n   <strong>\n    CERTIFY\n   </strong>\n   that question to the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   DAVID W. McKEAGUE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The majority is right that \"[n]either this court nor any of our sister circuits have developed a test to determine whether an entity is a state instrumentality within the meaning of \u00a7 101(27)\" of the Bankruptcy Code. Op. at 725. But instead of developing a clear test to fill the void, the majority relies on a single factor predominantly derived from a Nevada bankruptcy court's test-that it then purports not to adopt-to hold that Seven Counties is not an instrumentality. In doing so, the majority misapprehends several provisions of Kentucky's statutory regime governing entities like Seven Counties, likely leading it to an erroneous result even under its own approach. Because I cannot agree with the reasoning the majority uses or the result it reaches, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   I begin by noting that congressional acquiescence to longstanding precedent mandates a broad definition of \"instrumentality\" in the bankruptcy context because of state sovereignty interests. From there, using an ordinary-meaning framework, I conclude that Seven Counties easily qualifies as an instrumentality of Kentucky. I then answer the primary objection to an ordinary-meaning definition-that such a definition casts too broad a net-noting that the Supreme Court has already held entities like the Red Cross and Amtrak are instrumentalities in analogous contexts and concluding that Seven Counties would so qualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The term \"governmental unit\" was introduced into law in the 1978 Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub.

The Code casts a broad net with this term. A \"governmental unit\" includes: \"United States; State; Commonwealth; District; Territory; municipality; foreign state; department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States ..., a State, a Commonwealth, a District, a Territory, a municipality, or a foreign state; or other foreign or domestic government.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (27). But before I explore the definition of \"instrumentality\"-the most relevant subset of \"governmental unit\" in this case-I examine\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   Congress sought to \"define[ ] 'governmental unit' in the broadest sense.\" H.R.

The Supreme Court put a stop to it: \"If the obligations of states or their political subdivisions may be subjected to the interference [bankruptcy law creates],\" the Court wrote, \"they are no longer free to manage their own affairs....

This case provides but one striking example: Seven Counties wants to use Chapter 11 to walk away from its solemn state statutory obligations, leaving Kentucky and its own retirement system holding the bag. One could imagine other perverse results. Chapter 11 also allows for\n   <em>\n    involuntary\n   </em>\n   bankruptcy.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.380. Rather than provide care directly, as it had done for decades, Kentucky decided to provide mental health services through intermediaries. But this shift from institutionalized to community-based care did not signal a retreat from what has remained a core part of the\n   <em>\n    salus populi\n   </em>\n   for over a century. Even if its motives had once been malevolent or its care substandard, government has long directly assumed care for those in need of mental and behavioral health services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   From its inception, through its \"community mental health board[ ],\" Seven Counties has \"provide[d] regional community mental health-mental retardation services\" to fulfill the State's responsibility to the less fortunate.

Kentucky's statutory scheme provides entities like Seven Counties with special oversight from community-based boards, which must include local government stakeholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.480. These boards may, indeed\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   , request a special ad valorem tax if the programs they oversee are underfunded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .

Crucially, and most relevant to the \"control\" element, if Seven Counties fails to fulfill its (government) functions, CHFS has the authority to appoint a caretaker to operate and administer the programs and to make personnel changes necessary to ensure Seven Counties' continued operations in compliance with its plan and budget and CHFS' requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.440(3) - (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   And in the same vein that Seven Counties owes its very status to Kentucky law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.380 -what the government can giveth, it can taketh away,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2577287\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill/12/480/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 210.440(2).

If Seven Counties had no statutory status apart from any private corporation under Kentucky law, how could that possibly be so? While the Commonwealth could not necessarily \"destroy\" Seven Counties' status as a nonprofit corporation for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   purposes, it certainly has the power to destroy its instrumental status that births its very name-its status as the sole direct provisioner of community-based mental health care in a seven-county area under Kentucky law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   To be sure, Kentucky does not exercise \"day-to-day\" control over Seven Counties. However, neither does it exercise \"day-to-day\" control over its municipalities. Kentucky's commitment to subsidiarity (or local control) does not mean that it has abandoned solidarity with those whom receive its direct aid. An instrumentality can, of course, \"control[ ] its own day-to-day operations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hosp.

Ga. July 3, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Yet the majority seems to require just that-it constructs several factors that only serve to fuel its heightened \"government control\" test. In doing so, the majority misapprehends several provisions in the relevant statute. I briefly consider three of its worst mistakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Enabling Statute.\n   </em>\n   First, the majority finds that Seven Counties \"does not function pursuant to an enabling statute.\" An \"enabling statute\" is a law that \"creates new powers,\" particularly one that \"confer[s] powers\" on an instrumentality \"to carry out various delegated tasks.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). The majority is clearly wrong. Seven Counties certainly functions pursuant to an enabling statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    Any combination of cities or counties\n   </strong>\n   of over fifty thousand (50,000) population,\n   and upon the consent of the secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, any combination of cities or counties with less than fifty thousand (50,000) population,\n   <strong>\n    may establish a regional community services program for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability\n   </strong>\n   and staff same with persons specially trained in psychiatry and related fields.\n   <strong>\n    Such programs and clinics may be administered by a community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability established pursuant to KRS 210.370 to 210.460, or by a nonprofit corporation.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.370 (emphasis added). While the disjunctive \"or\" suggests that a \"nonprofit corporation\" is itself distinct from a \"community board,\" the very next section clarifies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Every combination of cities and counties establishing a regional community services program for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability shall, before it comes within the provisions of KRS 210.370 to 210.460, establish a community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability consisting of at least nine (9) members.\n   <strong>\n    When a nonprofit corporation is the administrator of such a program not established by a combination of either cities or counties, such corporation shall select a community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability which shall be representative of the groups herein enumerated, but the number of members need not be nine (9).\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.380 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In other words, a nonprofit corporation also must \"select a community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202905796\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the nonprofit corporation's \"community board\" must \"be representative\" of the same \"groups\" of community stakeholders, including \"elected chief executives of county governments,\" \"county welfare boards,\" and so on, as a county-run program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.380. Hence, Seven Counties derives its authority to \"administer\" the government program within its designated area from-and remains politically accountable to-its seven counties under Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.380.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202905796\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the face of these statutory provisions, the majority's finding that Seven Counties, through its board, \"does not function pursuant to an enabling statute\" is baffling. Op. at 728. No one disputes that \"being subject to regulation is not synonymous with functioning pursuant to an enabling statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 728. But the statutory scheme in this case demonstrates that Kentucky treats CMHCs as far more than mere \"subject[s] to regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the statutory text quite literally enables them to \"to\n   <em>\n    carry out\n   </em>\n   various delegated tasks,\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.380 (authorizing local government units to \"establish a regional community services program for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability and staff same with persons specially trained in psychiatry and related fields\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Ad Valorem Tax Power.\n   </em>\n   Second, the majority attempts to excuse the bankruptcy court's conclusion that Seven Counties \"does not have a statutory right to request a special ad valorem tax to fund [its] programs.\" Op. at 729. But this is just not so. Crucially, the statutory section that creates taxing districts gives no indication that it excludes areas where programs are administered by nonprofit corporations. Rather, the text expressly states that \"[t]he members of the community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability recognized by the secretary for health and family services pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.380 shall, by virtue of their office, constitute and be the governing board of the taxing district.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 210.470(3). This section cites \u00a7 210.380, which brings us full circle back to the very section that establishes that even programs administered by\n   <em>\n    nonprofit corporations\n   </em>\n   must have \"a community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 210.380.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   It's not just that the plain statutory text clearly refutes the bankruptcy court's position. History teaches and the record below demonstrates that these nonprofit corporations can request and\n   <em>\n    have requested\n   </em>\n   imposition of an ad valorem tax. Actually, the statute places a\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   on each board-overseeing a nonprofit corporation or not-to request imposition of such a tax if funding so requires.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    If\n   </strong>\n   , after the establishment of the taxing district for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability as provided for in this section, KRS 210.460, and KRS 210.470,\n   <strong>\n    the tax levying authorities in member areas of the district, in the opinion of the community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability, do not appropriate an amount sufficient to meet the needs of the services program for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability and clinic\n   </strong>\n   , as established pursuant to KRS 210.370,\n   <strong>\n    the community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability, acting as the governing body of the taxing district shall, with the approval of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, request the fiscal courts in each of the member areas which have not contributed a sufficient proportionate share of the cost of the program, to impose a special ad valorem tax\n   </strong>\n   for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability in such amount that it deems sufficient, but not in excess of four cents ($0.04) per one hundred dollars ($100) of full assessed valuation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.480(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Kentucky's statutory scheme does not say it requires only \"community boards\" established by cities or counties (none of which even exist) to perform the duties listed therein-and how could it? \"[E]ach community board for mental health or individuals with an intellectual disability\"-whether it governs a nonprofit corporation or county-run system-is subject to the same duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 210.400. The statute requires all boards to perform those duties, for \"ad valorem tax\" purposes and otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 210.480.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The majority protests that \"requesting a tax is a far cry from assessing one, and Seven Counties has never taken even the limited step of making such a request.\" Op. at 729. But this observation tells us nothing about Kentucky's treatment of its own CMHCs as instrumentalities, as evidenced by these types of special statutory powers and duties. If a city eliminated taxes and operated on grants instead, it would neither shed its instrumental status nor its ability to request higher taxes again from its constituents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Statutory Classification.\n   </em>\n   In addition to its muddled attempt to strip Seven Counties of its statutory powers and duties, the majority casually disregards Seven Counties' statutory classification. In the process, it enables a federal bankruptcy judge to disregard Kentucky's own determination that entities like Seven Counties are \"deemed to be a department, notwithstanding whether said body, entity, or instrumentality is an integral part of state government.\" Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 61.510(3). The majority is right to note that this statutory amendment was passed in response to a Kentucky Supreme Court decision and to ensure these entities were eligible to participate in KERS. But the majority draws a completely illogical conclusion from the statutory language: \"[Seven Counties] shall be deemed to be a department, notwithstanding whether [it] is an integral part of state government\" somehow equals an \"implicit[ ] acknowledge[ment] ... that Seven Counties [is] not 'an integral part of state government.' \" The majority then compounds its error by failing to explain why Kentucky's own statutory classification deserves no weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. at 731-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The majority also discredits another, more recent statutory amendment that provides that entities like Seven Counties, through their community boards, must \"comply with provisions\" governing \"special purpose governmental entities,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 210.400(8), 65A.010 -.090. Op. at 731-32. The majority announces that \"complying\" with the same regulations is not the same as \"being\" a special purpose entity.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . As evidence for this proposition, the majority declares-without any analysis-that Seven Counties \"does not meet the statutory criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In fact, the opposite is true. Seven Counties is a \"special purpose governmental entity\" because it: (1) \"[e]xercises less than statewide jurisdiction\"; (2) \"exists for the purpose of providing one ... or a limited number of services or functions\" (namely, \"public mental health,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 65A.010(c)(5) ); (3) \"[i]s governed by a board ... with policy-making authority that is separate from the state and the governing body of the ... cities and counties ... in which it operates\"; and (4) \"[m]ay receive and expend public funds ... from the state, from any agency, or authority of the state, from a city or county, or from any other special purpose governmental entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 65A.010(9)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Yet the majority asserts that Seven Counties' governing board does not have \"policy-making authority.\" This flatly contradicts statutory sections that command Seven Counties to, among other things: \"[a]ct as the administrative authority\" for and \"oversee and be responsible for [its] management\"; \"[a]dopt and implement policies to stimulate effective community relations\"; \"[p]romote, arrange, and implement working agreements with other social service agencies\"; and \"[c]omply with [all] provisions\" that govern \"boards with policy-making authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 210.400(3), (4), (7), (8). Considering this mountain of evidence, it defies logic to say that we cannot even \"infer\" that Seven Counties is a \"special purpose governmental entit[y].\" Op. at 732. If anything, we can infer just that-that Kentucky\n   <em>\n    clarified\n   </em>\n   through statutory amendment that entities like Seven Counties and its board must indeed operate as a \"special purpose governmental entity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 210.400(8), 65A.010 -.090.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   While I cannot say for certain that the majority would have changed its position if it had interpreted these relevant provisions correctly, I suspect that Seven Counties is an instrumentality even under the majority's approach. Unfortunately, the majority's interpretive gymnastics come with a heavy price-a severe intrusion into Kentucky's sovereignty.
