He filed this action against Missouri officials in October 2015, approximately two weeks before a scheduled execution on November 3, 2015. Johnson alleged that the State's method of execution-lethal injection with pentobarbital-violates the Eighth Amendment's proscription on cruel and unusual punishment, because there is \"a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that a pentobarbital injection will \"trigger severe and uncontrollable seizures and convulsions due to his brain defect and unique medical condition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court granted the State's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, stating that Johnson was free to amend his complaint to remedy its deficiencies.

The court allowed that it would give Johnson one more opportunity to file an adequately pleaded complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Johnson then filed a second amended complaint. As an exhibit, Johnson attached an affidavit from anesthesiologist Dr. Joel Zivot, who opined about the likelihood that Johnson would suffer a painful seizure if executed by means of pentobarbital. Johnson also attached an Oklahoma study concluding that nitrogen-induced hypoxia, an alternative to lethal injection, would be a humane method of execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court granted the State's motion to dismiss the latest complaint. The court reasoned that Johnson failed to plead adequately two elements of an Eighth Amendment claim-namely, that pentobarbital was sure or very likely to cause him to suffer severe pain, and that nitrogen-induced hypoxia was a feasible and readily implemented alternative method of execution that would significantly reduce that risk.

Insofar as Zivot reasoned by analogy from the effects of a \"close cousin\" in the barbiturate family, the reliability of his conclusion is a matter to be resolved after the presentation of evidence.

But in this case, the State does contend that Johnson failed to plead that nitrogen-induced hypoxia is a readily implemented method of execution. According to the State, Johnson's complaint does not include required factual information \"that explains how Missouri could take nitrogen gas from a tank and administer it to an inmate in a way that produces a rapid and painless death.\" As summarized above, however, Johnson alleged that nitrogen gas is readily available on the open market, could be introduced through a \"medically enclosed device to be placed over the mouth or head of the inmate,\" and would not require construction of a new facility. Under the notice pleading regime of the federal rules, this is sufficient. Johnson need not set forth a detailed technical protocol for the administration of nitrogen gas to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court concluded that the Oklahoma report attached to Johnson's complaint \"actually indicates nitrogen induced hypoxia is not feasible or capable of being readily implemented for use in state executions,\" but we respectfully disagree. The report does state that \"[f]urther study will be necessary to determine the best delivery system\" for nitrogen gas. The report also raises the possibility that a gas mask delivery system could be less efficient than a gas bag delivery system. But the report's ultimate conclusion is that execution by nitrogen-induced hypoxia would be \"simple to administer.\" That researchers have yet to decide which is the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   among several feasible methods of implementation does not definitively refute Johnson's allegation that Missouri could feasibly implement this alternative without undue delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court also thought it fatal to Johnson's claim that he did not plead facts \"indicating Missouri is willing to perform this type of execution, which suggests it may not be feasible.\" We cannot accept, however, that a State's unwillingness to employ a method that would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain makes the method infeasible. Under the\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baze\n   </em>\n   standard, a State\n   may be obliged under the Constitution to implement an alternative method of execution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baze\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673813\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/35/#p50\">\n    553 U.S. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673813\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/35/#p50\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether Missouri is \"willing\" to implement an alternative method voluntarily does not determine whether the alternative is feasible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State also contends that Johnson did not adequately allege that nitrogen gas would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain. The State suggests that\n   <em>\n    McGehee v.

Several Arkansas prisoners sought a stay of execution after an evidentiary proceeding on the ground that Arkansas's method of execution on its face violated the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276977\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/488/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276977\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/488/\">\n    at 490-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that the evidence was insufficient to justify a stay, because nitrogen hypoxia had \"never been used to carry out an execution\" and \"[w]ith no track record of successful use,\" it was \"not likely to emerge as more than a 'slightly or marginally safer alternative' \" to the State's current method in the ordinary case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276977\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/488/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276977\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/488/\">\n    at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/#p2737\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2737 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Johnson is not bound by the pleadings or the evidentiary record in\n   <em>\n    McGehee.\n   </em>\n   He has pleaded an as-applied claim based on his medical condition, not a facial challenge to Missouri's ordinary method. He claims that nitrogen hypoxia would ameliorate the risk of severe pain allegedly caused by pentobarbital, because \"the use of lethal gas would not trigger the uncontrollable seizures and convulsions.\" The pleading is sufficient to state a claim that the alternative method would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain for Johnson in his particular circumstances. Again, whether Johnson can\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   that claim is a different matter that will arise at a later stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The State's last argument for affirmance is that Johnson's complaint is barred by the statute of limitations. A statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that the defendant must plead and prove. But \"[a] defendant does not render a complaint defective by pleading an affirmative defense,\" so the defense ordinarily must be apparent on the face of the complaint to justify dismissal for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Jessie v.

His second amended complaint alleges that \"the brain defect and the scarring tissue that resulted from the craniotomy procedure were not known until an MRI procedure was conducted in April 2011.\" The complaint was filed within five years of April 2011, so it would be timely if that is the accrual date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The State argues that Johnson could have discovered his condition in 2008 after he underwent brain surgery.

He alleges a seizure disorder that is caused by a confluence of factors in his brain. Giving Johnson all reasonable inferences at this stage in the litigation, it is not clear from Johnson's pleadings that he could have discovered this condition through the exercise of reasonable diligence before his MRI procedure in April 2011.
