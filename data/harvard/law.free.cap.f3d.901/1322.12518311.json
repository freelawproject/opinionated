Maurin Chacon, Christopher Altamirano, Rodolfo Portela, and James Dixon were members of the self-described \"Big Money Team,\" a gang of drug dealers who also committed robberies and illegally possessed guns as part of their conspiracy. A jury convicted the defendants of conspiracy to distribute 280 grams of cocaine base and several other charges of drug trafficking, firearm possession, armed robbery, and assault. All four defendants argue that the government presented insufficient evidence of a conspiracy. And they raise individual challenges about the sufficiency of the evidence for separate charges, the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, the refusal to give a jury instruction on entrapment, the admission of evidence of uncharged conduct, the prosecutor's closing argument, the failure to conduct a competency hearing, and the reasonableness of their sentences. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For several years, the \"Big Money Team,\" a gang of drug dealers in Little Havana, Miami, maintained a set of \"traps,\" locations where members of the Team-and only members of the Team or their associates-sold drugs. Individual dealers cooperated to establish a marketplace with a reliable supply of drugs to attract customers to the exclusive territory of the Team. They manned a cluster of locations in close proximity. Some members of the Team also committed robberies to sustain supplies. And some carried guns, especially when they were at the traps at night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two cooperating witnesses, Nadim Guzman and Dayaan Zerquera, provided key testimony about the Team. Guzman explained that being a member of the Team meant \"[t]hat you [could] sell drugs and make money with them.\" He testified that members of the Team coordinated to supply drugs to the customers who visited the traps to buy drugs. Guzman explained that \"if you had [what a customer wanted] on you, you could sell it.\" Otherwise, members would \"bring[ ] customers to one another\" to satisfy customers' demands and facilitate each other's sales. Some members also pooled their money to buy larger supplies of drugs. And they guarded against competition and disruption by warning nonmembers not to sell drugs near the traps, and by serving as lookouts for each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Guzman explained that he sold one to two grams a day of cocaine base, also known as crack cocaine, for 11 months in 2013. He also estimated that three to six members sold drugs at the traps at a time and that each sold about one gram a day. Zerquera testified that he sold two to three grams a day and estimated that the Team as a whole sold three to 18 grams a day, with average sales falling between 16 and 18 grams a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Chacon, Altamirano, Portela, and Dixon were all members of the Team. Although the Team had no official \"boss\" who gave members orders, the Team had an internal hierarchy. Members would \"gain respect\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   or \"lose respect\" based on perceived contributions, including a reputation for violence and participation in robberies. Chacon and Altamirano were \"top guys\" who \"call[ed] shots.\" They also participated in robberies and carried guns. Portela also carried guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City of Miami Police Department started to investigate the Team in the summer of 2013. Detective David Bernat of the Gang Intelligence Unit coordinated surveillance of the traps and arranged for purchases of narcotics by a confidential informant. An undercover detective, Kenneth Veloz, also conducted controlled purchases from members of the Team and made video and audio recordings of their interactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 18, 2013, Officer David Segovia of the Miami-Dade Police Department stopped a car driving on the wrong side of the road. The driver was Portela's girlfriend, and Portela was in the front passenger seat. During the stop, Segovia \"smell[ed] ... marijuana\" wafting from the vehicle, and Portela admitted to Segovia that he had a bag of marijuana on his person. Segovia looked inside the car and saw \"loose particles\" of marijuana on the floorboard. He also observed a gun under the front passenger seat. Another officer then informed him that there was an outstanding warrant for Portela's arrest. Segovia arrested Portela and put him in the police car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Detective Thomas Wever arrived on the scene approximately two hours later and interviewed Portela. After Wever warned Portela of his rights to remain silent and to counsel, Portela signed a waiver of rights form. He explained that he bought the gun for protection, that it was loaded, and that he had been carrying the gun on his person before the stop, at which point he placed it under the seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Meanwhile, Agent Rosniel Perez of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives was investigating a separate incident involving Portela's illegal possession of a gun. Although Perez was still \"considering whether to open a formal federal investigation,\" he obtained a search warrant for Portela's DNA shortly after Portela's arrest at the traffic stop. Perez then executed the warrant at the jail where Portela was being held on state charges after having been appointed counsel. When Perez presented the warrant, Portela initiated a conversation and stated that he \"wanted to cooperate and make a deal.\" After Perez warned Portela of his rights and that Perez could not make any deals with him at that time, Portela waived his rights and made incriminating statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 20, 2013, Altamirano left a trap to go on a \"mission\" with another member. The duo robbed five people at gunpoint, taking cash and cell phones. As they fled the scene, Altamirano fired a shot from his gun. Altamirano and the other member then returned to the trap, where the robbers \"talk[ed] about [the] robbery ... and show[ed] [other Team members] ... a phone and a wallet they took.\" Police officers traced one of the stolen phones to the trap, where they found Chacon, Guzman, other members of the Team, cocaine base, other drugs, and a gun. The officers found Altamirano one block away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 25, 2014, Veloz, the undercover detective, asked Chacon if he had guns for sale during a recorded conversation. Chacon said that he had a \"couple\" but \"need[ed] some more\" and mentioned that guns were \"expensive right [then].\" At a later meeting in Veloz's car, Chacon sold Veloz a revolver that he referred to as \"[his] baby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Also in 2014, Perez obtained search warrants for Team members' social media accounts. He collected posts in which members\n   of the Team identified themselves, boasted about drug sales and violence, brandished weapons, and displayed the Team hand sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A federal grand jury indicted Chacon, Altamirano, Portela, Dixon, and several codefendants on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 280 grams or more of cocaine base,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(1)(A)(iii), 846, between 2011 and October 2014.

The grand jury also indicted Chacon for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), on the basis of the drugs and the gun that police found when they searched the trap after the November 20 armed robbery. And the grand jury indicted Chacon for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before trial, Portela filed a motion to suppress the gun that police found in his girlfriend's car, his statements to Wever after he was arrested, and the statements he later made at the jail. After an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge recommended denying the motion. The district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The four defendants, as well as a fifth codefendant, went to trial in February 2015. After the parties rested, the district court granted Chacon's motion for a judgment of acquittal of the two charges against him for the November 20 armed robbery. But the government argued in closing that the jury should convict Chacon of one of those charges. The district court then granted Chacon's motion to strike and instructed the jury to disregard the references to the acquitted counts. Chacon moved for a mistrial, but the district court denied the motion. The district court also refused Chacon's request for a jury instruction on entrapment as a defense to the count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The jury convicted the four defendants on the counts involved in this appeal, but it acquitted the fifth codefendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court sentenced Chacon to 420 months of imprisonment, Altamirano to 235 months of imprisonment, and Dixon to 144 months of imprisonment. It sentenced Portela, who was facing a mandatory life sentence, to a term of 360 months after he negotiated a deal with the government not to appeal his sentence. At the sentencing hearing, Portela introduced some evidence that he had diminished mental capacity, but the district court found that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We divide our discussion in several parts. First, we explain that sufficient evidence supports each defendant's conviction for the drug conspiracy. Next, we explain that the district court correctly denied Portela's motion to suppress evidence, that\n   sufficient evidence supports his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, that he was not entitled to a competency hearing, and that he waived his right to appeal his sentence. We then explain that sufficient evidence supports Altamirano's conviction for a violent crime in aid of racketeering. We next explain that sufficient evidence supports Chacon's convictions for possession of a firearm and for possession of narcotics and that the district court did not err when it admitted evidence of his uncharged conduct, when it refused to instruct the jury on entrapment, or when it denied his motion for a mistrial. We also explain that Chacon's sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. Finally, we explain that the remaining issues raised by the defendants are meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    A. Sufficient Evidence Supports Each Conviction for Conspiracy to Distribute 280 Grams of Cocaine Base\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Chacon, Altamirano, Portela, and Dixon challenge the sufficiency of the evidence for their convictions for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 280 grams or more of cocaine base,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(1)(A)(iii), 846, on several grounds. They argue that the government failed to prove the existence of a single conspiracy to sell drugs. And each defendant contends that insufficient evidence establishes that he joined that conspiracy. They also attack the sufficiency of the evidence about the quantity of drugs they conspired to distribute. \"We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the sufficiency of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Duperval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984533\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1324/#p1331\">\n    777 F.3d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1331 (11th Cir. 2015). But we must \"view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984533\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1324/#p1331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations adopted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251693\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/1258/#p1274\">\n    818 F.3d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1274 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Westry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823600\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/1198/#p1212\">\n    524 F.3d 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1212 (11th Cir. 2008) ). And when the government attempts to prove that defendants were part of a single overarching conspiracy and not multiple smaller conspiracies, it may rely on evidence such as \"whether a common goal existed [among the conspirators],\" \"the nature of the underlying scheme,\" and \"the overlap of participants.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031347\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/1279/#p1284\">\n    532 F.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1284 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If a defendant's actions facilitated the endeavors of other co-conspirators, or facilitated the venture as a whole, a single conspiracy is established.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583572\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/1033/#p1042\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration adopted) (emphases omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583572\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/1033/#p1042\">\n    525 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1042 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The government presented ample evidence of a single conspiracy to sell drugs by members of the self-described \"Big Money Team.\" It offered evidence of a common goal when Guzman testified that membership in the Team meant \"[t]hat you [could] sell drugs and make money with them.\" It also introduced evidence that the Team maintained a set of \"traps\" where members of the Team-and only members or associates of the Team-sold drugs, shared customers, kept lookout for one another, and cooperated to supply the drugs that consumers demanded. For example, Guzman explained that \"customer[s\n   ] would come\" to the traps to buy narcotics, \"and if you had [the drugs] on you, you could sell [them].\" Otherwise, Team members would \"bring[ ] customers to one another.\" He also testified that Team members would \"split money\" from certain drug sales. And Veloz testified about \"an undercover drug [deal]\" with Dixon and another member of the Team, whom Dixon asked to sell Veloz the \"additional crack rock\" needed to complete the deal. As we concluded in a similar case that also involved a common sales area and the sharing of customers and money, \"[f]rom this evidence the jury was free to infer that [members of the Team] had a common goal: to deal in cocaine [base] and to provide a marketplace for cocaine [base], and an overlap of participants.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, we have explained that such a \" 'marketplace' is at the heart of [a] conspiracy because those seeking cocaine [will] be drawn to a location and not to a particular dealer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5681170\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/1082/#p1090\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The evidence established that members of the Team \"facilitated the endeavors of other co-conspirators\" and \"the venture as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031347\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/1279/#p1284\">\n    532 F.3d at 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3583572\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/525/1033/#p1042\">\n    525 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1042 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendants respond that the evidence instead establishes \"several different conspiracies to buy and sell illegal drugs and to commit robberies\" that involved only some of the defendants. They assert that individual dealers operated independent drug businesses at the traps. They stress that \"[e]veryone bought for themselves and sold for themselves\" and that \"[t]here was no boss\" who gave them \"orders\" about their drug sales. And they cite Zerquera's testimony that no one assigned Team members specific shifts at the traps and that \"everybody would be selling at their own risk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   These arguments assume that a unified conspiracy requires a command-and-control structure, with one or more \"boss\" conspirators coordinating the actions of each player. But our precedents hold otherwise. We explained in\n   <em>\n    Westry\n   </em>\n   that \"[individual] drug dealers\" who collaborate \"to achieve the overall results of their several efforts\" can be conspirators-even if they \"sometimes, or even always, compete for supplies or customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Westry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823600\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/1198/#p1212\">\n    524 F.3d at 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government did not rely only on evidence that the defendants were discovered at the scene of drug trafficking.

Chacon stresses that Guzman and Zerquera testified that \"Chacon was not [their] boss\" and that he \"did not give [them] orders\" about drug sales. Chacon also cites testimony that someone else recruited Guzman and that the cooperators \"never had to give [Chacon] a cut\" of their profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The district court did not clearly err. It correctly explained that \"being characterized as boss is not controlling\" and instead considered specific facts that established Chacon's role as a leader. For example, it highlighted that although \"[t]here wasn't any strict hierarchy [in the Team],\" \"[e]verybody who testified ... agree[d]\" that Chacon was a \"shot caller[ ]\" who \"inspired or promoted or directed the activities\" of the Team. The district court also heard evidence that Chacon \"le[d]\" the videos that the Team posted on YouTube to boost their \"image,\" that Chacon had declared both that he \"r[a]n th[e] block\" and that other Team members \"[had] to give [him] money,\" and that a Team member stated that he had to \"respect what [Chacon] sa[id].\" And Guzman testified that, after he began cooperating with the police, Chacon called him and accused him of \"snitching\" and then later came to his house and physically attacked him. The district court was entitled to find that Chacon was a leader in the criminal activity of the Team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   2. The District Court Did Not Err when It Determined that Chacon Was Responsible for the Sale of at Least 2.8 Kilograms of Cocaine Base\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Guidelines establish a base offense level of 34 for an offense\n   involving between 2.8 and 8.4 kilograms of cocaine base. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3). \"When the amount of the drugs [actually] seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the district court [instead] must approximate the drug quantity attributable to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   , 742 F.3d at 506.

As explained above, the evidence established that Chacon was a leader in a broad drug-trafficking conspiracy. And the district court was entitled to rely on the cooperators' testimony about Team activities to \"approximate the drug quantity attributable to [Chacon].\"\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   , 742 F.3d at 506. Guzman testified that he sold one to two grams of cocaine base a day for 11 months in 2013. He also estimated that three to six other Team members sold one gram a day during his tenure with the Team. Zerquera testified that he sold two to three grams a day and estimated that the Team members he worked with sold three to 18 grams a day, with average daily sales between 16 and 18 grams. If the Team sold only 10 grams a day for 11 months-about 330 days-that would be 3.3 kilograms. So even a \"conservative estimate[ ]\" based on Guzman's numbers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , establishes that Chacon was responsible for more than 2.8 kilograms in the light of his substantial role in the conspiracy and the \"jointly undertaken criminal activity,\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   3. The District Court Did Not Commit Reversible Error when It Calculated Chacon's Criminal History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Chacon argues that the district court erred when it calculated his criminal-history score under section 4A1.1 of the Guidelines. He asserts that the district court erred when it counted a juvenile offense over his objection. And on appeal he argues for the first time that the district court erred when it counted five offenses for which the court withheld adjudication of guilt. He contends that these supposed errors require remand for resentencing. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    The Juvenile Offense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The district court did not err when it counted Chacon's 2005 juvenile conviction for robbery. The Guidelines direct a district court to add one point for a \"juvenile sentence imposed\n   <em>\n    within five years\n   </em>\n   of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Chacon contends that his juvenile sentence fell outside the five-year window, but the district court was entitled to find otherwise, because Zerquera testified that Chacon was involved with the Team in 2008, fewer than five years after the 2005 sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The Five Offenses for Which Adjudication Was Withheld\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Under section 4A1.1(c), a district court must assign one criminal-history point, up\n   to a total of four points, for each \"prior sentence\" of less than a term of imprisonment of 60 days. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(c).

Chacon's Sentence Is Substantively Reasonable\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   A district court must consider several factors before it imposes a sentence, including \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). A sentence is substantively unreasonable if the district court \"fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight,\" \"gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor,\" or \"commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The members who received the shortest sentences cooperated with the government, and \"[w]e have held that defendants who cooperate with the government and enter a written plea agreement are not similarly situated to a defendant who provides no assistance to the government and proceeds to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And two other Team members who went to trial received lengthy sentences of 360 and 235 months. As explained above, Chacon's leadership role also supports a longer sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 420-month sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    K. The Defendants' Other Arguments Are Meritless\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The defendants raise a number of other arguments about the sufficiency of the evidence, interpretation of the statutes of conviction, and alleged errors by counsel and the district court, but we have reviewed the record and determined that these contentions are meritless. These arguments contradict the record, are insufficiently developed, misunderstand the relevant statutes, or are not ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
