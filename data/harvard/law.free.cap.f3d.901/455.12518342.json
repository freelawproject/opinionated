Based on Bell's prior convictions, the district court sentenced Bell to a mandatory minimum sentence of 480 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Bell contends that the district court erred (1) in denying his motion to suppress statements he made to officers executing a search warrant for his residence; (2) in admitting \"other acts\" evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) ; (3) in denying his motion to disclose the identity of a confidential informant who provided information used to obtain the search warrant; and (4) in enhancing his sentence on the basis of his prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 9, 2014, an ATF task force consisting of federal and state law enforcement officers obtained a \"no-knock\" warrant from the Circuit Court of Prince George's County, Maryland, to search 5404 Morton Place in Riverdale, Maryland, and to seize from the house any narcotics, firearms, and related items found. The probable cause for the warrant was based on the affidavit of ATF Special Agent Frank Oliver, who had learned from a confidential informant (\"CI-1\") that Bell was \"utilizing the residence to sell and store large quantities of Heroin while armed with a firearm.\" The warrant application recounted that CI-1 had recently visited Bell's residence and \"observed, inside a room of the residence, a firearm and a quantity of heroin, consistent with distribution amounts.\" It further stated that the informant had been shown a police photograph of Bell and had \"positively identified\" him as \"the individual utilizing [the residence] to sell ... Heroin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next morning, April 10, 2014, officers of the Prince George's Police Department made a forced entry into 5404 Morton Place to execute the warrant and, while performing a security sweep, found Bell in the basement and placed him in handcuffs. They led him upstairs to the living room and seated him in a chair near his wife, Stacy Bell (\"Stacy\"), who had also been handcuffed and seated in a chair. After the house was secured, Agent Oliver\n   entered the living room and, knowing that Stacy was the owner of the house, informed her \"that [he] had a narcotics search warrant for the home\" and then asked her, in the interest of officer safety, \"if there [were] any weapons in the house that would hurt an officer.\" Before Stacy could respond, however, Bell interjected, stating that \"there was a gun under the couch\" next to them and that \"a friend had given him the gun [after] somebody had tried to break into the house and rob him.\" Officers then searched under the living-room couch and recovered a Mini-14 Ruger semi-automatic rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The ATF task force proceeded to search the house, recovering extensive evidence of drug trafficking. In the basement, where Bell was found, officers found approximately 112 grams of heroin and various drug-trafficking paraphernalia, including a digital scale, empty pill capsules, a capsule-filling device, and bottles of cutting agents. They also found a loaded rifle magazine that was compatible with the Mini-14 Ruger rifle. In the master bedroom upstairs, the officers found in a nightstand several more grams of heroin, another scale, approximately $2,000 in cash, a letter addressed to Bell, and Bell's driver's license. And in a separate bedroom, they found in a filing cabinet approximately $10,000 in cash and a collection of jewelry. Upon completion of the search, the task force released Bell from custody, pursuant to the \"request of another [law enforcement] agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Some four months later, on August 24, 2014, officers of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (\"MPD\") received a tip leading them to investigate a parked car in Southeast Washington, D.C. Bell was in the car, accompanied by two others. As the officers approached, Bell opened his door and attempted to exit but was apprehended. The officers found a loaded Glock pistol next to the driver's seat, where Bell had been sitting, as well as approximately $1,000 in cash on Bell's person. They also found several small baggies of marijuana, heroin, and crack cocaine in the car's center console. One baggie containing marijuana was imprinted with green dollar signs, and another baggie containing heroin was imprinted with blue caricatures of a devil's face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the MPD officers brought Bell back to the station, a detective advised him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and then interviewed him. During the interview, which was recorded by video, Bell stated that he had been \"sharing\" the Glock pistol with another man in the car; that the two of them had been \"hustlin[g] together\" when they were arrested; that he had come to Washington, D.C., that evening to buy \"two guns and some coke\"; and that, in particular, he was expecting to buy \"two Rugers.\" Bell was charged in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia with several offenses relating to this incident, but the government subsequently decided not to prosecute him in the District of Columbia and dismissed the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Five days later, on August 29, 2014, while Bell was still in custody in Washington, D.C., the ATF task force executed a second search warrant at 5404 Morton Place. Probable cause for this warrant was based on Bell's Washington, D.C. arrest, the evidence from the initial search in April 2014, and CI-1's assertion that Bell was \"storing quantities of heroin within [the] residence ... consistent with distribution amounts.\" During this search, officers found 14 grams of heroin and 3 grams of crack cocaine in the basement, as well as baggies marked with green dollar signs and blue devil faces. Elsewhere in Bell's residence, they again recovered other evidence of drug trafficking, including digital\n   scales, bottles of cutting agent, and handgun ammunition hidden inside a crockpot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 2014, a grand jury indicted Bell on four counts for drug trafficking and the illegal possession of a firearm. Bell filed a pretrial motion to suppress the statements he made to Agent Oliver during the April 2014 search of his residence, when he admitted to possession of the Ruger rifle, contending that the statements were obtained in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . He also filed a motion to compel disclosure of the identity of CI-1 or, in the alternative, for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination of the informant to determine whether disclosure was warranted. Also prior to trial, the government filed a motion to admit evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) of Bell's arrest in Washington, D.C., including the video of his interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a two-day hearing on these pretrial motions, the district court denied Bell's motion to suppress, stating that Agent Oliver had testified credibly about the April 2014 search; that Oliver had directed his question about weapons in the house to Stacy; and that Bell had then volunteered the answer. The court thus concluded that Bell was not interrogated in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . The court also denied Bell's motion to disclose the identity of CI-1, explaining that Bell had failed to meet his burden to pierce the informer's privilege or to obtain an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination of the informant that would risk disclosure of his or her identity. Finally, the court granted the government's motion to admit evidence of Bell's arrest in Washington, D.C., concluding that the evidence was reliable and relevant to showing Bell's knowing possession of the rifle and drugs found in his residence and that any prejudice to Bell would be outweighed by the evidence's probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following trial, the jury convicted Bell on all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The probation officer prepared a presentence report noting Bell's several prior convictions, on which the government relied to argue that he was an \"armed career criminal\" subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) (firearm possession as a felon).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The report also noted that Bell's conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) for possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking subjected him to a mandatory minimum consecutive sentence of 25 years' imprisonment because he had a prior conviction under \u00a7 924(c). Finally, the report classified Bell, based on his prior convictions, as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Combining an offense level of 34 and a criminal history Category VI with a second \u00a7 924(c) conviction resulted in an advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 562 to 627 months' imprisonment, and Bell's statutory mandatory minimum sentence was 480 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Bell objected to the calculation of his Guidelines sentencing range and to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, arguing that his predicate convictions did not qualify him as either an armed career criminal or a career offender. He argued further that the statutory mandatory minimum sentences could not constitutionally be applied to him because the fact of his prior convictions had neither been charged in the indictment nor found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court rejected Bell's arguments and sentenced him to 480 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bell contends first that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statements he made on April 10, 2014, during the execution of the first search\n   warrant for 5404 Morton Place. During the course of that search and after Agent Oliver asked Bell's wife, Stacy, \"if there [were] any weapons in the house that would hurt an officer,\" Bell interjected that there was a Ruger rifle under the couch. Bell notes that he and Stacy \"were being held together, next to each other\"; that \"it is commonplace for [married] couples to jointly answer questions about matters within their individual knowledge, even when a question is directed only to one of them\"; and that Agent Oliver \"did not specify whether [Bell] or [Stacy] should respond\" to his question. Accordingly, he claims that Agent Oliver's questioning\n   <em>\n    of Stacy\n   </em>\n   constituted interrogation\n   <em>\n    of him\n   </em>\n   , relying on\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island v. Innis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    446 U.S. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    64 L.Ed.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), to argue that, in those circumstances, Oliver \"should have known ... that [the questioning] was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Mr. Bell.\" Thus, Bell maintains, because he responded to interrogation while in custody without having been given the required\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, his motion to suppress should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the pretrial hearing, Agent Oliver described the April 10 encounter in some detail, testifying that after he entered the living room from outside the house, he approached Stacy, because she was the owner of the house, and \"informed [her]\" that the officers had \"a narcotics search warrant for the home.\" He then asked her, out of \"concern[ ] for officer safety,\" \"if there [were] any weapons in the house that would hurt an officer.\" According to Agent Oliver, in posing this question to Stacy, he walked to \"[w]ithin a couple feet\" of her and \"directed [his] question to [her] ... directly,\" \"looking at her in the eye.\" At the time, Stacy was handcuffed and seated in a chair in the living room. Bell, who was also handcuffed, was seated in \"another chair off to the right, behind her chair,\" and the two chairs were \"in close proximity\" to each other. After Agent Oliver directed the question to Stacy, however, and before she could answer, Bell stated that \"there was a gun under the couch.\" When the officers looked under the couch, they found the Mini-14 Ruger semi-automatic rifle that, Bell explained, a friend had given him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court accepted Agent Oliver's testimony about the encounter, stating that he credited, as a factual matter, \"Agent Oliver's testimony that he did direct the question at Ms. Bell and that the defendant then volunteered an answer.\" The court thus concluded that although Bell \"was in custody, he was not being interrogated\" and that his statements were therefore \"admissible even though\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   had not been given.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To safeguard the protection against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   adopted a set of procedural rules that apply when a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation, including the familiar requirements that he be informed of his \"right to remain silent, that any statement he [makes] may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). And the Court has stated, in applying\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   to circumstances similar to those before us, that \"the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its\n   <em>\n    functional equivalent\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    446 U.S. at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"That is to say, the term 'interrogation' under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant\n   to arrest and custody)\n   <em>\n    that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 301 &amp; n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"[t]he latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect,\" but that \"the intent of the police ... may well have a bearing on\" the inquiry).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was arrested for a robbery that had been committed hours before with a shotgun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    446 U.S. at 293-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After Innis received his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and invoked his right to counsel, officers took him to the station in a police car, and on the way, he overheard two officers discussing the need to find the shotgun because there was a school for handicapped children located nearby and one of the children could find the gun and hurt himself. Innis interrupted their conversation, stating that he knew where the gun was located, and then led the officers to it.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 294-95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On those facts, the Supreme Court rejected the Rhode Island Supreme Court's conclusion that Innis's statement was the product of \"subtle coercion\" equivalent to \"interrogation,\" in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 296, 303,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court noted that the officers had not expressly questioned Innis as they had spoken only to each other.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 302,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it further concluded that the officers' conversation did not amount to the \"functional equivalent\" of questioning, as the \"entire conversation ... consisted of no more than a few off hand remarks\"; that the remarks were not \"particularly 'evocative' \"; that Innis was not \"unusually disoriented or upset at the time\"; and that the officers had no reason to believe Innis \"was peculiarly [concerned for] the safety of handicapped children.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    at 302-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while recognizing that the officers' remarks presumably subjected Innis to \"subtle compulsion,\" the Court held nonetheless that their conversation did not amount to prohibited interrogation, as \"it [could not] be said ... that [the officers] should have known that their conversation was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   , it is apparent that Bell was subjected to neither express questioning nor its functional equivalent. Agent Oliver focused directly on Stacy as the owner of the house, looked her in the eye, and asked her a single question relating to officer safety - whether there \"w[ere] any weapons in the house that would hurt an officer.\" The question was not posed to Bell and did not seek a response from him, nor was there any evidence that it was intended to. Moreover, nothing in the formulation of the question would suggest that it invited a response from anyone other than Stacy. In short, the record hardly supports Bell's claim that the question, in the circumstances, was likely to elicit from him a statement implicating himself in the illegal possession of a firearm. To be sure, Bell was within earshot, and thus it was within the realm of possibility that he would interject to answer the question. But a conclusion that Agent Oliver\n   <em>\n    should have known\n   </em>\n   that his question to Stacy was likely to prompt an incriminatory response from Bell cannot be reconciled with the record before us, including the district court's factual findings, which Bell does not challenge. Nor could such a conclusion be reconciled with the holding of\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   's articulation of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rule as applying not only to express questioning but also to its \"functional equivalent\" reflected the Supreme Court's concern that certain conduct by the police could be designed to have the same coercive effect as\n   conventional interrogation. To illustrate, the Court gave as examples several \"techniques of persuasion,\" such as using a \"coached witness\" to pick the suspect out of a police lineup, or accusing him of a \"fictitious crime\" in order to induce his confession to the actual crime under investigation.\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    446 U.S. at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It can hardly be said that overhearing a single question posed to one's spouse creates the necessary level of compulsion without more. To the contrary, the district court found as fact that Bell had \"volunteered\" his answer to the question directed to Stacy. At bottom, we cannot conclude that Agent Oliver's single question to Stacy resulted in the degree of coercion for it to constitute the functional equivalent of express questioning, as would make Bell's self-incrimination likely enough that Oliver should have foreseen it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    446 U.S. at 301-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182222\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/291/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because Bell was not charged for this conduct, the district court admitted the evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) as proof that Bell knowingly possessed the drugs and Ruger rifle recovered from the April and August 2014 searches of his Maryland residence. Bell argues that, \"as compared to the charged conduct [in Maryland], the [Washington, D.C.] incident involved a different gun and categorically different quantities of drugs found in ... a different context,\" and thus the evidence could only be relevant to establish his criminal propensity, a prohibited ground for the admission of such evidence under Rule 404(b). He argues further that, even if the evidence had some marginal relevance, it should have been excluded under Rule 403 because \"that relevance was vastly overshadowed by the danger of unfair prejudice [to him].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rule 404(b) provides that \"[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's\n   <em>\n    character\n   </em>\n   in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character\" (emphasis added), but that such evidence may nonetheless be admissible for other purposes, \"such as proving motive,\n   opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\" It is thus a rule of inclusion because it \"recognizes the admissibility of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts, with only the one stated exception.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The video of Bell's police interview - in which he stated that he had been \"sharing\" the handgun with a companion as they \"hustl[ed] together,\" and that he was expecting to buy \"some coke\" and \"two Rugers\" - was plainly necessary and relevant to showing that Bell had, as charged, possessed the Ruger rifle in furtherance of drug trafficking four months earlier. And the MPD officers' testimony, recounting how Bell was arrested with heroin, marijuana, and crack cocaine, packaged in distinctively marked baggies, was similarly probative. Indeed, those same narcotics, and the same baggies, were discovered in Bell's basement the very next week. Rather than merely establishing a propensity to commit crimes, the Washington, D.C. evidence was persuasive proof that Bell had, as alleged in the indictment, knowingly possessed the illegal drugs in his residence with the intent to distribute them and that he had knowingly possessed the Ruger rifle in furtherance of his drug-trafficking activity. Bell's character was not at issue and the evidence was not admitted to prove his character. But intent and motive were at issue, and evidence of both were admissible under Rule 404(b). Finally, Bell makes no claim that the Washington, D.C. evidence was unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As to Bell's claimed unfair prejudice under Rule 403, nothing in the record suggests that admitting the Washington, D.C. evidence created confusion or tended to subordinate reason to emotion in the jury's factfinding process. Moreover, Bell was notified before trial of the government's intent to use the Washington, D.C. evidence, and the district court gave appropriate limiting instructions to the jury, explaining that the evidence could only be considered to infer his intent to commit the crimes alleged in his indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Queen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889571\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/991/#p994\">\n    132 F.3d at 997-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nonetheless, Bell argues that our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276331\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/254/\">\n    858 F.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2017), compels us to reach a contrary conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and related firearm offenses after the district court admitted, as evidence of knowledge and intent under\n   Rule 404(b), his several prior marijuana convictions. The prior convictions, however, all predated the offenses in Hall's indictment by at least five years, and the government provided\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the date and statutory citation of each conviction without offering \"any [other] information regarding the circumstances giving rise to the convictions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276331\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/254/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276331\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/254/\">\n    at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the district court had abused its discretion because the defendant's criminal history was either irrelevant to the purpose for which it had been admitted or, for certain purposes, so marginally relevant and unduly prejudicial as to violate Rule 403.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276331\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/254/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276331\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/254/\">\n    at 268-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our holding in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , however, is far afield, as the evidence admitted there was the bare fact of the defendant's convictions from more than a half-decade before. In this case, by contrast, the evidence at issue is the defendant's own conduct and statements, which had a close factual and temporal nexus to the crimes charged in the indictment. Bell's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   is thus unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of Bell's arrest in Washington, D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For his final challenge to his conviction, Bell contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to compel disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant who supplied law enforcement with information used to obtain the search warrants for his residence or, in the alternative, to have the district court conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   examination of the informant to determine whether disclosure was warranted. He argues that the crux of his defense was that the contraband at his residence actually belonged to Steven Wise, a heroin addict who assertedly had been living in Bell's basement prior to his death in August 2014. In light of Wise's unavailability as a witness, Bell maintains that he was entitled to pierce the informer's privilege so that he would have an opportunity to examine the informant at trial, as this \"could establish that the informant [had] mistakenly identified Mr. Bell [to law enforcement] and that the contraband actually was possessed by Mr. Wise.\" By denying his motion, Bell argues, the district court foreclosed his ability to offer testimony that was \"essential to a fair determination of [his] case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court denied Bell's motion because Bell had failed to meet his \"heavy burden to demonstrate the need for identification,\" as would allow him to pierce the informer's privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The \"informer's privilege,\" which protects a confidential informant's identity, \"is in reality the Government's privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information [about crimes]\" to law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Roviaro v.

In\n   <em>\n    Roviaro\n   </em>\n   , the Court declined to adopt a bright-line rule for determining when a defendant may pierce the privilege, stating that the issue instead calls for case-by-case \"balancing [of] the public interest in protecting the flow of information [to law enforcement] against the individual's right to prepare his defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/#p59\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/#p59\">\n    at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/#p59\">\n    77 S.Ct. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether disclosure should be ordered therefore depends \"on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer's testimony, and other relevant factors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/#p59\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And in applying\n   <em>\n    Roviaro\n   </em>\n   , we have held more particularly that \"the government is privileged to withhold the identity of [an] informant when [he] was a 'mere tipster,' or was used only for obtaining a search warrant, but that failing to\n   disclose the informant's identity more likely amounts to error when the informant was\n   <em>\n    an active participant\n   </em>\n   in the events leading to the arrest of the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Other than providing information for the search warrants - namely, that the informant had recently observed Bell \"inside a room of the residence, [with] a firearm and a quantity of heroin ... consistent with distribution amounts\" - the informant apparently had no role in Bell's crimes or his prosecution. The informant did not participate in the offenses charged in Bell's indictment, which arose from Bell's possession of narcotics and a firearm at times when the informant was not present, nor was the informant even mentioned to the jury at trial. Moreover, the assertion that the informant might have testified that it was Wise, not Bell, who had stockpiled illegal drugs at Bell's residence - in flat contradiction to the representations in the warrant affidavits - appears dubious, if not entirely speculative. In short, Bell has identified nothing in this case to exempt it from the \"well settled principle that the government is permitted to withhold the identity of a confidential informant when 'the informant was used only for the limited purpose of obtaining a search warrant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413842\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/1359/#p1365\">\n    47 F.3d at 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the time of Bell's convictions, the offense of common law robbery was incorporated into two provisions of the Maryland Code. The first, Maryland Code, Article 27 \u00a7 486 (now repealed), provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Every person convicted of the crime of robbery, or as accessory thereto before the fact, shall ... be sentenced to the penitentiary for not less than three nor more than ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   And the second, Maryland Code, Article 27 \u00a7 488 (now repealed), provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Every person convicted of the crime of robbery or attempt to rob\n   <em>\n    with a dangerous or deadly weapon\n   </em>\n   or accessory thereto, shall ... be sentenced to imprisonment in the Maryland Penitentiary for not more than twenty years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As Bell was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment (with 8 years suspended) for each of his two Maryland robbery convictions, he does not dispute that he was therefore convicted under \u00a7 488.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Bell contends that despite the two distinctly numbered sections for simple and armed robbery, providing for two distinct punishments, Maryland nonetheless recognizes only one crime of robbery that can be committed with\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   force or with force directed solely against property, either of which would disqualify it as a predicate offense under ACCA's force clause. To make his argument, he relies on statements made by the Maryland Court of Appeals that have described the \"dangerous or deadly weapon\" component of \u00a7 488 as a\n   <em>\n    sentence enhancement\n   </em>\n   for the \"single common law offense\" of simple robbery, as opposed to an\n   <em>\n    element\n   </em>\n   of the distinct crime of armed robbery.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Whack v.

I agree with both assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   My good colleagues in the majority conclude that the district court properly rejected Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   argument because Defendant did not make his inculpatory statements in response to \"interrogation\" by a law enforcement officer.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 462-64. In particular, like the district court, my colleagues conclude that because the law enforcement officer testified that he\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to direct the question to which Defendant responded to\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    wife\n   </em>\n   -who was seated \"in close proximity\" to Defendant when the officer asked the question-\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   was not subject to \"express questioning,\" therefore rendering\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   inapplicable. But, under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , our assessment of whether Defendant was subject to \"interrogation\" must be analyzed from the\n   <em>\n    perspective of Defendant\n   </em>\n   , not the officer who questioned Defendant. Therefore, as explained below, the district court erred by treating as dispositive the officer's testimony that he intended to, and did in fact, direct the question to Defendant's wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Additionally, regarding Defendant's sentence, my colleagues in the majority conclude that Defendant's prior Maryland armed robbery convictions had \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\n   <em>\n    against the person of another\n   </em>\n   ,\" as Section 924(e)(1) requires, notwithstanding that Maryland appellate decisions, which remain good law, provide that armed robbery can be committed solely by use or threatened use of force\n   <em>\n    against property\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Giles v.

The majority opinion disregards those state court decisions on grounds that the discussion of threats against property amounted to \"dicta\" and that, under Maryland law, armed robbery typically involves violence against persons.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 471-72. But this Court and other courts routinely rely on dicta from state court opinions in determining whether a state offense constitutes a predicate offense for purposes of the ACCA. And this Court has held that when a state offense allowed for conviction solely based on harm to property, the offense did not constitute a crime of violence, even though state law established that the offense was \"primar[il]y\" intended to protect persons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Special Agent Oliver sought and obtained a \"no knock\" search warrant so as to surprise\n   Defendant and thereby render him in \"a state of confusion that w[ould] eliminate the possible use of a firearm.\" J.A. 61. Special Agent Oliver entered directly into the home's living room, where he found Defendant's wife seated handcuffed in a chair.

According to Special Agent Oliver's testimony, when he asked that question, he \"directed\" the question to Defendant's wife, \"looking at her in the eye.\" J.A. 282. Special Agent Oliver did not preface either the statement or the question by stating Defendant's wife's name or instruct only her to answer. J.A. 282-83.

But nowhere in the district court's oral ruling, or its earlier oral factual findings, did the district court consider the relevant question: whether a reasonable suspect in Defendant's position would have believed that Special Agent Oliver's question was directed at Defendant. Notably, the district court failed to address that dispositive question, even though Defendant's counsel repeatedly argued that the court should do so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 337-38 (arguing that \"[i]t really doesn't even matter as to what Agent Oliver's subjective intent was\" because Defendant \"took the question [as] being addressed to him reasonably and answered in response.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   That legal error is significant because the factual record includes evidence that could allow a factfinder to conclude that a reasonable suspect in Defendant's position would have believed that the question was directed at him.

That is particularly true given that Special Agent Oliver (1) testified that he did not preface either his initial statement about the search warrant or the question regarding weapons by stating Defendant's wife's name, nor did he instruct only her to answer, and (2) obtained a \"no knock\" warrant so as to place Defendant in a \"state of confusion\" at the time of the questioning.

During cross-examination, defense counsel presented Special Agent Oliver with a diagram of the room in which the questioning occurred. At defense counsel's request, Special Agent Oliver made \"X\" marks on the diagram to indicate in which chairs Defendant and his wife were seated and where those chairs were located in the room. That marked diagram is not part of the record on appeal, nor was it preserved by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Additionally, during oral argument on the suppression motion-which occurred more than a week after Special Agent Oliver's testimony-the district court expressed confusion regarding where, exactly, Defendant and his wife were seated relative to each other. J.A. 359 (\"I looked back in my notes and, even then, I wasn't hundred percent sure [i]n terms of who is seated where at the time the question is being asked.\"). The record includes no indication that the district court ever resolved that uncertainty, which bears directly on whether Defendant reasonably believed, based on his proximity relative to his wife, that the question was directed at him.
