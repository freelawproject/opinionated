On April 24, 2015, the Coast Guard intercepted a 20-foot vessel off the coast of Dorado, Puerto Rico. Aboard the vessel were 72.5 kilograms of cocaine and three men: the defendant, Victor Mercedes-Guerrero (Mercedes), and Juan A. Concepci\u00f3n-Garc\u00eda (Concepci\u00f3n). Initially, the trio claimed to be Dominican nationals headed to Puerto Rico in search of work. Later, the defendant changed his tune and admitted his participation in a drug-smuggling enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 21, 2015, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned a four-count indictment. The indictment charged all three men with conspiracy to import five kilograms or more of cocaine into the United States, aiding and abetting that conspiracy, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, and aiding and abetting that conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 952(a), 960(a)(1), 963. In due course, the defendant entered a straight guilty plea to all four counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The probation office prepared a PSI Report. Because the offenses of conviction involved more than 50 kilograms but less than 150 kilograms of cocaine, the PSI Report recommended a base offense level of 34. After factoring in a three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, the PSI Report suggested a total offense level of 31. Coupled with a criminal history category of I, this offense level yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 108-135 months. The GSR, however, was trumped in part by a statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), 960(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant countered by moving for a downward departure or variance, making clear his objection to certain aspects of the PSI Report. Pertinently, he argued that he had played only a minor role in the criminal activity and, therefore, should receive a two-level role-in-the-offense reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 3B1.2.\n   <strong>\n    [redacted]\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant took the position that, because he was a \"mere transporter of the contraband,\" he deserved a mitigating role adjustment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argued that he was less culpable than Mercedes and other unindicted coconspirators (though he did not claim to be less culpable than Concepci\u00f3n). He also sought a downward departure or variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the disposition hearing, the district court accepted the PSI Report's recommendations, except that it reduced the GSR to 87-108 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then determined that the defendant was not entitled to a minor participant reduction. Considering the newly constituted GSR and the factors delineated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the court proceeded to reject the defendant's entreaty for a downward departure or variance. Instead, it imposed concurrent 87-month terms of immurement on all four counts of conviction. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Prior to November 1, 2015, a two-pronged test was typically employed to determine a defendant's entitlement to such a reduction. First, the court had to determine whether the defendant was \"less culpable than most of those involved in the offenses of conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mateo-Espejo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8915959\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/508/#p512\">\n    426 F.3d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (1st Cir.2005).

It does not require courts, when weighing mitigating role adjustments, to appraise a defendant's role in the broader conspiracy as opposed to his role in the specific criminal activity for which he is being held accountable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG App. C, Amend. 794 (instructing courts to determine \"defendant's relative culpability ... only by reference to his or her co-participants in the case at hand\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The upshot is that with respect to identifying the universe of relevant participants, earlier precedent developed under the first prong of our minor participant jurisprudence remains velivolant, notwithstanding the promulgation of Amendment 794.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De la Cruz-Guti\u00e9rrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275143\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/221/#p225\">\n    881 F.3d at 225-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even when it hews to the correct legal rule, a district court must still exercise judgment to identify the universe of participants involved in the particular conduct that forms the basis of the defendant's sentence.

The defendant's base offense level was determined by reference to the specific drug quantity involved in that singular transport-not the amount trafficked through any broader conspiracy.

The Sentencing Commission has provided a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   the degree to which the defendant understood the scope and structure of the criminal activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii)\n   </strong>\n   the degree to which the defendant participated in planning or organizing the criminal activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    (iii)\n   </strong>\n   the degree to which the defendant exercised decision-making authority or influenced the exercise of decision-making authority;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    (iv)\n   </strong>\n   the nature and extent of the defendant's participation in the commission of the criminal activity, including the acts the defendant performed and the responsibility and discretion the defendant had in performing those acts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    (v)\n   </strong>\n   the degree to which the defendant stood to benefit from the criminal activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252730\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/541/#p545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court below found that, under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant \"was not substantially less culpable than the average participant\" in the drug smuggle. In its view, the defendant understood the scope and structure of the criminal activity and knew that he was transporting narcotics. By the defendant's own account, he had agreed to participate in an illegal smuggling operation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once aboard the vessel, the defendant's participation in the criminal activity was substantial: he worked in tandem with the captain (Mercedes) to assure the success of the voyage. Although he did not participate in either planning or organizing the criminal activity, he exercised a modicum of decisionmaking authority in steering and navigating the vessel toward its destination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Last-but surely not least-the district court supportably found that the defendant stood to benefit from the criminal activity. He was paid handsomely to traverse the Caribbean Sea and, in addition, received what he had sought all along: passage to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"To be entitled to the role reduction, [the defendant] had to prove that he was\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   culpable than his cohorts.\"\n   <em>\n    De la Cruz-Gut\u00ederrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275143\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/221/#p225\">\n    881 F.3d at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The district court found that he had failed to carry this burden, and that finding was not clearly erroneous. The defendant's cohorts can be located on a continuum. Mercedes, who had primary responsibility for the voyage, stands at one end of the continuum. Concepci\u00f3n, whom even the defendant seems to admit was not a meaningful contributor to the enterprise, stands at the opposite end. The defendant, who was involved in the navigation and steering of the vessel, stands somewhere in the middle. Thus, the district court reasonably could have found that he was not substantially less culpable than the average participant. When a person undertakes to provide material assistance in transporting a large quantity of drugs as a member of a tiny crew in a hazardous voyage at sea, it ordinarily will not be clear error for the sentencing court to refuse him a mitigating role adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    P\u00e9rez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252730\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/541/#p545\">\n    819 F.3d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So it is here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In an effort to efface the district court's reasoning, the defendant argues\n   that an offender who lacks a proprietary interest in the criminal activity should receive a mitigating role adjustment. In support, he relies on Amendment 794. His reliance, however, is misplaced. The commentary does not indicate that every such offender is entitled to a mitigating role adjustment; it merely instructs that every such offender \"should be considered for a mitigating role adjustment.\" USSG App. C, Amend. 794. Here, the court considered the defendant's importunings and found them wanting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
