Price appeals his sentence, arguing that it was substantively unreasonable to have imposed a term of incarceration rather than ordering residential inpatient substance abuse treatment. Price also contends that the new term of supervised release was procedurally unreasonable because it exceeded the maximum length permitted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). We agree that \u00a7 3583(h) must be interpreted to require that the maximum term of supervised release be reduced by the aggregate of all post-revocation terms of imprisonment related to the same underlying offense. There is no dispute that, under this interpretation, 10 months was the maximum term of supervised release that could follow the 24-month term of imprisonment imposed in this case. After careful review, we affirm Price's custodial sentence, vacate the term of supervised release, and remand for the district court to impose a new term of supervised release not to exceed the maximum permitted under \u00a7 3583(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Andre Price pleaded guilty to one of four counts of bank robbery and was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release. Price completed that custodial sentence and began his first term of supervised release on July 21, 2017. Two urine samples collected the next week tested positive for cocaine, and Price admitted that he had used crack cocaine over the weekend of July 22, 2017. At the recommendation of the probation officer, however, the district court took no action with respect to those violations of the conditions of his supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But when Price tested positive for cocaine use twice more on July 28 and August 7, the probation officer recommended revocation in a petition filed on August 11, 2017. During the first revocation hearing, Price admitted using cocaine prior to those dates and pleaded guilty to violating two conditions of his supervised release. Through counsel, Price asked that he be allowed to participate in inpatient substance abuse treatment in lieu of incarceration. In support of that request, Price submitted a letter from the intake coordinator for the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which stated that Price would be a \"good fit\" for their inpatient alcohol and drug rehabilitation program. Given Price's admitted \"Grade B\" violation and his criminal history category of VI, his applicable policy-statement Guidelines range was 21 to 24 months of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 7B1.4 (Policy Statement).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court considered alternative sentencing options, revoked Price's supervised release,\n   and imposed a substantially below-Guidelines sentence of two months of imprisonment to be followed by a 34-month term of supervised release. The conditions of Price's supervised release were the same as before, with an additional requirement that Price spend six months in a halfway house. Price served that custodial sentence and began his new term of supervised release on October 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two weeks later, on October 29 and 30, Price violated the conditions of his supervised release by: (1) being absent from the halfway house overnight without permission; (2) possessing crack cocaine in violation of state law; and (3) using crack cocaine in violation of the terms of his supervised release. Although drug testing was not performed, Price admitted all three violations during the revocation hearing held November 13, 2017. Price again argued for substance abuse treatment in lieu of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The record confirms that the district court considered that to be an option but denied the request as inappropriate under the circumstances. Having admitted a \"Grade B\" violation, the applicable policy-statement Guidelines range was again 21 to 24 months of imprisonment. After considering the relevant sentencing factors, the district court revoked Price's supervised release for a second time and imposed the sentence that is at issue in this appeal: a 24-month term of imprisonment to be followed by a new 12-month term of supervised release. The district court imposed the same conditions of supervised release as before-including six months in a halfway house-but added the possibility that Price could substitute inpatient substance abuse treatment for time in the halfway house \"on a month-for-month basis.\" Defense counsel indicated that there were no other objections, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sentences imposed following the revocation of supervised release are reviewed for procedural and substantive reasonableness under the same abuse-of-discretion standard that applies to post-conviction sentences.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In addition, \u00a7 3583(g) requires revocation and imprisonment if, among other things, the defendant \"possesses a controlled substance in violation of the condition set forth in [ \u00a7 3583(d) ],\" or \"as a part of drug testing, tests positive for illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1 year.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and (4).

Even if that were not the case, there can be no dispute that Price tested positive for cocaine use \"more than 3 times over the course of 1 year,\" \u00a7 3583(g)(4).

In fact, before imposing a sentence of incarceration, the district court identified relevant sentencing factors, noted that substance abuse had played a role in the underlying offense, and emphasized the leniency already granted with respect to the previous drug-related violations of supervised release. Moreover, the conditions of supervised release included the possibility that Price could substitute residential substance abuse treatment for time that would otherwise be spent in a halfway house \"on a month-for-month basis.\" A rebuttable presumption of substantive reasonableness applies to Price's within-Guidelines sentence, and his argument that the sentencing factors should have been balanced differently is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And the Supreme Court has not weighed in on this issue. This is fatal to Price's procedural-reasonableness challenge, under our plain-error precedents. \"A lack of binding case law that answers the question presented ... preclude[s] our finding of plain error.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There was no binding case law that answered the question presented in this case at the time the district court decided it, and there have been no intervening cases creating such binding case law.
