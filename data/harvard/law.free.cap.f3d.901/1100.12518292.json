We hold that, under Amendment 798 to the Sentencing Guidelines, California robbery is not a \"crime of violence.\" But that holding does not help defendant Deljuan Bankston. Bankston was sentenced six months before the effective date of Amendment 798-and, as we now hold, the portion of that amendment applicable here is not retroactive. Bankston's efforts to avoid the consequences of that lack of retroactivity are valiant but unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2015, Deljuan Bankston pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Bankston had two prior convictions for California robbery under California Penal Code \u00a7 211. The presentence report suggested that both robbery convictions constituted \"crimes of violence\" under the 2015 United States Sentencing Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.2, 2K2.1 (2015). Bankston objected, arguing that the Guidelines' \"crime of violence\" section was void for vagueness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court, agreeing with Bankston, held that the section was unconstitutionally vague. In February 2016, the district court sentenced Bankston to 33 months' imprisonment, the high end of the range she had calculated under the 2015 Guidelines, followed by three years of supervised release.

California robbery is thus not a categorical match for generic federal robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But that's not the end of the story. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \"crimes of violence\" can be robbery\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   extortion (among other crimes not here relevant). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.1 (2015). In\n   <em>\n    Becerril-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , we adopted a generic definition of extortion. We noted that, \"[u]nlike robbery, the threats that can constitute extortion under the modern statutes include threats to harm property and to cause other unlawful injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Becerril-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049610\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/881/#p891\">\n    541 F.3d at 891, 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given this property-threat-inclusive definition of generic extortion,\n   <em>\n    Becerril-Lopez\n   </em>\n   reasoned, California robbery\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a categorical match for generic robbery\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   generic extortion, taken together.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049610\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/881/#p891\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049610\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/881/#p891\">\n    at 891-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But the Guidelines have changed. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Edling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517574\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1153/\">\n    895 F.3d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2018),\n   <em>\n    Becerril-Lopez\n   </em>\n   's definition of generic extortion-which includes the threats to property-is no longer controlling as to \"crimes of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517574\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1153/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517574\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1153/\">\n    at 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here's why: The United States Sentencing Commission substantially amended the Guidelines' \"crime of violence\" section effective August 1, 2016, in Amendment 798. U.S.S.G., Supp. Appx. C, Amend. 798 (Aug. 1, 2016). The comments to the amended version provided for the first time a specific definition of extortion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 131. Under Amendment 798, \" 'Extortion' is obtaining something of value\n   from another by the wrongful use of (A) force, (B) fear of physical injury, or (C) threat of physical injury.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.1 (2016); U.S.S.G. Supp. Appx. C, Amend. 798 (Aug. 1, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We recently considered whether Amendment 798's extortion definition affects the reach of the \"crime of violence\" Guideline as applied to a state robbery statute and concluded that it can. In light of its text, context, and the rule of lenity,\n   <em>\n    Edling\n   </em>\n   held, \"the Guidelines' new definition of extortion narrows the offense by requiring that the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats be directed against the person of another, not property.\"\n   <em>\n    Edling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517574\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1153/\">\n    895 F.3d at 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Nevada robbery, which\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   \"rest on fear of injury to property alone,\" does not any longer categorically match a combination of Guidelines-defined extortion and generic federal robbery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517574\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1153/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   So here. Under Amendment 798, Guidelines-defined extortion does not criminalize extortion committed by threats to property; California robbery does. California robbery is thus no longer a categorical match to a combination of Guidelines-described robbery and extortion, and\n   <em>\n    Becerril-Lopez\n   </em>\n   's holding to the contrary no longer controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But that conclusion does not mean that Bankston prevails. Bankston's sentence was imposed about six months before Amendment 798's effective date. Our question, then, is whether the Amendment applies retroactively. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"When an amendment to the Guidelines clarifies, rather than alters, existing law, we use the amendment to interpret the Guidelines provision retroactively.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

C, Amend. 798, at 129 (Aug. 1, 2016) (emphasis added). This language is best interpreted to mean that the addition of a definition of extortion in the commentary was one such \"revis[ion],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516050\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1207/#p1212\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , rather than a clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our interpretation finds additional support in the Commission's specific comments as to the new extortion definition. The Commission explained that it intended to \"narrow[ ] the generic definition of extortion,\" as established in \"case law existing at the time of this amendment,\" \"by limiting the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131. There is no indication that the Commission believed the \"case law existing at the time of th[e] amendment\" had strayed from the original intent of the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the definition represented a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   \"narrow[ing]\" and \"limiting\" of the definition of a \"crime of violence,\" which neither the Commission nor the courts had previously adopted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission's language thus reflects a substantive change to the extortion definition, not a clarifying one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The amendment was, to be sure, to the Guidelines' commentary rather than to the text itself. We have not before considered the location of an amendment within the Guidelines' structure when determining its retroactivity. Several other courts have, holding an amendment's location in the commentary to be \"some indication\" an amendment is clarifying,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Huff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241722\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/370/454/#p466\">\n    370 F.3d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 466 (5th Cir. 2004), particularly when the amendment \"merely supplement[s] commentary carried over from an earlier version of the Guidelines,\" rather than \"contradict[ing] or alter[ing] preexisting commentary,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For example, in the Fourth Circuit, \"whether the amendment changes a guideline's commentary or its actual text is relevant though not conclusive; amendments to the commentary on a guideline may be substantive, and amendments to the text of a guideline may be merely clarifying.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But whether it is such an indication still depends principally on the language, impact, and history of the change. Here, there is no indication\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than the location in commentary that suggests that Amendment 798's change to the definition of extortion is clarifying, and there are several reasons to believe it was substantive. Under these circumstances, the extortion definition's location in the commentary is an insufficient basis to conclude that the change is clarifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We hold that Amendment 798's alteration of the definition of extortion in the Guidelines' \"crime of violence\" section is not retroactive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Bankston was sentenced before August 1, 2016, the pre-amendment generic extortion definition applies, and the fact that California robbery is no longer a \"crime of violence\" is not here applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bankston maintains that, even under the pre-amendment Sentencing Guidelines, his\n   sentencing was improper because those Guidelines were inappropriately-even if not unconstitutionally-vague.

Because the Guidelines \"crime of violence\" language itself could not reach California robbery, the district court reasoned, the commentary interpreting that Guideline as specifically reaching extortion and robbery could not be used to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   But the Supreme Court thereafter broke a link in the district court's logical chain.

Because the Guidelines' residual clause \"was still in place at the time the district court sentenced [Bankston] and survived constitutional challenge in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516050\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1207/#p1212\">\n    883 F.3d at 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , California robbery could still be properly considered a \"crime of violence\" under the residual clause and the commentary interpreting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Bankston acknowledges that the district court's logic is no longer valid. But he maintains that, even though the Guidelines' \"crime of violence\" section may not be challenged on constitutional vagueness grounds, \"it is still so unclear that it cannot be accurately interpreted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The problem with the position is apparent: Absent vagueness rising to the level of a constitutional violation, there is no rule of law that would allow us to strike down a Guidelines section because it is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, the commentary to the applicable \"crime of violence\" section clearly identified both generic robbery and generic extortion as \"crimes of violence\" under the residual clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.1 (2015).

With that general principle in mind, we consider Bankston's two independent arguments that the district court's Guidelines calculation error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, Bankston suggests that, on remand, the district court would be required to apply the not-retroactive, narrower definition of extortion adopted in Amendment 798. He is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), \"A district court to which a case is remanded ... shall resentence a defendant\" by \"apply[ing] the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Commission ... that were in effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal.\" Prior to Bankston's appeal, he was sentenced under the Guidelines then in effect-the 2015 Guidelines-so, on remand, he will be resentenced under those same 2015 Guidelines. The Guidelines'\n   <em>\n    initial sentencing\n   </em>\n   mandate, that \"[t]he court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced,\" is not inconsistent with the separate statutory mandate as to defendants who are resentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B.11 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, Bankston maintains that \"the sentencing record in this case makes it clear that the district court would impose the same sentence upon any remand.\" \"[W]e do not agree that it is so certain that the district court would have imposed the same sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266551\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1043/#p1047\">\n    879 F.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is entirely possible that the district court could exercise its discretion to impose the same sentence on remand-particularly in light of Bankston's ability to argue for the same sentence based on the later-enacted, more narrow definition of extortion, as well as the fact that Bankston has already been released from prison and is on supervised release. And the district court already found that the sentence imposed was \"the appropriate sentence for this defendant under these circumstances,\" including the circumstances of Bankston's lack of relationship with his parents, who were addicted to drugs; his exposure to violence in his neighborhood at a young age; the effect his grandmother's death had on him after he cared for her as a teenager; and the lack of programming he had received after he \"went right off the\n   rails\" after his grandmother died; all compared against the \"hugely dangerous\" gun crime he committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Yet \"[n]othing in the sentencing colloquy suggests that the sentencing judge stated that [s]he would impose the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines calculation because of the mitigation factors.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In fact, the sentencing judge in Bankston's case was less definitive as to Bankston's sentence than in other cases in which we have found a lack of harmlessness. For example,\n   <em>\n    Munoz-Camarena\n   </em>\n   held that the \"district court's mere statement that it would impose the same above-Guidelines sentence no matter ... the correct calculation cannot, without more, insulate the sentence from remand, because the court's analysis did not flow from an initial determination of the correct Guidelines range,\" and because \"the extent of a variance\" from the Guidelines could have affected the court's analysis. 631 F.3d at 1031 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
