The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) refused the advertisements because they violated a then-recently adopted moratorium on issue-oriented advertising in the Metro system. AFDI sued both WMATA and its then-general manager, Jack Requa,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming WMATA's refusal to display its advertisements violated its rights to free speech and equal protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The district court granted summary judgment on behalf of WMATA, which we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   WMATA, which was created by an interstate compact among the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, operates the Metrorail and Metrobus services that provide Washington-area residents with the majority of their public transit options. D.C. CODE \u00a7 9-1107.01. Relevant to this litigation, WMATA permits advertising throughout the Metro system; specifically, Metrobuses display advertisements on their exteriors, and the Metrorail stations contain advertising \"dioramas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   AFDI describes itself as \"a nonprofit organization ... dedicated to freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, and individual rights.\" It \"promotes its objectives by ... purchasing advertising space on transit authority property ... to express its message on current\n   events and public issues, including issues involving the suppression of free speech by Sharia-adherent Islamists and complicit government officials.\" It was in furtherance of this mission that AFDI wanted to advertise in the Metro system in May 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   AFDI submitted two advertisements, identical in content, one to be displayed on the exteriors of Metrobuses and the other meant for Metrorail station dioramas. The advertisements depict a turbaned, bearded, sword-wielding man who is apparently meant to be the Prophet Muhammad. A speech bubble emerging from the man's mouth contains the sentence \"YOU CAN'T DRAW ME!\" Below the man is a disembodied hand, paler in color, holding either a pen or a pencil pressed to paper. From the hand comes a speech bubble reading \"THAT'S WHY I DRAW YOU.\" The phrase \"SUPPORT FREE SPEECH\" appears at the top of the advertisements. According to AFDI's complaint, the advertisements \"make the point that the First Amendment will not yield to Sharia-adherent Islamists who want to enforce so-called blasphemy laws here in the United States, whether through threats of violence or through the actions of complicit government officials.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When WMATA began accepting advertising in the 1970s, it accepted issue-oriented advertisements, including political, religious, and other advocacy. According to the uncontested testimony of Lynn Bowersox, WMATA's Assistant General Manager for Customer Service, Communications, and Marketing, WMATA had dealt with controversies surrounding issue-oriented advertisements for much of the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 2010s, however, the controversies grew, with monthly complaints over advertisements that disrespected President Obama, depicted animal cruelty, advocated the use of condoms to prevent sexually-transmitted diseases, and supported the legalization of marijuana. By the time AFDI submitted the advertisements at issue in this case, WMATA's leadership had spent \"nearly 5 years of looking at\" the question whether to permit issue-oriented advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   AFDI submitted its advertisements in May 2015. Not long thereafter, Ms. Bowersox directed her staff to prepare a memorandum detailing WMATA's history with AFDI. Additionally, Mr. Mort Downey, then Chairman of WMATA's Board, sent Ms. Bowersox an email message to which he attached an article about a recent shooting in Garland, Texas linked to the advertisements AFDI wanted to run on the Metro system; he asked Ms. Bowersox to be prepared to discuss it at the May meeting of the Board. Ms. Bowersox also prepared for the executive session of the board meeting a memorandum advocating the closure of WMATA's advertising space to issue-oriented advertising. In her deposition, Ms. Bowersox allowed as how AFDI's submission was \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" and prompted her to recommend WMATA temporarily refuse to run issue-oriented advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The consensus among members of the Board at the executive session was to accept Ms. Bowersox's recommendation of a temporary moratorium on issue-oriented advertisements, which by its terms \"close[d] WMATA's advertising space to any and all issue-oriented advertising, including but not limited to, political, religious and advocacy advertising until the end of the calendar year.\" No member of the Board mentioned AFDI's advertisements; the only specific advertisements mentioned were either \"talking about open skies agreements with certain Mid-East countries\" or detailing \"animal experimentation practices at some of our national science institutes.\" With the Moratorium in\n   place, WMATA rejected AFDI's proposed advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2015, AFDI sued, claiming WMATA's \"restriction on [AFDI's] speech [was] content- and viewpoint-based in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment\" and WMATA's \"true purpose for adopting the [Moratorium] was to silence the viewpoint expressed by [AFDI's] speech.\" For the same reasons AFDI claimed WMATA's actions deprived it of equal protection under the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   WMATA did not sit idly by during the pendency of this litigation. In November 2015, it rescinded the Moratorium and adopted a series of \"Guidelines Governing Commercial Advertising,\" the relevant parts of which provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   9. Advertisements intended to influence members of the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions are prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   11. Advertisements that support or oppose any political party or candidate are prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   12. Advertisements that promote or oppose any religion, religious practice or belief are prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   13. Advertisements that support or oppose an industry position or industry goal without direct commercial benefit to the advertiser are prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   AFDI did not amend its complaint to take account of the new Guidelines; its complaint still challenges only the Moratorium, which is no longer in place. Neither did it resubmit to WMATA the previously rejected advertisements for reconsideration under the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court granted WMATA's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    AFDI v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274613\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/205/\">\n    245 F.Supp.3d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2017).

The district court also held neither the Moratorium nor the Guidelines were unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274613\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/205/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274613\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/245/205/\">\n    at 213-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because AFDI did not amend its complaint, we face at the outset a jurisdictional question: Did the repeal of the Moratorium moot this case? We conclude it did not. Though the district court did not address mootness, \"we have an independent obligation to assure ourselves of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Council of Life Insurers v. D.C. Health Benefit Exch. Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147418,12310171\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/17/\">\n    815 F.3d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19 (D.C. Cir.2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Justiciability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We are acutely aware that \"Article III of the Constitution restricts the federal courts to deciding only actual, ongoing controversies, and a federal court has no power to render advisory opinions or decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Black Police Ass'n v. Dist. of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7629472,3703647\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/346/\">\n    108 F.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349 (D.C. Cir.1997) (cleaned up). Though a plaintiff's claim may be justiciable when filed, \"a federal court must refrain from deciding it if events have so transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the parties' rights nor have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting them in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Initiative &amp; Referendum Inst.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    IRI\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    v. USPS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875184,3901372\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1066/\">\n    685 F.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1074 (D.C. Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). At first\n   blush, that is what seems to have happened here. AFDI's complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief only against the Moratorium, but the Moratorium was replaced by the Guidelines in November 2015. There seems little point in enjoining the enforcement of a moratorium that is no longer in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, however, \"[t]he intervening event ... is of the [defendant]'s own doing.\"\n   <em>\n    IRI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875184,3901372\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1066/\">\n    685 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When this occurs, we examine whether the defendant's voluntary cessation of the challenged action truly renders the case moot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875184,3901372\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1066/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Generally it does not unless \"(1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely or irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Black Police Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7629472,3703647\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/346/\">\n    108 F.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This, however, is not a mine-run case of voluntary cessation. WMATA did repeal the challenged Moratorium, but it replaced the Moratorium with a policy that is fundamentally similar; the Guidelines are in effect a particularization and finalization of the temporary Moratorium. It is not quite correct to say WMATA has ceased the challenged conduct; instead, WMATA has renewed the challenged conduct in a new form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   An analogous Supreme Court decision makes clear this case is not moot.\n   <em>\n    Northeastern Florida Chapter of AssociatedGeneral Contractors of America\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    v. City of Jacksonville\n   </em>\n   , involved a challenge to a minority-owned business preference in the Jacksonville purchasing code.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n    508 U.S. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Shortly after the Court had granted certiorari, Jacksonville repealed that portion of its purchasing code and replaced it with a new ordinance differing only in minor respects.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n    at 660-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held the case was not moot: \"There [was] no mere risk that Jacksonville [would] repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct\" for \"it [had] already done so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n    at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The voluntary cessation exception to mootness is not limited, however, to cases in which \"the\n   <em>\n    selfsame\n   </em>\n   statute will be [re]enacted\"; \"if that were the rule, a defendant could moot a case by repealing the challenged statute and replacing it with one that differs only in some insignificant respect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The new ordinance in\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   \"may [have] disadvantage[d] [the plaintiffs] to a lesser degree than the old one, but ... it disadvantage[d] them in the same fundamental way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore the case was not moot.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Global Tel*Link v.

Cir.2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   So too here. WMATA does not contend the change to the Guidelines has remedied AFDI's alleged injury; clearly AFDI's proposed advertisements are just as unacceptable to WMATA under the Guidelines as they were under the Moratorium; the Moratorium banned issue-oriented advertisements, and so do the Guidelines. AFDI, in other words, is still disadvantaged in the same fundamental way. Indeed, AFDI's briefs are best read to say it would resubmit its advertisements but for their certain rejection under the Guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   One further question remains: Should we decide the constitutionality of the Moratorium or the constitutionality of the Guidelines? \"A change in the law between a nisi prius and an appellate decision requires the appellate court to apply the changed law.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziffrin, Inc. v.

Though the present situation is slightly different, for the policy here changed prior to rather than after the district court's decision, precedent and practicality direct us to deal with the world as it is now, not as it was when the case was filed.

Viewpoint neutrality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Though its briefs are confused, from what we can discern AFDI offers three separate arguments to support its claim that the Guidelines are not viewpoint-neutral. First, it brings what amounts to an as-applied challenge, contending that, even if the Guidelines are facially neutral, adopting the Moratorium and the Guidelines bespeak an intent to discriminate specifically against the views of AFDI. Second, it contends the ban on issue-oriented advertising is facially viewpoint-discriminatory. Third, it gestures at an argument that Guideline 12, which bans \"[a]dvertisements that promote or oppose any religion, religious practice or belief,\" effectively closes the forum to its antireligious speech, which it argues must be permitted under various Supreme Court cases. We find merit in none of the arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    i. As-applied challenge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties point to no case in the Supreme Court or in this circuit in which a change in the status of a forum was challenged on the ground that it was intended\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   to suppress the views of a particular party. Nevertheless, we assume such a claim is viable, as exemplified by\n   <em>\n    Ridley v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n    390 F.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir.2004), which dealt with a similar claim of seeming viewpoint neutrality masking insidious bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the outset, we note that as a general rule \"[t]he government is free to change the nature of any nontraditional forum as it wishes.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n    390 F.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the rule is not without an exception: For the Government to change the nature of a forum in order to deny access to a particular speaker or point of view surely would violate the First Amendment. Here, if WMATA adopted the Moratorium and subsequent Guidelines with the intent of suppressing the views of AFDI, then we would hold the Guidelines unconstitutional as applied to AFDI. Therefore, \"[t]he [WMATA]'s mere recitation of viewpoint-neutral rationales (or the presentation of a viewpoint-neutral guideline) for its decisions to reject the [advertisements at issue] does not immunize those decisions from scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The question is how to identify the Government's intent. Of course, direct evidence of viewpoint discrimination would be highly probative, but \"the government rarely flatly admits it is engaging in viewpoint discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . That leaves two types of evidence. The first is retrospective, that is, evidence from before the decision was taken to close the forum insofar as it may show whether the Government acted in order to suppress a disfavored view. The second is prospective, namely evidence of what happened once the forum\n   was closed. AFDI focuses its argument upon what happened in the lead up to closing the forum, whilst WMATA focuses its argument upon the lack of evidence of viewpoint discrimination once access to the forum was restricted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Retrospective evidence begins with \"statements by government officials on the reasons for\" closing the forum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n    at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Assuming those statements provide a legitimate reason, the plaintiff may attempt to show \"the viewpoint-neutral ground is not actually served very well by the specific governmental action at issue ... in other words, the fit between means and ends is loose or nonexistent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If, for example, the Government had said it wished to close a forum to political speech but passed regulations banning only anti-abortion messaging, then its action would undermine its claim of viewpoint neutrality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Other, less probative types of retrospective evidence might also play a role. We are guided here by the test the Supreme Court has used to unearth tacit discrimination on the basis of race. \"The historical background of the decision\" is relevant; if the Government had repeatedly been found to have engaged in viewpoint discrimination, especially against the plaintiff, then courts should look skeptically at its seemingly viewpoint-neutral rationale.\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Arlington Heights v.

Also relevant is any post-hoc rationalization for the change in the forum; if the Government proffers one reason when closing the forum but another when it later defends the closing, then that in itself is evidence of pretext.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Ann Arbor Transp. Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233798\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/947/777/#p788\">\n    947 F.Supp.2d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788 (E.D. Mich. 2013) (noting in dicta that \"post-hoc rationalization\" could be evidence of viewpoint discrimination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Applying this framework to AFDI's claims, it is clear they fall short, indeed, so far short that no reasonable jury could uphold them. First, AFDI has provided no prospective evidence whatsoever; it cites no example of an issue-oriented advertisement being run on Metrobuses or in Metrorail stations once the Moratorium was adopted, nor has AFDI pointed to any inconsistency in WMATA's explanation for its decision to close the forum. Neither has AFDI shown any mismatch between WMATA's stated reason for closing-to avoid being involved in further controversies arising from issue-oriented\n   advertisements-and its decision to end the problem by banning all issue-oriented advertisements. In other words, there is a fit between WMATA's means and its stated ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Indeed, AFDI's own assumptions speak to the lack of mismatch here. AFDI emphasizes the importance of advertising to WMATA's budget and hints WMATA would not have reduced its advertising revenue unless it was to discriminate against AFDI. That would counsel banning the fewest advertisements consistent with excluding AFDI's. Yet there is no question the Moratorium and the Guidelines sweep out far more than just AFDI's advertisements. If WMATA wished to keep out these particular advertisements, then it could have banned, as one example, advertisements \"with a demonstrated link to violence,\" which would have sufficed given the events in Garland, Texas. That WMATA put in place a much broader ban, even though it resulted in a larger potential loss of revenue, strongly suggests it was not discriminating against the views of AFDI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The evidence AFDI proffers is weak. It stakes much of its case upon Ms. Bowersox's depicting AFDI's advertisement as \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" with regard to issue-oriented advertisements in the forum. AFDI seems to misunderstand this metaphor. The point is that no particular straw shoulders all the blame. Each straw, on its own, contributed to breaking the unfortunate camel's back. The last straw was last by pure happenstance, not intent. So too here. That AFDI's advertisements were the last in a long line of controversial or potentially controversial advertisements does not mean the closure of the forum was meant to keep out the views of AFDI in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   AFDI also points to the confusion over how to place the Moratorium on the schedule for WMATA's Board meeting, Mr. Downey's request that Ms. Bowersox be prepared to discuss the violence surrounding AFDI's advertisements in Texas, and the haste with which the Moratorium was passed, but these events are consistent with WMATA's stated reason for restricting the forum. When AFDI submitted its advertisements, WMATA decided that it was no longer willing to tolerate the controversies advertisements like them engendered. It did act with haste to change its policies, but AFDI does not even suggest WMATA violated its own procedural rules. Regarding AFDI's point about Mr. Downey's email, we note that neither the violence in Texas nor AFDI itself was even mentioned at the Board meeting and therefore seems irrelevant to the Board's decision adopting the Moratorium. AFDI is essentially asking us to infer WMATA harbored an illicit intent without proffering any evidence to that effect. No reasonable jury could do that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The contrast between this case and\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   is instructive. There the defendant transit authority's rationale for rejecting the advertisements was that they advocated the legalization of marijuana, and the head of the authority said bluntly that he would have published the advertisements if they had supported existing marijuana laws.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n    390 F.3d at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such direct evidence of viewpoint discrimination is lacking here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, the transit authority in\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   also claimed, post hoc, it had rejected the advertisements because they might promote marijuana use among juveniles, a risk the court deemed \"minimal and, indeed, probably nonexistent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Not so here-the sole reason in the record for the advertisements' rejection was that they were political, not commercial (they \"advocate[ ] free speech and do[ ] not try to sell you a commercial product\"), so there is no\n   doubt WMATA's reasons for rejection match the advertisements' actual content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   pointed to advertisements promoting alcohol use that were \"clearly more appealing to juveniles\" than the marijuana legalization advertisements.\n   <em>\n    Ridley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9138074\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/65/\">\n    390 F.3d at 88-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This inconsistent application of the supposed rules of the forum was strong evidence of viewpoint discrimination. Here, however, AFDI has not even alleged, let alone provided evidence, that WMATA has applied its rules inconsistently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Facial viewpoint neutrality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Next, AFDI argues the ban on issue-oriented advertising is facially unconstitutional. The argument, again, is confused, but the main thrust appears to be that WMATA's restrictions favor commercial over noncommercial speech and therefore run afoul of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We have no trouble rejecting this claim: There is Supreme Court precedent almost directly on point.

AFDI points out, as a way of showing WMATA's policy\n   is flawed, that an advertiser could claim its product is the best value, most efficient, or best tasting, but a religious person could not promote his religion as the best, most truthful, or most charitable. This is a correct description of what is and is not acceptable under WMATA's policy-an advertiser can say whatever it wants about a permissible subject but cannot say anything about an impermissible subject-but this is not viewpoint discrimination; to hold otherwise would, as WMATA points out, erase the distinction between content-based and viewpoint-based restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   AFDI next argues WMATA's policy runs afoul of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Metromedia, Inc. v.

If\n   <em>\n    Lehman\n   </em>\n   had no application to\n   <em>\n    Metromedia\n   </em>\n   , then it stands to reason that\n   <em>\n    Metromedia\n   </em>\n   has no application to this case, which is closely analogous to\n   <em>\n    Lehman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, AFDI complains that the Guidelines are somehow worse than the Moratorium and that it is not clear on what basis WMATA rejected its advertisements. How, asks AFDI, can advertisements advocating free speech not be permitted? AFDI has only itself to blame for any uncertainty as to why its specific advertisements were rejected because it neither included in the record WMATA's communication rejecting the advertisements nor resubmitted the advertisements once the Guidelines were adopted. As it is, all we have in the record before us is Ms. Bowersox's statement that the advertisements were rejected because they \"advocate[ ] free speech and do[ ] not try to sell you a commercial product.\" In other words, WMATA rejected the advertisements because they were political.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

In doing so, AFDI mentions obliquely three Supreme Court cases-\n   <em>\n    Lamb's Chapel v.

To begin with, AFDI never mounts a full-on argument that\n   <em>\n    Lamb'sChapel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Good News Club\n   </em>\n   do indeed apply to this case; it only cites them for the general proposition that viewpoint discrimination is unconstitutional. Moreover, AFDI was extremely late in portraying its advertisement as antireligious speech, insofar as it has done so at all. In its complaint, for example, it stated its \"advertisements make the point that the First Amendment will not yield to Sharia-adherent Islamists who want to enforce so-called blasphemy laws here in the United States, whether through threats of violence or through the actions of complicit government officials, such as Defendants in this case.\" When the case was filed, that is, AFDI represented the subject of its advertisements as the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In AFDI's initial motion for summary judgment it made a vague reference to\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   but came no closer to presenting its advertisements as religious speech. Indeed, it first and belatedly made this argument, such as it is, in its reply in support of its motion for summary judgment. Implying now that its speech is antireligious speech is a mere characterization of convenience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Additionally, as far as the record shows, WMATA decided to refuse AFDI's advertisements only because of their political nature. As we said before, AFDI neglected to put in the record the actual communication from WMATA rejecting its proposed advertisements. (This failure of evidence is, of course, entirely attributable to AFDI, as it has the burden of proof.) All we have in the record is the testimony of Ms. Bowersox. When AFDI's counsel asked Ms. Bowersox at her deposition why WMATA rejected the advertisements at issue, she said she \"believe[d] that this ad would come under advocacy because it advocates free speech and does not try to sell you a commercial product.\" \"The government's purpose is the controlling consideration\" in speech cases,\n   <em>\n    Ward v. Rock Against Racism\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    491 U.S. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    105 L.Ed.2d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), and here all we have is WMATA itself telling us it rejected the advertisements because they were political speech. Guideline 12, therefore, is entirely irrelevant to this appeal, and we express no opinion as to whether it violates the First Amendment. This leaves Guideline 9 as the only Guideline AFDI properly challenges that could apply to its proposed speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reasonableness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We come, at last, to the reasonableness of WMATA's policy limiting access to its nonpublic forum, which \"must be assessed in the light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Cornelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p802\">\n    473 U.S. at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p802\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The Government's decision to restrict access to a nonpublic forum need only be\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   ; it need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p802\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p802\">\n    at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p802\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A regulation is reasonable if it is consistent with the government's legitimate interest in maintaining the property for its dedicated use.\"\n   <em>\n    IRI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875184,3901372\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1066/\">\n    685 F.3d at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   AFDI does not suggest the purpose for the forum is anything other than public transportation; instead, it posits that (1) controversial advertising had not disrupted WMATA's operations prior to AFDI's submission,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Brief at 44 (noting that \"[f]or decades WMATA had displayed controversial, public-issue advertisements\" and questioning how any \"ad ... would somehow interfere with the operation of WMATA's bus system\") and (2) WMATA's objective in selling advertising space must have been revenue maximization, so that losing any revenue by refusing AFDI's advertising was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   AFDI's premise is incorrect. As related by Ms. Bowersox in her deposition, before the Moratorium WMATA had been plagued by problems stemming from issue-oriented advertisements. These problems included complaints from riders, community leaders, and employees; and vandalism, security threats, and the increased administrative burden of evaluating arguably obscene or otherwise unacceptable advertisements. All this testimony is uncontested; there is not the slightest hint in the record that WMATA in fact did not have to deal with these problems. Nor has AFDI contested Ms. Bowersox's assertion that the problems became more acute in the 2010s. In the face of all this, WMATA concluded the game was not worth the candle; better to lose some advertising revenue and avoid having to deal with the controversies they create. This seems eminently reasonable; it might have cut into WMATA's revenues, but it necessarily avoided the complaints, the vandalism, and the security threats that WMATA's open advertising policy had engendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   No reasonable jury could conclude, therefore, that the Moratorium and the Guidelines were not reasonable efforts to avoid controversies engendered by advertising on Metrobuses and at Metro stations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   AFDI also cites two Third Circuit cases to support its position. The first held unreasonable a ban upon noncommercial advertisements in airports.\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

The crux of the Court's decision was that the State's discretion in enforcing the statute had to be \"guided by objective, workable standards.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the unqualified ban on \"political\" apparel did not provide those standards, it was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   At several points in its briefs, AFDI makes something approaching this argument, though it never explicitly argues the Guidelines are unreasonable because they lack objective, workable standards. Instead, AFDI at various points complains the Moratorium and Guidelines are \"hopelessly vague\", vest WMATA with \"unbridled control over the use of the forum\", and lack the precise and definite standards necessary to satisfy First Amendment scrutiny. AFDI focuses this attack in particular upon Guideline 9-the only Guideline it can properly challenge-which bans \"[a]dvertisements intended to influence the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In essence, AFDI merges two variant, though closely related, Supreme Court doctrines to make this claim. First, the Court has held, repeatedly, that the \"danger of censorship and of abridgment of our precious First Amendment freedoms is too great where officials have unbridled discretion over a forum's use.\"\n   <em>\n    See.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Promotions, Ltd. v.

Therefore, when government censors control access to a forum, but have no standards to govern their decisions, first amendment freedoms are abridged.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Lakewood v.

City of Rockford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782877\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/104/#p108\">\n    408 U.S. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782877\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/104/#p108\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782877\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/104/#p108\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). It is not entirely clear that the vagueness doctrine applies to the Guidelines, which do not, of course, impose criminal penalties on those whose advertisements are denied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

Cir.2008) (noting \"it is not clear whether the vagueness doctrine applies ... at all\" to statutes that do not threaten criminal penalties). In any event, the overlap in analysis between unbridled discretion and vagueness is clear; both doctrines require a court to determine whether a decisionmaker's exercise of discretion in allowing or disallowing speech is based upon objective and clear standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To this we can now add a third related inquiry-the inquiry that\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   seems to call for-whether the discretion vested in a government official to permit or prohibit speech is \"guided by objective, workable standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These three seemingly inquiries all pose a single challenge: We must determine whether Guideline 9 is so broad as to provide WMATA with no meaningful constraint upon its exercise of the power to squelch. If so, then it is not \"reasonable,\" as that term is used in\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   , and not constitutional because it provides WMATA with unbridled discretion. Put the other way around, if Guideline 9 is capable of reasoned application, as\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   demands, then it does not confer unbridled discretion upon WMATA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The parties' briefs predate the decision in\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   . Yet\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   invites arguments about whether Guideline 9 is capable of reasoned application. Moreover, WMATA's defense of the Guidelines against AFDI's unbridled discretion/vagueness challenge was that it banned AFDI's advertisements as \"political\" speech, which is not unconstitutional. That argument might be unavailing in light of\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In these circumstances, AFDI should be given an opportunity to refine its argument and to supplement the record accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Belizan v. Hershon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566393,3564194\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/686/\">\n    495 F.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692 (D.C. Cir.2007) (remanding securities fraud claims to the district court to reconsider in light of intervening Supreme Court precedent). Guideline 9 has been in place for nearly three years, and information on how it has been applied would certainly be information as to whether it is capable of reasoned application. In addition, the district court may wish to clarify whether WMATA would have rejected AFDI's advertisements based upon Guideline 9 or some other Guideline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment to WMATA as to whether its policy is reasonable and remand that portion of this case to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Fourteenth amendment claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As we noted at the outset of this opinion, AFDI also brought a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, asserting that the \"speech restriction ... unconstitutionally deprived [AFDI] of the equal protection of the law guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment ... in that [WMATA is] preventing [AFDI] from expressing a message based on its content and viewpoint.\" In support of this claim, AFDI cites\n   <em>\n    Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"under the Equal Protection Clause ... [the] government may not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782915\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/92/#p96\">\n    408 U.S. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782915\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/92/#p96\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782915\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/92/#p96\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). In other words, according to AFDI the Equal Protection Clause, like the First Amendment, prohibits the Government from engaging in viewpoint discrimination. As seen above, WMATA did not do that. AFDI does not contend, and\n   <em>\n    Mosley\n   </em>\n   does not suggest, that an unreasonable speech restriction violates the Fourteenth, as opposed to the First Amendment. This is fatal to AFDI's Fourteenth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   WMATA sought to end the controversy over the advertisements displayed in its forum. It has succeeded in eliminating complaints about the advertisements it accepts, but it has swapped those controversies for numerous lawsuits over the advertisements it rejects. While it is clear WMATA did not engage in viewpoint discrimination in rejecting AFDI's advertisement and adopting Guideline 9,\n   <em>\n    Mansky\n   </em>\n   provides enough uncertainty that it makes sense for the district court to reexamine in the first instance whether WMATA's applicable restrictions are reasonable. The district court's grant of summary judgment to WMATA is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Karen LeCraft Henderson, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   After the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) rejected the American Freedom Defense Initiative's (AFDI) advertisement under an interim advertising policy (Moratorium), AFDI sued to enjoin that policy. Although WMATA later changed its advertising policy by adopting more specific, lucid and permanent provisions (Guidelines), the litigation posture did not catch up. AFDI never resubmitted its ad to WMATA and therefore WMATA did not reject AFDI's ad under its new permanent policy and has not specified which, if any, of the Guidelines AFDI's ad would violate. AFDI did\n   not amend its complaint to challenge WMATA's Guidelines, which remain in effect today. Although the Guidelines attempt to serve the same goal as the interim policy-banning controversial ads from WMATA's advertising space-WMATA's speech restrictions' applicability to the plaintiff's speech is not clear and their contents changed significantly after the plaintiff sued to enjoin the earlier version. I believe the AFDI's claim for an injunction against the inoperative Moratorium is moot\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We \"lack jurisdiction to decide moot cases\" because a moot case is no longer an actual case or controversy under Article III.\n   <em>\n    Iron Arrow Honor Soc'y v. Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194503\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/67/#p70\">\n    464 U.S. 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194503\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/67/#p70\">\n    104 S.Ct. 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194503\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/67/#p70\">\n    78 L.Ed.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). The basis of mootness is in WMATA's voluntary conduct: changing the Moratorium-under which WMATA rejected AFDI's ad and which is the only policy AFDI challenged in its complaint-to the Guidelines. A defendant's \"voluntary cessation of a challenged practice\" moots a case if \"subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

In contrast, the \"statutes at issue\" in\n   <em>\n    Diffenderfer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fusari\n   </em>\n   \"were changed substantially\" and thus the claim was moot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/656/#p658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   So the question here: how similar are the Moratorium and the Guidelines? WMATA points to a central similarity: the Moratorium prohibited \"any and all issue-oriented advertising, including but not limited to, political, religious and advocacy advertising until the end of the calendar year,\" Joint Appendix (JA) 34, and the Guidelines \"resolved\" to \"close[ ]\" WMATA's\n   advertising space \"to issue-oriented ads, including political, religious and advocacy ads,\" JA 35. WMATA argues the carryover language means that WMATA's conduct \"has not ceased.\" Appellee's Supp. Br. 5. My colleagues agree with this reasoning. Maj. Op. 362 (\"[T]he Moratorium banned issue-oriented advertisements, and so do the Guidelines.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   If that were all the new policy said, I would agree. But WMATA's advertising decisions under the Guidelines are not governed by the language that WMATA relies on. Whereas the prohibition of \"issue-oriented ... political, religious and advocacy\" ads was operative in the Moratorium, that same language in the Guidelines is more akin to a preamble or a statement of purpose; WMATA instead effects its intent via five specific inquiries that serve as the operative terms of the Guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   JA 34 (Moratorium),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   JA 35 (Resolution to revise Guidelines to prohibit issue-oriented ads),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   JA 37-38 (Guidelines). Thus, under the Moratorium, WMATA asked: Is this advertisement an \"issue-oriented ... political, religious [or] advocacy\" advertisement? Under the Guidelines, however, WMATA asks,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : Is this advertisement (1) \"intended to influence members of the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions\"; (2) \"support[ing] or oppos[ing] any political party or candidate\"; (3) \"promot[ing] or oppos[ing] any religion, religious practice or belief\"; (4) \"support[ing] or oppos[ing] an industry position or industry goal without any direct commercial benefit to the advertiser\"; or (5) \"intended to influence public policy\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The two versions ask very different questions. And the textual difference between the Moratorium and the Guidelines is not purely semantic. As WMATA acknowledges, the Guidelines \"elaborate\" on and \"add meaningful content\" to the Moratorium's policy. Appellee's Supp. Br. 11 n.5. The Guidelines give contours to the line WMATA draws between what ads to accept and what ads to reject. The new boundaries matter under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Airport Comm'rs of L.A. v.

Although my colleagues believe the Guidelines merely \"particulariz[e] and finaliz[e]\" the Moratorium, Maj. Op. 361-62, the addition of \"meaningful content\" to guide government officials' decision-making, Appellee's Supp. Br. 11 n.5, can make all the difference in whether a nonpublic forum speech restriction survives constitutional scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   A recent United States Supreme Court case illustrates why. A nonpublic forum speech restriction must provide \"objective, workable standards\" to constrain government officials' \"discretion\" in deciding what speech comes in and what speech stays out.\n   <em>\n    Minn.

For example, the Supreme Court suggested, the First Amendment nonpublic forum \"reasonableness\" analysis of a law that prohibits wearing \"political\" apparel likely differs from the analysis of a law that prohibits displaying \"information that advocates for or against any candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the Supreme Court noted that state guidance prohibiting \"issue oriented material designed to influence or impact voting\" is problematic because it \"raises more questions than it answers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612298\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1876/\">\n    at 1889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Accordingly, it is possible that the answer to whether a restriction on \"issue-oriented\" \"political\" or \"religious\" or \"advocacy\" advertisements is viewpoint-neutral and reasonable may differ from the answer to whether a restriction on advertisements that \"support or oppose any political party or candidate\" or \"promote or oppose any religion, religious practice or belief\" or \"support or oppose an industry position or industry goal without any direct commercial benefit\" or attempt to \"influence public policy [or] the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions\" is viewpoint-neutral and reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Guidelines, then, do not \"differ[ ] only in some insignificant respect.\"\n   <em>\n    Ne.
