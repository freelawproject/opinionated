We deny Lopez's petition for review of the BIA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lopez is a citizen of Mexico who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident (\"LPR\") on October 7, 1984. On September 23, 1996, after entering a plea of no contest, he was convicted of possession for sale of cocaine salt in violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code (\"CHSC\") \u00a7 11351. On January 18, 2008, the conviction was expunged pursuant to California Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 21, 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") initiated deportation proceedings against Lopez. The DHS cited two grounds for deportation:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. Lopez conceded that he was deportable, having been convicted of a controlled substance violation, but denied that he was deportable based on the aggravated felony ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The immigration judge held that Lopez's violation of CHSC \u00a7 11351 constituted an aggravated felony, and that his expunged conviction remained a valid ground for deportation. Furthermore, the judge concluded that Lopez was ineligible for a discretionary waiver under the former Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") \u00a7 212(c) and denied deferral under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). The judge ordered his deportation, and the BIA affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Lopez argues that his violation of CHSC \u00a7 11351 does not constitute an aggravated felony. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Any state crime that is a categorical match to an offense under the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\") constitutes an aggravated felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). There is a three-step process for determining whether Lopez's violation of CHSC \u00a7 11351 is punishable as a felony under the CSA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   At the first step, we ask whether the statute of conviction is a categorical match to the generic predicate offense; that is, if the statute of conviction criminalizes only as much (or less) conduct than the generic offense. If so, the inquiry ends, because the conviction categorically constitutes a predicate offense. If not, we move on to step two and ask if the statute of conviction's comparatively \"overbroad\" element is divisible. If not,\n   then our inquiry ends, because a conviction under an indivisible, overbroad statute can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   serve as a predicate offense. But if the overbroad element (or elements) is divisible, we then continue to the third step, an application of the modified categorical approach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Medina-Lara v.
