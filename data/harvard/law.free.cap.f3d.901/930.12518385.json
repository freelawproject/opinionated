We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012, the United States Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a section in the Department of Justice (DOJ), began an investigation into Nebraska Beef, a meat-packing company. The investigation sought to determine whether the company discriminated against immigrant workers in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b. Specifically, the OSC alleged that Nebraska Beef unlawfully required work-authorized immigrants to provide certain documents not required of non-immigrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2015, rather than proceed into litigation, the government and Nebraska Beef entered into a settlement agreement. The agreement required Nebraska Beef to pay a $200,000 civil penalty and to provide back pay to those who were not hired as a result of the practice or whose hiring was delayed by it. Nebraska Beef also agreed not to engage in any such practices in the future. The third and fourth opening recitals of the agreement set forth the parties' positions on liability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   WHEREAS, the Office of Special Counsel concluded based upon its investigation that there is reasonable cause to believe that Respondent used documentary practices based on citizenship status in violation of [ 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b(a)(6) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   WHEREAS, Nebraska Beef denies that it has used any documentary policies or practices based on citizenship status in its employment eligibility verification process in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b(a)(6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant's Add. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Paragraph 3(b) stated, \"The Office of Special Counsel maintains its right, as a federal agency statutorily charged with serving and educating the public regarding the scope of its enforcement activities, to notify the public, including but not limited to individuals [Nebraska Beef] identifies and notifies pursuant to paragraph 3, about this Agreement.\" Appellant's Add. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nebraska Beef signed the agreement on August 20, 2015, and the government executed it four days later. That same day, the OSC issued a press release announcing the agreement on the DOJ website. The\n   webpage also linked to a copy of the settlement agreement. The first two paragraphs of the release stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Justice Department announced today that it reached a settlement with Nebraska Beef Ltd., a meat packing company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. The settlement resolves an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) into whether the company was engaging in employment discrimination in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). In particular, OSC investigated whether the company was requiring non-U.S. citizen employees, because of their citizenship status, to present proof of their immigration status for the employment eligibility verification process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The department's investigation found that the company required non-U.S. citizens, but not similarly-situated U.S. citizens, to present specific documentary proof of their immigration status to verify their employment eligibility. The INA's anti-discrimination provision prohibits employers from making documentary demands based on citizenship or national origin when verifying an employee's authorization to work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellant's Add. at 20. Three days later, Nebraska Beef's counsel sent a letter to the OSC accusing it of breaching the agreement. The letter stated that the DOJ lacked the authority to make a finding that Nebraska Beef \"required non-U.S. citizens ... to present specific documentary proof of their immigration status\" as described in the press release. Appellant's Add. at 22. Nebraska Beef stated that it never agreed to such a finding and that the agreement did not provide for such a finding. Nebraska Beef declared that, as a consequence of the government's breach, it would not make any of the payments required by the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Nebraska Beef made good on that threat, the government filed this breach-of-contract suit to compel compliance with the settlement agreement. Nebraska Beef counterclaimed for breach of contract and sought declaratory relief. Specifically, Nebraska Beef sought an order releasing it from its obligations under the agreement because the government's statement that its \"investigation found\" wrongdoing was a material breach excusing its nonperformance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nebraska Beef filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and the government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The central question facing the district court was whether the government's press release stating that its investigation found that Nebraska Beef had engaged in illegal employment practices constituted a material breach of the agreement. The district court determined that it did not and ruled in favor of the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court began its analysis by discussing the effect of the recitals and concluded that \"under Nebraska law, recitals are generally understood to be useful insofar as they are able to clarify ambiguous or imprecise portions of an agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It states that \"having 'found' something occurred unequivocally suggests that it did, in fact, occur. An allegation and a finding of fault are entirely different things. The distinction here is amplified when news outlets in turn repeated the DOJ's 'finding' of wrong doing [sic] from the Press Release.\" Appellant's Br. at 10. In support, Nebraska Beef cites Black's Law Dictionary, which defines \"find\" as \"[t]o determine a fact in dispute by verdict or decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Find\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). It also cites a case from the Eastern District of Texas in which the court held it improper for an agency to disqualify contractors from projects based on \"administrative merits determinations\" that were essentially unadjudicated allegations of wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Se. Tex. v. Rung\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-CV-4252016,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208188655\">\n    2016 WL 8188655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 24, 2016). According to Nebraska Beef, these authorities support the proposition that an agency may not claim to have made a finding in the absence of either an admission by the party accused of wrongdoing or some judicial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nebraska Beef also claims that the district court construed the essential purpose of the agreement too narrowly. Though it agrees that avoiding litigation was a motivation\n   for settling the case, Nebraska Beef avers that it\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   sought to avoid any admission of liability. In support, it cites\n   <em>\n    Priem v. Shires\n   </em>\n   , in which a Texas court identified the purpose of a settlement agreement as \"compromising doubtful and disputed claims so as to avoid litigation and buy peace without admitting liability.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9987230\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/697/860/#p864\">\n    697 S.W.2d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 864 (Tex. Ct. App. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The government responds that nothing in the settlement agreement prohibited it from characterizing the settlement as it wished in a press release announcing the agreement. The government is correct. The settlement agreement does not contain any stipulated facts nor an admission by Nebraska Beef that the company violated federal law. However, though the agreement did not explicitly authorize the OSC to state that its investigation found violations, the agreement also\n   <em>\n    did not forbid\n   </em>\n   the OSC from doing so. We find it somewhat troubling for the government to enter into a settlement in which the accused party maintains its innocence yet the government nonetheless declares it found violations of the law. But while conducting litigation and public relations in this fashion may be suspect, it does not materially violate the settlement agreement in a manner that would excuse Nebraska Beef's obligations thereunder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To find a breach, we must first find a promise.\n   <em>\n    Henriksen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2215163\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/263/840/\">\n    643 N.W.2d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the recitals should be considered binding, as the district court concluded, need not be resolved, because nothing in the agreement imposes a duty on either party to do or abstain from anything with regard to how they publicly describe the enforcement action.

Given the recitals and contract language of this Agreement, along with the portrayal of the Agreement by the parties themselves in this litigation, it is axiomatic that the essential purpose of the Agreement was to avoid costly litigation and to avoid admission of liability on the part of Nebraska Beef regarding the conclusion by the OSC that it had \"reasonable cause\" to believe that Nebraska Beef violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court accurately points out that the Agreement did not forbid the OSC from stating that its investigation found violations.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 934-35. However, the OSC\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   under an obligation to describe the Agreement accurately, which Agreement established only that the OSC had \"reasonable cause\" to believe that Nebraska Beef engaged in practices that violated the INA and that Nebraska Beef denied the same. The statement by the OSC in the\n   press release that it \"found\" that the company violated the INA imparts the idea that Nebraska Beef did, indeed, do so, a far cry from a \"reasonable cause\" to believe that a violation occurred. Accordingly, OSC's public statement was a material breach of its duty under the Agreement to accurately notify and educate the public.\n   <em>\n    Siouxland Ethanol, LLC v.

To make a \"finding\" means \"[t]o determine a fact in dispute by verdict or decision.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). There was no such \"finding\" here.
