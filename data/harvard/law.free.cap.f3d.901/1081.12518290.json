The Suns entered into two Share Purchase Agreements, each of which contained a forum-selection clause that required any disputes \"arising out of or related to\" the agreements to be adjudicated in California state court. Notwithstanding the forum-selection clause, the Suns brought suit against Kao under Washington securities law in a Washington district court. The district court concluded that the Suns were bound by the forum-selection clause, and dismissed the action. Because the Suns have not carried their heavy burden of showing the sort of exceptional circumstances that would justify disregarding a forum-selection clause, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Suns' complaint, in December 2010, Kao met with the Suns in Seattle, Washington. Kao told the Suns that she was the President of Advanced China Healthcare, a company formed to provide Western-style medical services (such as sports medicine, pain management, and physical therapy) in China. According to Kao, Advanced China Healthcare had received substantial investor funding as well as all necessary licenses from the Chinese government, and intended to open its first medical center in Shanghai in 2011. Kao made a number of\n   other representations about the status of the project to induce the Suns to invest in Advance China Healthcare's Series B offering. She told the Suns that \"all funds would be used for the development of medical centers in China,\" and stated that a healthcare venture capital fund in Alabama had conducted extensive due diligence on the project and was investing in the Series B offering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While investigating this potential investment, the Suns contacted Robert Claassen, who was a partner in Paul Hastings, LLP, and the head of the corporate department in its Palo Alto, California office. Claassen informed the Suns that Advanced China Healthcare was a good investment in which his firm and he himself had invested, and confirmed that the Alabama venture capital fund had performed extensive due diligence before investing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following these representations, the Suns executed two separate, but identical, Series B Preference Share Purchase Agreements and invested a total of $2.8 million in Advanced China Healthcare. Both agreements included a forum-selection clause, entitled \"Jurisdiction; Venue,\" which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   With respect to any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state courts in Santa Clara County in the State of California (or in the event of exclusive federal jurisdiction, the courts of the Northern District of California).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the closing, which took place in Paul Hastings's Palo Alto office, the Suns sent their funds via a wire transfer to Paul Hastings's account in Los Angeles, California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Suns' complaint, several years after closing, the Suns discovered that Kao had misled them. The Suns alleged that they had been shown fabricated financial records of Advanced China Healthcare. They also alleged that Kao had not used their $2.8 million investment for the development and opening of medical centers, but had converted and misappropriated it for her own use or to cover up her prior misappropriation of other investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Suns sued Kao and Advanced China Healthcare in Washington district court under \u00a7 21.20.430(1) of the Washington State Securities Act (WSSA), which imposes liability on a person who \"sells a security in violation of any provision[ ] of RCW 21.20.010.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2021.20.430\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 21.20.430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Section 21.20.010 makes it unlawful for a person to take certain fraudulent actions in connection with the offer or sale of a security. A \"person who directly or indirectly controls\" such a seller may also be held liable. \u00a7 21.20.430(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On Kao's motion, the district court dismissed the complaint because the Share Purchase Agreements contained a forum-selection clause that applied to the dispute, was valid and enforceable, and required the dispute to be resolved in California. The court conditioned its dismissal on several requirements: Kao had to \"submit to the jurisdiction of the California court in which Plaintiffs file suit, so long as the court is proper under the forum selection clause\"; the statutes of limitations on the Suns' California and Washington state-law claims had to remain tolled for the pendency of the current lawsuit; Kao could not \"argue that California securities laws do not apply to the disputed transaction because\n   it occurred in Washington State\"; and Kao had to waive service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Suns timely appealed, arguing that the forum-selection clause in the Share Purchase Agreements was not enforceable. First, they argue that, as a matter of contract, the forum-selection clause does not apply to their action. Alternatively, they argue that the clause is not valid and enforceable because their action under the WSSA embodies an important public policy that cannot be waived, and California is not an adequate alternative forum because it deprives them of any remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the clause covers \"any disputes ...\n   <em>\n    related to\n   </em>\n   this Agreement,\" it applies to any dispute that has some logical or causal connection to the parties' agreement. Here, the Suns' claim that Kao engaged in various fraudulent practices to induce them to invest $2.8 million in Advanced China Healthcare relates to the Share Purchase Agreements because the Suns invested pursuant to those agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huffington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196514\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/18/\">\n    637 F.3d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding\n   that a forum-selection clause covered state-law securities claims because the plaintiff's purchase of privately offered securities \"could not have been made without the agreement\");\n   <em>\n    Carter's of New Bedford, Inc. v.

Indeed, the Suns' complaint itself alleges that they executed the Share Purchase Agreements \"in reasonable and justifiable reliance on the representations of Kao.\" The Suns argue that their claims do not relate to the Share Purchase Agreements because they are challenging fraudulent conduct that occurred before the agreements were executed by the parties. This argument is belied by the Suns' complaint itself, which alleges that Kao is liable under the WSSA as a seller of securities (or as a person controlling such a seller), which occurred when the Suns entered into the agreements. Because the Suns' dispute is logically connected to the parties' agreements, it is subject to the forum-selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We next consider whether the forum-selection clause is enforceable. \"[T]he appropriate way to enforce a forum-selection clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\"\n   <em>\n    Atl.
