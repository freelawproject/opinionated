(\"Wells Fargo\") on behalf of a putative class, alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of Title VII and the Iowa Civil Rights Act. They seek reversal of the district court's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   grant of summary judgment in favor of Wells Fargo. Specifically, the appellants argue that the court erred in concluding that they failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact. They also challenge the magistrate judge's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   order granting in part and denying in part their Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) motion seeking additional time for discovery. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Federal law bars \"any person who has been convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or a breach of trust\" from becoming or continuing as an employee of any institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201829\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). More commonly known as Section 19, the statute does not consider the age of the convictions when applying the employment bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201829\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1829(2)(A). In other words, an individual with a one-month-old disqualifying conviction is equally barred from FDIC-institution employment as a person with a thirty-year-old conviction. Violations of Section 19 can result in daily fines of up to $1,000,000 per day, five years' imprisonment, or both.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201829\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1829(b). Disqualified persons may apply for employment waivers with the FDIC. Banking institutions wishing to hire-or to continue to employ-Section 19-disqualified individuals also may sponsor waiver applications. No disqualified individual may begin or continue employment with the FDIC-insured institutions until after obtaining a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wells Fargo is an FDIC-insured bank. Job applicants to Wells Fargo are required to answer whether they had a conviction of a crime involving dishonesty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Starting in 2010, Wells Fargo instituted a fingerprint-based background check for its current and potential employees. The background\n   check returns all criminal convictions, regardless of the age of the crime. In 2012, Wells Fargo re-screened its entire Home Mortgage division. Wells Fargo asked its employees for authorization to re-screen and again asked the employees to answer whether they had convictions involving crimes of dishonesty. The bank then terminated the Home Mortgage employees verified to have Section 19 disqualifications. Wells Fargo did not inform the terminated employees of the availability of Section 19 waivers, and it did not offer to sponsor waivers for any individual. Between December 2011 and March 2013, Wells Fargo terminated at least 136 African Americans, 56 Latinos, and 28 white employees because of Section 19 disqualifications. Between February 2013 and November 2015, Wells Fargo also withdrew at least 1,350 conditional job offers to African Americans and Latinos and 354 non-minorities after the background check revealed these individuals had disqualifying convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The appellants sued, alleging race-based employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as violations under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. They alleged that Wells Fargo's policy of summarily terminating or withdrawing offers of employment to any individual with a Section 19 disqualification discriminated against them. Prior to merits discovery, Wells Fargo moved for summary judgment. The appellants filed a motion requesting additional time to conduct discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), and the magistrate judge partially granted and partially denied the motion. The district court then granted summary judgment to Wells Fargo, concluding that the appellants failed to establish a prima facie case under any theory of employment discrimination pursuant to either federal or state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The appellants now contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Wells Fargo, arguing that the district court misapplied disparate-impact law. Additionally, they challenge the magistrate judge's ruling on their Rule 56(d) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Title VII Disparate Impact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ultimately, at issue in this case is whether the appellants had established a prima facie case of Title VII disparate impact, and if they had, whether Wells Fargo failed to show a business necessity defense. The appellants contend that Wells Fargo refused to adopt the alternative practices of giving advance notice of the need for a waiver, granting leave to seek a waiver, and providing direct sponsorship of a waiver. They argue that Wells Fargo sometimes took these steps, and that if the company had done so uniformly, then the alternative practice would have reduced the disparate impact caused by the summary exclusions.

But other than the assertion, the appellants present insufficient evidence or statistics showing that these alternative practices would have reduced the disparate impact on people of color. The appellants present statistics showing that the FDIC's waiver approval rate can reach nearly 100 percent, especially when sponsored by the employer. However, the data does not advance the appellants' argument. The appellants point to publicly available data showing a 99 percent\n   <em>\n    fully adjudicated\n   </em>\n   waiver approval rate. But they fail to note that the FDIC regularly declines to approve applications by terminating the waiver process, unless a waiver applicant specifically requests a public denial. Taking these withdrawals into account, the FDIC waiver approval percentage is approximately 57 percent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. at 9. Further, while sponsored waivers may fare better, the appellants also present no data that the sponsored waivers ameliorated racial disparity.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.
