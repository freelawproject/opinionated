Because we agree with the district court that the awards exceeded the scope of the Arbitrator\u2019s authority, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">The facts, as found by the Arbitrator, are undisputed. In July 1992 the Madison Hotel (Hotel) eliminated its food service bus positions and shifted bus responsibilities to its waiters. The Union, which represented a bargaining unit that included the Hotel\u2019s waiters and bus employees, filed a grievance on behalf of the laid-off employees. On July 24,1992 the grievance was submitted to arbitration pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">On January 2,1994 the Arbitrator issued a decision in favor of the grievants. In the decision the Arbitrator framed the \u201cissue\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-18\">Whether the Hotel violated the Agreement by its abolishment of the Bus Employee position, its transfer of the duties of the Bus Employees to other positions and its layoff of the Grievants in July 1992 and, if so, what is the appropriate remedy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKa\">JA 19. The Arbitrator balanced the Hotel\u2019s management rights under the collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against \u201cthose provisions which are of great importance to the employees who have worked at the Hotel for many years, i.e. provisions which afford employees rights in the matters of seniority, classification, layoff projections, retention of seniority following a layoff, etc,\u201d JA 32.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He concluded: \u201cFor the Hotel to take the drastic action of not just laying off employees during the period of slack business, as contemplated by the Agreement, but to instead completely eliminate their positions and reassign substantially all of their remaining duties to another position, the Hotel must demonstrate a legitimate business reason, i.e., a reason beyond mere \u2018slackness of business,\u2019\u201d a showing he determined the Hotel had not made. JA 32. Accordingly, the Arbitrator ordered the following remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-19\">The Hotel is directed to reinstate the Grievants to their former positions and to make them whole for all losses, including seniority, attributable to their improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>layoff. Pursuant to the Parties [sic] agreement to bifurcate this proceeding, the Parties are directed to attempt to resolve this matter and, if unsuccessful, either Party may return this matter to the Arbitrator for further proceedings with respect to the remedial aspects only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">JA 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">When it turned out that none of the grieving bus employees desired reinstatement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Hotel took the position that the dispute was at an end while the Union insisted that the Arbitrator\u2019s award required that the bus positions be reestablished and filled by new employees. On December 14, 1994 the Union wrote the Arbitrator requesting \u201cclarification\u201d of the matter. After receiving a response from the Hotel, the Arbitrator decided by letter dated February 6, 1995 that, despite the mootness of the bus employees\u2019 grievance, the Hotel was required to reestablish the positions because his original decision treated the abolition of positions and the layoff of the grievants as separate elements in both the statement of the \u201cissue,\u201d which characterized them as distinct violations of the agreement, and the remedy, which \u201cnecessarily\u201d contemplated that the positions be reestablished before the employee grievants were reinstated. The Arbitrator then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">At the point of offering each identified Grievant reinstatement to the restored Bus Employee positions, if any such offer to fill one of these restored positions is not accepted by a Grievant, such restored position becomes a vacancy subject to being filled in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Agreement. A restored position cannot be eliminated solely because a Grievant elected not to accept the offer to be reinstated in such position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAV\">JA39.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">On April 18,1995 the Union filed an action in the district court to enforce the Arbitrator\u2019s award. On February 13, 1996 the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction, concluding it was \u201cnot ripe for adjudication\u201d because the Arbitrator had \u201cnot issued a final remedial order.\u201d 955 F.Supp. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">On June. 6, 1996 the Arbitrator issued a final remedial order, reaching the same conclusion as he had in the February 6, 1995 letter. The Arbitrator again asserted that his statement of the \u201cissue\u201d in his original (January 2, 1994) decision treated separately the. abolition of positions and. the layoff of the grievants. He then characterized the original remedy as \u201can attempt to recreate the <em>status quo ante </em>the Hotel\u2019s violation of the Agreement,\u201d namely \u201crestaurant and Room Service facilities which operated with Bus Employees,\u201d JA 48, and observed that \u201cthe Hotel never has returned to the <em>status quo ante,\u201d </em>JA 49. The Arbitrator determined that his original decision had \u201cnecessarily found that the bargaining unit employees generally, as well as the specific individuals who filed the grievance, have a seniority right to have as many positions in the bargaining unit as possible in which to bump in the event of an economic layoff pursuant to the provisions of Article 12, Section 12.2(a)\u201d of the collective bargaining agreement. JA 48. According to the Arbitrator, \u201c[t]he Union, as the representative of all of the unit employees, has an interest in protecting the seniority rights of all of the unit employees and preserved its right to do so in this case by raising in this grievance the issue of the abolishment of the classification as well as the layoff of the particular Grievants.\u201d JA 48. Finally, the Arbitrator stated: \u201cThe Hotel ... has not identified any \u2018changed circumstances\u2019, other than th\u00e9 passage of time, nor has the Hotel identified any legitimate business reasons which occurred since the classifications improperly were abolished which after-the violation business reasons, arguably, would mitigate against a remedial order requiring the Hotel to reinstate the classification and to fill it until such time as the Hotel has a proper justification for abolishing it.\u201d JA 49. The Arbitrator then issued the following final award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">The Hotel is directed to reinstate the Bus Employee classification for its restaurant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>outlets and for its Room Service operations and to fill the number of Bus Employee positions in each area which existed at the time of the layoff and to operate with such Bus Employee classifications until it can demonstrate an appropriate basis, under the Agreement, to abolish such positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqN\">JA 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">On June 20, 1996 the Hotel filed an action to vacate the Arbitrator\u2019s award and the Union counterclaimed for enforcement. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted' judgment in the Hotel\u2019s favor on December 17, 1996, concluding that the Arbitrator \u201cexceeded the scope of his jurisdiction, both by deviating from the issues submitted for arbitration and by issuing an award that does not draw its essence from the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>Madison Hotel v. Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees Local 25, </em>955 F.Supp. 1, 3 (D.D.C.1996). The Union appeals the judgment. We conclude that the district court correctly held the Arbitrator\u2019s final award went beyond the scope of his authority, which was limited to arbitrating the laid-off bus employees\u2019 grievance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The \u201cscope of review of an arbitrator\u2019s award interpreting a collective bargaining agreement is extremely narrow.\u201d <em>American Postal Workers Union v. United States Postal Serv., </em>52 F.3d 359, 361 (D.C.Cir.1995) (citing <em>United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 567, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1346, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960); <em>United Steelworkers of America v.

National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, </em>810 F.2d 1239, 1241 (D.C.Cir. 1987) (quoting <em>Northwest Airlines v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>808 F.2d 76, 78 (D.C.Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1014, 108 S.Ct. 1751, 100 L.Ed.2d 213 (1988)). Nevertheless, \u201c\u2018arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u2019 \u201d <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, </em>475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 1418, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf, </em>363 U.S. at 582, 80 S.Ct. at 1353); see <em>Davis v. Chevy Chase Fin. Ltd., </em>667 F.2d 160, 165 (D.C.Cir.1981) (citing <em>United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf, </em>363 U.S. at 582, 80 S.Ct. at 1352-53) (\u201c[A]rbitration is, however, a matter of contract, and the contours of the arbitrator\u2019s authority in a given case are determined by reference to the arbitral agreement.\u201d). Thus, \u201c[t]here is no duty to arbitrate matters not subject to the arbitration agreement, and no authority on the part of arbitrators to consider matters not necessary to the resolution of disputes actually submitted.\u201d <em>Williams v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>753 F.2d 117, 119 (D.C.Cir.1985) (citing <em>Davis, </em>667 F.2d at 165). \u201cIn determining the scope of an arbitrator\u2019s authority we look to two sources: the collective bargaining agreement, and the submission of the parties to the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, Local 35 v. Washington Post Co., </em>442 F.2d 1234, 1236 (D.C.Cir.1971); <em>see also Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019 Warehouse, Inc. v. Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019 Warehouse Indep. Truck Drivers Union, Local No. 1, </em>611 F.2d 580, 584 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cHowever, once the parties have gone beyond their promise to arbitrate and have actually submitted an issue to an arbiter, we must look both to their contract and to the submission of the issue to the arbitrator to determine his authority.\u201d). Accordingly, we now examine the arbitration provisions in the collective bargaining agreement and the grievance as submitted by the Union to the Arbitrator to determine the intended scope of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>We first consider the parties\u2019 agreement. \u201c[T]he question of arbitrability \u2014 whether a collective-bargaining agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate the particular grievance \u2014 is undeniably an issue for judicial determination. Unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.\u201d <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, </em>475 U.S. at 649, 106 S.Ct. at 1418. The agreement here provided only very generally for arbitration of \u201ca grievance or misunderstanding arising] out of and during the term of [the] agreement\u201d provided the grievance is not first resolved by the \u201cjoint grievance subcommittee.\u201d Collective Bargaining Agreement \u00a7 17.1 (filed July 9, 1996 in district court as attachment 1 to defendant\u2019s Answer &amp; Counterclaim). The issue the Arbitrator ultimately resolved below \u2014 whether the Union or its <em>non-busing </em>members have a right to reestablishment of the bus positions \u2014 seems to come within the broad class of subjects arbitrable under the agreement. We must next look at the grievance as submitted by the parties to the Arbitrator to determine how it further limits the scope of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The Union commenced the arbitration on July 24, 1992, filing with the Arbitrator a letter addressed to the Hotel\u2019s Managing Director which stated that the Union was \u201copposing and taking to arbitration <em>the action taken </em>by your establishment <em>against the above captioned employee.\u201d </em>Arbitration Letter (filed Sept. 12, 1997) (emphasis added.) The caption identified the grievant \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cBus employees/Local 25 members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the letter manifests that the grievance was taken to arbitration only on behalf of the bus employees in Local 25 and not on behalf of the Union itself or of non-bus employees, as the district court concluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The Union contends the letter is irrelevant because it is an \u201cinformal\u201d document largely ignored by the parties themselves. The Arbitrator, however, apparently considered the letter of significance, describing the nature of the grievance by reference to it and noting in the first sentence of his original decision that its filing on July 24, 1992 was \u201con behalf of\u2019 each of the individually named- grieving bus employees. JA 18. Nevertheless, even without the letter we would be bound to conclude, based on the Arbitrator\u2019s decisions, that arbitration was sought on behalf of the. named individual grievant bus, employees only and that its scope was limited thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">If there is in fact no written submission to the Arbitrator specifying the issue to be resolved, the scope of arbitration must be determined from the conduct of the parties. <em>Matteson v. Ryder Sys. Inc., </em>99 F.3d 108, 114 (3d Cir.1996); <em>International Chem. Workers Union, Local No. 566 v. Mobay Chem. Corp., </em>755 F.2d 1107, 1110 (4th Cir.1985); <em>Ficek v. Southern Pac. Co., </em>338 F.2d 655, 656 (9th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 988, 85 S.Ct. 1362, 14 L.Ed.2d 280. Here the parties\u2019 conduct in pursuing the arbitration, insofar as it is discernible from the Arbitrator\u2019s determinations, manifests an intent, at least at the time of the submission and original hearing, to limit arbitration to a resolution of the individual grievants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The Arbitrator\u2019s original decision plainly recites that the grievance was \u201cfiled ... on behalf of\u2019 the eight named grievants, as we noted above, and that each grievant \u201cwas employed as a Bus- Employee at the Madison Hotel.\u201d JA 18. In the decision the Arbitrator identified the abolition of positions and the layoffs (as well 'as the transfer of duties) as a single \u201cissue\u201d for which he needed to ascertain a single \u201cappropriate remedy,\u201d JA 19. He resolved the issue by recourse to the reasonable expectation of a classification\u2019s <em>laid-off </em>employees\u2019 (here the bus employees) .that they would be recalled when business improved and the frustration of the expectation \u201cif the classifications completely are eliminated at the time of the layoff.\u201d JA 33. Significantly, however, the decision made no mention of the rights or expectations of employees in other classifications not subject to layoff and elimination, such as the non-bus unit employees here on whose rights the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Arbitrator based his determination in his final remedial order that the remedy remained in force despite the departure of all of the grieving bus employees. Finally, the remedy the Arbitrator originally fashioned simply directed the Hotel \u201cto reinstate <em>the Grievants </em>to their former positions and to make them whole for all losses, including seniority, attributable to theit improper layoff.\u201d JA 36 (emphasis added). In short the entire focus of the decision was the grievance of the laid-off bus employees. Nothing in the original decision suggests that the Arbitrator or the parties intended the arbitration to extend beyond settling that grievance and fashioning a remedy, if appropriate, for the grievants.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Despite the undisputed and limited scope of his original decision, the Arbitrator purported to construe its language <em>post hoc </em>to expand the arbitration to encompass the relief granted in his final award. As noted above, he reinterpreted the statement of issue in the original decision to make reestablishment of busing positions and layoff of the grievants separate issues. In addition, the Arbitrator\u2019s February 6, 1995 letter decision concluded that the original remedy \u201cnecessarily intended that the Hotel reinstate the Bus Employee classification for the requisite number of positions equivalent to the number of Bus Employee positions which existed before the improper elimination of the classification and the subsequent layoff of the incumbent Bus Employees.\u201d JA 39. The June 6, 1996 final order went further and, as we stated earlier, characterized the original decision as having \u201cnecessarily found\u201d that \u201cthe bargaining unit employees generally\u201d'\u2014 not only the laid-off bus employees on whose behalf the grievance was. expressly brought \u2014 had seniority rights in the abolished positions and that the Union, \u201cas the representative of all of the unit employees,\u201d had an interest in protecting those rights through arbitration. JA 48. This broad construction of the arbitration\u2019s scope is at odds with the Arbitrator\u2019s original view that it was limited to the bus employees\u2019 grievance \u2014 a view he acknowledged in his later two decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">In his February 6,1995 letter, the Arbitrator expressly recognized that \u201c[t]he remedy set1 forth \u25a0\u25a0in the [January 2, 1994] Opinion contemplated reinstatement of, and a make whole award to, the identified Grievants <em>only. </em>\u201d JA 39 (emphasis in original). In the same letter the Arbitrator also confirmed that the intent of the .parties to the arbitration had been to provide a remedy for the grievant employees alone. <em>See </em>JA 39 (\u201c[N]othing in this Arbitration proceeding raised, or was intended to resolve, any issue with respect to any potential remedy to any individuals other than the identified Grievants.\u201d). JA 39. Similarly, in his June 6, 1996 order, the Arbitrator acknowledged that \u201cin finding the violation, [he] balanced Management\u2019s right to manage, including the right to determine staffing, against <em>the Grievants\u2019 </em>seniority rights,\u201d not the rights of other employees. JA 48 (emphasis added). It is clear, then, that .throughout the proceeding the Arbitrator adhered to the view that he and the parties conducted the arbitration, at least up through the time of the original award, as limited to resolving the grievance filed on behalf of the laid-off bus employees. Given his undisputed perception of the arbitration\u2019s limited scope at the time of the initial award, we cannot credit the Arbitrator\u2019s subsequent usurpation of authority to arbitrate the rights of non-bus (non-grieving) employees, and through them of the Union itself, and to issue a remedy for the breach of those rights. Such a remedy necessarily exceeds the scope of the arbitration brought and maintained on behalf of the laid off bus employees, as the Arbitrator himself perceived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">We are aware that an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the ' scope of the submission generally receives the same deference accorded his interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.\u2019- <em>See El Dorado Technical Servs., Inc. v. Union General De Trabajadores de P.R., </em>961 F.2d 317, 321 (1st Cir.1992); <em>Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.R. v.

And we have, accordingly, accepted the Arbitrator\u2019s original view, as he consistently characterized it throughout, that the arbitration was brought on behalf of and to provide a remedy for the named -grievants only \u2014 a view that accords with the text of the submission letter and which we must assume reflects the intent of the parties as expressed in their briefs and at the hearing. \u201cJudicial deference to arbitration, however, does not grant carte blanche approval to any decision an arbitrator might make.\u201d <em>Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019 Warehouse, Inc., </em>611 F.2d at 583. \u201c[T]he courts are neither entitled nor encouraged simply to \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 the interpretations and decisions of arbitrators.\u201d <em>Matteson, </em>99 F.3d at 113. They can and do decline enforcement of awards if an arbitrator exceeds his authority by arbitrating issues not submitted by the parties. <em>See, e.g., Matteson, </em>99 F.3d at 113-15; <em>Hardin\u2019s Bakery, Inc. v. Retail, Wholesale, &amp; Dep\u2019t Store Union, </em>877 F.2d 1541, 1544-45 (11th Cir.1989); <em>John Morrell &amp; Co. v.

Chevy Chase Fin. Ltd., </em>667 F.2d 160, 164-68 (D.C.Cir.1981) (holding that arbitrator exceeded authority under limited arbitration clause in employment contract). We do so here. We cannot defer to the Arbitrator\u2019s ultimate assertion that the arbitration encompassed the abolition of the classification apart from the rights of the named grievants and that his original award \u201cnecessarily\u201d contemplated remedies for non-grievants. The Arbitrator\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>position cannot be \u201crationally derived\u201d from his contemporaneous view of the parties\u2019 submission as limited to the grievants\u2019 rights and remedies. <em>See Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac </em>R.R., 973 F.2d at 280; <em>High Concrete Structures, </em>879 F.2d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Because the Arbitrator exceeded the arbitral authority conferred by the parties, the judgment of the district court vacating the February 6, 1995 and June 6, 1996 arbitral awards is</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-14\">.

Because we affirm on this ground we need not address the district court's alternative holding, that the award did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.

Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEDB\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">My colleagues believe the arbitrator\u2019s remedy \u2014 the hotel shall restore the classification it unilaterally abolished \u2014 was outside the scope of the arbitration. In support, they point to the union\u2019s letter starting the arbitration, and to the arbitrator\u2019s initial opinion. I have five points in opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">First, the union\u2019s letter signaling the beginning of arbitration tells us nothing of particular significance. It states that \u201cpursuant to our collective bargaining agreement,\u201d the union \u201cis opposing and taking to arbitration the action taken by your establishment against the above-captioned <em>employee.\u201d </em>Letter from Richardson to Jacques of 7/24/92, at 1 (italics added). Now we know that the grievance was not just for one employee, so right from the start the letter loses any claim to being the definitive guide to the scope of the arbitration that eventually followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Little wonder then that the union treats its letter as unimportant. The hotel did so too, and said as much at oral argument. The letter was not before the district court, it was not part of the record before us, and when my colleagues asked for a copy during argument, the parties were not at all sure they could find one.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">The complaint, according to the union\u2019s letter, is merely \u201cImproper Layoff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no elaboration, no citation' to -any part of the labor contract, nothing. How then can one say on the basis' of this letter that the arbitrator misinterpreted the scope of the issues? The arbitrator listened to the parties, he read their submissions, he heard their evidence. And he presumably knew the customary manner in which union and management treat such informal proceedings. We decidedly do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Second, considerations such as those just mentioned are partly behind the settled law that an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the issues submitted to him for arbitration gets the same deep judicial bow as an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>See, e.g., Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n Local Union No. 859 v. Madison Indus., </em>84 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.1996); <em>El Dorado Technical Servs. v. Union General De Trabajadores de Puerto Rico, </em>961 F.2d 317, 321 (1st Cir.1992); <em>Lattimer-Stevens Co. v. United Steelworkers of America, Dist. 27, Sub-Dist. 5, </em>913 F.2d 1166, 1170 (6th Cir.1990); <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Independent Oil Workers Union, </em>679 F.2d 299, 302 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Waverly Mineral Products v. United Steelworkers of America Local No. 8290, </em>633 F.2d 682, 685-86 (5th Cir.1980). This rule of deference also rests on federal labor policy, judicial economy, and the Supreme Court\u2019s directive that \u201cwhen the subject matter of a dispute, is arbitrable, \u2018procedural\u2019 questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are to be left to the arbitrator.\u201d <em>United Paper-workers Int\u2019l Union v. Misco, </em>484 U.S. 29, 40, 108 S.Ct. 364, 372, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987) (citing <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S.Ct. 909, 918, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">If an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation gets the \u201cgreatest deference imaginable,\u201d <em>Utility Workers Union of America, Local 246, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, </em>39 F.3d 1210, 1216 (D.C.Cir. 1994), I see no plausible ground for setting aside this arbitrator\u2019s view of what was before him. Certainly the grievance letter cannot shoulder such a heavy load.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Which brings me to my third point. All indications point in favor of the arbitrator\u2019s version of the scope of this arbitration. Even if we were on a level, no-deference playing field, I would find the .arbitrator\u2019s view far more,persuasive than the majority opinion\u2019s. , Consider the context. The hotel did two things: it announced an across-the-board layoff of-its bus employees and it abolished the bus classification. Both of the hotel\u2019s actions were therefore in play.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The \u201con behalf of\u2019 language \u2014 viewed by my colleagues and the district judge as critical \u2014 comes from the first paragraph of the arbitrator\u2019s initial opinion. Now, it seems to me the person best situated to pronounce on the import of those words is not a judge, but the arbitrator who wrote them. And here is what the arbitrator thought. From the second paragraph of his opinion onward, the arbitrator treats the hotel\u2019s unilateral abolishment of the bus employee position as a chief topic of dispute between the parties. This is compelling evidence of what the parties believed they were arbitrating. A court cannot rightly claim to be giving deference to an arbitrator when it reaches out so far to overturn him.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">My fourth point is that to restrict the scope of arbitration to the union\u2019s opening grievance letter is to adopt a formal arbitration pleading requirement, judicially monitored \u2014 something like, \u201cThe scope of the union\u2019s first letter defines the scope of the arbitration.\u201d Yet I had thought informality was one of the hallmarks of this sort of nonjudicial dispute resolution. The approach my colleagues adopt, if it were to have any lasting impact (I cannot imagine that it will), means that no longer will the arbitrator hear the parties out, consider the evidence they wish to present, and make a considered determination of the scope of the issues before him. Instead he will examine only the initial grievance letter, much in the manner of a common law judge in Blackstone\u2019s time. Such a regime, I can say with no exaggeration, flies in the face of, contradicts, deviates from, upsets, disregards, conflicts with, tosses aside, ignores and repudiates a large portion of the law of labor arbitration from the <em>Steelworkers Trilogy </em>on down.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Indeed, such a regime would impose upon arbitration practice procedural requirements even stricter than the more formal rules governing the trial of a federal civil case. Consider Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b): \u201cWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\u201d Here the union and the hotel \u201ctried\u201d the issue of the classification abolishment and the arbitrator issued his findings and conclusions about that issue in his initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>award. And so, if this had been a district court case, the union\u2019s grievance letter \u2014 its \u201ccomplaint\u201d \u2014 would be deemed to have raised that issue. It is utterly incomprehensible that arbitration proceedings should be more regimented.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">This brings me to my fifth and final point. My colleagues say that the arbitrator\u2019s remedy of restoring the bus classification fell outside' the issues the parties arbitrated and came about only <em>\u201cpost hoc.\u201d </em>This is doubly mistaken. In his initial award the arbitrator held, for instance, that \u201cthe Hotel violated the layoff, seniority and classification provisions of the Agreement ... insofar- as it eliminated completely the Bus Employee classification, laid off all of the Bus Employees and transferred the substantial remaining Bus Employee duties to the Waiters .... Consequently, the Hotel is directed to restore the Bus Employee position, to reinstate the laid off Bus Employees and to make them whole for all losses attributable to the improper layoff.\u201d J.A. 31. Having found, as an initial matter, that the hotel violated the contract by eliminating the classification, the arbitrator simply followed elementary logic in ordering the hotel to restore the classification. It is an old rule that the scope of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The majority\u2019s other error is in supposing that the arbitrator\u2019s rulings after his initial award may be dismissed as merely <em>\u201cpost hoc.\u201d </em>After the initial decision, the parties returned to the arbitrator for clarification. Parties sometimes do the same thing in this court. The arbitrator issued an opinion stating that the bus classification had to be restored. Even then the district court did not think the arbitration proceedings had ended and so, at the district court\u2019s direction, the parties' returned to the arbitrator again for a final ruling and again the arbitrator ordered the hotel to restore the classification. The majority\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>rationale thus embodies a legal principle \u2014 whatever the arbitrator says first in the course of ongoing arbitration proceedings is all that counts. There is probably no need to point out that in all the annals of arbitration law, this marks the first appearance of such \u25a0 a legal principle. If there is something, anything to be said in favor of it, the majority has neglected to enlighten us.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
