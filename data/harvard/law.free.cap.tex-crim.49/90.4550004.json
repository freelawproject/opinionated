It will be noted in this connection that article 851 (chap. 7), Penal Code, defines the substantive offense of breaking and entering a \u201crailroad car,\u201d with intent to commit a felony, fixing the punishment for such offense at confinement in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years. This article, as to the means used in making the entry, refers to article 838, which defines burglary. The substantive offense is found in a separate chapter from that relating to burglary, and refers to the entry by means of breaking any \u201cvessel, steamboat, or railroad car.\u201d None of these are fixtures, but are movables; and evidently the Legislature believed they were not included in the term \u201chouse\u201d as defined in the chapter on burglary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In the chapter on burglary we find article 849 makes penal an attempt to commit the crime of burglary. This is in the chapter on burglary. There is no such article in chapter seven, relating to the breaking and entry of vessels, steamboats or railroad ears. The entry into such convej^ances is not made in terms, or defined to be burglary. ' We hold that it. is no offense to \"attempt\u201d to break and enter a \"railroad car,\u201d the same not having been made such or defined by our statute. Inasmuch as this is not an offense against our law, it is not necessary to discuss the validity of the indictment, which appears to treat a \u201cboxcar\u201d of a railroad company as a \u201chouse,\u201d\u2014referring to the same as \"said house.\u201d For the error discussed, the judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\n<em>.Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
