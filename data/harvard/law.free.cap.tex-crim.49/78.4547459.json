Defendant asked deceased to get out and look in the mail box, that he was looking for a letter, or a note there for some party, he agreed to leave him a letter that day, and that he was feeling very bad and sick and did not feel like getting out; and that deceased got out and went to the mail box when defendant began shooting.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-14\">One of the State\u2019s witnesses, among other things, testified to the homicide as follows: \u201cThe first I saw was the defendant standing in his wagon, facing eastwards with his pistol in his hand pointing eastward, and I heard the report of a pistol and then the next I saw was deceased, he looked like to me, he was either running or backing. There was a mail box there nearby * * * . The wagon was stopped and defendant was standing in the wagon * * * . I looked from the deceased back to defendant and when I looked back to deceased I did not see him any more, I suppose he had fallen; and then I looked at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>defendant and he had jumped out of the wagon and ran back a piece, it must have been half way to the gate * * * . He ran east and stopped and fired two shots; I heard three shots fired in all * * * . He han back to the wagon, got into it and drove off in a gallop.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">The evidence is very voluminous, showing that defendant and deceased were brothers-in-law; that they had some litigation between them and bitter feeling resulted. Defendant testified of some previous difficulty between him and deceased, and the wife of deceased testified to threats of violence and language indicating that deceased was likely to attack defendant. Defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense in the difficulty with deceased who was the superior in strength. The above statement with that contained in the opinion elucidates the points at issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-8\"><em>Young Adams, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai_\">On question of dying declaration: 10 Am. and Eng.

Several objections were urged. The court heard the testimony of Mrs. George Peede, Dock Phillips, Dock Hudson and Chip Keasonover, wherein the State was attempting to lay the predicate for the introduction of the dying declarations. On exception being taken, the testimony was excluded. Subsequently, in a second attempt to introduce the dying declaration, Tom Demasters was used as a witness. On this statement of Demasters, the dying declaration was admitted, to wit: Keath turned over and made this statement, \u201cI believe I am fatally shot.\u201d The conversations occurring between the witnesses, except Demasters, was some hours prior to deceased\u2019s statement to Tom Demasters. The purported dying declaration was made the following day, at about 5 o\u2019clock in the evening. The statement to Demasters was made about 11 o\u2019clock at night prior to said dying declaration. The time intervening being from 11 o\u2019clock at night, until 5 o\u2019clock the next evening. The contention here is made that the proper predicate was not laid. In order to authorize the introduction in evidence of the dying declaration it is incumbent on the State to prove (1) that the deceased when he made it, was conscious of approaching death, and believed there was no hope of his recovery; (2) that the declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>was voluntarily made, and not through the persuasion of any person; (3) that it was not made in answer to interrogatories calculated to lead deceased to make any particular statement; and (4) that deceased was of sane mind at the time of making the declaration. The only evidence that was introduced as a means of justifying the introduction of the statement of deceased was through Tom Demasters to wit: \u201cI believe I am fatally shot.\u201d This did not exclude the hope of recovery; nor does it show that he was conscious of approaching death, in the sense in which this statute means approaching death. Of course every man knows, as a matter of fact, that ultimately he must die, and the fact that he may state a belief of the fact, does not show, within the meaning of our statute with reference to dying declarations, a consciousness of approaching death. The predicate must exclude hope of life. It must reach the point of a certainty in the mind of declarant that all hope of recovery is gone, and that he is conscious of then approaching death, and in his mind it must be the inevitable result. Of course, the fact is in the record that deceased was dangerously shot, but he had stated to the physician and others who endeavored to have him make a statement, that he had some hope of recovery. Ledbetter v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 247; Ex parte Meyers, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 204; 10 Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 2nd ed., p. 364, et seq. Page 366 of the cited volume contains this language: \u201cTo render such declarations admissible, the declarant must not only believe that he is about to die, but he must be without hope.\u201d Further, \u201cAccording to the clear preponderance of authority, if the deceased had the slightest hope of recovery when the declarations were made, they were inadmissible.\u201d The words of our statute, \u201clost all hope of recovery,\u201d means that it is a belief in death which does exclude any hope of recovery. The rule may be summed up, as found on page 368, of the same work, \u201cThat the belief declarant may ultimately die from his injuries is not sufficient.\u201d 41 Texas, 496. And it it has been held in Hunnicutt\u2019s case, 18 Texas Crim. App., 498, that the declarant must be in extremis, and under the solemn conviction that he is bound to die, and that all hope of recovery is eliminated from his mind. Only two hours before deceased in this case should have made the statement to Tom Demasters, one of the doctors told him that he thought he was bound to die, and the other asked him if he realized how mortally wounded he was. Studying over the question a moment, deceased replied, \u201cI do not know that I do.\u201d The doctors continuously held out to him encouragement during their treatment of him. We therefore hold, under this record that which purports to be the dying declaration was inadmissible. For a case strongly in point see Ledbetter v. State, supra. All of the authorities, so far as we are aware in our State, construe our statute to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Again, exception was reserved to some of the statements of the deceased as not being dying declarations, even if the predicate had been laid. We believe this contention is correct. Even had the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>predicate been laid, all these statements not with reference to the death and cause of death, should have been excluded. With reference to this particular question the rule has been long as we understand thoroughly settled, that dying declarations can only be admissible, \u201cwhere the death of the deceased is the subject of the charge, and the circumstances of the death are the subject of the dying declarations.\u201d There are some further exceptions in regard to the impeachment of the dying declaration, and the failure of the charge to .limit the introduction and rejection of other testimony, which we deem unnecessary to discuss, as the dying declaration under the predicate was not admissible. Therefore, the other questions pass out, as they are but cgrollaries to the main proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Shortly after the difficulty, and within four to six minutes, appellant made a statement to his father, which was excluded. He reached his father\u2019s front gate, from four to six minutes after the shooting. His horses were running almost at break-neck speed, appellant was greatly excited, and was immediately asked by his father what was the matter. The reply was that he had trouble with Ed Keith, and that Ed Keith had struck him, and threw a rock at him, and tried to pull him out of his wagon, and that he (Keith) was going to kill him, and that he had to shoot him. We think this testimony was admissible. Craig v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 619; Scott v. State, 10 Texas Ct. Rep., 928; Freeman v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 545, and collated authorities. This was res gestae under the authorities of our State, and under the circumstances it was proper to have admitted it. It would have also been admissible under another theory, as corroborative of appellant\u2019s statement on the stand as a witness, he having been impeached by statements at variance with his statement on the stand. The statement to his father was practically the same as that of his testimony on the trial. However, we are of opinion that it was admissible as res gestae, and therefore original testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">For the errors discussed, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
