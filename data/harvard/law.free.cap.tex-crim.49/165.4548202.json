The evidence shows that proscutrix gave birth to a child. The testimony for the State shows that at the time of the rape prosecutrix was 14 years of age. We have heretofore held that where the corpus delicti is proven, a confession is of sufficient cogency to connect the party making the confession with the murder; and therefore sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Gallegos v. State, 12 Texas Ct. Rep., 792; Attaway v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 403. We think the evidence, in addition to the above, shows a certain character of association of prosecutrix with defendant. Upon one occasion her mother on returning home, found appellant talking to prosecutrix.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b186-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>[Motion for rehearing overruled without written opinion.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The record contains various bills of exceptions, but under the qualifications and statements of the court, we do not think any of them present any error requiring a reversal, or that require us to review them.
