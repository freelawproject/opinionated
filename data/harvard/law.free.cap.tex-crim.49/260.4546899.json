It was tried before the court without a jury. Judgment was entered against him for $25. The evidence shows that appellant had rented the house and was living in it as a private residence. The facts further show that there was a good deal of playing in the house with dice, and cogently show that the game was a banking game. He was not charged with exhibiting a banking game, so that passes out of the case, and a conviction could not be had on that theory. As the evidence shows that the house. was a private residence he could not be punished for playing dice, as it is not a violation of the law to play games of dice at a private residence under our statute. We deem it unnecessary to go into a discussion of the matter as the record is presented as above stated. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded. .</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
