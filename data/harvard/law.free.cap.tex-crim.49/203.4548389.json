Writ of habeas corpus was resorted to for the purpose of reduction of the bail. In the trial the court reduced the bail in one case to $300, and the remaining six to $200. each. It is made to appear that appellant was unable to give the amount fixed, but could give bond in about $100 in each ease. This ease is practically the same as that of Ex parte Henry Finn, decided at the recent Tyler Term, 1905. Without entering further into a discussion of it, we refer to that case as authority for reducing the bail to $100 in each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>case mentioned in this record. Upon giving said bond, in accordance with the law, the sheriff will release relator from custody. The judgment is reversed and bail fixed at $100 in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>Reversed and bail reduced.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
