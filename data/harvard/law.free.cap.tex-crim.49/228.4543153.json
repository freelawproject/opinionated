The State\u2019s witness testimony showed that shortly after prosecutrix had been cut she was seen by witnesses, whom she told upon being asked who cut her, that defendant, who was present, did it; and that defendant asked one of the witnesses whether she wanted to take it up and seemed to be pretty angry at the time. Blood was coming from prosecutrix\u2019 face. The witnesses did not see who cut prosecutrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-11\">The defendant testified that he cut \u25a0 his wife accidentally with a pocket knife and was friendly to her at the time, but that he had not lived with her since; that he went into the house with his wife after cutting her. and washed her head and attended to her wound.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-12\"><em>Merrow </em>and <em>Smiihdeal, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AGtt\">On question of forcing the State to place witness on stand: Thompson v.

Appellant insists that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury, but claims that the injuries inflicted upon his wife were accidental. The res geste statement of the wife was that appellant cut her. We do not think the court erred in refusing to require the State to put the wife upon the stand. Defendant could have done this himself, if he had desired to do so. There is no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
