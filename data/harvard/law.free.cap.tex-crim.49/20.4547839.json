However, as we understand the evidence, the State has not made out a case. The indictment charges that the adultery was committed by appellant living with Mattie Caldwell, a married woman. The evidence upon which the allegation is sought to be sustained is found mainly in the statement of appellant to witness Hardwick. Hardwick caught appellant in the act of intercourse with the woman in her house. He arrested him, and while en route to the office of the county attorney, had a conversation with him, after the stereotyped warning. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t remember the words, but in substance he said, he had been living or boarding, I don\u2019t remember which, but that he had been boarding or staying there six or eight weeks (supposedly meaning the house of his paramour, Mattie Caldwell). I don\u2019t remember whether defendant said he was boarding or staying there. He did say that he was living there, or boarding there, or staying there, I don\u2019t know which he said.\u201d This is the strength of the State\u2019s case, on the question of the living together of appellant with Mattie Caldwell. Allen testified that appellant slept at his house, and paid him 35 cents a week, as such boarder or for his room-rent, and took his meals at Mattie Caldwell\u2019s. We do not believe that this evidence is sufficient to show the parties were living together. The mere fact that a party taires his meals at a house, does not constitute \u201cliving together.\u201d Where the statute undertakes to fix a residence at all, it makes the criterion where .the party sleeps, and not where he takes his meals. We do not believe the evidence is sufficient, and for this reason the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
