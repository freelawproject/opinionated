You are instructed that you can only consider such testimony for the purpose for which it was admitted; that is, to establish,\u201d etc. Various grounds of objection are urged to this charge. These are well taken under the following cases: Reese v. State, 67 S. W. Rep., 283; see also Nelson v. State, 67 S. W. Rep., 320; Santee v. State, 37 S. W. Rep., 436; Reese v. State, 70 S. W. Rep., 424; Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>liams v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 128; Hudson v. State, 66 S. W. Rep., 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The court, submitting the law of accomplices, limited the consideration of the jury to the evidence of the witness Livingston as an accomplice. Exception is taken to the charge because of this limitation, the insistence being that the witness Haynes, as well as Rosser, were accomplices. We think the evidence makes it clear that Haynes was an accomplice. The testimony to some extent tends to show that one of the Rossers was also so connected with the transaction that the charge should also have embraced him. We \u00bfre of opinion that these exceptions are well taken; and upon another trial the charge in regard to accomplice\u2019s testimony should be broad enough to include both Haynes and Rosser.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Charges were requested submitting the issue that appellant may have been a receiver of stolen property, instead of being connected with the original taking. We are of opinion that such a charge should have been given. Some of the evidence suggests that he may have been a receiver and.not a principal. We think the issue is sufficiently presented by the evidence to have required the court to give the special instruction instead of refusing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Eor the errors indicated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
