J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASi\">In this consumer class action case the trial court found plaintiff\u2019s claims against a retailer for violation of provisions of the Song-Beverly Credit Card Act of 1971 (Song-Beverly; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1747 et seq.) were preempted by provisions of a federal statute, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701 et seq.) (CAN-SPAM). Accordingly, the trial court sustained the retailer\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The disputed provisions of Song-Beverly were added by the Legislature in 1990 and limit the information that may be requested of a consumer when the consumer uses a credit card to transact business. In particular, Song-Beverly prohibits businesses from requesting or requiring credit card customers to provide \u201cpersonal identification information,\u201d such as their addresses and telephone numbers. In contrast, CAN-SPAM imposes disclosure and \u201copt-out\u201d requirements on the senders of commercial electronic mail (e-mail) and restricts the manner in which such e-mail may be sent. In addition, by its terms CAN-SPAM preempts any state law that \u201cexpressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7707(b)(1).) However, CAN-SPAM does not preempt state laws that \u201care not specific to electronic mail.\u201d (15 U.S.C. 7707(b)(2).) Because Song-Beverly\u2019s regulation of what may be asked of credit card customers is not a regulation of what can be sent in commercial e-mails and is not in any manner specific to e-mail, we conclude Song-Beverly is not preempted by CAN-SPAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">On March 12, 2008, plaintiff and appellant Susan Catherine Powers filed a class action complaint against defendant and respondent Pottery Bam, Inc. (Pottery Bam). Powers alleged she visited a Pottery Bam store, selected an item to buy and, when she used her credit card to buy it, was asked to provide an e-mail address. Powers gave the sales clerk her e-mail address and saw the clerk enter the address into the store\u2019s electronic cash register. More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>generally, Powers alleged Pottery Bam made a practice of asking for personal identification information within the meaning of Song-Beverly and that this conduct, in addition to giving rise to a cause of action under Song-Beverly, gave rise to claims under the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) (UCL) and for invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Pottery Bam demurred to Powers\u2019s complaint. Pottery Barn alleged e-mails are not personal identification information within the meaning of Song-Beverly and that, in any event, regulation of the collection of e-mails is preempted by CAN-SPAM. Pottery Bam further alleged Song-Beverly was an unlawful limitation on its right to engage in commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The trial court determined e-mails are personal identification information within the scope of Song-Beverly, but that Powers\u2019s claims were nonetheless preempted by CAN-SPAM. The trial court gave Powers leave to allege that, aside from e-mails, Pottery Bam had collected other personal identification information. Powers was unable to make such an allegation and the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal. Powers filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">\u201cOn appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer ... the standard of review is well settled. The reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] The court does not, however, assume the tmth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.] The judgment must be affirmed \u2018if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] However, it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.\u201d <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].) Where the plaintiff has been given an opportunity to amend, we presume the complaint states as strong a case as is possible. <em>(Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 457 [212 Cal.Rptr. 743].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Song-Beverly was enacted in 1971. \u201cThe act \u2018imposes fair business practices for the protection of the consumers. \u201cSuch a law is remedial in nature and in the public interest [and] is to be liberally construed to the end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>of fostering its objectives.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Florez v. Linens \u2019N Things, Inc. </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 447, 450 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The particular provisions of Song-Beverly in dispute here were added by the Legislature in 1990 as Assembly Bill No. 2920 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) and in pertinent part state: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c), no person, firm, partnership, association, or corporation that accepts credit cards for the transaction of business shall do any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-6\">\u201c(1) Request, or require as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment in full or in part for goods or services, the cardholder to write any personal identification information upon the credit card transaction form or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-7\">\u201c(2) Request, or require as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment in full or in part for goods or services, the cardholder to provide personal identification information, which the person, firm, partnership, association, or corporation accepting the credit card writes, causes to be written, or otherwise records upon the credit card transaction form or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">\u201c(3) Utilize, in any credit card transaction, a credit card form which contains preprinted spaces specifically designated for filling in any personal identification information of the cardholder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-9\">\u201c(b) For purposes of this section \u2018personal identification information,\u2019 means information concerning the cardholder, other than information set forth on the credit card, and including, but not limited to, the cardholder\u2019s address and telephone number.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1747.08.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">In reviewing the legislative history of Assembly Bill No. 2920 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.), the court in <em>Florez </em>v. <em>Linens \u2019N Things, Inc., supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at page 452 stated: \u201cOur inquiry begins with the California Assembly Committee on Finance and Insurance, Background Information Request on Assembly Bill No. 2920 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.): \u2018AB 2920 seeks to protect the personal privacy of consumers who use credit cards to purchase goods or services by prohibiting retailers from requiring consumers to provide addresses, telephone numbers and other personal information that is <em>unnecessary to complete the transaction and that the retailer does not </em>need.\u2019 (Italics added.) In essence, the original enactment (Stats. 1990, ch. 999, \u00a7 1, pp. 4191^-192 [Assem. Bill No. 2920]) was a response to two principal privacy concerns. \u2018[F]irst, that with increased use of computer technology, very specific and personal information about a consumer\u2019s spending habits was being made available to anyone willing to pay for it; and second, that acts of harassment and violence were being committed by store clerks who obtained customers\u2019 phone numbers and addresses.\u2019 \u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">CAN-SPAM was enacted in 2003. Under CAN-SPAM the sender of any unsolicited \u201ccommercial electronic mail message\u201d is subject to civil liability unless the e-mail contains a mechanism which permits the addressee to \u201copt-out\u201d or unsubscribe from further e-mails, an accurate identification of the sender, an accurate subject line, a physical address of the sender and a warning label if the e-mail contains adult content. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7704.) CAN-SPAM also makes it a crime to send e-mail through a computer without the permission of the owner of the computer (\u201copen-relay\u201d) or place false information in the e-mail header. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1037(a)(1), (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">In enacting CAN-SPAM, Congress expressly found: \u201cThe convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited commercial electronic mail is currently estimated to account for over half of all electronic mail traffic, up from an estimated 7 percent in 2001, and the volume continues to rise. Most of these messages are fraudulent or deceptive in one or more respects.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(2).) However, Congress also found: \u201cMany States have enacted legislation intended to regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail, but these statutes impose different standards and requirements. As a result, they do not appear to have been successful in addressing the problems associated with unsolicited commercial electronic mail, in part because, since an electronic mail address does not specify a geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for law-abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate statutes they are required to comply.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(ll).)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">In light of its findings, Congress expressly provided that CAN-SPAM preempts state anti-spam laws: \u201cThis chapter supersedes any statute, regulation, or rule of a State or political subdivision of a State that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages, except to the extent that any such statute, regulation, or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7707(b)(1).) Importantly, Congress also expressly limited the preemptive impact of CAN-SPAM: \u201cThis chapter shall not be construed to preempt the applicability of\u2014(T (A) State laws that are not specific to electronic mail, including State trespass, contract, or tort law; or [f] (B) other State laws to the extent that those laws relate to acts of fraud or computer crime.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7707(b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">CAN-SPAM cannot be interpreted as preempting application of Song-Beverly to Pottery Barn\u2019s collection of e-mail addresses from its credit card customers. Song-Beverly does not expressly regulate any Internet activity, let alone use of \u201celectronic mail to send commercial messages.\u201d (See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7707(b)(1).) Rather, as we have discussed, Song-Beverly only governs the information businesses may collect in the course of transacting business with credit card users. Thus Song-Beverly does not fall within the scope of CAN-SPAM\u2019s express preemption provisions. Importantly, CAN-SPAM does not permit us to find any implied preemption here. CAN-SPAM not only has a carefully limited express preemption provision, but it also expressly excludes preemption of any state laws, such as Song-Beverly, which \u201care not specific to electronic mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Contrary to Pottery Barn\u2019s argument, nothing in <em>Facebook, Inc. </em>v. <em>ConnectU LLC </em>(2007) 489 F.Supp.2d 1087, 1093-1094 <em>(Facebook), </em>expands CAN-SPAM preemption to cover state laws which do not expressly and specifically regulate e-mail. In <em>Facebook </em>the plaintiff made a claim under two California anti-spam statutes, Business and Professions Code sections 17529.4 and 17538.45. Business and Professions Code section 17529.4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> expressly prevents businesses from electronically collecting e-mail addresses from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>Internet for the purpose of sending unsolicited e-mail to the collected addresses; Business and Professions Code section 17538.45<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prevents the unauthorized use of e-mail servers located in this state to send unsolicited e-mails. Although Business and Professions Code section 17529.4 may be violated by collecting e-mail addresses with only the intent to send unsolicited e-mails and without actual distribution of any e-mails, the court in <em>Facebook </em>nonetheless properly concluded that it, as well as Business and Professions Code section 17538.45, regulate \u201c \u2018the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Facebook, supra, </em>489 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1093-1094.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>The express and specific e-mail regulations considered in <em>Facebook </em>are readily distinguishable from Song-Beverly, which does not directly regulate the use of e-mails or the Internet, but instead protects the privacy of consumers when they use credit cards to transact business. (See <em>Florez </em>v. <em>Linens \u2019N Things, Inc., supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 452.) Song-Beverly\u2019s impact on a business\u2019s use of e-mail is only an incident of the statute\u2019s regulation of such credit card transactions. By its terms CAN-SPAM does not preempt state statutes which are not specific to e-mail and have only such incidental impact on e-mail use. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7707(b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">In sum, the trial court erred in sustaining Pottery Barn\u2019s demurrer on the grounds Powers\u2019s Song-Beverly claims are preempted by CAN-SPAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Judgment reversed.
