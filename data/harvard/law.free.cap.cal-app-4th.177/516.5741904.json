(a)(2); counts 1 &amp; 5), forcible lewd act on a child under age 14 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 288, subd. (b)(1); counts 2 &amp; 6), forcible oral copulation <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 288a, subd.

Counts 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>through 4 involved crimes against S., while counts 5 through 7 involved crimes against A., and the jury further found, as to all but count 4, that the offenses were committed against multiple victims. <em>(Id.., </em>\u00a7 667.61, subd. (e)(5).) Appellant was between 16 and 18 years of age during much of the period of time in which the crimes were alleged to have occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Concluding that appellant was not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under juvenile court law, the trial court sentenced appellant to a total unstayed term of 30 years to life in prison, and this appeal ensured. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">I-III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">FINDING OF JUVENILE COURT UNFITNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The parties stipulated that appellant\u2019s date of birth was September 6, 1982. The original information alleged some counts occurring as early as November 1, 1997, while the first amended information alleged some counts occurring as early as May 30, 1992. As set out in the second amended Information (upon which the jury returned its verdicts), the offenses charged with respect to S. were alleged to have occurred between September 6, 1998, and May 29, 2001, while the offenses charged concerning A. were alleged to have occurred between September 6, 1998, and November 1, 2002. Thus, appellant was between 16 and 18 years old (hence, a juvenile) during a portion of the periods in which the crimes were committed, having turned 18 on September 6, 2000. In filing the second amended information in the midst of trial, the prosecutor stated her belief that, given the amendment of dates so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>appellant was 16 or older at the time of the alleged offenses, the People could \u201cdirect file\u201d the charges under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 and Proposition 21.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant did not object to the amendment of the information or to its being filed directly in adult court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Prior to sentencing, the People filed a written motion for an adult sentencing. Although contending that provisions enacted in 2000 pursuant to Proposition 21 permitted the direct filing of appellant\u2019s offenses in adult court, they observed that the court might, out of an abundance of caution and because some of the offenses antedated enactment of the Proposition 21 statutory amendments, conduct a fitness hearing. The People argued that appellant\u2019s failure to object to the direct filing waived any objection to his status, and that he was unfit to be dealt with under the juvenile court law in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The court opted to hold a fitness hearing prior to sentencing. Appellant did not object to this procedure, and did not present any evidence. Following argument concerning the probation officer\u2019s fitness report, the trial court found appellant was alleged to be a person described in section 602, and that he was 16 years of age or older at the time of the alleged offenses. Although finding appellant to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law with regard to his prior delinquent history and the success of previous attempts by the juvenile court to rehabilitate him, inasmuch as he had no prior juvenile history or record, the court found him unfit with respect to the degree of criminal sophistication of the offense, whether he could be rehabilitated prior to expiration of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, and the circumstances and gravity of the offenses. Accordingly, the trial court ruled that appellant was not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law, and instead was to be sentenced under the general law of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Appellant now contends that under <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, and its progeny, \u201cthe facts of juvenile unfitness that increased the penalty for the crimes beyond a juvenile court disposition to a prescribed adult maximum sentence had to [be] submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d instead of determined by the sentencing judge. To permit an increase in his authorized punishment contingent upon the finding of unfitness facts, he says, violated his Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. Appellant further contends, based on <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541 [16 L.Ed.2d 84, 86 S.Ct. 1045] and its progeny, that he was entitled to a hearing <em>before </em>juvenile court jurisdiction was rejected and his case was transferred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>superior court criminal process, and that the procedures employed in this case violated his rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Respondent disagrees with both arguments, claiming California law does not make any facts \u201clegally essential\u201d to appellant\u2019s prosecution as an adult, and that the United States Supreme Court has made clear that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial rights are to be expanded only to those issues that historically have been the subject of a jury trial. Respondent further says appellant forfeited his due process claim by failing to raise it in the trial court; moreover, because the charges against appellant spanned a time period after the passage of Proposition 21, the prosecutor was required to file them in a court of criminal jurisdiction, and appellant received a fitness hearing in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We conclude <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny do not apply. We further conclude appellant forfeited any due process claim by failing either to raise it, or to object to the procedures used, in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">1. <em>The statutory framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s apparent uncertainty over what procedure to follow is understandable: The relevant statutes underwent significant revisions over the course of the timeframe alleged in the second amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In 1998, former section 602 placed every juvenile alleged to have committed a crime under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Former section 707 allowed the district attorney to move to have a minor 16 years of age or older found unfit to be dealt with under the juvenile court law. If the minor was not alleged to have committed an offense listed in subdivision (b) of the statute, the juvenile court could find him or her unfit following investigation, consideration of the probation officer\u2019s report, and hearing (former \u00a7 707, subd. (a)); if the minor was one who, like appellant, was alleged to have committed an offense listed in subdivision (b) of the statute, the minor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>presumed to be unfit (former \u00a7 707, subd. (c)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Effective March 8, 2000, the electorate enacted the initiative measure known as Proposition 21. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>amended thereby, section 602 mandated the prosecution of specified minors in adult court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 707 permitted the district attorney to directly file charges in adult court against other specified minors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In light of the foregoing, appellant was, at all times alleged in the second amended information that were prior to his 18th birthday, presumptively unfit to be dealt with' under the juvenile court law. What is not clear is whether, because Proposition 21 went into effect partway through the timeframe in which the crimes were alleged to have been committed, appellant was <em>per se </em>unfit. (See <em>In re Veronique P. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 195, 198 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 125].) If appellant was per se unfit to be dealt with under the juvenile court law, then any errors with respect to his posttrial, presentence fitness hearing are immaterial, since the trial court could not have found him fit under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We need not decide whether Proposition 21\u2019s amendment to section 602 was intended to apply retroactively, contrary to the general rule that a new or amended statute applies prospectively only unless the Legislature or electorate expresses an intent otherwise (see <em>In re N.D. </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 885, 892 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 517]), or whether applying it to appellant would run afoul of ex post facto principles (see <em>Thompson v. Missouri </em>(1898) 171 U.S. 380, 383 [43 L.Ed. 204, 18 S.Ct. 922]).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that, even assuming appellant was not per se unfit to be dealt with under the juvenile court law, he has not shown grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>2. <em>Due process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u201cThe possibility of transfer from juvenile court to a court of general criminal jurisdiction is a matter of great significance to the juvenile. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Breed v. Jones </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 519, 535 [44 L.Ed.2d 346, 95 S.Ct. 1779]; see <em>Kent v. United States, supra, </em>383 U.S. at p. 556.) In order to afford a juvenile the constitutional protection against multiple trials, a transfer decision generally must be made prior to an adjudicatory hearing. <em>(Breed, supra, </em>at pp. 535-536.) Transfer hearings \u201cmust measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kent, supra, </em>at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">At his fitness hearing, appellant was afforded such hallmarks of due process as the assistance of counsel, the right to review the probation officer\u2019s report, and the right to present evidence. (Contrast <em>Kent v. United States, supra, </em>383 U.S. at p. 546.) Although the hearing was not held prior to the waiver of juvenile court jurisdiction, at no time, as we have noted, did appellant object either to the direct filing of charges in adult court, or to the holding of a posttrial fitness hearing. \u201cWhether a case should proceed in juvenile or adult court \u2018does not involve an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.\u2019 [Citation.] There is but one superior court in a county, though it is divided into different departments. [Citation.] Because [appellant] was charged with a felony, the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(In re Harris </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 813, 837 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 373, 855 P.2d 391].) \u201c[T]he right to trial in the proper department of the superior court may be waived. \u2018[I]t is well settled that a person who is eligible to have his or her case proceed in juvenile court may waive this right either knowingly, or by failing to timely and properly raise the matter.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 837-838; see, e.g., <em>In re Rodney F. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d <em>177, </em>186 [249 Cal.Rptr. 424]; <em>Rucker v. Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 197, 200-201 [141 Cal.Rptr. 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Appellant\u2019s failure to timely object, either to the adult court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction or to the holding of a fitness hearing after trial, forfeited his claim on appeal. (See <em>In re Harris, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 838.) Moreover, we see nothing that undermined the fairness of the hearing appellant was afforded (see <em>id. </em>at p. 835) or that suggested the result might have been different had the hearing been held before trial. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s due process claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>3. Apprendi<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, a New Jersey hate crime statute authorized a 20-year sentence, despite the usual 10-year maximum, if the sentencing judge found the crime was committed for a specified purpose. In invalidating the statutory scheme, the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556, 122 S.Ct. 2428], the Supreme Court followed <em>Apprendi </em>to invalidate a scheme whereby, after the jury found guilt, the judge determined the presence or absence of aggravating factors required by state law for imposition of the death penalty. The high court explained: \u201cWe held that Apprendi\u2019s sentence violated his right to \u2018a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.] That right attached not only to Apprendi\u2019s weapons offense but also to the \u2018hate crime\u2019 aggravating circumstance ....[][] The dispositive question ... \u2018is one not of form, but of effect.\u2019 [Citation.] If a State makes an increase in a defendant\u2019s authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u2014no matter how the State labels it\u2014must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] A defendant may not be \u2018expose[d] ... to a penalty <em>exceeding </em>the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ring, </em>at p. 602.) The court concluded: \u201cBecause Arizona\u2019s enumerated aggravating factors operate as \u2018the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,\u2019 [citation], the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury.\u201d <em>(Ring, </em>at p. 609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531] <em>(Blakely), </em>the standard sentencing range provided for a maximum prison term for the defendant\u2019s crime of 53 months. Because the judge found he acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty,\u201d however, he was sentenced to more than three years above that maximum, although the facts supporting the finding were neither found by the jury nor admitted by the defendant. In rejecting the state\u2019s argument that there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation because the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\u201cstatutory maximum\u201d was the 10-year maximum sentence permissible for the class of felonies in which the crime was categorized under Washington\u2019s sentencing scheme, the high court stated: \u201cOur precedents make clear . . . that the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>[Citations.] In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \u2018which the law makes essential to the punishment,\u2019 [citation], and the judge exceeds his proper authority.\u201d (Blakely, at pp. 303-304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker </em>(2005) 543 U.S. 220 [160 L.Ed.2d 621, 125 S.Ct. 738], the high court found mandatory federal sentencing guidelines indistinguishable from the statute at issue in <em>Blakely </em>and so subject to the same holding. (Booker, at pp. 233, 243.) <em>Apprendi </em>was reaffirmed: \u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Booker, at p. 244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In <em>Cunningham v. California </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856], the court applied <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny to California\u2019s sentencing scheme. The court stated: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s determinate sentencing law (DSL) assigns to the trial judge, not to the jury, authority to find the facts that expose a defendant to an elevated \u2018upper term\u2019 sentence. The facts so found are neither inherent in the jury\u2019s verdict nor embraced by the defendant\u2019s plea, and they need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. The question presented is whether the DSL, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the judge\u2019s province, violates a defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury safeguarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold that it does. [][] As this Court\u2019s decisions instruct, the Federal Constitution\u2019s jury-trial right guarantee proscribes a sentencing scheme that allows a judge to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on a fact, other than a prior conviction, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. [Citations.] ... In petitioner\u2019s case, the jury\u2019s verdict alone limited the permissible sentence to 12 years. Additional factfinding by the trial judge, however, yielded an upper term sentence of 16 years .... [T]he four-year elevation based on judicial fact-finding denied petitioner his right to a jury trial.\u201d (Cunningham, at pp. 274-275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>In <em>People v. Black, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at page 812, the California Supreme Court found it \u201cimportant to recognize that, under the [foregoing] line of high court decisions . . . , the constitutional requirement of a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies only to a fact that is \u2018legally essential to the punishment\u2019 [citation], that is, to \u2018any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater potential sentence\u2019 than is authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict alone [citation]. \u2018The Sixth Amendment question, the Court has said, is whether the law <em>forbids </em>a judge to increase defendant\u2019s sentence <em>unless </em>the judge finds facts that the jury did not find (and the offender did not concede).\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We have quoted each of the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases to show why, in our view, their holdings are not violated by a juvenile court fitness finding. \u201cThe maximum penalty in defendant\u2019s case was established when the jury convicted him of the predicate offenses and sustained the [section 667.61] allegations.\u201d <em>(People v. Retanan </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1229-1230 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 177].) No additional fact finding by the judge was engaged in or required: The <em>jury\u2019s verdict alone </em>authorized the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We recognize that, had appellant been tried as a juvenile, his maximum period of actual physical confinement would have been limited by the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to his attainment of age 25. We also recognize that the findings required under the criteria listed in section 707 with respect to fitness are factual ones. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Jones) </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 667, 680 &amp; fn. 1 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 641, 958 P.2d 393].) This simply does not mean, however, that the Sixth Amendment is violated because a judge makes them.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In <em>People v. Black, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at page 821, the California Supreme Court explained that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>treated the crime, together with the fact that is the prerequisite to eligibility for an increased sentence, as the functional equivalent of a greater crime. Thus, these decisions are intended to protect the historic right to a trial by jury on all elements of an offense, which would be jeopardized if a legislature could label facts affecting the length of the authorized sentence for an offense as something other than elements, thereby eliminating the right to a jury trial thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">This interpretation was confirmed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Oregon v. Ice </em>(2009) 555 U.S. _ [172 L.Ed.2d 517, 129 S.Ct. 711], which held that <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny do not apply to a sentencing judge\u2019s decision whether to impose consecutive sentences. The court observed that \u201c[o]ur application of Apprendi\u2019s rule must honor the \u2018longstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ing common-law practice\u2019 in which the rule is rooted. [Citation.] The rule\u2019s animating principle is the preservation of the jury\u2019s historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense. [Citation.] Guided by that principle, our opinions make clear that the Sixth Amendment does not countenance legislative encroachment on the jury\u2019s traditional domain. [Citation.] We accordingly considered whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within \u2018the domain of the jury ... by those who framed the Bill of Rights.\u2019 [Citation.] In undertaking this inquiry, we remain cognizant that administration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the basic sovereign prerogatives States retain. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ice, </em>at p.___ [129 S.Ct. at p. 717].) After reviewing \u201c[t]he historical record\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201cIn light of this history, legislative reforms regarding the imposition of multiple sentences do not implicate the core concerns that prompted our decision in <em>Apprendi. </em>There is no encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jury\u2019s domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">\u201cIt is no answer that, as Ice argues, \u2018he was <em>\u201centitled\u2019 </em>to\u2019 concurrent sentences absent the fact findings Oregon law requires. [Citation.] In Ice\u2019s view, because \u2018the Oregon Legislature deviated from tradition\u2019 and enacted a statute that hinges consecutive sentences on fact findings, Apprendi\u2019s rule must be imported. [Citation.] As we have described, the scope of the constitutional jury right must be informed by the historical role of the jury at common law. [Citation.] It is therefore not the case that, as Ice suggests, the federal constitutional right attaches to every contemporary state-law \u2018entitlement\u2019 to predicate findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">\u201cFor similar reasons, <em>Cunningham, </em>upon which Ice heavily relies, does not control his case. As stated earlier, we held in <em>Cunningham </em>that the facts permitting imposition of an elevated \u2018upper term\u2019 sentence for a particular crime fell within the jury\u2019s province. [Citation.] The assignment of such a finding to the sentencing judge implicates Apprendi\u2019s core concern: a legislative attempt to \u2018remove from the [province of the] jury\u2019 the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense. [Citation.] We had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no erosion of the jury\u2019s traditional role was at stake. <em>Cunningham </em>thus does not impede our conclusion that, as Apprendi\u2019s core concern is inapplicable to the issue at hand, so too is the Sixth Amendment\u2019s restriction on judge-found facts.\u201d <em>(Oregon v. Ice, supra, </em>555 U.S. at p._[129 S.Ct. at p. 718].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201cMembers of [the United States Supreme] Court have warned against \u2018wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the <em>Apprendi </em>doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries.\u2019 [Citation.] The jury-trial right is best honored through a \u2018principled rationale\u2019 that applies the rule of the <em>Apprendi </em>cases \u2018within the central sphere of their concern.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Oregon v. Ice, supra, </em>555 U.S. at p._[129 S.Ct. at p. 719].) Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases \u201c \u2018suggests that they apply to factual determinations that do not serve as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of an element of a crime.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Black, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 821.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The factual findings involved in a fitness determination are not the functional equivalent of an element of a crime. \u201cThe sole purpose of the fitness hearing is to determine whether the best interest of the minor and of society will be served by retention in the juvenile court or whether the minor should be tried as an adult. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Ronald H.) </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1475, 1479 [269 Cal.Rptr. 4].) A transfer hearing \u201cdoes not directly result in an adjudication of guilt or delinquency\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Steven </em>S.) (1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 162, 173 [173 Cal.Rptr. 788]), and the question of a minor\u2019s amenability to treatment within the juvenile court system is concerned with the child\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation, not the degree of his or her criminal culpability (see <em>People v. Macias </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 739, 746-747 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 659, 941 P.2d 838]). A finding that a minor is not amenable to treatment in the juvenile system \u201cdoes not increase the maximum penalty one can receive if punished according to the facts as reflected in the jury verdict alone.\u201d <em>(People v. Ferris </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 773, 780 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 426] [rejecting claim that, under <em>Apprendi, </em>insanity must be treated as element of offense charged].) Moreover, even assuming juveniles have indeed historically been afforded the right to trial by jury on allegations they committed a crime (see <em>In re Javier A. </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 913, 928-949 [206 Cal.Rptr. 386]), we are aware of no historical practice extending that right to a fitness determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The constitutional concerns expressed in <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny were satisfied in the present case by the jury\u2019s finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of those facts legally essential to the punishment imposed, viz., that appellant committed the offenses. Appellant\u2019s sentence was fully authorized by the jury verdict; the statutory provision for judicial factfinding with respect to amenability to treatment in the juvenile court system is not \u201ca legislative attempt to \u2018remove from the [province of the] jury\u2019 the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense . . . . [A]s Apprendi's core concern is inapplicable to the issue at hand, so too is the Sixth Amendment\u2019s restriction on judge-found facts.\u201d <em>(Oregon </em>v. <em>Ice, supra, </em>555 U.S. at p._[129 S.Ct. at p. 718].)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Vartabedian, J., and Cornell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 22, 2009, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 17, 2009, S176852.
