Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) text of Prop. 83, \u00a7 31, p. 138.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Given that intent, the People find it an \u201cabsurd consequence[]\u201d that section 667.6, subdivision (c) would \u201clessen the number of sex offenders who fall under [its] purview ... by making [it] inapplicable to a defendant who is convicted of committing an [enumerated sex offense] against one victim and a non-[enumerated sex offense] against a separate victim on a separate occasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">As noted (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 7), Jessica\u2019s Law <em>repealed </em>language that authorized a trial court to impose \u201ca full, separate, and consecutive term ... for each violation of [enumerated sex offenses] <em>whether or not the crimes were committed during a single transaction.'\u201d </em>(Former \u00a7 667.6, subd.

Notwithstanding, the People urge us to insert language that would undo the repeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In interpreting a voter initiative \u201cwe apply the same principles that govern statutory construction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliot </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 453, 478 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 759, 122 P.3d 968].) As noted, \u201cthe basic principle of statutory . . . construction . . . mandates that courts, in construing a measure, not undertake to rewrite its unambiguous language. <em>(In re Waters of Long Valley Creek Stream System[, supra,] 25 </em>Cal.3d 339, 348 . . . .)\u201d <em>(Skinner, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 775.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cIn interpreting statutes, we follow the Legislature\u2019s intent, as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law . . . .\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. v.

A court \u201c \u2018 \u201cis not authorized to . . . rewrite the statute to conform to an assumed intention which does not appear from its language.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Hoddinott </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 992, 1002 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 911 P.2d 1381].) It is only when the language to be constmed is ambiguous that the courts may look to legislative intent to resolve the ambiguity. As the People concede, section 667.6\u2019s language is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The absurd consequences exception to the plain meaning rule cannot be applied whenever it is claimed to run counter to a generalized legislative intent. The meaning of absurd consequences appears only in the narrow factual circumstances of its application. That is made clear in <em>Pieters, </em>upon which the People rely for the proposition that the \u201c \u2018language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature [or, as in this case, the electorate] did not intend.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 898.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In <em>Pieters, </em>the court held that \u201cdrug quantity\u201d enhancements imposed pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 11370.4 are impliedly excepted from the double-base term limitation of former section 1170.1, subdivision (g). <em>(Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 896-897.) The court explained: \u201cQuantity enhancements under [Health and Safety Code] section 11370.4 were enacted in 1985. [Citation.] The express legislative purpose in adding [that] section was \u2018to punish more severely those persons who are in the regular business of trafficking in, or production of, narcotics and those persons who deal in large quantities of narcotics as opposed to individuals who have a less serious, occasional, or relatively, minor role in this activity.\u2019 [Citation.] [][] The double-base-term limitation, on the other hand, first became operative in 1977. [Citations.] In cases involving multiple sentences, [that] rule limit[ed] the maximum term to twice the number of years imposed as the base term under . . . section 1170[.l], subdivision (b). Then, as now, the rule admitted specific exceptions. Quantity enhancements pursuant to [Health and Safety Code] section 11370.4, however, were not explicitly included among those exceptions until 1988\u2014after defendant had committed the crimes charged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 898.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Carvajal </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 487 [249 Cal.Rptr. 368], cited with approval in <em>Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pages 899-901, \u201cthe Court of Appeal initially observed that [Health and Safety Code] section 11352 provides allowable base terms of three, four, or five years. [Citation.] The court reasoned that if [Health and Safety Code] section 11370.4 were subject to the double-base term limitation, only the three-year enhancement could be applied regardless of the chosen base term: a five-year enhancement could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>imposed only if the defendant received the upper, [and a] five-year base term, and a ten-year enhancement <em>\u2018could never be </em>imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pieters, </em>at p. 899, summarizing &amp; quoting <em>Carvajal, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.3d at p. 501.) As a consequence, a literal reading of the double-base term limitation would render ineffective other provisions of the enactment of which it was a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The present case is distinguishable. No provision of section 667.6 would be rendered ineffective if subdivision (c) is given its literal meaning. While defendants whose crimes involve separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions are not subject to subdivision (c)\u2019s discretionary sentencing scheme, they are included in subdivision (d)\u2019s mandatory sentencing scheme in cases where a defendant is convicted of more than one subdivision (e) offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (d); <em>Jones, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 595-596.) Because, however, subdivision (d)\u2019s mandatory sentencing scheme applies only where a defendant is convicted of more than one such offense (\u00a7 667.6, subds. (c), (d); <em>Jones, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 594, fn. 5, 595-596), defendants whose crimes involve separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions, but who are convicted of only one offense enumerated in subdivision (e), would not be subject to a full, consecutive sentence if subdivision (c) is given its literal meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">While such a construction may be viewed as inconsistent with the electorate\u2019s generalized intent \u201cto strengthen and improve the laws that punish and control sexual offenders\u201d insofar as it narrows, albeit slightly, section 667.6, subdivision (c)\u2019s application, it does not follow that the plain, unambiguous language of subdivision (c) should not be given its literal meaning. Unlike the present case, <em>Pieters </em>involved \u201can unambiguous expression of legislative purpose\u201d as \u201cevidenced by both the express purpose of the section and the graduated sentence enhancements provided therein.\u201d <em>(Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 902, 901.)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Here, section 667.6 was one of over two dozen statutes amended or added by Jessica\u2019s Law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) text of Proposition 83, \u00a7\u00a7 3-30, pp. 127-138.) While the electorate\u2019s general intent in enacting Proposition 83 was to strengthen and improve the laws that punish sex offenders (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) text of Jessica\u2019s Law, \u00a7 31, p. 138), we cannot say that the electorate did not intend that section 667.6, subdivision (c) be given its literal meaning. This is particularly so where, as here, the drafters plainly intended to omit the \u201cwhether or not\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\u201cWhen construing . . . initiative measures, ... the intent of the drafters may be considered ... if there is reason to believe that the electorate was aware of that intent [citation] and we have often presumed, in the absence of other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent such as ballot arguments [citation] or contrary evidence, that the drafters\u2019 intent and understanding of the measure was shared by the electorate.\u201d <em>(Rossi </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 688, 700, fn. 7 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 363, 889 P.2d 557]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hazelton </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 101, 123 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 443, 926 P.2d 423].)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In amending section 667.6, subdivision (c), the drafters not only repealed the \u201cwhether or not\u201d language, but added the following sentence: \u201cA term may be imposed consecutively pursuant to this subdivision if a person is convicted of at least one offense specified in subdivision (e).\u201d (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (c); see Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 7, 2006) text of Prop. 83, \u00a7 11, p. 130.) In <em>Jones, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at page 589, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca single conviction of an enumerated sex offense is sufficient to trigger the sentencing court\u2019s discretion under . . . section 667.6, subdivision (c), to impose a full, consecutive sentence for that conviction.\u201d At the time the defendant in that case was sentenced (before Jessica\u2019s Law), section 667.6, subdivision (c) authorized a trial court to impose \u201ca full, separate, and consecutive term ... for each violation of [certain enumerated sex offenses] <em>whether or not </em>the crimes were committed during a single transaction.\u201d (46 Cal.3d at p. 591, fn. 2, italics added &amp; omitted.) In holding that a single conviction of an enumerated sex offense was sufficient to trigger the sentencing court\u2019s discretion under subdivision (c), the court relied substantially on the \u201cwhether or not\u201d language, explaining that \u201cit is at once apparent that the \u2018whether or not\u2019 language was intended to broaden the scope of subdivision (c)\u2019s effect not to restrict it.\u201d (46 Cal.3d at p. 593.) \u201cThe entire \u2018whether or not\u2019 clause is to be read as the Legislature\u2019s shorthand pronouncement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the court may discretionarity impose a full, consecutive sentence for each [enumerated sex offense] conviction, irrespective of whether the violent sex crime and the other crime making section 1170.1 potentially applicable were committed \u2018during a single transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">While we do not know why the \u201cwhether or not\u201d language was deleted, we do know that it was not inadvertent because of the addition of the following sentence: \u201cA term may be imposed consecutively pursuant to this subdivision if a person is convicted of at least one offense specified in subdivision (e).\u201d (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (c).) Given the court\u2019s holding in <em>Jones, </em>the only explanation for this addition was the removal of the \u201cwhether or not\u201d language. The drafters plainly were concerned that without the \u201cwhether or not\u201d language, subdivision (c) might be interpreted as applicable only where a defendant is convicted of more than the offenses specified in subdivision (e).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We decline to read back into the statute language that was intentionally removed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On this record, we cannot say that giving section 667.6, subdivision (c) its literal meaning will result in absurd consequences which the electorate did not intend. Accordingly, subdivision (c)\u2019s plain meaning governs our review. A court may impose a full, separate and consecutive sentence for each violation of an enumerated sex offense <em>only if the crimes involve the same victim on the same occasion. </em>(\u00a7 667.6, subd. (c).)  Because defendant\u2019s crimes did not involve the same victim on the same occasion as required by subdivision (c), the trial court erred in imposing a full, consecutive upper term on count 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The judgment is reversed insofar as it relates to defendant\u2019s sentence under section 667.6, subdivision (c) and the no visitation order as it applies to K.G.
