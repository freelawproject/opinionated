The State contends that a reading of the affidavits presented in support of the warrant application amply supports the proposition that the description of the property to be seized in the warrant was mere harmless error, unfortunately overlooked by the issuing municipal court judge, and that the materials found at the described premises were seized in good faith reliance upon the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Defendant argues that, although the trial judge raised the issue of the applicability of <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 <em>US. </em>-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3405, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>677 (1984), the State in violation of <em>R. </em>3:5-7 failed to submit a brief in response to defendant\u2019s brief in support of the suppression motion and, therefore, should not be heard with respect to the <em>Leon </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">It is true that the State has the obligation on a suppression motion to file a brief in support of its position. <em>State v. Walker, </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 398 (App.Div.1971). In this case, however, the judge had before him defendant\u2019s motion and brief. Whatever sanction, if any, may be appropriate to enforce <em>R. </em>3:5-7, the remedy for the State\u2019s failure to file a brief is certainly not that the evidence objected to by defendant automatically will be suppressed. <em>Evid.R. </em>9(1) requires that a court take judicial notice \u201cwithout request by a party, of the decisional, constitutional, and public statutory law and rules of court of this State and the decisional, constitutional, and public statutory law and rules of court of the United States____\u201d The trial judge properly discharged his duty in considering and analyzing all relevant law. Irrespective of the Rules of Evidence, such a duty devolved on the trial judge. <em>Carlo v. Okonite-Callender Cable </em>Co., 3 <em>N.J. </em>253, 260 (1949). We at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the appellate level are under a similar duty. The presentations before us and our own research aid us in our consideration of each matter under the applicable law up to the date of our decision. Defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the State may not cite on appeal case law not presented in the trial court is, in a word, incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The facts before us are relatively simple. The investigating detectives presented to the municipal court judge ample grounds for reasonable cause to believe that a numbers operation was being conducted at defendant\u2019s barber shop. Attached to the affidavits was a printed form of search warrant requiring completion by the detectives by filling in the judge\u2019s name, a description of the defendant and the place to be searched, the statutes allegedly violated, the property to be seized and their own names. Unfortunately, although the balance of the search warrant form was correctly completed, the property to be seized was described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">Certain paraphernalia used in the process of bookmaking on horses, geldings, mares, racing at various tracks and other sporting events. Plus all instruments used to prevent detection or aid in the escape from the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The detective who completed this form noted that he had been assigned only recently to this duty and copied the language from an old warrant form, thinking that the wording was required in all gambling cases. The municipal court judge, after reviewing the detailed description of the investigation and noting that there was probable cause, obviously only scanned the warrant form briefly and then signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">These facts place before us the Supreme Court decisions in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>and its companion case <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3424, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>737 (1984). The trial judge found that these decisions were not to be applied retroactively to govern the search in the matter before him. After receipt of the notice of motion for leave to appeal, the trial judge issued a supplementary written opinion indicating two bases for his decison: the warrant (1) lacked the required specificity, and (2) could not have been signed under these circumstances by a detached magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The first point is supported by <em>pre-Leon </em>law; the second point according to the trial judge is factually supported by the issuing judge\u2019s signature on a warrant which, in the paragraph noted above, had nothing to do with the activities described in the supporting affidavits. The trial judge accordingly concluded that the warrant had not been read and \u201cthat the warrant was not signed by a detached magistrate as required under our law.\u201d As to retroactive application of <em>United States v. Leon, </em>the trial judge noted that defense counsel presented to him a quotation from the case that the Supreme Court had been \u201cunwilling to conclude that new Fourth Amendment principles are always to have a prospective effect. No Fourth Amendment decision marking a clear break with the past has been applied retroactively.\u201d As will be discussed below, an analysis of the quoted material, including the footnote reference, yields the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The State contends that <em>Leon </em>and <em>Sheppard </em>should be applied retroactively to the case before us. We recognize that where the United States Supreme Court has restricted police activity under the Fourth Amendment, such cases are not generally retroactively applied. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>537, 549, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2579, 2586, 73 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>202, 214 (1982). Similar examples can be cited at least back to <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 <em>U.S. </em>618, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1731, 14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>601 (1965), holding that <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>643, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1684, 6 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1081 (1961), extending the exclusionary rule to State prosecutions, would not be applied retroactively. Therefore, a clear break with the past involving the broadening of defendants\u2019 rights and correspondingly restricting police action should be regarded as prospective in nature because of the justified reliance that law enforcement authorities place on preexisting law. <em>Solem v. Stumes, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>-, -, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1338, 1341, 79 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>579, 589 (1984). <em>Cf. State v. Adams, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 389-390 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">In contrast to these cases expanding defendant\u2019s rights and limiting previously sanctioned police action, stand the cases that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>broaden the scope of permissible police activity. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>798, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982), which broadened the scope of warrantless searches under the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d has been retroactively applied in various circuit court opinions. One of these opinions, <em>United States v. Johns, </em>707 <em>F.2d </em>1093, 1097 (9th Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d </em>on other grounds \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>881, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>890 (1985), was reversed and remanded because the Ninth Circuit applied too limited an interpretation of <em>Ross, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 887. The Court\u2019s reversal on the basis of too limited an application of <em>Ross </em>obviously concurred with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning as to retroactivity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">The purpose of refusing to apply retroactively a new decision enforcing the exclusionary rule is to avoid penalizing police conduct when the police reasonably relied on existing judicial precedent ... When a court determines that a particular police practice does <em>not </em>violate the Constitution there is no reason not to apply that decision retroactively. 707 F.2d at 1097.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Similarly, <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>213, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) has been applied retroactively. There the Supreme Court abandoned the earlier two-pronged \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d and \u201cveracity or reliability\u201d test for the use of an informant\u2019s information and embraced a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach, thus broadening the scope of permissible police action. In <em>Massachusetts v. Upton, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2085, 80 L.Ed.2d 721 (1984), the Court retroactively applied <em>Gates.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">In addition to <em>Ross </em>and <em>Gates, Leon </em>has been found to apply retroactively in <em>United States v. Sager, </em>743 <em>F.</em>2d 1261, 1264-1265 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">Notwithstanding the fact that \u201cas a rule, judicial decisions apply retroactively,\u201d <em>Solem v. Stumes, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1134, 79 L.Ed.2d at 586, and that particularly decisions limiting the exclusionary rule have been held retroactive, the trial court in the present case refused to apply <em>Leon </em>retroactively, focusing on the language in <em>Leon </em>quoted earlier as precluding anything but prospective application. That lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>guage, however, was quoted out of context. It, and its appended footnote (with the portion quoted by the trial judge emphasized), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">The same attention to the purposes underlying the exclusionary rule also has characterized decisions not involving the scope of the rule itself. We have not required suppression of the fruits of a search incident to an arrest made in good-faith reliance on a substantive criminal statute that subsequently is declared unconstitutional. <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo, </em>443 US 31, 61 L Ed 2d 343, 99 S Ct 2627 (1979).8 <em>Similarly, although the Court has been unwilling to conclude that new Fourth Amendment principles are always to have only prospective effect, United States v. Johnson, </em>457 US 537, 560, 73 L Ed 2d 202, 102 S Ct 2579 (1982),9 <em>no Fourth Amendment decision marking a \"clear break with the. past\" has been applied retroactively. </em>See <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>422 US 531, 45 L Ed 2d 374, 95 S Ct 2313 (1975); <em>Desist v United States, </em>394 US 244, 22 L Ed 2d 248, 89 S Ct 1030 (1969); <em>Linkletter v Walker, </em>381 US 618, 14 L Ed 2d 601, 85 S Ct 1731, 5 Ohio Misc 49, 33 Ohio Ops 2d 118 (1965).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The propriety of retroactive application of a newly announced Fourth Amendment principle, moreover, has been assessed largely in terms of the contribution retroactivity might make to the deterrence of police misconduct. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>supra [457 <em>U.S.], </em>at 560-561, 73 L Ed 2d 202, 102 S Ct 2579 [at 2592-2593]; <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>supra [422 <em>U.S.], </em>at 536-539, 542, 45 L Ed 2d 374, 95 S Ct 2313 [at 2316-2318],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">The trial court focused upon the \u201cclear break with the past\u201d statement, but ignored both the reason, here inapplicable, for that rule and the footnote indicating that the Court\u2019s \u201cunwillingness\u201d to apply decisions retroactively has centered upon the disruption of past police actions which have relied upon the settled state of the law. No such bar exists when the Court determines that police action was constitutional; certainly no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>citizen relies upon the good-faith issuance of a warrant being thwarted by an error in the material included.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We find, therefore, that both <em>Leon </em>and <em>Sheppard </em>should be applied retroactively. While <em>Leon </em>dealt with an absence of probable cause<footnotemark>1</footnotemark><em>, Sheppard </em>dealt with a factual situation similar to that before this court. There, as here, there was an erroneous designation of the items to be seized. Although the documents supporting the warrant indicated that the warrant was desired to search for the clothing and possessions of a homicide victim, the warrant form was one designed for a controlled substance investigation. There the error was recognized and the judge informed the investigator that he would make the necessary changes, but unfortunately did not. The Supreme Court applied <em>Leon </em>(decided that day) stating that \u201cthe sole issue before us ... is whether the officers reasonably believed the search they conducted was authorized by a valid warrant.\u201d Since that belief existed, \u201cthe only question is whether there was an objectively reasonable basis for the officers\u2019 mistaken belief.\u201d 468 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3428-29, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 743-744.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">In <em>Sheppard </em>the judge when handing the warrant to the detective told him that it \u201cwas sufficient authority in form and content to carry out the search as requested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3427, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 742. The Court asserted that it refused \u201cto rule that an officer is required to disbelieve a judge who has just advised him, by word and action that the warrant he possesses authorizes him to conduct the search he has requested,\u201d and noted that the officer \u201cknew what items were listed in the affidavit presented to the judge and he had good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>reason to believe that the warrant authorized the seizure of those items.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3429, 82 L.Ed.2d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In the case before us, the officer\u2019s affidavit correctly set forth the items he desired to seize: lottery slips, related paraphernalia, and other items indicative of an illicit lottery operation. The municipal court judge was informed that the officer was \u201clooking for an illegal lottery operation.\u201d Here as in <em>Sheppard </em>the officer was not required to disbelieve the judge whose actions in reviewing the affidavit and placing his signature on the warrant form indicated that the warrant authorized the requested search. Under the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception set forth in <em>Leon </em>and applied in <em>Sheppard, </em>the officer\u2019s actions when seizing the property in this case were objectively reasonable; the evidence seized should not be suppressed because the warrant \u201clacked the requisite specificity.\u201d The supporting affidavit clearly designated the intended items; an obvious defect in form should not preclude admission at trial of the evidence seized. <em>Sheppard, </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3428-29, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 743-744.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The Supreme Court in <em>Leon </em>set forth four exceptions to the application of the \u201cgood faith\u201d rule: (1) if probable cause is lacking to the extent that no objectively reasonable officer would rely upon the warrant; (2) if the affidavit contains material misstatements of fact; (3) if the issuing magistrate is not neutral and detached, but acted as a mere \u201crubber stamp;\u201d or (4) if the warrant is \u201cso facially <em>deficient\u2014i.e., </em>in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized\u2014that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\u201d 468 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3422, 82 L.Ed.2d at 699. This fourth requirement, of course, must be read in light of <em>Sheppard. </em>Here, the particularity of such designation can be shown by the totality of the application before the municipal court judge; the officer who executed the warrant at the barber shop, having also submitted the affidavit, \u201creasonably presumed\u201d the warrant\u2019s validity. \u201cSuppression of evidence ... should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the exclusionary rule ...\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3419, 82 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 695; \u201cthe rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.\u201d <em>Id., </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3418, 82 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The trial court\u2019s second basis for excluding the evidence was that the warrant was \u201cnot signed by a detached magistrate as is required under our law.\u201d This is not borne out by the facts before us. Neutrality and detachment are required to assure that \u201cprobable cause\u201d supports the request. The inferences from the facts which lead to the issuance of the warrant \u201cmust be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 <em>U.S. </em>108, 84 <em>S.Ct. 1509, </em>12 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>723 (1964). Here the municipal court judge did not act as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d or as adjunct to the law enforcement officer. See example in <em>Leon, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3417, 3422, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 693, 699. The issuing judge here was presented with an affidavit setting forth all the factual predicates necessary to search for evidence of an illegal lottery operation. He performed the factual scrutiny necessary and found that probable cause existed to support the issuance of the warrant. There was no evidence before the trial judge of a lack of probable cause or the municipal judge\u2019s abandonment of his \u201cneutral and detached\u201d position in favor of a partisan viewpoint. The fact that when he turned to the warrant form he overlooked the incorrectly typed language describing the property to be seized in no way altered his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">The order of the Law Division granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence is vacated and the matter is remanded for trial. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> Our retroactivity decisions have, for the most part, turned on our assessments of \"(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.\" <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 US 293, 297, 18 L Ed 2d 1199, 87 S Ct 1967 [1970] (1967). As we observed earlier this Term,</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">\"In considering the reliance factor, this Court's cases have looked primarily to whether law enforcement authorities and state courts have justifiably relied on a prior rule of law said to be different from that announced by the decision whose retroactivity is at issue. Unjustified \u2018reliance\u2019 is no bar to retroactivity. This inquiry is often phrased in terms of whether the new decision was foreshadowed by earlier cases or was a \u2018clear break with the past.\u2019 \u201d <em>Solem v.
