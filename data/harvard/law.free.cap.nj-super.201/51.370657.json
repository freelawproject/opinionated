We hold that the statute is not so tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Plaintiff filed this action on December 22, 1982. He alleged that he had been injured in an automobile accident on July 4, 1975 when his bicycle collided with an automobile owned and operated by defendant Walter Metzner. The complaint sought damages against Metzner and PIP benefits against defendant Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate). Allstate admitted that it was the insurer of Metzner\u2019s automobile but, by separate defense, asserted that plaintiffs action was barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1a. Allstate moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs cause of action was time-barred; the trial judge denied that motion and ordered that plaintiff \u201cis entitled to the benefit\u201d of PIP coverage under the Allstate policy. Allstate appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1a directs that \u201c[ejvery action\u201d for the payment of PIP benefits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">shall be commenced not later than 2 years after the injured person or survivor suffers a loss or incurs an expense and either knows or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know that the loss or expense was caused by the accident, or not later than 4 years after the accident whichever is earlier....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Plaintiff acknowledges that his action was not filed within the period thus defined. He urges, however, that he is entitled to \u201cthe broad and comprehensive protection\u201d afforded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">If any person entitled to any of the actions or proceedings specified in sections 2A:14-1 to 2A:14-8 or sections 2A:14-16 to 2A:14-20 of this title or to a right or title of entry under section 2A:14-6 of this title is or shall be, at the time of any such cause of action or right or title accruing, under the age of 21 years, or insane, such person may commence such action or make such entry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>within such time as limited by said sections, after his coming to or being of full age or of sane mind.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">This language is not as comprehensive as plaintiff suggests. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-21 is of limited applicability, providing for tolling only where a plaintiff is \u201centitled to any of the actions or proceedings\u201d specified in the enumerated statutory sections and extending only the time \u201climited by said sections.\u201d An action to recover PIP benefits is not a proceeding governed by any of the enumerated Title 2A sections, for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1a fixes its own limitation period applicable to \u201cevery\u201d action for PIP benefits. Thus, even if the PIP action could be construed as a tort or contract suit, as the motion judge reasoned, the fact remains that the timeliness of the action is fixed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1a and not by any of the provisions of Title 2A to which <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-21 relates. The language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-21 thus does not permit us to read it as applicable to actions brought under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1a.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The same conclusion was reached in <em>Lind v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 367-68 (Law Div.1980), aff\u2019d. 193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>303 (App.Div.1983) and in <em>Giantonio v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309 (Law Div.1980). In other settings as well, our courts have held that the tolling provision in the general statutes of limitations does not apply to statutory causes of action which fix their own limitation provisions. <em>See, e.g., Scharwenka v. Cryogenics Management, Inc., </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 21-22 (App.Div.1978); <em>Uscienski v. National Sugar Refining Co., </em>19 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>240, 18 <em>A.</em>2d 611 (C.P.1941); <em>cf. Gillette v. D., L. &amp; W. R.R. Co., </em>91 <em>N.J.L. </em>220 (E. &amp; A.1917). We also note that when the legislature wanted to incorporate a tolling provision in the Tort Claims Act, it used unmistakable language to do so. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Plaintiff further seeks to support the judgment by urging that he \u201cgave timely notice of his PIP claim thereby obligating Allstate to pay benefits.\u201d That contention was never made in the trial court;, indeed, counsel for plaintiff acknowledged at the motion hearing that he was not raising any estoppel argument. We will accordingly not consider the claim on appeal. <em>See Misani v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>552, 556, <em>cert. </em>den. 382 <em>U.S. </em>203, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>398, 15 L.Ed.2d 270 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of judgment in favor of Allstate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-12\">The claim against Metzner was dismissed by stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-9\">This provision was not modified by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:17B-1 <em>et seq., </em>which lowered the age of majority from 21 years to 18 years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:17B-2; <em>Tyson v.
