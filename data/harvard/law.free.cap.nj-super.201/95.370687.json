He sued the Messers, alleging negligent operation by Stanley, vicarious liability on Mack\u2019s part and negligent entrustment of the car by Mack to Stanley. Defendant Continental denied coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy it had issued to Mack Messer on the ground that the injuries to plaintiff arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle and were specifically excluded by the terms of the policy. Mack Messer\u2019s automobile liability carrier offered the limits of its policy, $25,000, for personal injuries and $5,000 for property damage. The case was then settled with an agreement by the Messers to entry of a judgment against them for $265,000, of which they would pay $30,000, and assign Mack\u2019s rights under the homeowner\u2019s policy to plaintiff. In exchange, plaintiff agreed to accept the $30,000 and the assignment and to waive his right to proceed against the Messers personally for the balance of the $265,000 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Plaintiff then instituted this action for the balance of his judgment, alleging that defendant wrongfully disclaimed coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy and refused to provide Mack Messer with a defense to the negligent entrustment counts of the complaint in the underlying tort action. Plaintiff sent defendant copies of the complaint that he had filed against the Messers and their answer. In a cover letter plaintiff asserted that the negligence on Mack Messer\u2019s part alleged in count six of the complaint fell within the coverage of the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy which defendant had furnished to Mack and Rita Messer.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">A claims manager for defendant wrote Messer and advised him that the company denied coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy for the allegations in the amended complaint on the ground that the injuries to Williamson arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle and were specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of the policy. The limit of liability coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy issued by defendant to the Messers was $50,000. On page 9 of the policy, under \u201cSection II\u2014Exclusions\u201d the policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">1. Coverage E\u2014Personal Liability and Coverage F\u2014Medical Payments to Others do not apply to bodily injury or property damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">e. arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">2. A motor vehicle owned or operated by, or rented or loaned to any insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The trial judge held that there was no coverage and no duty to defend under the homeowner\u2019s policy by reason of the exclusion for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, or loading or unloading of a motor vehicle. He noted that there was coverage under Mack Messer\u2019s automobile insurance policy and that the entire amount of that coverage had been paid. Accordingly, summary judgment was entered in defendant\u2019s favor and plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Plaintiff argues that the amended complaint set forth two separate and distinct negligent acts alleged to have been committed by defendants. The first act was committed in the home of Mack Messer, in leaving the keys to his car where Stanley could find them, and the second on the highway by Stanley Messer in his operation of the car. While the policy excluded coverage for the second act, coverage was not excluded for the first because it does not allege that plaintiffs injuries arose out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the motor vehicle. In support, plaintiff cites <em>McDonald v. Home Ins. Co., </em>97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501 (App.Div.1967). Plaintiff argues that the weight of authority in other jurisdictions holds that the negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle falls within the coverage provided by the standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, and that a narrow construction of the policy\u2019s exclusion requires reversal of the judgment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Defendant claims to distinguish the facts in <em>McDonald </em>from those in the present case and argues that two decisions subsequent to <em>McDonald </em>compel the result reached by the trial judge in the present case, citing <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29 (App.Div.1973), aff\u2019d <em>o.b. </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>152 (1974), and <em>Bartels v. Romano, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23 (App.Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In <em>McDonald v. Home Ins. Co., </em>the McDonalds sued defendant alleging that a homeowner\u2019s policy required Home to defend them in an action brought by Walter Dorman for damages for the death of Dorman\u2019s son. Dorman\u2019s son was a passenger in a car owned by Mickey McDonald, a minor, and was killed when Mickey drove the car into a tree. Dorman\u2019s complaint alleged that the death of his son was caused by the two-fold negligence of the McDonalds: failing to supervise and control their child, knowing of his violent and dangerous habits, and causing or permitting Mickey to purchase and operate the car. 97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 502-503. Home refused to defend the Mc-Donalds on the ground that the homeowner\u2019s policy, in the court\u2019s words, \u201cdid not apply \u2018to the ownership, maintenance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>operation, use, loading or unloading of automobiles while away from the premises * * * \u201d 97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503. The court held that Home was obliged to defend the McDonalds, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">The <em>action </em>against the McDonalds was not based upon \u201cthe ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of ' ' automobiles ' even though the immediate cause of the <em>injury </em>and death of Dorman, Jr. was Mickey\u2019s operation of the automobile. The action was based upon their alleged negligence in failing to supervise and control their child, knowing of his violent and dangerous habits____ The details of the alleged negligence were spelled out in the complaint and included causing and permitting Mickey to purchase and operate the automobile, but nowhere was it alleged that the McDonalds owned, maintained, operated or used the automobile, or that the automobile was negligently driven by them or their agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">In short, regardless of the truth of its allegations, there was nothing in the Dorman complaint which brought the claim within the policy exclusion. [97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503-504]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Plaintiff relies on <em>McDonald </em>to support his position that Continental was obliged to defend and indemnify Mack Messer. The first aspect of the McDonald\u2019s alleged negligence, failing to supervise and control their child, however, is not a factor in the present case since Stanley Messer was 18 at the time of the accident. The fifth and sixth counts of Williamson\u2019s complaint against the Messers sounded in negligent entrustment. While the second aspect of the McDonald\u2019s alleged negligence, permitting or causing Mickey to purchase and operate the car, also sounded in negligent entrustment, the facts of the entrustment in <em>McDonald </em>are distinguishable from those in the present case and its holding is thus inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The crucial difference, in our view, is that while the Mc-Donalds could control their son\u2019s access to his car, they did not own it, nor was their failure to deny him access an aspect of their use of the vehicle. Thus, young Dorman\u2019s death did not involve the ownership, operation or use of the vehicle by the McDonalds. In this case, by way of contrast, the car was owned by Mack Messer and his negligence in either entrusting it to his son Stanley (fifth count) or leaving the keys in a place accessible to Stanley (sixth count) was an aspect of Mack\u2019s ownership or use of the car. Thus the factual allegations underlying the negligent entrustment are fundamentally differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ent from those in <em>McDonald, </em>in that they necessarily involve Mack\u2019s ownership and/or use of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">There would be no liability on Mack Messer\u2019s part for negligent entrustment but for Stanley\u2019s negligent use of the car owned by Mack. The action complained of by plaintiff, negligent entrustment, thus subsumes use of a motor vehicle owned by the named insured, coverage for which is excluded by the policy. In <em>McDonald, </em>as we have noted, the vehicle was not owned by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Another important factor in the present case is that Stanley is an insured under the policy issued by defendant. Thus, not only was the vehicle owned by an insured, plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of its operation by an insured, coverage for which is expressly excluded by the policy. There is no indication in <em>McDonald </em>that Mickey was an insured, nor that the policy contained precisely the same exclusion. We find <em>McDonald </em>to be inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The elements of motor vehicle use and ownership by the insureds in this case bring it within the holdings in <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29 (App.Div.1973); <em>Bartels v. Romano, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23 (App. Div.1979), both decided after <em>McDonald. </em>In <em>Westchester, </em>a bicyclist was struck by a piece of wood thrown by a minor passenger out of a car driven by another minor. 126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 33. In addition to suing the driver and passenger, the bicyclist sued their parents alleging negligence in the care, control and discipline of their children. Judge Carton, writing for this court, phrased the basic issue as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">... whether the injury sustained by the bicyclist was one \u201carisfing] out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the owned automobile * * *\u201d within the meaning of the automobile insurance policies. Corollary to this issue is the applicability of an exclusionary clause of the homeowner\u2019s policy making its coverage inapplicable to \u201cthe * * * use of automobiles * * *. [126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 32-33]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The court considered that the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d \u201cmust be interpreted in a broad and comprehensive sense,\u201d and concluded that \u201calthough Holcombe\u2019s act in throwing the stick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>from the automobile may not have been foreseen or expected, it was a sufficiently foreseeable consequence of the use of the vehicle to mandate coverage under the terms of the [automobile] policies.\u201d 126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38-39. Turning to the exclusionary clauses in the homeowner\u2019s policies, which were nearly identical to the exclusionary clause in the present case, Judge Carton wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">We recognize that the general rule of construction of exclusions in insurance policies is that they must be strongly construed against the insurer. However, we may not disregard their clear import and intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">Homeowner\u2019s policies of the kind here involved are of relatively recent origin. Their growth and development can be generally ascribed to the rise of tort claims of the kind made against homeowners and their families, and the need for wider protection than that afforded under ordinary residential liability policies. Although the homeowner\u2019s policy is not confined to protection for risks arising strictly out of the use of residential premises, it is, as the name suggests, home oriented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">It seems clear to us that the language in the policies is mutually exclusive and that, as used in the homeowner\u2019s policy, is specifically designed to exclude the coverage provided under language in the standard family automobile policy for injuries arising out of the use of the motor vehicle insured thereunder____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">We think that an interpretation which excludes coverage in the present case is in keeping with the reasonable expectations of the parties to the homeowner\u2019s insurance contract. [126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41-42]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">We do not have the terms of Mack Messer\u2019s automobile insurance policy before us. We find this of no concern since the auto insurer has settled with plaintiff. Plainly there was coverage under the automobile policy since plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of the automobile and it should follow, as it did in <em>Westchester, </em>that the language in the automobile and homeowner\u2019s policies is mutually exclusive. This result was reached in <em>Westchester </em>notwithstanding the bicyclist\u2019s allegations of parental negligence in controlling their children, which might be viewed, as plaintiff urges here, as acts separate from the use of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Plaintiff does seek to distinguish the present case from <em>Bartels v. Romano, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23. In that case the Romano children were occupying the family car while waiting for their mother. In some manner it was caused to roll backward and strike the Bartels\u2019 children. 171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>25. The Bartels sued the Romanos, alleging, among other things, that \u201cdefendants \u2018so carelessly and negligently supervised or failed to supervise their infant children and other children under their care, custody and control so as to permit <em>such children to occupy and operate the motor vehicle which occupation of said motor vehicle caused said vehicle to collide with infant plaintiff ..\u201d </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 26. Relying on <em>Westchester, </em>this court concluded that \u201cthe rolling of the automobile down the sloping driveway with the Romano children in occupancy was a consequence of the use of the automobile, and encompassed by the automobile policy coverage.\u201d 171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 27. On the question of coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy, which contained an exclusion clause identical to the one in the present case, the court relied on <em>Westchester, </em>and concluded that the allegations of the complaint \u201cfall squarely within the clear language of the exclusion in the homeowner\u2019s policy.\u201d 171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 27-28. This court pointed out that in <em>McDonald </em>the court \u201cwas confronted with the issue of coverage or no coverage,\u201d and distinguished <em>McDonald </em>on the ground that there was no allegation in that case that the McDonalds owned, maintained, operated or used the automobile. 171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><em>Westchester </em>and <em>Bartels </em>both stand for the proposition that where injuries arise out of the use of an automobile, coverage is excluded by the standard homeowner\u2019s policy. Plaintiff makes much in his brief over the reference in <em>Bartels </em>to \u201cthe issue of coverage or no coverage\u201d in <em>McDonald </em>and argues that <em>Bartels </em>was wrongly decided because coverage should not depend upon who has the deepest pocket. This argument misses the technical distinction drawn by us in <em>Bartels </em>based on the lack of allegations in <em>McDonald </em>regarding ownership or use of the motor vehicle. As we stated in our earlier discussion of <em>McDonald, </em>this distinction is critical and it is the elements of use and ownership by the insured in this case which brings it within the holdings of <em>Westchester </em>and <em>Bartels </em>and distinguishes it from <em>McDonald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Plaintiff asserts that \u201c[t]he weight of authority holds that the negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle is an act which is encompassed within the coverage provided by the standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.\u201d This is not an accurate representation of the split in authority which currently exists among the various jurisdictions outside of New Jersey. <em>See Annotation, </em>\u201cConstruction and effect of provision excluding liability for automobile-related injuries or damage from coverage of homeowner\u2019s or personal liability policy,\u201d 6 A.L.R.4th 555 (1981). The out-of-state opinions cited by plaintiff rely, to greater or lesser degrees, on our decision in <em>McDonald. See Republic Vanguard Insurance Co. v. Buehl, </em>295 <em>Minn. </em>327, 204 N.W.2d 426, 429 (Sup.Ct.1973); <em>Lalomia v. Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co., </em>35 App.Div.2d 114, 312 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1018, 1021 (App.Div.1970), insurer\u2019s appeal dismissed 27 N.Y.2d 796, 315 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>856, 264 N.E.2d 349 (Ct.App.1972), and aff\u2019d <em>o.b. </em>on plaintiff\u2019s appeal 31 N.E.2d 830, 339 N.Y.S.2d 680, 291 N.E.2d 724 (Ct.App.1972); <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Reliance Insurance Co., </em>85 Misc.2d 734, 380 N.Y.S.2d 923, 927 (Sup.Ct.1976); <em>Upland Mutual Insurance Inc. v. Noel, </em>214 <em>Kan. </em>145, 519 <em>P.</em>2d 737, 741-742 (Sup.Ct.1974); <em>Douglass v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>602 F.2d 934, 937 (10 Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Courts in several other jurisdictions have held that injuries arising from the negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle are not covered by the standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. <em>See Safeco Ins. Co. v. Gilstrap, </em>141 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>524, 190 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>425 (Ct.App.1983); <em>Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. v.

App.1980); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. McGlawn, </em>84 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>107, 39 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>531, 404 N.E.2d 1122 (App.Ct.1980); <em>Barnstable County Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Lally, </em>374 <em>Mass. </em>602, 373 <em>N.E.</em>2d 966 (Sup.Jud.Ct.1978); <em>Great Cent. Ins. Co. v. Roemmich, </em>291 <em>N.W.2d </em>772 (S.D.Sup.Ct.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Many of these latter opinions rely on <em>Cooter v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>344 So.2d 496 (Ala.Sup.Ct.1977), where the passenger sought to recover from the homeowner\u2019s insurer of the driver\u2019s father despite an exclusionary clause identical to the one involved in the present case. 344 So.2d at 496-497. The Alabama Supreme Court accepted the insurer\u2019s argument that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of the insured\u2019s <em>ownership </em>as well as his son\u2019s <em>use </em>of the vehicle\u201d, 344 <em>So.</em>2d at 498 (emphasis in original), and criticized the line of decisions holding that there is coverage under the standard homeowner\u2019s policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arx\">The plain wording of the exclusionary provision reveals the deficiency in this rationale. While liability (apart from coverage) for negligent entrustment is not conditioned upon the entrustor\u2019s ownership or use of the vehicle, negligent use by the one to whom it is entrusted is essential to recovery. \u25a0 It is the concurrence of these dual elements\u2014negligent entrustment by the owner or custodian of the instrumentality plus its negligent use by entrustee\u2014that is missing in the rationale of those cases upholding coverage. Taken literally, this line of reasoning\u2014that negligent entrustment of the vehicle, and not its use, is the basis of insured\u2019s alleged liability\u2014the injured party could recover absent any showing that the incompetent to whom the vehicle is entrusted caused the injury by his negligent use of the vehicle. As we have already observed, this does not comport with the elements that make up this tort concept of negligent entrustment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">The clear and unambiguous language here applicable is susceptible of but one meaning; that this homeowner\u2019s policy excludes personal liability coverage for bodily injury arising out of the ownership and use of an automobile owned and operated by the insured. It is the very condition spelled out in this exclusion from coverage that must be proved in fixing liability against the insured under the negligent entrustment doctrine. Once the essential elements of the tort claim for negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle are proved, the policy exclusion is likewise legally operative so as to effectively bar liability of the insurer. [344 So.2d at 499]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The reasoning of <em>Cooter </em>is clearly apposite to the present case. But for Stanley Messer\u2019s negligent use of Mack Messer\u2019s car, no liability could result to Mack Messer. Plaintiff\u2019s inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ries thus arose out of the use of a motor vehicle owned by an insured, coverage for which is explicitly excluded by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"> Finally, plaintiff argues that a narrow construction of the exclusionary clause compels the conclusion that there is coverage for his injuries under the policy issued by defendant. We agree with the proposition that where the language of a policy will support two meanings, it will be construed in favor of the insured. <em>Aetna Ins. Company v. Weiss, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292 (App.Div.1980), certif. den. 85 <em>N.J. </em>127 (1980). We also recognized this rule in <em>Westchester, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41, but observed that \u201cwe may not disregard their clear import and intent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As it was in both <em>Westchester </em>and <em>Bartels, </em>the clear intent of the exclusion in the present policy is to deny coverage for injuries, such as those suffered by plaintiff, which arise out of the ownership of a motor vehicle owned by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
