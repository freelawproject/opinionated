K. HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1252-30\">Michael Dennis Talbott was convicted of various firearms violations and was sentenced to a total of 45 years imprisonment. On appeal he contends that certain evidence used at his trial was illegally seized during a search of his residence and that there was insufficient evidence produced to support his conviction on two counts of possession of unlawfully-made firearms. He also attacks certain aspects of the sentence. We affirm the convictions but vacate the sentence and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\">Based on information that Talbott had in his possession false driver\u2019s licenses and other identity-changing materials, Raleigh city police officer Stacey Coleman obtained a search warrant to search Talbott\u2019s residence. The search was carried out on February 27, 1988; at the same time, Talbott was arrested on a fugitive warrant from Virginia. The search of his residence uncovered guns and two pipebombs as well as extensive identity-changing material. Also seized were various books on bomb-making and a handwritten \u201chit list\u201d containing the names of various public officials related in some way to Talbott\u2019s prior legal troubles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">During trial, Talbott moved to suppress both the books on bomb-making and the \u201chit list.\u201d The court interrupted the trial to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the motion. The motion was denied, and both the books and \u201chit list\u201d were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Talbott was convicted of possession of unlawfully-made destructive devices (pipe-bombs), in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c) (counts 4 and 7); possession of unregistered firearms (pipebombs), in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (counts 5 and 8); possession of a firearm (pistol) by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (count 10); making a false statement to obtain a firearm (pistol) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) (count 1); and possession of firearms (pipebombs) by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (counts 12 and 14). The jury acquitted him of two counts of illegally manufacturing firearms (pipe-bombs) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(f)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">The presentence report prepared by the probation officer recommended that all six Guideline counts be grouped together. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.3, the highest offense level for these counts was determined to be that applicable to Counts 4 and 5, the \u201cReceipt, Possession and Transportation of Firearms.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.2(a). This produced a base offense level of 12 for the grouped counts. The court increased this by two levels due to a finding that the use of identity-changing paraphernalia and the manufacture of the pipebombs required \u201cspecial skills.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. Talbott\u2019s initial refusal to give handwriting exemplars and his implication in a conspiracy to escape from jail formed the basis for the court\u2019s decision to increase the offense level by two for obstruction of justice. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. This produced a total offense level of 16 which, in conjunction with a criminal history category of V, resulted in a Guideline sentence range of 41-51 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">The district court then ruled that the bomb-possession counts involved \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d and, further, that Talbott\u2019s prior felony convictions for burglary and for breaking and entering also constituted \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The court then invoked the career criminal provisions and determined that Talbott\u2019s Guideline sentence range was 100-125 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">The court next decided to depart from the Guidelines and imposed the statutory maximum for some of the pipebomb counts. The court then structured its sentence as follows: (1) two consecutive ten-year sentences on the unlawfully-made pi-pebomb convictions (counts 4 and 7); (2) two consecutive ten-year sentences on the unregistered pipebomb convictions (counts 5 and 8), to be served consecutively to the \u00a7 5861(c) sentences; (3) a five-year sentence for the felon-in-possession of a gun conviction (count 10), to be served consecutively to counts 4, 5, 7 and 8; and (4) five-year concurrent sentences on all other counts (1, 12 and 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-15\">Talbott contends that the bomb-making books and the alleged \u201chit list\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>were illegally seized and that their admission into evidence constitutes reversible error. He also argues that the lower court erred in entering a judgment of conviction on two counts of possession of unlawfully-made firearms in the absence of any evidence that the pipebombs in his possession were manufactured or transferred to him after the effective date of the statute making such devices illegal. Finally, he challenges the sentence on various grounds. We address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">The search warrant which led to the seizure of the bomb-making books and the \u201chit list\u201d described only identity-changing paraphernalia, such as blank driver\u2019s licenses and birth certificates. Talbott argues that the books and \u201chit list\u201d do not come within the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement and, therefore, that they should have been suppressed. He does not contest the validity of the warrant itself nor does he raise any issue regarding the police\u2019s authority to search the residence or to seize the firearms and bomb-making material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Under the plain-view doctrine, the war-rantless seizure of property is permissible if the following criteria are satisfied: (1) the police officer must first be engaged in a lawful intrusion or must otherwise legitimately occupy the position affording a plain view of the evidence seized; (2) the discovery of the evidence must be inadvertent; and (3) it must be immediately apparent that the evidence may be either contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>United States v. Fawole, </em>785 F.2d 1141, 1145 (4th Cir.1986). Since it is conceded by Talbott that the police officers were lawfully in his residence to execute the search warrant, the first requirement is satisfied. A review of the record satisfies us that the remaining criteria were satisfied as well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Officer Coleman testified during the suppression hearing that the search for the items described in the warrant was limited to Talbott\u2019s bedroom, his bedroom closet, and a connected bathroom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court expressly found that the scope of the search was reasonable in light of the evidence of a crime involving identity-changing items. The nature of the search necessitated an examination of the documents which were strewn about Talbott\u2019s bedroom, and nothing suggests that the discovery of the \u201chit list\u201d or the books was anything other than inadvertent within the meaning of <em>Fawole. </em>It is readily apparent that the books were, when viewed in conjunction with the bomb-making components, evidence of a crime. The \u201chit list\u201d was also relevant evidence inasmuch as it could be viewed as listing Talbott\u2019s intended targets. We therefore affirm the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">Talbott attacks only the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to his convictions on counts 4 and 7, possession of destructive devices made in violation of federal law. Specifically, Talbott contends that the government failed to prove an essential element of a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c), to wit: that the devices (pipe-bombs) were manufactured on or after November 1, 1968, the effective date of the statute regulating the manufacture of such devices (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5822). Since he was acquitted of manufacturing the two pipe-bombs, he argues that the government had to prove that whoever did manufacture the pipebombs did so after November 1, 1968; otherwise, such devices were not illegally made and, as such, \u00a7 5861(c) does not apply. At least two other circuits are split on this issue. We join the Tenth Circuit in holding that since what is prohibited is the possession of illegal firearms, the date of their manufacture is immaterial. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>423 F.2d 142 (10th Cir.1970); <em>contra Gott v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 45 (9th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-14\">Talbott contends that he cannot be sentenced in excess of ten years for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>possession/non-registration counts for each pipebomb. We agree. The district court erred as a matter of law in the pyramiding of the consecutive sentences. Under <em>United States v. Kaplan, </em>588 F.2d 71 (4th Cir.1978), <em>modified on other grounds sub nom. United States v. Seidel, </em>620 F.2d 1006 (1980), consecutive sentences may not be imposed for both possession and manufacture of a single firearm such that the total sentence exceeds the statutory maximum for one violation. The government concedes that the imposition of twenty-year total sentences for the possession (\u00a7 5861(c)) and non-registration (\u00a7 5861(d)) convictions with respect to each pipebomb was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">Talbott also contends that the district court erred in finding that he qualified for treatment as a career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because his prior convictions did not involve \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d as that term is defined in the Guidelines. Since it is conceded that Talbott\u2019s two 1975 breaking and entering convictions and his two 1976 burglary convictions involved commercial structures rather than residences, we are constrained to follow the Guideline Commission\u2019s view that such crimes do not come within the ambit of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, Comment (n. 1) (Oct.1987).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that the lower court erred as a matter of law in finding that Talbott\u2019s prior criminal record qualified him for treatment as a career criminal. For the reasons set forth in this Part, the sentence is vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">In its sentencing colloquy, the lower court relied on two grounds to justify a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. First, Talbott\u2019s skill in changing his identity was evidenced by the fact that he had been able to purchase firearms under a different name. Second, the evidence sufficiently showed that Talbott used special skills in manufacturing the pipebombs. Talbott objects to this increase in his offense level on the ground that his acquittal on the bomb-manufacturing charges precludes the use of the same evidence against him during the sentencing phase. This Court has held, however, that acquittal of an offense does not bar consideration of the conduct underlying the charge for purposes of sentencing. <em>United States v. Isom, </em>886 F.2d 736, 738 (4th Cir.1989). By increasing the offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, Talbott is not being punished for an offense for which he was acquitted. Instead, under the preponderance standard of proof applicable to sentencing matters, the evidence that he manufactured the bombs could be considered in imposing a heavier sentence for the offenses for which he was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">Talbott raises a <em>Miranda </em>issue with regard to the use of pretrial statements made to a court official. During the course of an interview with a probation officer regarding pretrial services, Talbott admitted that he was represented by counsel with regard to several prior convictions. However, he now claims there no longer exists any record of such representation and that the government\u2019s inability to prove that he was represented would foreclose consideration of such conviction(s) in calculating his criminal history category. By failing to properly warn him that the statements during the pretrial services interview could result in a longer sentence, he contends that his right to remain silent and his right to counsel were violated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">The simple answer to Talbott\u2019s argument is that the waiver form which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>executed did adequately warn him of his right to remain silent and to seek the assistance of an attorney; the form also advised him that an attorney would be provided if he could not afford one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The waiver form further expressly informed him that the information provided to the pretrial services officer would also be made available to the probation officer who would prepare a presentence report in the event of a conviction. It is hard to imagine a clearer expression of the rights which Talbott claims were violated. Moreover, elicitation of the information regarding prior representation was not relevant to the charged offenses; as such, it does not constitute interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. <em>See United States v. McLaughlin, 7777 </em>F.2d 388, 391-92 (8th Cir.1985). Indeed, the information regarding criminal history is properly considered by the court in determining whether to release or detain a suspect pending trial. <em>Id. </em>at 392; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(3)(A). We find no constitutional violation arising from the consideration of these past convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">The district court clearly stated that the decision to depart upward was not dependent on the findings involved in the Guideline determinations and that the career criminal enhancement had no bearing on the final departure decision. In other words, the sentence would have been the same regardless of the Guideline maximum. The length of the Guideline maximum, however, may be relevant in assessing the reasonableness of the departure. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>878 F.2d 164, 166 (5th Cir.1989). The sentencing court should normally first determine the correct Guideline range even if a departure is being made. <em>United States v. Warters, </em>885 F.2d 1266, 1272 (5th Cir.1989). In the instant appeal, the incorrect application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, coupled with the illegal pyramiding of the \u00a7 5861 sentences, mandates a remand for resentencing. We express no opinion, however, on whether a departure is warranted or on whether a departure to the allowable statutory maximum is reasonable. Our conclusions with regard to the sentencing issues are summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">(1) Talbott\u2019s prior convictions are not \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 and, therefore, he may not be sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">(2) The increase in the offense level for use of special skills (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3) is properly based on both Talbott\u2019s skill in changing his identity as well as on his skill in manufacturing pipebombs. Therefore, the Guideline sentence range is 41-51 months, based on an offense level of 16 and a criminal history category V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-11\">(3) Without reaching the issue of whether the court erred in departing upward, we hold that consecutive sentences in excess of ten years may not be imposed for convictions under both 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c) and (d) to the extent that such convictions relate to the same firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">. On the government\u2019s motion, convictions on three fugitive counts (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(2)) and two false statement counts (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6)) were vacated prior to sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1253-16\">. The convictions arising out of Talbott's purchase and possession of the pistol (counts 1 and 10, respectively) were subject to pre-Guidelines sentences. Neither the convictions nor the resulting sentences are involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">. A motion to suppress evidence must normally be raised prior to trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3). Although Talbott\u2019s motion was made during trial, the court reached the merits as if it had been timely made. We likewise will reach the merits of Talbott's claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1254-17\">.
