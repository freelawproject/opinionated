We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b859-20\">In a lengthy analysis, the Claims Court detailed the facts with respect to the unusual nature of motion picture film stock which is the subject of the asserted \u201ccharitable contribution,\u201d as well as the events leading up to the transfer of certain rights therein to the Library of Congress. Familiarity with that opinion is presumed. <em>See Transamerica Corporation v. United States, </em>15 Cl.Ct. 420, 443-475 (1988). Taxpayer\u2019s involvement in the charitable contributions issue, which was only part of the proceedings below, stems from its ownership in 1969 of United Artists Corporation. For convenience we refer to both entities as \u201ctaxpayer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-21\">The physical property which is the subject matter of the transfer consists primarily of original film negatives of motion pictures on nitrate-base film. Nitrate-base film negatives are not directly \u201cviewable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444-446. Such film is unusable except to strike a positive therefrom. A master negative can be made on safety film from that positive, which is then used to make duplicate negatives. These materials are generally called \u201cpreprint\u201d materials. An exhibition \u201cprint\u201d, which is a viewable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>film, may be made from a duplicate negative. The trial court characterized the unusual nature of nitrate-base film as follows: \u201cNitrate-base film is highly flammable, potentially explosive, and, with the passage of time, decomposes. Ultimately nitrate-base film self-destructs and ceases to exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. To prevent eventual loss of the images (and sound) on such film, the court noted that they must be transferred to safety film or preserved in some other manner. <em>Id. </em>In 1969, at the time of the transfer, there was no charitable institution, archive, or museum that had vault facilities or resources adequate to store taxpayer\u2019s collection of nitrate-base film. <em>Id. </em>Taxpayer sought to give them to the University of Wisconsin, which had established a Center of Film and Theater Research, and was apprised that the University could not accept nitrate film, although it accepted a substantial gift of studio memorabilia and documents, as well as safety films, from taxpayer. The Library of Congress, on the other hand, in cooperation with the American Film Institute, has solicited motion pictures on nitrate film from which preservation masters can be made as part of its program to preserve early motion pictures as an historical and scholarly heritage. To build up its collections (whether loaned or by a transfer of ownership), the Library obligated itself to make preservation masters from nitrate negatives. 15 CLCt. at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">By a document entitled \u201cInstrument of Gift,\u201d taxpayer conveyed \u201ctitle in and set[ ] over\u201d a large number of nitrate-base motion picture films to the United States for inclusion in the collections of the Library of Congress. The \u201cgift\u201d was stated to be of the \u201cphysical property ... only,\u201d and \u201cexcept for the gift herein made, the Donor reserves all right, title, and interest in and to all the property constituting the Collection.\u201d With respect to use, the donor permitted the Library to convert the nitrate film to safety film which would become the \u201cphysical property\u201d of the Library. The Library agreed that, except for access by taxpayer and the University, use of all original and converted films would be \u201climited to private study on the Library\u2019s premises by researchers engaged in serious research.\u201d No reproductions were allowed; nor was screening for the general public permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The trial court analyzed the \u201cgift\u201d document as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">In structure, the Library agreement was more than a simple instrument of gift. It involved reciprocal undertakings. The agreement authorized the Library to convert the image and sound recorded on nitrate-base film onto safety stock to make preservation preprint material and prints, which preservation pre-print material and prints would become the physical property of the Library. [Taxpayer\u2019s] reservation of commercial exploitation, reproduction, and other intangible rights applied to the use of the safety stock preprint material and preservation prints that the Library converted from the nitrate negatives. Upon physical delivery of the nitrate film, the Library was obliged to store, care for and maintain the property at its sole expense. [Taxpayer] reserved, and the University [of Wisconsin] was given, the right of access on demand to have the Library process orders for positive safety prints to be made from either the nitrate negatives or from the Library\u2019s preservation safety preprint materials. With [taxpayer\u2019s] prior written consent, the Library could trade [sic, \u201ctransfer possession of\u201d] a limited number of the components of the collection to other institutions in exchange for other motion picture materials, but only if the other archive agreed in writing to assume all the terms and conditions imposed on the Library.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-8\">The access provisions [for taxpayer] incorporated in the Library agreement were negotiated at [taxpayer\u2019s] request and were as broad as any ever extended by the Library. During trial, Library officials explained that [taxpayer\u2019s] right of access was the \u201cprice\u201d the Library had to pay for the rights it obtained in the Library Property, and that the concessions made to [taxpayer] during the negotiations were part of the \u201cgive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>take\u201d between the parties and a \u201ctradeoff\u201d of rights and obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 469-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The cost of the conversion to safety film which the Library undertook to make was well over $1 million. 15 Cl.Ct. at 471. Taxpayer contributed nothing towards this cost, although it received the right, to the exclusion of other members of the public, to obtain access to the Library\u2019s safety film for commercial purposes in perpetuity. Even after the relinquishment of copyright, the Library agreed to make such materials available only to educational institutions for scholarly research and then only with taxpayer\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The Claims Court found that there was no market at the time of the transfer in which taxpayer could have sold its nitrate negatives, stripped of all intangible rights in the motion picture, for scholarly or archival uses or as historical artifacts. Per the Claims Court, the nitrate films as physical property had no fair market value in November, 1969. 15 Cl.Ct. at 475. It specifically rejected taxpayer\u2019s analogies of the nitrate film to unique property which could be commercially evaluated as a collector\u2019s item (property such as that gifted to the University).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">The Claims Court relied on the principle that when a donation is made with the expectation of receiving a substantial benefit in return, no charitable contribution has been made within the meaning of section 170(a). <em>Ottawa Silica Co. v. United States, </em>699 F.2d 1124, 1132 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Singer Co. v. United States, </em>449 F.2d 413, 423, 196 Ct.Cl. 90 (1971). In applying that principle to the facts here, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_D\">In the transfer of the Library property, the benefit received by the Library was the right to make preservation copies of the nitrate negatives. This benefit brought with it substantial expense to the Library for care and maintenance, and in the costs of copying. The benefits received by [taxpayer] were (1) continued access for its commercial interests to both the physical property in the nitrate negatives given and access to the Library\u2019s preservation copies, [and] (2) relief from the costs and potential liability for the storage, maintenance, and care of nitrate negatives. Benefits to [taxpayer] were substantial, and were sufficient to provide [taxpayer] with a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the transfer. These benefits to [taxpayer], accordingly, effectively destroyed the charitable nature of the transfer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">15 Cl.Ct. at 475. For reasons which follow, we agree that taxpayer has not established reversible error in the disallowance of the claimed deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">The ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue enjoys a presumption of correctness and a taxpayer bears the burden of proving it to be wrong. <em>Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933). Thus, the taxpayer must come forward with enough evidence to support a finding contrary to the Commissioner\u2019s determination. <em>Danville Plywood Corp. v. United States, </em>899 F.2d 3, 7 (Fed.Cir.1990). Even after that burden is satisfied, taxpayer must satisfy the ultimate burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Under section 170(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 170(a)(1), a deduction from gross income is allowable for any \u201ccharitable contribution,\u201d payment of which is made within the taxable year. That phrase is defined, <em>inter alia, </em>in section 170(c)(1) as \u201ca contribution or gift to or for the use of ... the United States ... but only if the contribution or gift is made for exclusively public purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">Not every transfer of property to the United States or to a charitable institution which is denominated a charitable contribution or gift falls within the ambit of the section. \u201cA payment of money [or transfer of property] generally cannot constitute a charitable contribution if the contributor expects a substantial benefit in return.\u201d <em>United States v. American Bar Endowment, </em>477 U.S. 105, 116-17, 106 S.Ct. 2426, 2432-33, 91 L.Ed.2d 89 (1986). To the same effect is <em>Hernandez v. Commissioner, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 109 S.Ct. 2136, 2144, 104 L.Ed.2d 766 (1989) (payment to church for special religious evaluation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>education sessions not charitable contribution). <em>See also </em>S.Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 196 (1954); H.R.Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1954), <em>reprinted in </em>1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4017, 4180, 4831).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Taxpayer recognizes the above rule but argues that it is only one of two methods for determining the presence of a charitable contribution. Per taxpayer, under the second method, which it argues is applicable here, any anticipated substantial benefit to the donor is not fatal to the deduction so long as such benefit is of less value than the benefit to the donee. Thus, it is taxpayer\u2019s position that the Claims Court erred in holding there was no charitable deduction because the court did not determine the comparable dollar values for the respective benefits each party received.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Contrary to taxpayer\u2019s argument, we understand the cited precedent to set forth a single <em>general rule </em>that a purported gift is at least presumptively negated by the receipt of a substantial benefit in return. The benefits each party received need not be quantified and compared to place the transaction within the general rule stated in <em>American Bar Endowment. </em>Such comparison is, as an initial matter, not necessary. <em>Cf. Hernandez v. Commissioner, </em>109 S.Ct. 2136; <em>Ottawa Silica Co., </em>699 F.2d at 1132; <em>Singer Co., </em>449 F.2d at 422-23. Where in return for a transfer, a taxpayer receives something patently of more than nominal value from the transferee (whether economic or other), a benefit which other members of the public do not receive, a presumption arises that the transfer from taxpayer to the government or charity was not a gift or at least not a gift in its entirety. An identifiable benefit presumptively provides a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the transfer. Where a transaction has an \u201cinherently reciprocal nature\u201d when looked at in its entirety, there is no debate that the entire value of the donor\u2019s property which was transferred may not be deducted. <em>Hernandez v. Commissioner, </em>109 S.Ct. at 2145.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Taxpayer maintains that it is entitled to deduct the entire value of the nitrate film, whatever value is placed on it, because it received nothing more than <em>de minimis </em>value in exchange. Per taxpayer, the <em>quid pro quo </em>analysis is, thus, inapplicable. It asserts that the only benefit it received was relief from storage and insurance for the nitrate film and that this benefit was negligible. However, the Claims Court found that, as part of the transaction, the Library committed itself to make preservation copies of taxpayer\u2019s motion pictures and agreed that taxpayer would have an exclusive right of access to that converted material, as well as access to transferred materials. The finding of the Claims Court with respect to the Library\u2019s obligation is not clearly erroneous. Further, we agree with the interpretation that the agreement gave taxpayer the rights of access delineated by the Claims Court. Moreover, the right of access to the converted materials which would be made by the Library was not a \u201creserved\u201d right, as taxpayer would have it, but one that came into being as a result of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Taxpayer also denigrates the value of any access right, asserting that it had little need for access because it had largely converted its collection of nitrate films before transferring them to the Library. However, it is not the frequency of access that is important, but, rather, whether the benefit received from the transferee is \u201csubstantial.\u201d In the <em>Singer </em>case, the court defined \u201csubstantial benefits\u201d to mean \u201cbenefits greater than those that inure to the general public from transfers for charitable purposes.\u201d <em>Singer Co., </em>449 F.2d at 423. In <em>Singer, </em>the taxpayer was allowed no section 170(a) deduction for the discount allowed on sewing machines to schools because of the expectation of receiving increased future sales from students. In <em>Ottawa Silica, </em>the taxpayer was allowed no section 170(a) deduction for the transfer of land for a public school site because he received the benefit of increased value to his adjoining property from public roads being built to the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Here, the availability to taxpayer of its entire collection as needed, for duplication for commercial exploitation in perpetuity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>together with the exclusion of all others from obtaining copies, even after taxpayer\u2019s copyright expired, places taxpayer in a unique position, one far different from the public at large. Moreover, at the same time taxpayer was relieved of the expense of storage. We agree with the Claims Court that the facts here give rise to receipt of a \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d by taxpayer in exchange for the benefits received by the Library. Thus, by reason of taxpayer\u2019s receipt of such benefit, the presumption arises that a charitable contribution was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">A taxpayer may, in certain circumstances, be able to rebut the above presumption at least in part and, thereby, obtain a partial deduction. In <em>American Bar Endowment, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that some transfers to a charitable institution admit to division into two parts, one being a payment for a thing of value and the other, a charitable contribution. As stated there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">A taxpayer may ... claim a deduction for the difference between a payment to a charitable organization and the market value of the benefit received in return, on the theory that the payment has the \u201cdual character\u201d of a purchase and a contribution. See, <em>e.g., </em>Rev.Rul. 67-246, 1967-2 Cum.Bull. 104 (price of ticket to charity ball deductible to extent it exceeds market value of admission); Rev. Rul. 68-432, 1968-2 Cum.Bull. 104, .105 (noting possibility that payment to charitable organization may have \u201cdual character\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-8\">In Rev.Rul. 67-246, <em>supra, </em>the IRS set up a two-part test for determining when part of a \u201cdual payment\u201d is deductible. First, the payment is deductible only if and to the extent it exceeds the market value of the benefit received. Second, the excess payment must be \u201cmade with the intention of making a gift.\u201d 1967-2 Cum.Bull., at 105.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">477 U.S. at 117, 106 S.Ct. at 2433. The Court specifically approved that two-part standard. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 106 S.Ct. at 2433-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Taxpayer argues, if this court believes the transfer here has a \u201cdual character,\u201d we need only subtract the cost of storage of the nitrate films from taxpayer\u2019s evaluation of the nitrate films to arrive at the net amount of the charitable contribution. However, for reasons previously indicated, taxpayer\u2019s view as to the benefit it received is too restrictive. Taxpayer did not \u201cpurchase\u201d storage facilities for the nitrate film, as one might purchase the dinner portion of a fund-raising affair. While relief from storage costs was a benefit, that was not the entirety of the benefit taxpayer received. In addition, taxpayer was given the right of exclusive access to a permanent collection of preserved films which the Library would maintain at its expense and which only taxpayer could commercially exploit or even freely view. Thus, taxpayer\u2019s proposed mathematical equation in which only storage costs are deducted is inherently defective. Moreover, taxpayer put in no evidence here as to what its exclusive right of access was worth. Taxpayer simply refused and continues to refuse to acknowledge that access was part of the <em>quid pro quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Having failed to prove the value of its own benefit in the equation, taxpayer\u2019s arguments concerning the error of the Claims Court in evaluating the benefit received by the Library need not be addressed. We would note only that we do not read the Claims Court\u2019s opinion as saying, as taxpayer asserts, that the rights received by the Library had no value. The court found that bare legal title to the nitrate films <em>with no other rights </em>had no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">In view of the above, taxpayer\u2019s assertion that the Claims Court erred by failing to determine a net amount of the deduction on the basis of the evidence it proffered is untenable. No reversible error has been shown. The first requirement of the \u201cdual character\u201d test simply was not met. Accordingly, we need not address the arguments of taxpayer that it had the requisite intent and, therefore, that the second part of the \u201cdual character\u201d test was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">In sum, because taxpayer received a <em>quid pro quo </em>in the form of a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>benefit for the transfer of property to the Library, the transaction falls within the general rule that there was no gift. Further, the burden was on taxpayer to establish the facts necessary to receive a partial deduction under the dual character test of <em>American Bar Endowment. </em>As in that controlling precedent, taxpayer failed to prove its claim for a partial deduction. <em>See also, Hernandez v. Commissioner, </em>109 S.Ct. at 2146, n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">We conclude that taxpayer has failed to demonstrate that the Claims Court committed reversible error in upholding the disal-lowance of a deduction under section 170(a)(1) of the Code for all or part of the subject transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
