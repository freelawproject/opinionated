Conrad was admitted to the practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of law in the State of New York by the Second Judicial Department on January 26, 2000, and at all times relevant to this proceeding has maintained an office for the practice of law within the First Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The Departmental Disciplinary Committee now seeks an order, pursuant to 22 NYCRR 603.4 (e) (1) (i), immediately suspending respondent from the practice of law based on her failure to cooperate with the Committee\u2019s investigation into two complaints alleging professional misconduct which threatens the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">One of the complaints was brought by an attorney who appeared in an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in which respondent represented an opposing party. This attorney alleged that respondent violated court orders and failed to appear as directed, ultimately resulting in the dismissal of the action. The second complaint was brought by an attorney who had hired respondent to appear and submit opposition to an order to show cause; he discovered thereafter that respondent had failed to do so, and as a result the application he had hired respondent to oppose was granted on consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Respondent has failed to date to respond to the Committee\u2019s requests for responses to these complaints, or to subpoenas thereafter served on her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">This Court may suspend an attorney from the practice of law pending consideration of charges of professional misconduct upon a finding that she is \u201cguilty of professional misconduct immediately threatening the public interest\u201d (22 NYCRR 603.4 [e] [1]). Such a finding may be based upon \u201cthe attorney\u2019s default in responding to the petition or notice, or the attorney\u2019s failure to submit a written answer to pending charges of professional misconduct or to comply with any lawful demand of this court or the Departmental Disciplinary Committee made in connection with any investigation, hearing or disciplinary proceeding\u201d (22 NYCRR 603.4 [e] [1] [i]). Respondent\u2019s failure to respond and to appear pursuant to subpoenas \u201cevinces a shocking disregard for the judicial system, and can only be interpreted as a deliberate and willful attempt to impede the Committee\u2019s investigation\u201d <em>(see Matter of Gordon, </em>142 AD2d 135, 137 [1988]).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Accordingly, the Committee\u2019s motion should be granted and respondent suspended from the practice of law, effective immediately, until such time as disciplinary matters pending before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the Committee have been concluded and further order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">Saxe, J.P., Friedman, Sweeny, McGuire and Malone, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Respondent suspended from the practice of law in the State of New York, effective the date hereof, until such time as disciplinary matters pending before the Committee have been concluded and until further order of this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
