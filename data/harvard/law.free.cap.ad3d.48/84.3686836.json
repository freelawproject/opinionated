At all relevant times, respondent maintained an office for the practice of law within this Judicial Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">On November 13, 2006, respondent pleaded guilty to a felony information filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in violation of 18 USC \u00a7 1960. Based on this conduct, he was sentenced to 18 months incarceration and supervised release for two years. As a special condition of his supervision, respondent agreed to surrender his law license.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The Departmental Disciplinary Committee asks this Court for an order, pursuant to Rules of this Court (22 NYCRR) \u00a7 603.11, accepting respondent\u2019s affidavit of resignation from the practice of law and striking his name from the roll of attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">In his affidavit of resignation, sworn to September 4, 2007, respondent acknowledges that based on his guilty plea, and the pending disciplinary investigation/proceeding against him, if charges were brought predicated upon his misconduct he could not successfully defend himself on the merits against such charges. He states that his resignation is freely and voluntarily rendered, and is given free from coercion or duress, and that he is fully aware of the implications of submitting his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">As respondent\u2019s affidavit of resignation fully complies with the requirements of Rules of this Court (22 NYCRR) \u00a7 603.11 (a), the Committee\u2019s motion should be granted, respondent\u2019s resignation accepted and, effective nunc pro tunc to September 4, 2007, his name stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law in the State of New York.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Lippman, P.J., Andelas, Williams, Buckley and Kavanagh, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Respondent\u2019s name stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law in the State of New York, nunc pro tunc to September 4, 2007.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-12\"> We decline to accept the Committee\u2019s recommendation that respondent\u2019s name be stricken from the roll of attorney\u2019s nunc pro tunc to November 13, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
