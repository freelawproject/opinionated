That the hazard at issue\u2014debris accumulated as a result of the demolition\u2014was readily observable does not absolve Liberty of liability, because the hazard was not inherent in the work being performed by plaintiff, an electrician, at the time of the accident <em>(see Bombero v NAB Constr. Corp., </em>10 AD3d 170, 171 [2004]). Similarly, plaintiffs Labor Law \u00a7 241 (6) claim predicated on 12 NYCRR 23-1.7 (e) (2) was properly sustained as against Hennegan, because the debris was not an integral part of the work being performed by the plaintiff at the time of the accident <em>(see Maza v University Ave. Dev. Corp., </em>13 AD3d 65, 65-66 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">DBAB, the owner, and Hennegan should have been granted summary judgment on their claim for contractual indemnification against Liberty, notwithstanding that the indemnification requirement was embodied in an agreement executed after the accident in question,.as they submitted competent evidence sufficient to establish that the agreement was actually entered into before the accident date and that the parties intended that it apply as of when it was entered into, and none of the evidence was controverted by Liberty <em>(see Flores v Lower E. Side Serv. Ctr., Inc., 4 </em>NY3d 363, 371 [2005]). Furthermore, summary judgment should have been granted to DBAB and Hennegan on their claim for common-law indemnification against Liberty, since they were free from active negligence and Liberty had direct control over the work giving rise to the injury <em>(see Rodriguez v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>234 AD2d 156, 156 [1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Finally, we decline to review the court\u2019s dismissal of DBAB\u2019s and Hennegan\u2019s cross claim against Liberty for breach of contract based on Liberty\u2019s alleged failure to procure insurance, as that particular issue is not preserved for review.

Although Liberty unquestionably supervised the work out of which the claims arose, the hazard at issue\u2014sheetrock debris accumulated during the ongoing interior demolition work\u2014was \u201cpart of or inherent in\u201d the work being performed at the time of the accident <em>(see Bombero v NAB Constr. Corp., </em>10 AD3d 170, 171 [2004], quoting <em>Gasper v Ford Motor Co., </em>13 NY2d 104, 110 [1963]). Similarly, plaintiffs Labor Law \u00a7 241 (6) claim predicated on 12 NYCRR 23-1.7 (e) (2) should have been dismissed as against Hennegan, because plaintiff slipped on the accumulation of debris on the floor while stringing temporary lights to make sure the area being demolished was well lit. Unlike the debris in <em>Maza v University Ave. Dev. Corp. </em>(13 AD3d 65 [2004]), the case relied upon by the majority, the accumulation of debris here was clearly an integral part of the work being performed at the time of the accident, and the accumulation of debris was an unavoidable and inherent result of the ongoing demolition project <em>(see Bond v York Hunter Constr., </em>270 AD2d 112, 113 [2000], <em>affd </em>95 NY2d 883 [2000]). This is not a situation where the debris was left at the work site overnight or longer without being removed <em>(see e.g. Singh v Young Manor, Inc., </em>23 AD3d 249 [2005]). There was no evidence that it was allowed to accumulate over time, as was the case in <em>Maza </em>(13 AD3d at 65).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
