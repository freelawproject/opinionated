The statements were admitted as excited utterances. Defendant also argues that the admission of the statements violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation under <em>Crawford v Washington </em>(541 US 36 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The trial evidence reveals the following. In late July 1994, the victim, Richard Moore, was selling drugs out of a building located at 154 West 130th Street in Manhattan, employing two or three \u201cyoung kids\u201d who assisted him in selling cocaine, heroin and crack. John Haywood, who had known Moore since 1977, released from prison that same month, looked up Moore. For the first few days after his initial visit with Moore, Haywood took no part in Moore\u2019s drug operation. About a week later, he began working for Moore, five days a week, 12 hours a day, for about $200 per week. The drugs were generally kept in an apartment with a certain amount kept in a mailbox downstairs. Haywood would station himself in front of the building, waiting for customers to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">About two weeks after Haywood began working, he and Moore were standing outside the building when defendant, whom Moore identified as \u201cTommy,\u201d rode up on a bicycle. Defendant and Moore engaged in conversation, which Haywood could not hear, although he did notice that the conversation did not appear to be friendly. After defendant left, Moore informed Hay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>wood that the two had had a prior drug relationship, but that there had been a difference of opinion. Haywood resolved to \u201ckeep an eye out\u201d for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">That same week, Haywood saw defendant on two different occasions passing by Moore\u2019s drug spot. Thereafter, Haywood noticed that defendant had his own drug operation on 130th Street. About a week after first meeting defendant, Haywood, alone and in front of Moore\u2019s drug spot, was approached by a woman whom he had never met before. She asked Haywood if he was working; responding that he was, he directed her into the building. Haywood followed the woman inside and sold her a bag of heroin for $10, after which the woman left.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Within minutes, Moore pulled up in his car and walked over to Haywood. As the two men talked, Haywood noticed that the woman who had just made the drug purchase was approaching with defendant. Speaking to Moore, defendant asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this I\u2019m hearing, you are using my name in your spot?\u201d Moore replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d The woman spoke up, \u201cI just bought something from there and you said it was Tommy\u2019s stuff,\u201d at which point Haywood acknowledged that he had just sold her a bag of heroin, but insisted he had \u201cnever said that we were working for Tommy or we had Tommy\u2019s product.\u201d Defendant warned Moore, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this no more, I don\u2019t want no more customers coming down here telling me that you are serving them using my name.\u201d Moore kept insisting that he did not know what defendant was talking about. At the end of the discussion defendant walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On August 15, 1994, about a week and a half later, shortly before 9:00 p.m., Moore\u2019s friend, Anthony Pinkston, was sitting on the stoop of an abandoned building while Moore and Haywood were standing in front of the drug spot \u201ctwo doors away.\u201d At that point a regular customer who lived in the building called out to Haywood. He was about to attend to her, when a shot rang out and flew over his head. Haywood, \u201cin shock,\u201d ducked down and covered his head. When he turned, he saw Moore falling back onto a chair. Haywood then observed defendant, with a ski hat folded over his forehead, stepping onto the sidewalk, no more than four to five feet away, by the curb. Haywood looked directly at defendant\u2019s face and had no doubt as to the shooter\u2019s identity. Panicking as defendant continued shooting, he pushed the woman who was looking to purchase drugs into the building and both fled up the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Pinkston, who had never before met defendant, testified that he observed a man approaching on a bicycle, wearing a black and gray mask that covered the lower half of his face. The man pulled out a long silver gun from behind his back, prompting Pinkston to scream out to Moore, \u201cRich, he got the jammy.\u201d Pinkston, unsure who the gunman\u2019s target was, also ran into the building as two more shots rang out. As he ran up the stairs, he heard three more shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Roth Haywood and Pinkston ended up together on the roof, from which they looked down and saw Moore lying prone on the sidewalk and defendant riding off on his bicycle. Haywood ran downstairs and, finding that Moore was still alive, cradled him as he tried to talk. Moore said, \u201c[I]t was Tommy,\u201d and Haywood replied, \u201cI know, don\u2019t talk, I know.\u201d A friend of Haywood\u2019s pulled him away, telling him to \u201cget out of here.\u201d Haywood eventually flagged down a taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Pinkston testified that by the time he reached Moore, he was coughing blood and in \u201cpretty bad shape.\u201d Moore told him he had been hit \u201ctwo or three\u201d times. Pinkston used Moore\u2019s cell phone to call 911. Moore said to Pinkston, \u201cGet the smoke off me, get the smoke off me. . . . The smoke is in my sock.\u201d Still coughing up blood, Moore then said, \u201cThat punk ass nigger Gantt shot me.\u201d When Pinkston asked, \u201cWho?\u201d Moore repeated, \u201cThat punk ass nigger Tommy Gantt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">At about 8:50 p.m., Police Officer McDermott, on radio motor patrol on 150th Street, received a transmission of a \u201cmale shot.\u201d Arriving at the scene, she found Moore, lying on the sidewalk, shot in the left thigh and stomach. Although Moore was conscious, his condition appeared critical. When McDermott asked who shot him, Moore replied, \u201cTommy Grant.\u201d Pinkston, still present at the scene, furnished Moore\u2019s pedigree information to McDermott.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Moore underwent emergency surgery that same night. After undergoing a series of operations and transfusions, his condition seemed to improve, but later began to deteriorate. He died on New Year\u2019s Day, 1995, 4V2 months after being shot, never having left the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Haywood did not contact the police about the shooting even after he learned that Moore had died. More than five years later, when Haywood was serving a prison sentence, a police detective investigating the double homicide of Haywood\u2019s nephew and the nephew\u2019s girlfriend spoke to Haywood, who, although not an eyewitness, was helpful in aiding the police in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>determining, inter alia, the motive for the killings. About two months later, both the detective and the trial prosecutor in the double homicide interviewed Haywood a second time. At one point, Haywood, acknowledging the detective\u2019s role in working on \u201cold homicides,\u201d told him he had once witnessed one and provided information about the Moore shooting, including the month and year it occurred and the name \u201cTommy\u201d as the killer. Upon further investigation, the detective located Pinkston and ultimately, defendant, leading to this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Defendant does not contest the legal sufficiency of the evidence against him, although in the course of arguing that the trial court improperly admitted the victim\u2019s statements identifying him as the shooter, he claims that the other evidence against him was \u201cextraordinarily weak.\u201d A review of the record, however, shows that defendant\u2019s guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt not only by the statements of the victim after he was shot and lay bleeding on the ground, but also, independently, through the identification testimony of the witness Haywood.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On appeal, as noted, defendant argues that the challenged statements made to Haywood, Pinkston and Officer McDermott, identifying him as Moore\u2019s assailant, do not fall within the excited utterance exception to the prohibition against hearsay evidence, and that their admission violated his right of confrontation. In denying the motion to preclude, the court determined that the statements, made \u201cwithin minutes of the shooting, clearly qualiffy as] excited utterances under New York law,\u201d that none of them was testimonial within the meaning of <em>Crawford, </em>and that they were sufficiently reliable otherwise to meet federal and state constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">An extrajudicial statement will be admitted under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule when it relates to a startling event and is made while the declarant remains under the stress of excitement caused by the startling event <em>(see People v Johnson, </em>1 NY3d 302, 306 [2003]; <em>People v Nieves, </em>67 NY2d 125, 135 [1986]). Such statements are considered intrinsically reliable by virtue of the fact that when a declarant speaks under the influence of such stress or excitement, his or her reflective capacity, and thus the ability to fabricate, is stilled <em>(id.). </em>The test for admission of such a statement is whether the declarant was \u201cso influenced by the excitement and shock of the event that it is probable that he or she spoke impulsively and without reflection\u201d <em>(People v Caviness, </em>38 NY2d 227, 231 [1975]; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>People v Brown, 70 </em>NY2d 513, 522 [1987]). It is well established that even responses to questions may qualify as excited utterances <em>(People v Edwards, </em>47 NY2d 493 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In deciding whether a statement qualifies as an excited utterance, the court must determine the nature of the startling or traumatic event, the time lapse between the occurrence and the statement, the activities of the declarant in the interim to ascertain whether he had the opportunity to deliberate and depart from the truth, and whether circumstances indicate that the \u201cremarks were not made under the impetus of studied reflection\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 497). Ultimately, a statement\u2019s admissibility is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court, whose ruling should not be disturbed, absent a clear abuse of discretion <em>(see People v Carroll, </em>95 NY2d 375, 385 [2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">That the statements at issue were precipitated by an event that was startling and traumatic to Moore is beyond dispute. As to the time lapse between the event and the statement, the time for reflection is not measured in minutes or seconds, but rather by the facts <em>(People v Vasquez, </em>88 NY2d 561, 579 [1996]). Moore\u2019s identifications of defendant to Haywood, Pinkston and Officer McDermott, as he lay seriously wounded and bleeding on the sidewalk almost immediately after the shooting, were made under circumstances that did not allow for \u201cstudied reflection,\u201d but rather were uttered while Moore was \u201cunder the stress of excitement caused by [the] external event\u201d <em>(Edwards, </em>47 NY2d at 497). The evidence of Moore\u2019s mental and physical trauma from the shooting and his on-the-scene, close-in-time identification of defendant as his assailant rendered his statements \u201cnear-classic\u201d instances of the excited utterance exception <em>(see People v Fratello, </em>92 NY2d 565, 570 [1998], <em>cert denied </em>526 US 1068 [1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Defendant argues that the reliability of such statements was fatally undermined by Moore\u2019s statement to the police nine days after the shooting that he had identified defendant as the shooter merely because he had heard somebody on the street around the time of the shooting say defendant\u2019s name. In <em>Fratello, </em>the Court of Appeals rejected a similar argument where the victim made on-the-scene statements that qualified as excited utterances, despite a later recantation, both by affidavit and in his testimony as a defense witness that the defendant was not one of the two assailants. The victim\u2019s initial statements were properly admitted as excited utterances, since they \u201ccould rationally and objectively have been credited by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>court as inherently more reliable than [the victim\u2019s] later versions, formulated once 'there ha[d] been time to contrive and misrepresent\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 574 [citation omitted]; <em>see People v Torres, </em>196 AD2d 758 [1993], <em>lv denied </em>82 NY2d 854 [1993] [on-the-scene utterance by victim of shooting \u201cprovided adequate indicia of reliability\u201d despite his \u201cconflicting testimony before the grand jury\u201d eight days later]).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Similarly, the trial court correctly ruled that Moore\u2019s subsequent recantation of his on-the-scene identifications of defendant notwithstanding, his initial statements were demonstrably trustworthy so as to be admitted as excited utterances. In contrast, Moore\u2019s subsequent statements to the police, made nine days after the shooting, in which he claimed that he had been unable to see his assailant\u2019s face, were far less reliable. Upon \u201cstudied reflection,\u201d with every reason to believe that he had survived the shooting, Moore was undoubtedly convinced that it now was in his own self-interest to deny the earlier statements implicating a fellow drug dealer. Significantly, Moore\u2019s statement to the police denying that defendant was the shooter was intertwined with demonstrable lies; for example, despite evidence to the contrary, he told the police he did not even know defendant, even though he later confirmed that he and defendant had had a drug dispute similar to the one described by Haywood. Thus, as the trial court noted, Moore\u2019s recantation, while a factor in a jury\u2019s assessment of the weight to be given the identification statements, did not sufficiently undermine the reliability of those statements to render them inadmissible as excited utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Defendant argues that Moore\u2019s request that Pinkston remove the marijuana from his sock before the police arrived, indicating Moore\u2019s manifest self-interest, shows that at the time of the statements, \u201cit cannot... be said that he did not possess a sufficient mental state such that he was incapable of fabrication.\u201d While, as the trial court ruled, Moore\u2019s request was a \u201crelevant consideration\u201d for jury consideration on the weight to be given the statements, his severely impaired physical condition at the time rendered it highly unlikely that he had the opportunity to \u201cdeliberate and thus deviate from the truth\u201d as to the identity of the person who shot him <em>(People v Diaz, </em>21 AD3d 58, 66 [2005], <em>appeal dismissed </em>7 NY3d 831 [2006]). While a seriously wounded person might reflexively recognize the adverse consequences of having the police find drugs on him, it is quite improbable that such a person would have the capacity for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201cstudied reflection\u201d required to implicate intentionally the wrong person as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Nor is there merit to defendant\u2019s argument that, under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause as interpreted in <em>Crawford </em>(541 US 36 [2004], <em>supra), </em>the three statements at issue constituted testimonial hearsay that was improperly admitted. In <em>Ohio v Roberts </em>(448 US 56, 66 [1980]), the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of an unavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statement against a defendant in a criminal proceeding provided the statement \u201cbears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 . . . [which] can be inferred without more . . . where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d In <em>White v Illinois </em>(502 US 346, 355 n 8 [1992]), the Court noted that the exception to the hearsay rule for spontaneous declarations, synonymous with the excited utterance exception, was \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d (see <em>also People v Del Vermo, </em>192 NY 470, 483 [1908]). Thus, statements satisfying the excited utterance exception carried such indicia of reliability that a trial court\u2019s case-by-case assessment of reliability was not required for their admission in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court, in revisiting the admission of hearsay statements in criminal trials, examined the historical roots of the Confrontation Clause, noting that it was designed principally to address the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and in particular, its use of ex parte, pretrial examinations of witnesses as evidence against the accused, a common practice in England that the framers of the Constitution wished to ban (541 US at 50). These statements, free from the test of cross-examination, would later be introduced at trial as part of the prosecution\u2019s case. Thus, the Court held, the Confrontation Clause does not permit \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 53-54).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The Court defined \u201cthis core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements . . . [as] <em>\u2018ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent . . . such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 51). Testimonial statements would also include extrajudicial statements \u201ccontained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions,\u201d as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>as statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations, even though unsworn <em>(id. </em>at 52). In contrast, the Court indicated that the admission of nontestimonial hearsay statements, regardless of whether the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, was not barred. As the Court explained, \u201cWhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 68).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Applying these principles, the Supreme Court reversed Crawford\u2019s conviction. He had been charged with stabbing a man who had allegedly attempted to rape his wife. As part of the investigation, the police brought her to the precinct and, after reading her the <em>Miranda </em>rights, interviewed her and tape-recorded the interview. The defendant invoked the state\u2019s marital privilege and his wife did not testify. Her recorded interview was admitted, the trial court finding it reliable. The Supreme Court, abandoning its reliability test under <em>Ohio v Roberts, </em>found the wife\u2019s testimony to be \u201ctestimonial hearsay\u201d and inadmissible absent unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The Supreme Court subsequently availed itself of the opportunity to expound on its definition of testimonial hearsay in the companion cases of <em>Davis v Washington </em>and <em>Hammon v Indiana </em>(547 US 813 [2006]), in which statements by nontestifying declarants were admitted as excited utterances in each of the defendants\u2019 trials. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d (547 US at 822).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In <em>Davis, </em>Michelle McCottry called 911 but the call was terminated before anyone spoke. The 911 operator reversed the call and, in response to the operator\u2019s questions, McCottry explained that her boyfriend, the defendant, was in her house \u201cjumpin\u2019 \u201d on her again, and using his fists. The operator learned that the defendant had just run out the door and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>driving away. When the police arrived about four minutes later, they observed McCottry still shaken and frantic. She did not testify at trial; instead, the prosecutor played the 911 tape. The defendant was convicted of a felony for violating a domestic protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In <em>Hammon, </em>the police responded to a report of a domestic disturbance at the home of the defendant and his wife. On arrival, they observed the wife alone on the front porch. Although she appeared somewhat frightened, she assured the police that \u201cnothing was the matter\u201d and allowed them to enter the house, where they observed a gas heating unit with its glass front broken. They spoke to the defendant, who admitted that he and his wife had argued but that everything was \u201cfine\u201d now; he denied that it had become physical. In another room, the wife told the officers what had happened; one of them had her fill, out and sign a \u201cbattery affidavit\u201d describing the incident. She did not testify at trial, but the statements she made to the officers before filling out the affidavit were admitted as excited utterances. The defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Applying its \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test, the Court in <em>Davis </em>found that McCottry\u2019s initial statements to the 911 operator, identifying the defendant as her assailant, were not testimonial,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> noting that when it held, in <em>Crawford, </em>that interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within the class of testimonial hearsay (541 US at 53), it was referring to the type of interrogation conducted in <em>Crawford, </em>where the questioning was \u201csolely directed at establishing the facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide evidence to convict) the perpetrator\u201d (547 US at 826). In <em>Davis, </em>the Court found that the 911 operator\u2019s interrogation was not primarily to establish or prove some past fact, but rather \u201cto describe current circumstances requiring police assistance\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 827).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The Court found several important differences between the 911 operator\u2019s questions in <em>Davis </em>and the police interviews of Crawford\u2019s wife. McCottry was speaking about events as they were occurring, whereas the <em>Crawford </em>interrogation had taken place hours after the event. Furthermore, any reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>listener would realize that McCottry was seeking help for an ongoing emergency. The Court noted that \u201cthe nature of what was asked and answered in <em>Davis, </em>again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in Crawford) what had happened in the past\u201d <em>(id.). </em>This was so in <em>Davis </em>despite the operator\u2019s attempt to determine the identity of the perpetrator so that officers would know whether they would be confronting a violent felon. The Court also noted the significant difference between the interview in <em>Crawford </em>and the 911 operator\u2019s questions of McCottry. Crawford\u2019s wife \u201cwas responding calmly, at the station house, to a series of questions, with the officer-interrogator taping and making notes of her answers,\u201d whereas \u201cMcCottry\u2019s frantic answers were provided over the phone, in an environment that was not tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe\u201d <em>(id.). </em>All of these facts considered, the Court determined the primary purpose of the 911 operator\u2019s initial questions to McCottry was to enable the officers to meet the exigencies of an ongoing emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Mrs. Hammon\u2019s statements to the police officer, on the other hand, were held to be testimonial. As in <em>Crawford, </em>it was \u201centirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 829). The emergency was over; in fact, Hammon\u2019s wife told the officers that the dispute had ended and that everything was all right. Any questioning of her was conducted in order to investigate what had occurred, not what was occurring. And, although unlike <em>Crawford, </em>where the statement was taken at a police station, the interview was nonetheless conducted in a separate room from where the defendant was being detained, and Mrs. Hammon was asked to recount how the incident had begun and progressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">New York\u2019s Court of Appeals, in two recent cases, has applied the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>in determining whether a statement admitted at a criminal trial constituted testimonial hearsay and was improperly allowed in evidence. In <em>People v Bradley </em>(8 NY3d 124 [2006]), a police officer, responding to a 911 call, arrived at an apartment door to find a shaken woman, bleeding profusely and limping. In response to the officer\u2019s question as to what happened, the woman said her boyfriend had thrown her through a glass door. The of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>fleer found the defendant in the apartment and also observed a broken glass door. Applying the <em>Davis </em>\u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation\u201d analysis, the Court held that although the statement had been elicited in response to the police officer\u2019s inquiry, there had been no right of confrontation violation because \u201cthe officer\u2019s evident reason for asking the question was to deal with an emergency\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 125).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In <em>People v Nieves-Andino </em>(9 NY3d 12 [2007]), an associate of a drug dealer who was shot on a Bronx street where he sold drugs called 911. One of the police officers responding to the scene observed the victim bleeding and grimacing in pain. When the officer asked what happened, the victim responded that he had argued with a man named Bori, who shot him three times. In moving to exclude the victim\u2019s statement on the ground of testimonial hearsay, the defendant argued that because the assailant had left the crime scene and no longer posed a physical threat to the victim, the police officer\u2019s primary purpose in questioning the victim could not have been to deal with an ongoing emergency. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, refusing to accept such a restrictive interpretation of what constitutes a continuing emergency. \u201cEven when the assailant has fled, the circumstances of the police officer\u2019s questioning of the victim may objectively indicate that the officer reasonably assumed an ongoing emergency and acted with the primary purpose of preventing further harm\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 15). The officer\u2019s \u201cbrief solicitation\u201d of information was not an attempt to learn about past events, but rather \u201cwas part of [his] reasonable efforts to assess what had happened to cause [the victim\u2019s] injuries and whether there was any continuing danger to the others in the vicinity\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">With these precedents as our guideline, it is clear that none of the three statements challenged here was testimonial in nature. Moore\u2019s statements to his two friends, Haywood and Pinkston, as he lay bleeding on the ground, bear no similarity to the kind of formal interrogation by authorities that the Supreme Court found to be part of the \u201cSixth Amendment\u2019s core concerns\u201d <em>(Crawford, </em>541 US at 51). Nonetheless, defendant argues that when Moore, lying mortally wounded on a sidewalk, spoke to his two friends, he must have believed that his identification of defendant would enable the police to investigate and prosecute him. Suffice it to say that how his statements might be used in a police investigation and prosecution could not have been uppermost in Moore\u2019s mind at that moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Similarly, the statement to Officer McDermott was not testimonial. While Moore\u2019s statement was in response to Mc-Dermott\u2019s question, that solitary inquiry, posed to Moore in the course of a fast-moving on-the-scene crime investigation, is hardly the sort of structured police investigation to which <em>Crawford </em>is directed. As in <em>Nieves-Andino, </em>Officer McDermott, responding to the scene of a shooting that had just occurred, could not have been certain that the assailant posed no further threat to the victim or the onlookers. Clearly, the statement was elicited as in <em>Nieves-Andino, </em>as part of an attempt \u201cto assess what had happened to cause [the victim\u2019s] injuries and whether there was any continuing danger to the others in the vicinity\u201d (9 NY3d at 16), and not merely to learn what had happened in the past. In any event, given the unassailably correct admission of Moore\u2019s statements to Haywood and Pinkston, respectively, it is clear that Officer McDermott\u2019s testimony as to Moore\u2019s statement to her could have had no impact on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">We have examined defendant\u2019s other contentions and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of Supreme Court, New York County (Michael J.
