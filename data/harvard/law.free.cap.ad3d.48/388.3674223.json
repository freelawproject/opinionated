No appeal lies' from an order made upon the default of the appealing party <em>(see </em>CPLR 5511).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">To vacate the order dated July 5, 2006 the plaintiff was required, inter alia, to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for her default in opposing the NYCHA\u2019s motion, <em>(see Gironda v Katzen, </em>19 AD3d 644 [2005]; <em>Antoku v Grace Indus., </em>295 AD2d 294 [2002]). However, the plaintiff failed to provide a reasonable excuse for her failure to oppose the motion <em>(see Scoca v Bon Realty Corp., </em>284 AD2d 388 [2001]). She also failed to adequately explain her failure to comply with certain outstanding discovery demands and orders over a two-year period <em>(see Tutt v City of Yonkers, </em>11 AD3d 532 [2004]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>providently exercised its discretion in denying her motion, in effect, to vacate the order dated July 5, 2006. Crane, J.P., Fisher, Ritter, Covello and Dickerson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
