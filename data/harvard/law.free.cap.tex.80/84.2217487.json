The evidence shows that appellant was in the switch yard and on one'of its trades in advance of a standing Car which was moved by being struck by other cars placed upon the track. It was at a place where employes of the railway company had no reason to expect persons to be, and especially so at the time (half-past 4 a. m.) when he was injured. The morning was foggy, and it was not shown that the employes were wanting in due care. A verdict and judgment for the defendant can not be set aside as against the evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b100-12\">Appeal from Harris.

He was at a place where employes of appellee had no reason to expect persons to be, and especially so at the time in the morning when he was injured. The morning was foggy, and it is not shown that the employes of appellee were wanting in due care. Persons could pass over the switch yard on foot but it was not a public way, and the jury might well have come to the conclusion that appellant\u2019s negligence was the cause of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The charge of the court fairly submitted to the jury the questions on which depended the liability of the railway company, and it would be useless to discuss the charge in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The charge requested by appellant, in so far as applicable to the case made by the evidence, was embraced in the charge given, and the residue of the charge if given would have been likely to divert the minds of the jury from the real questions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">There was no error in the proceedings that led to the judgment, and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Delivered March 3, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
