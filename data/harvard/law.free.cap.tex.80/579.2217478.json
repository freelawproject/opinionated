Citation Against Corporation.\u2014A citation commanding the officer \u201cto summon J. N.

The petition showing that the only service in the case in' the Justice Court was the service of the citation 'directed to. W. J. Sayre, agent, and that the appellant never appeared in the case or waived service, it showed that the justice of the peace had never acquired authority to render judgment against the appellant.

Injunction is the proper remedy against a void judgment, and we submit that if the judgment be only voidable, where there is no other remedy, an injunction should be allowed. Witt v.

J. Sayre, agent of appellant, but not directing the citation of appellant, which was served on Sayre; that appellant did not appear, answer, or waive service, and that after this Craddock, after he had adjourned his court for the term, entered a judgment in favor, of Rawlins for $15, on which execution issued which was levied on personal property belonging to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The citation was made an exhibit to the petition, and commanded the officer \u201cto summon W. J. Sayre, agent for the Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Pe Railway Company, * * * to be and appear * * * then and there to answer unto Lee Rawlins in suit for damages for the killing of one half-bred calf, killed by the cars of the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Pe Railway Company oh or about the 17th day of September, 1887, and said calf living valued at $15,\u201d etc. The petition alleged that plaintiff had a good defense to the action, in that it alleged that the animal was not killed by plaintiff\u2019s cars, \u201cbut got into a mud hole and died from effects of injuries received while therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The defendants demurred as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">1. To the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter of the suit as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\"><em>2. </em>General demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">3. The following special demurrers:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">(1) Said petition shows no equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">(2) Said petition does 'not state any valid defense to the defendant Lee Rawlins\u2019 suit in the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">(3) Said petition does not show that plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">(4) Said petition shows that the plaintiff is attempting to get the District Court to exercise supervisory and appellate jurisdiction over the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">The demurrers .were sustained, injunction dissolved, and plaintiff declining to amend, its suit was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"Atx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The statute requires that citations from Justice Courts \u201cshall require the officer to summon the defendant to, appear and answer the plaintiff\u2019s suit,\u201d etc. Rev. Stats., art. 1570. It further provides that \u201cno judgment other than a judgment by confession shall be rendered by a justice of the peace against any party who has not entered an appearance or accepted or waived service, unless such party has been cited either personally or by publication.\u201d Rev. Stats., art. 1617.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The citation in question did not direct the officer to summon \u201cthe Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Bail way Company,\u201d the defendant, but simply directed that a person stated to be its agent should be summoned. Jurisdiction to render a judgment can be acquired only by compliance with what the law prescribes shall be done to confer it, and without a substantial compliance with this, power to render a judgment does not exist. The citation under consideration was not a substantial compliance with the law, and service of such a writ on the agent did not confer on the court from which it issued jurisdiction to render the judgment against the company. Railway Co. v. Sauls, 2 Ct. App. C. C., 242; Insurance Co. v. Seeligson, 59 Texas, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">A judgment rendered without jurisdiction is void and may be enjoined. Witt v. Kaufman, 25 Texas Supp., 384; Byars v. Justin, 2 Ct. App. C. C., 688, 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The judgment being for less than $20 no appeal or <em>certiorari </em>could be prosecuted to set it aside and injunction was the only remedy, and this the District Court had jurisdiction to grant. County of Anderson v. Kennedy, 58 Texas, 616; Alexander v. Holt, 59 Texas, 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">This view of the question will require the reversal of the judgment, and this renders it unnecessary to inquire whether the averments of the petition amount to a charge that the judgment was pronounced in vacation, or that it was rendered during the term but not entered in the judge\u2019s docket until after adjournment, nor to inquire what would be the effect of a judgment actually rendered during the term but not recorded until after adjournment, if then entered without notice to a defendant, even in a case in which the defendant' was properly cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">' The answer set up a good defense, and the court erred in sustaining the exceptions and dismissing the cause, and for this reason its judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Delivered April 24, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
