It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>alleged that defendant had failed to do either and recovery was asked under it-\u2014the value of the hoat. Testimony was introduced supporting the allegations. Defendant in answer alleged that it was to have the injured hoat repaired,'etc., and testimony was introduced in support of the answer. The charge of the court submitted as a basis of recovery by plaintiff a combination of facts gathered from the pleadings of both parties; upon which the jury found a verdict for plaintiff, and damages. <em>Held, </em>that as the cause of action declared on was the specific contract to furnish a new hoat or pay value of the hoat injured, the charge should have submitted it to the jury.

The court\u2019s charge to the jury that the payment of $300 to Waters &amp; Sons on the two boats ordered of them was a contention of appellant, and that appellant also contended that the damaged boat was to be so repaired as to make it as good as new, was without foundation as an issue in the case. There was no such contention, and such instruction was calculated to mislead the jury and distract their attention from the issues as made by the pleadings and the evidence. Rev.

The damaged boat was taken back to Uew York by the carrier, and having been there repaired by the manufacturers, it was brought back to Galveston by the defendant and again offered to the plaintiff upon condition that it would pay the balance \u00f3f the price which it had contracted to pay for the two boats, only one of which appears to have been forwarded or manufactured. The defendant declined to receive the boat when offered to it on said terms. The evidence was conflicting on the question as to whether the boat when repaired was as good as new. Witnesses for the defendant testified that it was so in all respects, but it was disputed by witnesses for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s contention is that it had paid $300 to Waters &amp; Co. in part payment on some paper boats that they were to make for and ship to plaintiff by defendant\u2019s st\u00e9amship, and that one of them was so shipped and damaged on the ship, and that plaintiff refused to receive it in that condition, and that thereupon the defendant promised, in consideration of the damage to the boat, that it would take it back and deliver a new boat in place of it or have it so repaired as to make it as good as new. - \u00b0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s contention is that it did not agree that it would deliver a new boat, but that it would take the boat back to Sew York and have the damage repaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence that the paper boat was damaged on defendant\u2019s ship, and that defendant agreed to replace it with \u00e1 new boat or have the repair made as good as new, and that the boat was taken to Sew York and repaired and brought back to Galveston and tendered to plaintiff but was refused by plaintiff, and that the repairs did not make the boat as good as new, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover damages for the breach of the contract, and the measure of damages would be the difference in value between a new one or one as good as new and the value of the repaired boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u201cBut unless you believe from the evidence'that the defendant did make a promise to return a new boat or make the repaired boat as good as new, the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">This charge was not applicable to the case made by the pleadings, and was misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The petition distinctly states plaintiff\u2019s cause of action to be that the defendant, in consideration of the liability it had incurred on account of the damage to the boat, promised to furnish plaintiff a new boat similar to the damaged one before it was injured, or would pay to it the value of such a boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Upon that contract, as plaintiff\u2019s pleading now stands, it must recover or it can not recover at all. Plaintiff having .introduced evidence to establish the 'contract alleged, the jury should have been instructed upon the issue so presented by the pleading, and the charge with regard to an undertaking by defendant to make the damaged boat as good as new and as to the difference in value between a new boat or one as good as new and the repaired boat (that issue not having been made by the pleadings of either party) should not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Delivered March 24, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
