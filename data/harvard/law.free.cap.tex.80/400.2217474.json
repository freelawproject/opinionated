Conspiracy. \u2014At common law a conspiracy can not \u25a0 \"be made the subject of a civil action, although damages result, unless something is done which without the conspiracy would give a right of action. The true test as to whether such action will lie is whether the act accomplished after the conspiracy is formed is itself actionable/</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b416-12\">2. Same. \u2014As a general rule a person has an absolute right to refuse to have business relations with any other person whomsoever, whether the refusal is based upon reason or on caprice, and there is no law which forces a man to part with the title to his property. Yet the proposition must be limited to the individual action of the party who asserts the right. It is not equally true that one person may from such motive influence another to do the same thing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b416-13\">3. Same \u2014 Case in Judgment.\u2014The petition by a butcher charging conspiracy among cattle dealers to his injury went further than to charge that defendants refused to sell to him. It charges that they not only did that, but that they induced a third person to refuse to sell to him. It does not appear from the petition that their interference with the business of plaintiff was done to serve any legitimate purpose of their own, but that it was done wantonly and maliciously and that it caused, as they intended it should, pecuniary loss to him. <em>Held, </em>that the petition alleged a cause of action, and that it was error to sustain a demurrer to it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-14\">Error from Galveston.

All confederacies wrongfully to prejudice a third person in any manner are misdemeanors at common law and are prohibited by our statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-17\">2. Where two or more persons combine to accomplish an unlawful purpose, or a purpose not unlawful by unlawful means, and in pursuance of such a conspiracy they do an act injurious to another person, such person has a right of action against them or any one of them to repair the damage done him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-18\">3. Every person has a right to enjoy such benefits and advantages as society affords, and' such as he can get by his enterprise, industry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>and credit, and to be free from any wanton or unjustifiable interference or hindrance that would deprive him of any of these advantages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-3\">4. The right to deal with whom one chooses does not give or imply a right to solicit others not to deal with a named person, and does not give or imply a right to procure and enter into an agreement with others not' to deal with such person. A refusal under such circumstances to deal with such person, if resulting in damage, is a \u201cboycott,\u201d and an injury to the public and to the individual, and is actionable.

St., 173, in which the court says: \u201cSingly, each company might have suspended its sales of coal to suit its own interests. * * * There is a certain freedom which must be allowed to every one in managing his own affairs. When competition is left free, individual error or folly will generally find a corrective in the conduct of others. But here the companies have combined to govern the supply and price of coal. * * * This combination has a\u00a1 power which no individual can confer (and it may be added, which no individual can withstand). The public must succumb, for it has left no competition free to correct its -baleful influence. * * * Such a combination is more than a contract; it is an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-5\">Reg v.

Held to be a criminal conspiracy; and if so, then actionable; and that the case is within the principle of Rex v.

A conspiracy to refuse to. deal with another is neither an offense at common law nor under our statutes. Penal Code, art. 800-808; Gen. Laws 1884, p. 25; Gen. Laws 21st Leg., chap. 117, p. 141; 4 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 583.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-6\">2. In \u00e1 civil action for damages sustained by reason of acts accomplished in pursuance of a conspiracy the gist of the action is the damage sustained by the acts of the defendants, and the allegations of a conspiracy need not be proved. The only object in alleging a conspiracy is to look beyond the actual participants in committing the injury and join with them as defendants all who conspired to accomplish it, and the conspiracy is nothing so far as sustaining the action goes, the foundation of it being the actual damage done to the party.

A conspiracy can not be made the subject of. a civil action, although damages result, unless something is done which without the conspiracy would give a right of action. In other words an act which if done by one alone constitutes no ground of action can not be made the ground of such action by alleging it to have been done by and through a conspiracy of several. The true test as to whether such action will lie is whether or not the act accomplished after the conspiracy jhas been formed is itself actionable.

In other words an act which if done by one alone constitutes no ground of action can not be made the ground of such action by alleging it to have been done by and through a conspiracy of several; that the true test as to whether such action will lie is whether or not the act accomplished after the conspiracy has been formed is itself actionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We think that the proposition here asserted is well sustained by the authorities, and the first question to be determined is whether, on account of the acts charged by plaintiff against the defendants, he would have had a cause of action against either of them if no conspiracy had been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">If he would have had, then he may maintain his action for a conspiracy. If he could not have sustained a separate action against either of the defendants on account of the matters complained of, the additional charge of a conspiracy will not give it. Cool. on Torts, 125; Kimball v. Harmon <em>&amp; </em>Burch, 34 Md., 407; Laverty v. Vanarsdale, 65 Pa. St., 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The appellee also asserts the following proposition, which may be conceded to be correct: \u201cA person has an absolute right to refuse to have business relations with any person whomsoever, whether the refusal is based upon reason or is the result of whim, caprice, prejudice, or malice, and there is no law which forces a man to part with his title to his property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">The privilege here asserted must be limited however to the individual action of the party who asserts the right. It is not equally true that one person may from such motives influence another person to do the same thing. If without such motive the cause of one person\u2019s interference with the property or privileges of another is to serve some legitimate right or interest of his own, he may do acts himself, or cause other persons to do them, that injuriously affect a third party so long as no definite legal right of such third party is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">In the case of Walker v. Cronin, 107 Massachusetts, 562, it was recognized to be a general principle that, \u201cIn all cases where a man has a temporal loss or damage by the wrong of another, he may have an action upon the case to be repaired in damages. The intentional causing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>such loss to another, without justifiable cause and with the malicious purpose to inflict it, is of itself a wrong. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">\u201cThere are indeed many authorities which appear to hold that to con.stitute an actionable wrong there must be a violation of some definite legal right of the plaintiff. But those are cases, for the most part at least, where the defendants were themselves acting in the lawful exercise of some distinct right, which furnished the defense of a justifiable cause for their acts, except so far as they were in violation of a superior, right in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u201cThus every one has an equal right to employ workmen in his business or service; and if by the exercise of this right in such manner as he may see fit persons are induced to leave their employment elsewhere, no wrong is done to him whose employment they l\u00e9ave, unless a contract exists by which such other person has a legal right to the further continuance of their services. If such a contract exists, one who knowingly and intentionally procures it to be violated may be held liable for the wrong, although he did it for the purpose of promoting his own business.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u201cEvery one has a right to enjoy the fruits and advantages of his own enterprise, industry, skill, and credit. He has no right to be protected against competition; but he has a right to be free from a malicious and wanton interference, disturbance, or annoyance. If disturbance or loss come as a result of competition, or the exercise of like rights by others, it is <em>damnum absque injuria, </em>unless some superior right by contract or otherwise is. interfered with. But if it come from the merely wanton or .malicious acts of others, without the justification of competition or the service of any interest or lawful purpose, it then stands upon a different footing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s petition goes further than to charge that each of the defendants refused to sell to him. It charges that they not only did that, but that they induced a third person to refuse to sell to him.. It does not appear from the petition that their interference with the business of plaintiff was done to serve some legitimate purpose of their own, but that it was done wantonly and maliciously, and that it caused, as they intended it should, pecuniary loss to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We think the petition stated a cause of action and that the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Delivered March 24, 1891.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\"><em>Forster Rose, </em>for defendants in error, argued a motion for rehearing. The motion was transferred to Austin and there refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
