Lease and Sale of School Land\u2014^Constitution.\u2014Section 4, article 7, of the Constitution of 1876 provides: \u201cThe lands herein set apart to the public free school fund shall be sold under such regulations, at such times, and on such terms as may be prescribed by law. \u2019 \u2019 While this commands that the lands shall be sold, it leaves it entirely to the discretion of the Legislature when it shall be done. It fails to direct that the entire body of such lands shall be immediately sold, or that until sold no other disposition shall be made of them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b600-12\"><em>2. </em>Lease of School Land.\u2014A <em>watered section </em>of school land was leased for a term of six years from April 15, 1884, under Act of April 12, 1883.

The Legislature may provide for leasing State school lands without making same subject to sale during the term of said leases; provided that the leases are not for such long periods of time as to be continuous in character;' and provided, they are for such short terms as not to prevent the State from exercising its ultimate policy of disposing of the same by sale.

Granting that an act of the Legislature providing for leases of State school lands for absolute and fixed terms' beyond the time when succeeding Legislatures shall be in session would be violative of an imreplied restriction of the Constitution, nevertheless leases contracted und <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>such a statute would not be absolute nullities, but would be valid until such time as one of the parties thereto disaffirmed the contract or until a succeeding Legislature, regardless of such leases, should place said leased lands on the market for sale.

When an express constitutional clause is mandatory, then there can be no implied authority in the Legislature to pass any act that will prohibit, restrict, or infringe on the express provisions of the Constitution.

An act of the Legislature must conform to the written Constitution, and so far as it infringes on the provisions of the Constitution is void. 1 Kent Com., 12 ed., p. 449, marginal. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-8\">3. If the legislative, act impugn the privileges of the Constitution, the act to that extent must yield to the Constitution, and is so far void. Smisson v.

W. Taylor unlawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>entered upon and dispossessed plaintiff of said premises, and still withholds from plaintiff the possession thereof; that defendant in entering upon and dispossessing plaintiff was and is a mere wrongdoer, without any right or title to said premises whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The defendant filed the following exceptions to the .petition, which were sustained by the court, and the plaintiff declining to amend his cause was dismissed, from which judgment he prosecutes this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADZT\">\u201c1. Because plaintiff\u2019s lease was made without authority of law. That clause of section 17 of the Act of April. 12, 1883, by attempting to provide for a lease not subject to sale, rendered said clause unconstitutional and void, and said clause was by virtue of such attempt null and void, and plaintiff\u2019s attempted lease made under said law was wholly null and void and conferred no right on plaintiff. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201c5. Because said act wherein it attempted to lease school lands, where watered, in such manner as to prevent future Legislatures from immediately placing said lands on the market for sale to actual settlers was unconstitutional and void; and plaintiff\u2019s attempted lease, made under said act of 1883, was illegal and void and conferred no rights on plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201c6. Because the lease claimed by plaintiff was made for a term of six years, thereby restricting the right of the Legislature to put same on the market for sale during such time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The 17th section of the Act of the 12th of April, 1883, contains a proviso \u201cthat when the lessee has but one watered section leased from the State in the same vicinity such section shall not be subject to sale and settlement during the term of the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Section 4 of article 7 of the Constitution of 1876, to which this provision is claimed to be obnoxious, reads as follows: \u201cThe lands herein set apart to the public free school fund shall be sold under such regulations, at such times, and on such terms as may be prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJo\">While the Constitution commands that the lands shall be sold, it leaves it entirely to the discretion of the Legislature when it shall be done. It fails to direct that the entire body of such lands shall be immediately sold, or that until sold no other disposition shall be made of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">In the case of Smisson v. The State, 71 Texas, 232, it was said that the Legislature has the power to authorize such leases .of school lands as will not interfere with the right of the State to sell them whenever the Legislature may think proper. It may be conceded that one Legislature by authorizing a lease of the lands can not deprive a future one of its power to direct the sale of such lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">That question is not involved in the case now before us. The lease in. this case can not be said by the courts to have been for an unreasonable period. Such a lease made in pursuance of an act of the Legislature must be held binding at least until abrogated by another act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the Legislature, and before any subsequent law should be given that effect it should clearly appear that it was so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">When the Legislature has declared that leased lands of a given description shall not be sold no officer or agent of the government has an option to say that they shall be.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">By section 25 of the Act of April 1, 1887, which provides for the sale and lease of school and other public lands, it is directed that \u201cnothing in this act shall be construed to impair, interfere with, or in any manner affect any lease or sale or the rights growing out of the same made under former laws, of the lands herein referred to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We think there was error in sustaining the exceptions, for which the judgment should be reversed and the cause be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Beversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Delivered April 24, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
