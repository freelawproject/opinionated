At the time of the death of his first wife, in 1871, Bock was generally considered in the community to be worth from $40,000 to $60,000, consisting chiefly of his homestead, which then contained three lots and a ship chandler\u2019s-stock, in which business he was then engaged. . All of said property except the two lots in controversy was consumed by loss in business and in the support of himself and family, including the children of both marriages. Plaintiffs\u2019 right under their mother\u2019s will to one-half of the property in controversy is not contested. But they seek to recoup upon the interest of their father, claiming that the will of their mother vested only a life\u2019estate in their father, that he had no right to use the corpus of their mother\u2019s estate, and that the remaining property being of less value than their mother\u2019s half at the time of her death they are in equity entitled to all the remaining property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">The jury found for plaintiffs one-half the lots sued for and half the \u25a0 rents defendant had collected, and that defendant owned the other half.

Minor, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjM\">1. The legal effect of the will of Susanna Bock (the first wife of Peter Bock, deceased, and the mother of appellants), devising her share of the community estate, of herself and her husband was to vest in him an estate for life, with remainder in fee to their children, with power to the life tenant to managej control, sell, and convey the property subject to the condition contained in the fifth article, to-wit, that it shall be equally distributed at his death among the children. The important and controlling provisions of the will are in the second, third, fourth, and fifth articles. [See opinion.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-9\">(1) The second article is explained and limited by the fifth, and must be taken and construed in connection with the latter, which prescribes the condition upon which the husband is authorized \u201cto take, receive,. and become possessed of\u201d the devised estate, and \u201cto manage, control, sell, and convey the same as his own estate;\u201d that condition being \u201cthat the said estate\u201d (to-wit, the estate devised by the testatrix) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u201cshall be equally distributed at his death among our children, subject only to the suggestion contained in article 4.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">(2) There is nothing in the will indicating any. intention of the testatrix to vest in the husband anything more than a life estate. The words generally used when the intention is to vest an estate in fee, such as give, grant, devise, etc., are not to be found in the instrument, while the words actually employed in declaring what the husband\u2019s rights shall be in respect to the devised property, to-wit, \u201cto take, receive, and become possessed of,\u201d and \u201cto manage, control, sell, and convey the same as his own estate,\u201d not only do not suggest but rather exclude the idea of any intention to vest in him an estate in fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">(3) Such intention is not deducible from the words \u201cas his own estate,\u201d used in the fifth article, for the context clearly shows that these words were meant to qualify only the words immediately preceding them, to-wit, \u201cto manage, control, sell, and' convey,\u201d and were not meant to qualify the preceding and more remote words, \u201cto take and receive;\u201d that they did not mean that he should \u201ctake and receive\u201d the devised property \u201cas his own estate,\u201d but are rather, to be taken in the sense of words <em>ejusdem generis, </em>and as intended to designate the manner in which and the extent to which he should have power to manage, control, sell, and convey it; and the elipsis or eliptical expression, if completed, would be that he should take, receive, and become possessed of the devised estate, with full power and authority during his life to manage, control, sell, and convey the same as if it were his own estate, subject to the condition that at his death it should be distributed among the children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APZ\">(4) The power given the husband \u201cto sell and convey\u201d the devised property does not imply an intention to vest the fee in him: First, because if vested with the fee he would necessarily have the power to sell and convey, and the express grant of such power would be inoperative and superfluous; second, because the context shows that these words are to be taken and construed with those which they follow and with which they are closely connected and used, and the scope and meaning of which they are obviously designed to enlarge, to-wit, the words \u201cto manage and control; \u2019 \u2019 and so taken and construed their meaning manifestly is, in effect, that in managing and controlling the devised property for the purposes indicated in the third article, to-wit, the education and support of the children, the husband may to the extent necessary sell and convey it; and the fact that such acts would be essential in managing and controlling it, as well as the object of the testatrix in giving such power, is apparent when the character and condition of the property is considered (as may properly be done, 2 Jarmon on Wills, 525), as shown by the extrinsic evidence, from which it appears that the devised property consisted principally of merchandise held for sale in the usual course of trade, the management and control of which necessarily involved its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>sale and conveyance; third, because an intention of vesting the fee in the husband is directly in conflict with the expressed conditions on which the power to sell and convey is given, to-Avit, that the property shall be distributed at his death among the children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">(5) The third article of the will, in effect making the education and support of the children during the husband\u2019s lifetime a charge upon the property devised, is entirely consistent with and corroboratiA-e of the construction contended for by appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-6\">(6) The fourth article sIioavs the intention of the testatrix by assuming, as if a matter of course, that her children \u00e1re to receive the property at the death of their father, and directing that such of them as shall have received advancements shall be charged therewith in the contemplated distribution among them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-7\">(7) The several articles of the Avill referred to, considered either separately or together, show that the testatrix\u2019s intention was to give her husband only a life estate in the property, with such power of sale as should be necessary for the proper management and control of it during his life, so as to provide for the support and education of their children and to preserve it for distribution among them at his death; and said articles and the whole Avill exclude the inference of any intention of the testatrix to authorize her husband to consume the property, or most of it (as the evidence shows he did do), in providing for himself and a second wife and her children by a former marriage as well as her children by him; while the portions of the charge quoted in first and second assignments of error, especially Avhen taken in connection with the portion quoted in the seventh assignment, to-wit, \u201cneither could the titles to these two. lots be affected by any unprofitable management of the community estate of Peter Bock and his first wife, who by her will <em>gave </em>her husband the rights and powers aforesaid,\u201d Avere calculated to and probably did mislead the jury as stated in second assignment of error, and cause them to belieAre that the husband had the right to consume in the way the evidence shoAved that he did do during his second marriage nearly all his first wife\u2019s share of her and his community estate, to the exclusion of her children, and then by his Avill leave the residue of it to his second wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">(8) So far as the intention of the testatrix was a question of fact to be determined by the jury, the court erred in withholding it from their consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-9\">2.. The evidence thus summarily excluded by the charge from the consideration of the jury ought not to have been s\u00f3 excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-10\">(1) It had been admitted over appellee\u2019s objection after full argument before the court, and was evidence absolutely necessary to sustain appellants\u2019 case. It was not offered in confession or avoidance of anything pleaded by appellee, for it must necessarily have been presented to maintain appellants\u2019 right of action, even if there had been no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>plea than that of not guilty. Appellants\u2019 case was in effect that their mother by her will had left her share of the community estate of herself and their father to him for life, with remainder to them in fee; that said community estate at her death in 1871 consisted of real and personal property, including the two lots sued for, amounting in value to above \u00a710,000; that their father had married appellee soon after their mother\u2019s death and had himself died in December, 1888, having in the meantime applied to his own use, disposed of, and consumed the whole of said community estate\u2014their mother\u2019s share as well as his own\u2014excepting only the two lots in controversy; and that the3r therefore were entitled to the whole of said two lots, it being all that remained of said communhy, and much less than their mother\u2019s share of it, which she had devised to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-5\">(2) Appellants\u2019 petition was in the usual form of one in trespass to try title and contained all the averments prescribed by statute, while their deraignment of title set out the claim or title on which they relied. Under them they were entitled to introduce said evidence, it being necessary to establish their right of action; nor could they be deprived of such privilege by the pleadings of their adversary. The rale excluding in the absence of proper specific allegations evidence offered by plaintiff in confession and avoidance of matter pleaded in defense was not applicable to this case, for the said evidence was offered, not in confession and. avoidance of matter pleaded in defense, but to sustain the right and claim asserted by appellants; and so far as it affected the matter pleaded in defense it was not in confession and avoidance, but went directly to contradict, rebut, and disprove such matter, as appellants had a right to do; and if said evidence was excluded from the consideration of the jury because in confession and avoidance of matter pleaded in defense, without sufficient allegations in the petition, then said ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-6\">(3) . The said evidence having been admitted when offered and its objects and purposes stated by appellants\u2019 counsel, over appellee\u2019s objection that it was inadmissible on the ground of being in confession and avoidance of matter pleaded in defense, and said objections having been overruled, the action of the court afterward in excluding by its charge to the jury said evidence from their consideration\u2014no reason being assigned therefor\u2014apparently must have been on the ground that it was irrelevant because appellants\u2019 father had the right under their mother\u2019s will to apply to his own use, consume, and dispose of, to their exclusion, the estate devised by her; and if the evidence was so excluded on that ground the court erred in so construing the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-7\">(4) The father\u2019s appropriating to his own use, consuming, and disposing of part of the community estate of himself and appellants\u2019 mother, was in legal effect making partition of said community estate between himself and appellants, taking to himself the part of such es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>tate so appropriated to his own use, consumed, and disposed of by him, and separating and-setting apart therefrom the remainder of said estate, (the same being less than said mother\u2019s share) and appropriating it to appellants, and by such partition he and those claiming under him as volunteers are bound.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">(5) The father having appropriated to his own use, consumed, and disposed of more than half of the community estate of himself and appellants\u2019 mother, they are entitled to be indemnified as against him and those claiming under him as volunteers out \"of whatever remains of said community estate; and have such right if such indemnification takes all that remains of such estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcP\">(6) The action and conduct of the court in overruling appellee\u2019s objections to testimony offered -by appellants, after said objections had been fully presented by appellee and the objects and purposes of the testimony fully stated by appellants, and in admitting said testimony in evidence for the purposes and objects as stated by appellants\u2019 counsel, and then after appellants\u2019 counsel had closed their case and made their argument to the jury under the belief necessarily produced by the rulings of the court that said evidence was before the jury for its consideration, in excluding said evidence from the consideration of the jury by charging them that it \u201chad nothing to do with the ca&amp;'e,\u201d was improper, unjust, and unfair, and prejudicial to appellants and calculated to operate and did operate as a surprise to their counsel, and prevented them from so managing and presenting their case as might and probably would have caused a different result.

The context does not clearly require the insertion of the words \u201cas if it were\u201d before the words \u201chis own\u201d (as suggested by counsel), and such addition would create a new intent not expressed by the testatrix.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">(3) The directions in the third clause of the will in regard to the maintenance of the children, and in the fourth clause as to advancements, are precatory, and in the absence of any provisions fixing these expenditures or advancements as a charge upon her estate the intention to vest the fee in the husband is manifest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">(4) The greater part of the property devised consisted of personalty, viz., a ship chandler\u2019s stock of merchandise, etc., and the intent to give the fee of perishable property is presumed, unless the will contains express provisions showing a different intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-8\">(5) The whole will shows a manifest intention that the husband should take the fee, and the directions as to maintenance of the children, advancements, and disposition upon death of her husband show the intent of testatrix that after her death her husband should still have the management and disposal of the community estate as an entirety, and that at his death he should distribute the whole estate, whatever it might then consist of, among their children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-9\">(6) If the court should hold that the fifth clause is a limitation over in fee, then the words \u201cmy said estate shall be equally distributed at his death,\u201d etc., apply or speak to the time of his death and mean the estate as it then existed, whether increased or diminished by the use and enjoyment of the same by the husband and children, as contemplated by the will. 3 Jar. on Wills, 31-33; 2 Jar. on Wills, 527, n. 17, 529, n. 19; 2 Red. on Wills, 328, 330, 394, pl. 22, 23; Schoul. on Wills, secs. 549, 559; Ramsdell v.

The court erred in rendering judgment against defendant for one-half the rent received by defendant for part of the premises, and in refusing defendant\u2019s requested charge to the effect that the said premises in controversy having been the homestead of defendant and her late husband, defendant could not be held liable to her cotenants for rent or use and occupancy thereof until a homestead, or an allowance in lieu of a homestead, was secured or offered to her out of her interest in said property. Presley\u2019s Heirs v. Robinson, 57 Texas, 459, 460; Putnam v. Young, 57 Texas, 461; Runnels v. Runnels, 27 Texas, 517.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-10\">HENRY, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AuV\">This was an action of trespass to try title, and to recover rents, brought by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The plaintiffs alleged that they and one Charles Schrimpf as tenants in common owned the whole of the land sued for, which they described as lots 13 and 14, in block 619, in the city of Galveston.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The defendant Susan Bock pleaded not guilty, and specially that she owned an undivided one-half of the land in controversy, and \u201cwithout admitting or denying plaintiffs\u2019 title in the remaining undivided moiety of said premises,\u201d she asked \u201cthat they be put to their proofs.\u201d The defendant further answering stated how she had acquired her title to an undivided one-half of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">The answer of the defendant and the evidence shows that Peter Bock was twice married. The land in controversy belonged to the community estate of the said Peter and his first wife Susanna Bock (sometimes called Susan Bock). Appellants were children of that marriage. The first wife died in 1871, leaving a will which was duly probated. At the date of her death, in addition to the land now in controversy there belonged to the community estate other property of considerable value,consisting mainly of a stock of merchandise. At the date of the death of Peter Bock nothing remained of the community estate except the property in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In the year 1872 Peter Bock married the defendant, and on the 7th day of December, 1888, he died, leaving a. last will, which was subsequently duly probated, by which he devised to the defendant his interest in the property in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"AcP4\">Appellants contend, and with the view of sustaining their claim introduced evidence, that the will of the first wife of Peter Bock only gave to her husband a life estate .in her share of their community property; that at the time of the death of the first wife the community estate was of the value of some $30,000 or $40,000; that at the' time of the death of the husband all of said estate had disappeared except the property in controversy, which was of the value of about $5000 or $6000; and that the husband having used more than an equal half of the estate intrusted to him, the children of his first wife are entitled to hold all that remains.</p>\n<p id=\"AsT\">Evidence was introduced tending to show that the diminution in the value of the community estate was caused by the unprofitable character of the business conducted by the husband subsequent to the death of his first wife, and by the cost of maintaining his family, including his family by his second marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The appellee contends with regard to the will of the first wife that \u201cthe whole will show a manifest intention that the husband should take the fee, and the directions as to the maintenance of the children, advancements, and disposition upon death of her husband show the intent of testatrix that after her death her husband should still have the management and disposal of the community estate as an entirety, and that at his death he should distribute the whole estate, whatever it might then consist of, among their children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The will reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>It is my will and desire that. my much beloved husband Peter Bock shall take, receive, and become possessed of, all and singular, niy earthly .possessions, including my separate .and community property, being every estate, in'property known to the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><em>\u201c3. </em>I desire that my said husband Peter Bock during his life shall support and educate in a liberal manner all our children while they are minors and our daughters so long as they shall remain unmarried, without any charge whatever against such minor children or unmarried daughters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AST\"><em>\u201c4. </em>I .desire that all moneys, or property at an estimate in money to be made by my said husband, that may hereafter be given or that may have been heretofore given by either of us to any child after marriage or its majority shall be charged against such child, and such moneys or property so given shall be deducted from such child's inheritance or patrimony whenever the same shall be given to such child or its representatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3x0\"><em>\u201c5.' I </em>desire that my said husband Peter shall take and receive all of my estate as aforesaid with full power and authority to manage and control, sell and convey the same as his own estate, conditioned nevertheless that the said estate shall be equally distributed at his death among our children, subject to the suggestions contained in article <em>4 </em>herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">\u201c6. I desire that no action whatever shall be taken in the management of my estate in any court of the country, except in so far as is necessary for the probate of my will and the filing of an inventory and an appraisement thereunder in pursuance of statutory requirements now in force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\"><em>\u201c7. I </em>desire that no bond shall be. required of my said husband Peter Bock in order to enable him to take and receive under this will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">\u201c8. I desire that there be no executor of my will further than the action of my said husband may be considered such in probating this will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">\u201c[l. s.] [Signed] \u201cSusanna Book.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">We do not think that it was the intention of the testatrix to devise her estate as it existed at her death to her children, subject to only a life estate in her husband. . On the contrary, considering every part of the instrument, we conclude that it was the intention of the testatrix to vest in her husband an unrestricted power to use, consume, and dispose of the whole estate, without accountability to any one for any portion of it used or consumed, but to vest in her children her undivided balf of so much of it as might remain at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Entertaining this view of the will we are of opinion that there was no error in the charge of the court construing it, nor in the instruction that the evidence with regard to the character and extent of the community property of Peter Bock and his first wife, which had been ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>mitted contrary to the objection of the defendant, should not be con-. sidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We find no error in any particular in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Appellant assigns the following error: \u201cThe court erred in its charge to the effect that the defendant was to account for rents not on the basis of the rental value of the two lots, but only on the basis of the amount of rents received by her from the two lots since Peter Bock\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The rule here suggested depends no doubt upon the contention of appellants that they are the sole owners of the land in controversy, and entitled to recover it as such. Under such circumstances the rental value of the property and not the amounts actually received by the defendant would be the correct rule of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The property in controversy was occupied as a homestead partly, and partly rented by Peter Bock during his life and by the defendant subsequent to his death. The evidence does not show that such occupancy by his widow subsequent to his death was exclusive. Under this state of facts we think there was no error in holding the defendant accountable to plaintiffs and the defendant Schrimpf for one-half of the rents collected by her from tenants subsequent to the death of her husband, and for no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The appellee also assigned errors and complains of the judgment against her for one-half of the rents collected by her, on the ground that the property having been the homestead of herself and her late husband she could not be held liable for the use thereof until a homestead, or an allowance in lieu of one, was secured or offered to her out of her interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u25a0 Upon the death of her husband the right of the defendant to use the one-half interest of the children of the first wife as a homestead or otherwise at once terminated. Her relation to them was from that date a tenant in common, and as such she was accountable to them for their part of rents collected by her. It was as much her duty as it was the plaintiffs\u2019 to seek a partition of the property if she desired one.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The defendant not only pleaded not guilty and failed to disclaim title to one-half interest in the land, but as we have said required plaintiffs to establish their title thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">With the issue so joined we think the court properly held the defendant liable for all the costs up to and including the entry of the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">We find no error in the proceedings, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ASN\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">Delivered March 6, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
