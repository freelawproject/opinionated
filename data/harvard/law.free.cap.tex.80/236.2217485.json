The plaintiffs and defendants pleaded stale demand, and the testimony failed to show the extent of the interest of the intervener. <em>Held, </em>that for both reasons the court properly instructed the jury to find against the intervenor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b252-14\">Appeal from Gonzales.

McCall and others brought an action of trespass to try title for one hundred and sixty acres of land against Wm. Trench and wife. The defendants answered not guilty, and set up title under will of Mrs. Eugenia McCall to Mrs. Trench, her daughter, alleging that it was the separate property of Mrs. McCall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>July 3, 1890, J.

The facts show that the mother of appellant held the land in trust for intervenor, the character of the trust being such as that the statute of limitations would not run against him. Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., art. 3198, sec. 24; 68 Texas, 70; Id., 353.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-10\">2. The question whether or not the trust under which appellant\u2019s mother held the land was of such a character as that the statute of limitations would run was one of fact to be decided by the jury under proper instructions by the court. Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., art. 1317.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-11\">3. The motion for new trial shows a meritorious cause of action and that injustice has been done intervenor without negligence on his part. 56 Texas, 431; 61 Texas, 103.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-13\"><em>W.

The evidence shows that Samuel McCall purchased the land and paid for it with his own money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-14\">2. The deed from Baldridge to McCall and wife shows that the land was their community property unless overborne by direct and positive proof that the land was the separate property of one of the spouses or was purchased by McCall and wife for appellant with his funds and held in trust by both for him, which proof was not furnished. Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., arts. 2852, 2853; Epperson v. Jones, 65 Texas, 425; Smith v. Bailey, 66 Texas, 553. A trust in land can not be proved by the testimony of a single witness swearing to the verbal declarations of the alleged trustee. Hall v. Layton, 16 Texas, 274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-16\">3. The court did not.err in charging that appellant\u2019s claim was a stale one, for the testimony shows that McCall and wife held, used, and enjoyed the land for a period of thirty-three years adversely to appellant, during which time lie made no demand for it. Hudson v. Jurnigan, 39 Texas, 585; Fleming v. Reed, 37 Texas, 152; McGreal v. Jones, 36 Texas, 674; Barrett v. Kelley, 31 Texas, 480.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b253-18\">HENRY, Associate Justice</author>\n<p id=\"AoE\">This was an action of trespass to try title brought by appellees against Fannie B. Trench and her husband. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The appellant intervened in the cause, alleging that he owned the land. \u2022 - \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">It was agreed that W. H. H. Baldridge was the common source of title. It was proved that Baldridge conveyed the land to Samuel McCall and his wife Eugenia McCall by deed dated the 19th day of September, 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Eugenia McCall, before she married McCall, was the widow of James S. Norfleet, Sr. The intervenor was her son by that marriage. The defendant Mrs. Trench was a daughter of Eugenia Norfleet, afterward McCall.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The plaintiffs were the only heirs of Samuel McCall, deceased. Eugenia McCall by her last will devised the land in controversy to the defendant Fannie Trench.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The intervenor contended that the purchase money paid Baldridge for the land when he conveyed it to Samuel and Eugenia McCall was the proceeds of the sale of negroes belonging to his father\u2019s estate, in which he had an interest, and that the'title was- held by the grantees in the deed in trust for him. Intervenor was upward of fifty years old when this suit was begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The plaintiff brought evidence that the purchase money paid to Bald-ridge for the land was the separate estate of Samuel McCall, acquired by him by a sale of his property in the State of Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The defendant introduced evidence showing that it was paid with the proceeds of the sale of negroes belonging to the estate of the father of the intervenor..</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The intervenor introduced some evidence of declarations made by his mother that she had given the other Norfleet children their part of their father\u2019s estate and that intervenor should have his part at her death. He testified that these. declarations of his mother and her age and feeble condition were the causes of his not suing to establish his claim to the land. He introduced no other evidence to account' for or excuse his delay in suing to establish his claim. He testified that he had several brothers and sisters, all of whom were then dead except Mrs. Trench, the defendant, who was his half-sister but not his father\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">The evidence showed nothing further with regard to who were interested in the estate of the father of the intervenor.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">The court gave an appropriate charge upon the issues between the plaintiff and the defendant. With regard to intervenor it charged that he could not recover because the trust'had not been proved and his claim was a stale demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">The jury found that the land was the community property of the father of plaintiffs and the mother of the defendant, and-judgment was rendered dividing it equally between them, of which neither of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>complain. . The intervenor alone prosecutes this appeal and complains of the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We think the charge was correct. If there was any evidence tending to establish a trust in the land in favor of plaintiff it altogether failed to establish the extent of his interest. Even if he had sufficiently proved the existence of a trust in his favor his long and unexcused delay in suing to establish it was properly held to be a bar to his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Delivered March 13, 1891.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
