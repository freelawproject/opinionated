I asked Mr. Green if he wanted to loan Professor Stuart some money on the General Gas Company\u2019s stock. He said he would loan him $2,500 on a collateral note with fifty shares of the gas company\u2019s stock attached. I said to Mr. Green, \u2018 Will you offer him a renewal incase Stuart is not able to pay you when the note falls due at the end of the first ninety days ? \u2019 He said, \u2018 Yes.\u2019 Said I, \u2018 What will happen, then, in case the professor is. not able to pay you ? \u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018I want the stock, unless you will become his surety\u2014indorse the note.\u2019 1 said, \u2018 Well, Mr. Green, in case that happens, I don\u2019t want to see Stuart lose his stock. It must be understood that the stock must be offered for sale, and an opportunity given to the present stockholders of the General Gas Company to buy that stock and apply the proceeds on the note before you shall have the right to take it up.\u2019 He says, \u2018 That\u2019s all right. I will agree to that.\u2019 On the day I had a talk with Mr. Green I saw Professor Stuart and told him I wanted $2,000. He says, \u2018I have not got $2,000.\u2019 \u2018 Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018 you got securities and you can borrow it.\u2019 He says, \u2018 I can\u2019t borrow any-money. I haven\u2019t got any bank account and influence, as you have, and I don\u2019t know moneyed men. But you make the loan for me, and make it for $2,500 and give me $500, because my grocer has got a judgment against me now, and I need money.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249\">It also appeared that Mr. Ell wood discounted the note at the request of Mr. Green.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-7\" pgmap=\"249\">The collateral stock was the property of Mr. Stuart. It afterward became valueless, it being canceled by vote of the stockholders, the plaintiff and defendant below, Stuart and others, agreeing thereto.</p><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-8\" pgmap=\"249\">Stirlen &amp; Dickson, attorneys for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-9\" pgmap=\"249\">Wood &amp; Elmer, attorneys for defendant in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b249-10\" pgmap=\"249\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"A5b\" pgmap=\"249\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b249-11\" pgmap=\"249(39) 250(14)\">Plaintiff in error insists that the collateral stock should, in accordance with his alleged agreement with Green, have been offered for sale and the proceeds applied on the note. The stock was canceled by agreement of plaintiff in error, and thereafter there was no collateral stock to be sold or offered for sale.</p> <p id=\"b250-5\" pgmap=\"250\">Moreover, the alleged agreement was not with the Bridge-water G-as Company, nor did it, so far as appears, have notice thereof; while presumably it took the note bona fide, for value, and before it became due.</p> <p id=\"b250-6\" pgmap=\"250\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
