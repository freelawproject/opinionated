Appellee, having under the contract obtained possession of the premises, caused a survey of the same to be made, which survey showed that the building on the premises overlapped the adjoining premises on the south one inch, ivhile the buildings on the adjoining premises did not in any way overlap the lines of the lot sold as aforesaid. Because of this overlapping appellee refused to pay the balance due on the contract, whereupon appellant, by her attorney, offered to appellee to give him a deed upon the payment of $5,000, together with the $500 so held in escrow, thus, appellant claims, leaving the question of the $500 balance open.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\" pgmap=\"223\">Appellant insists that appellee accepted this proposition, and that the deed was executed and $5,500 paid and received in pursuance thereof. Appellee insists that he offered to take the deed and pay $5,500 instead of $6,000, notwithstanding the overlapping of the building, and that the matter was adjusted and closed in this way.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\" pgmap=\"223\">The $500 in escrow was turned over to appellant and she received appellee\u2019s check for $5,000, upon which was written : \u201c Balance in full for property 1921 Indiana avenue, Chicago.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\" pgmap=\"223\">This having been done, appellant filed a bill to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien for the $500 more she claimed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-9\" pgmap=\"223\">Albert H. Meads, attorney for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-10\" pgmap=\"223\">John Reid McFee, attorney for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b224-4\" pgmap=\"224\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AS6\" pgmap=\"224\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b224-5\" pgmap=\"224\">Hot only is it apparent that appellant, in receiving the check' for $5,000, had notice that appellee regarded it as given in full payment for the premises, but the court, upon the one question of fact upon which this controversy turns, has found for appellee.</p> <p id=\"b224-6\" pgmap=\"224\">We see no sufficient reason for setting aside such finding. There arises under such state of facts no question as to the existence of a vendor\u2019s lien, or of attempted satisfaction by payment of a lesser sum than is plainly due in full discharge of a debt.</p> <p id=\"b224-7\" pgmap=\"224\">The decree of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
