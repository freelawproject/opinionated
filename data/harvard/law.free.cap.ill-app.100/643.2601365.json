Voluntary Assignment\u2014All the Property Assigned, Subject Jurisdiction of County Court\u2014 After the delivery of a deed of assignment, all the property, both in law and in equity, in the judgment of the law, is within the operation of the deed of assignment, and becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the County Court.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b670-5\" pgmap=\"670\">2. Same\u2014Deed of. Assignment Conclusive on Assignor.\u2014Where a deed of assignment is delivered to the assignee, the assignor thereby completely relinquishes his dominion over his property; it is beyond his power, either by his acts or by his purposes, to invalidate the assignment he has made.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b670-6\" pgmap=\"670\">3. Same\u2014Fraudulent Agreement of Creditors or Erroneous Order of Court, Fot Act of Assignee.\u2014Any agreement, however fraudulent, concerning the assigned estate, made between any or all of its creditors, and any orders made by the County Court in the administration of the estate, no matter hoxv wrong or erroneous, can, neither as a matter of law nor fact, be deemed the act of the assignor, or held to invalidate an assignment created in good faith, without fraud in its inception.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b670-7\" pgmap=\"670\">4. Same\u2014An Agreement of Creditors as to the Mode of Dealing with Property, When Tantamount to a Decree of Court, and Conclusive as to Them.\u2014An agreement entered into between some of the creditors as to a certain mode of dealing with the assigned property to pay their debts, would not bind other creditors who have proved their claims before the assignee, nor would such an agreement be binding upon the County Court. But once such an agreement is sanctioned by the court, it becomes in substance a decree of the court in the administration of the estate, that must be appealed from at the' proper time, by any person who was a party to the assignment and who considers himself injured thereby; not to appeal is to be concluded by the rule of res judicata as to all property embraced within the assignment, no matter how erroneous the order may be as measured by the assignment statute and the adjudication of the courts in interpretation thereof.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b670-8\" pgmap=\"670\">5. Same\u2014Creditors Who Have Received Benefits of Assignment Can Not Attach It.\u2014Creditors who have filed their claims with the assignee and received dividends from the assigned estate can not be permitted to, at the same time, enjoy the benefits of the assignment and to assail it by creditor\u2019s bills. This principle has been so strongly enforced that in a case where the deed of assignment itself was void on its face, the court held the creditor, who by some significant act has made himself a party to the assignment, may not take any steps to impair its validity.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b670-9\" pgmap=\"670\">6. Same\u2014Is Good' as to All Debts that Are Bona Fide.\u2014The preponderance of authority is in favor of the opinion that the assignment will be held good as to all debts that are bona fide; and this rule would undoubtedly prevail in this State where the provision is made by Secs. 4 and 5 of the assignment act for testing the validity of the claims presented to the assignee for payment under the assignment.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-10\" pgmap=\"670\">Creditor\u2019s Bill.\u2014Appeal from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County; the Hon.

W. Holder, Charles A. Stookey, Alonzo S. Wilderman, Lucius D. Turner, Rudolph Ocks, L. Niemeyer, Ella P. Lindley, Ida B. Kneisley and Emma J. Kneisley. Taylor and the interveners had recovered judgments against Seiter, on which executions had been issued and returned \u201c no property found.\u201d The object and purpose of the bill is to set aside certain deeds of, and subject to a sale by the master in chancery, the following described lands, to wit:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-5\" pgmap=\"671\">The south half of section thirteen; the northeast quarter and the east half of the northwest quarter of section fourteen; the west half of the southwest quarter, the southwest quarter of the northwest quarter, the northeast quarter of the southwest quarter (less the east five acres), and the southeast quarter of the northwest quarter (less the east five acres), of section nine; all of said lands being in township No. 2 north, range No. 6 west, in St. Clair county, Illinois, being 750 acres; and being, as alleged in the bill, of the value of $65,000; the proceeds of the sale to be applied in paying the judgments of appellant Taylor, and of the intervenors against Seiter.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-4\" pgmap=\"672\">\u2022Henry Seiter, in 1891 and before that time, was the owner of the lands sought to be reached in this case, and they were used by him in carrying on a dairy and creamery business until August of that year, when he turned the business over to a company which he had been instrumental in having incorporated, under the laws of this State, with a capital stock of $60,000, in shares of $100 each, 596 shares of which were subscribed for and issued to Seiter, the remaining four shares having been subscribed for and issued to James D. Baker, Ed. L. Bobinson, H. A. Hanlon, and Mamie Seiter, wife of Henry Seiter, one share each.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\" pgmap=\"672\">The name of the corporation, thus created was the \u201c Lebanon Hairy &amp; Creamery Company,\u201d and Henry Seiter became its president and general manager.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-6\" pgmap=\"672\">The company so formed took possession of the land and took over and continued the dairy and creamery business begun by Seiter, and on the 21st of July, 1894, increased its capital stock 650 shares, all of which were subscribed and taken by Henry Seiter.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\" pgmap=\"672\">Seiter testified that the 600 shares of stock originally subscribed were paid for, and that when the last 650 shares of stock were taken by him, the understanding and agreement between the company and himself was that the stock should be paid for by the conveyance of the land before described, by Seiter and his wife, to the dairy and creamery company, and there is no testimony in the record to the contrary, as to either fact.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-8\" pgmap=\"672(118) 673(20)\">On the next day after the 650 shares of stock were issued, Seiter and his wife made and duly acknowledged a warranty deed of the land, for an expressed consideration of $75,000, to the dairy and creamery company, and Seiter testified that the deed was delivered to him as the legal representative of the company, on the day of its date, and that the reason he did not have the deed recorded at once was that be had, before that time, borrowed of Bufus 1ST. Bamsay $50,000, and conveyed to Bamsay a part of the land by deed, to secure the loan, and while he had given Bamsay other collaterals to secure the loan to the satisfaction of Ramsay, he had not yet received the deed from Ramsay; and there is no evidence to the contrary.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-4\" pgmap=\"673\">At the time of making the deed to the dairy and creamery company, and for years before, Seiter was and had been engaged in banking and was running two banks, one at O\u2019Fallon, and one at Lebanon, where he resided.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-5\" pgmap=\"673\">The stock of the creamery company was pledged by Seiter to the St. Louis banks to secure them for money loaned to him.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-6\" pgmap=\"673\">On the 8th of December, 1894, Seiter, finding himself unable to pay his obligations, concluded to make an assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors; but the day being Saturday, he deferred the matter until the following Monday, December 10th, when he went to the recorder\u2019s office of St. Clair county and had the deed to the creamery company duly filed for record, and about an hour thereafter he caused to be filed a deed of assignment of his property to Marshall W. Weir, as assignee, for the benefit of his creditors.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-7\" pgmap=\"673\">In the schedule of his assigned property the land was not included, but the stock of the creamery company was listed with a note or memorandum that it was already hypothecated with the St. Louis banks. Seiter also owned or had an interest in about 3,000 acres of land in Madison county, in this State, but the value of and title to this land seems to have been uncertain.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Au5\" pgmap=\"673\">A large portion of Seiter\u2019s indebtedness was to Rufus N, Ramsay, treasurer of this State, and was for State money, and when Ramsay died, on November 11, 1894, indebted to the State, appellees Witbeck and others, who were sureties on Ramsay\u2019s bond, and who are parties to this suit, made good Ramsay\u2019s defalcation and succeeded to the securities held by Ramsay for Seiter\u2019s indebtedness, which was upward of $240,000.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-9\" pgmap=\"673\">The sureties on Ramsay\u2019s bond claim to have succeeded in getting other security on Seiter\u2019s property for Seiter\u2019s debt, some considerable time before Seiter contemplated making an assignment.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-3\" pgmap=\"674\">When Seiter made his assignment the Lebanon Dairy &amp; Creamery Company and the Illinois Land Company together were indebted, to him on overdrafts the sum of $20,736.55.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-4\" pgmap=\"674\">At the April term, 1895, of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Weir, as assignee of Seiter, brought his bill in chancery to set aside the deed of Seiter to Ramsay, the deed from Seiter to the Lebanon Dairy &amp; Creamery Company, and other conveyances and pledges of land and property claimed to'have been made by Seiter to some of his creditors for the purpose of preferring them to his other creditors. A further object of the bill was to secure control of all Setter\u2019s mortgaged and pledged property, that it might be fully administered by the assignee under the deed of assignment.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\" pgmap=\"674\">All of the sureties on Ramsay\u2019s- bond as state treasurer were made parties to the bill, with their trustee, the Equitable Trust Company, of Chicago, which held the stocks, property and securities turned , over and pledged to it, to secure its cestui que trusts; but the St. Louis banks were not made parties to the proceeding.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-7\" pgmap=\"674\">The bill seems to have been \u2022 answered by some of the parties to it, but nothing was done under it, and it was superseded by what was called a \u201c creditor\u2019s agreement,\u201d and an order and decree made by the County Court of St. Clair County, at its July term, 1895, which order and decree, with the agreement as a part thereof, is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-8\" pgmap=\"674\">[[Image here]]</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-12\" pgmap=\"674(69) 675(27)\">And now comes Marshall W.

One question concerns the deed of Henry Seiter and wife, of July 22,1894, to the Lebanon Dairy and Creamery Company, covering the lands sought to be reached by the'bill in this case.</p> <p id=\"b684-12\" pgmap=\"684\">Ihe other question concerns the validity of Seiter\u2019s original deed of assignment, as supposed to be affected by the creditors\u2019 agreement and the order of the County Court, with the conveyances made to the trustees, Parsons, Blount and Sexton.</p> <p id=\"b684-13\" pgmap=\"684(23) 685(97)\">As a large portion of the arguments of counsel for appellants has relation solely to the deed of the lands made by Seiter and wife to the Lebanon Dairy and Creamery Company, we do not choose to pass the arguments by unnoticed, for, although we are of the opinion that the fact whether the deed was delivered or not, has little, if anything, to do with the case, we are fully aware, from the earnestness of the various arguments of counsel for appellants, that the point is made in the utmost faith, that if the deed was not delivered before Seiter made his assignment the land was open to seizure by appellants in the manner adopted by them.</p> <p id=\"b685-4\" pgmap=\"685(311) 686(165)\">It is claimed by appellants that all of Seiter\u2019s original stock of the creamery company was unpaid for by him. All of the evidence in the record on that point is to the effect that this claim is entirely without foundation. But suppose nothing had been paid on it; how does that affect either the appellants or the appellees ? We are unable td see how either party can be affected by such a fact, so far as the title to the land in this case is concerned. It is a fact undisputed by any evidence in the record that when the stock of the creamery company was increased by a further issue of $65,000, Seiter subscribed for and took the entire 650 shares, and he agreed to pay for it by conveying to the creamery company the land sought to be reached by the bill in this case; that immediately on the issuance of the stock, he, with his wife, made and acknowledged a deed for the land to the creamery company, and he testified that as grantor he delivered the deed to himself as president of the creamery company, and there is no evidence to the contrary; but, as he further testified that the reason he did not have the deed recorded at once was because he had previously deeded a part of the land to Rufus hT. Ramsay to secure a loan of money he had made from Ramsay, and that while he had given to Ramsay other col\u00bb lateral security to secure the loan in place of the deed of the land, he had not yet received the deed from Ramsay, and for this reason he withheld his deed to the creamery company from record until the day he made his assignment to Weir, which was five months after the date of the deed to the creamery company, this testimony is construed by counsel for appellants as meaning that Seiter was acting in his private capacity in withholding the deed from a complete delivery, and this may be correct; but whether it is or not we express no opinion. It is clear from the evidence that the creamery company had purchased the land and had paid for it all that it is alleged in the bill in this case to have been worth. Under such circumstances, if Seiter had scheduled the land in his assignment as his property and the assignee had inventoried it as assigned property, the assignee could not have held it as assets of the assigned estate, against the creamery company, in a proceeding against the assignee to specifically enforce the contract for a deed, made by Seiter, as the uncontradicted evidence is that the creamery company was in possession of the land under the contract of purchase at the time Seiter made his assignment.</p> <p id=\"b686-6\" pgmap=\"686(227) 687(35)\">Under such circumstances, where no actual fraud is shown, should a court of chancery decree a sale of the property to pay Setter\u2019s creditors, or should it presume that as done which ought to have been done, and refuse any relief whatever because of the manifest unjustness in taking the property of one who had honestly purchased and paid for it, and is in possession of it, to pay the debts of another, even though the \u201c another \u201d happens to be the person from whom the property was purchased ? It would at least seem that justice would require that a presumption should take the place of a missing fact in such a case. But since, in our opinion, no such presumption needs to be indulged in this case, because of the fact that before any of appellants had recovered judgment against Seiter, on which the bill in this case was founded, and before any proceedings were begun by any of appellants to subject the land to the payment of any of their judgments, the title to the land and the dominion over it had passed into the assignment, where appellants concede it should have gone, on the filing of the deed of assignment for record, therefore we express no opinion in the matter whether there was a valid delivery of the deed to the creamery company before Seiter contemplated making an assignment, or whether, from the undisputed facts, the presumption should be indulged that the deed was delivered before the assignment was contemplated by Seiter.</p> <p id=\"b687-4\" pgmap=\"687\">No question is raised as to the terms contained in the deed of assignment made by Seiter to Weir. It is not pretended that it contained provisions which would make it fraudulent in law, such as were contained in Hardin v. Osborne, 60 Ill. 93; Gardner v. Commercial National Bank, 95 Ill. 298; or Bowen v. Parkhurst, 24 Ill. 257. For anything appearing in the record, the deed of assignment executed by Seiter on December 10, 1894, was a general assignment for the benefit of all creditors, without reservations in his own favor, and free from any powers in favor of the assignee other than are contained in the statutes regulating assignments for the benefit of creditors. When the deed was delivered to the assignee, Seiter thereby completely relinquished his dominion over his property; it was then beyond his power, either by his acts or by his purposes, to invalidate the assignment he had made. After the delivery of the deed, all such property, both in law and in equity, as in the judgment of the law was within the operation of the deed of assignment, became subject to the jurisdiction of the County Court. Freydendall v. Baldwin, 103 Ill. 325; Feltenstein v. Stein, 157 Ill. 19.</p> <p id=\"b687-8\" pgmap=\"687(125) 688(259)\">Any agreement, however fraudulent, concerning the assigned estate, made between any or all of its creditors, and any orders made by the County Court in the administration of the estate, no matter how wrong or erroneous, can neither as a question of law or fact, be deemed the act of Seiter. The creditors\u2019 agreement appointing the three trustees to manage the property assigned to Weir, was in substance and in fact an administrative order of partial distribution rendered by the County Court. That this agreement-order contains provisions which would render a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors void, may be admitted; but the agreement-order is not the act of Seiter. It was probably never contemplated by him when he made his assignment that his property should be administered as provided in such order; but whether this conjecture is true or not, this agreement-order of August 17, 1895, made months afterward, can not be held to invalidate the assignment which Seiter created without taint or blemish in its inception; and therefore the first above quoted decisions are not applicable. The error in counsel\u2019s argument lies in the tacit assumption that the agreement-order is in some way the act of Seiter. Such an agreement entered into between some of the creditors would not bind other creditors, who had proved their claims before the assignee, nor would the agreement be binding on the court. But once the court sanctioned such an arrangement, it became in substance a decree of the court in the administration of the estate that must be appealed from at the proper time, by any person who was a party to the assignment and who considers himself injured thereby; not to appeal is to be concluded by the rule of res judicata as to all property embraced within the assignment, no matter how erroneous the order may be as measured by the assignment statute and the adjudication of the courts in interpretation thereof. But appellant Taylor never filed his claim with the assignee; as to all property under the dominion of the County Court he is a stranger. It does not'lie in his power by means of a creditor\u2019s bill to draw in question the legality of the agreement-order entered under the direction of the County Court.</p> <p id=\"b688-4\" pgmap=\"688\">Unless Seiter\u2019s deed of assignment of December 10,1894, was fraudulent in its inception, no claimed wrongs committed afterward by his creditors or his estate, or claimed improvident orders of the County Court in pursuance of such wrongs, can be of avail to appellant Taylor on his creditor\u2019s bill; for the theory of such a bill is the fraudulent purpose or effect of the grantor\u2019s deed to hinder and delay his creditors in the collection of their claims, a state that can not exist with an assignment made as the law directs. Feltenstein v. Stein, supra; Weir v. Mowe, 182 Ill. 444.</p> <p id=\"b688-5\" pgmap=\"688(10) 689(97)\">If the assigned estate is not administered by the County Court in conformity to law, the remedy is to compel the execution of the trust, according to law, and the intent of the assignor as expressed in his valid deed. To allow a creditor\u2019s bill or an attachment to be levied on property which has already been assigned by a valid deed of assignment, either because the assignee is colluding with some creditors for a preference or because the County Court enters erroneous orders in the distribution of the estate, would be for one set of laws to nullify what another set of laws has created.</p> <p id=\"b689-4\" pgmap=\"689\">We do not say that either the creditors or the assignee or the County Court did any wrong in fact by the agreement-order of August 17, 1895; it may have been a proper thing to do; but it can not be tolerated that such interveners in this case as filed their claims with the assignee and received dividends from the assigned estate be permitted at the same time to enjoy the benefits of the assignment and to assail it by creditor\u2019s bills. So strongly has this principle cbeen enforced that in a case where the deed of assignment itself was void on its face, the court held the creditor, who by some significant act has made himself a party to the assignment, may not take any steps to impair its validity. Rapalee v. Steward, 27 N. Y. 310.</p> <p id=\"b689-5\" pgmap=\"689\">So far as appellant Taylor is concerned, his position is consistent all the way through; but not having filed his claim with the assignee, he can in no way challenge or assail the distribution of the assets of the estate; he is not a cestui que trust at the assigned estate.</p> <p id=\"b689-6\" pgmap=\"689\">The question then arises: what does the assigned estate consist of under the rules of the law, and what does the evidence in this case show to have been done to bring Setter\u2019s property rights now in contention by this bill, under the operation of the assignment running in the County Court ?</p> <p id=\"b689-7\" pgmap=\"689(41) 690(269)\">As to the lands in question, we do not deem it important to determine whether there was a preference created by Setter\u2019s deed to the creamery company when he made the assignment, or whether the deed was void for want of delivery, or whether the outstanding deed from Seiter to Ramsay was fraudulent; or whether Seiter could have compelled the Ramsaj' heirs to reconvey the lands to him, because the deed was a lawful conveyance by him to Ramsay, to secure a lawful debt, which had been paid so that the equitable title resulted to Seiter. Disregarding for the moment the outstanding deed from Seiter to Ramsay, it is too plain for discussion that if the deed to the creamery company was void for want of delivery, then the lands were still Seiter\u2019s, and they passed to the assignee by virtue of the deed of assignment; and it is equally plain that if Seiter could have compelled the Ramsay heirs to reconvey the lands to him, then the equity title of Seiter to the lands would also pass by the deed of assignment to Weir; and adopting, by analogy of reasoning, the distinction made between a fraudulent conveyance and a preference, as pointed out in Ahlgren v. Huntington, 85 Ill. App. 639, we see no reason why the assignee should not be the very party to call in the legal title from the Ramsay heirs. (See Preston v. Spalding, 120 Ill. 208; Davis et al. v. Chicago Dock Co., 129 Ill. 180.) We are of opinion that the decision in Bouton v. Dement, 122 Ill. 143, is not applicable to this case; but it is not important to determine whether the assignee or the creditors of the estate were the proper parties to initiate such a proceeding, for reasons to be hereafter stated.</p> <p id=\"b690-5\" pgmap=\"690(123) 691(58)\">The frictional point of this controversy is found in appellant\u2019s contention that by reason of the fact (a matter that we do not pass upon) that Seiter borrowed state money from Ramsay as state treasurer, and gave a deed as security for the return of such money, such deed was a mere voluntary conveyance by Seiter to Ramsay, in that the consideration was illegal and void, as determined by the Supreme Court in Witbeck v. Estate of Ramsay, 183 Ill. 550; and it is further urged that by reason of such voluntary conveyance by Seiter to Ramsay, the deed is conclusively fraudulent, and that therefore Seiter\u2019s deed of assignment could not operate upon a prior fraudulent transfe for the lands, and that inasmuch as the creditors of Seiter, who proved their claims before the assignee, have taken no legal steps to set aside this fraudulent conveyance and bring the property within the operation of the assignment before appellant filed his bill, therefore he has acquired a lien on the lands by virtue of his creditor\u2019s bill.</p> <p id=\"b691-4\" pgmap=\"691\">We are not prepared to say whether the Ohicago creditors occupy the same position in reference to Seiter\u2019s assigned estate that they have been adjudged to occupy in reference to Ramsay\u2019s estate.</p> <p id=\"b691-5\" pgmap=\"691\">If it should be admitted that the claims of the Chicago creditors are merely spurious debts, it by no means follows that the assignment itself will not be sustained for the benefit of creditors whose debts are bona fide. There is no evidence that Seiter intended any portion of his property for the Chicago creditors; if they are creditors of the estate at all, it is on the principle of subrogation in having paid Ramsay\u2019s debt to the State, and thereby succeeding to the collaterals which Ramsay held against Seiter. In the event that in the judgment of the law, the Chicago creditors shall, as against Seiter\u2019s estate, be deemed no creditors at all, such fact would not be proof of a fraudulent intent of Seiter when he made his deed; he may still have believed that the debts which he owed Ramsay\u2019s estate were good in law, for as a matter of fact he owed Ramsay\u2019s estate for the state money he had borrowed. But even if we are wrong in this view of the matter, the rule of law on the particular point now adverted to is stated by Burrill in his work on assignments, section 82, and is as follows: \u201c The preponderance of authority seems to be in favor of the opinion that the assignment will be held good as to all debts that are bona fide; and this rule would undoubtedly prevail in those states where provision is made by statute for testing the validity of the claims presented to the assignee for payment under the assignment, citing Macintosh v. Corner, 33 Md. 607; Hempstead v. Johnston, 18 Ark. 137; Hardcastle v. Fisher, 24 Mo. 75. Ample provision for such a test is found in sections four and five of our assignment law.</p> <p id=\"b692-5\" pgmap=\"692\">Should it be admitted that the Chicago creditors hold spurious claims, the fact remains that there are still creditors, exclusive of the Chicago parties, whose claims are bona fide, and who before the 17th of August, 1895, had proved up their claims before the assignee. By such proof of claims their rights in the estate became vested. (Levy v. Chicago National Bank, 158 Ill. 88; Weir v. Mowe, 182 Ill. 444.) The record fails to show the exact amount of admittedly valid claims proved up before the assignee; certain it is, that the St. Louis banks were among these bona fide creditors, and that their claims alone amounted to more than $106,000. That these creditors could, by the institution of legal proceedings, have compelled the claimed fraudulent conveyance to Bamsay to be set aside for the benefit of the assigned estate, does not admit of discussion (Hinckley v. Reed, 182 Ill. 440), provided such legal steps were taken before appellant filed his bill. If before the filing of such a bill, Bamsay\u2019s heirs have, without legal compulsion, yielded up by their deed to Seiter\u2019s assignee, property which was fraudulently conveyed to their ancestor, then such act simply puts the property into its proper channel. The Seiter creditors, who hold bona fide claims, had an equitable remedy to compel the Bamsay heirs to put the property where it belonged, even though Seiter\u2019s assignee was powerless to do so. If the lands reconveyed by the Bamsay heirs, came to a lawful resting place, it can not make any difference whether it came there with or without legal proceedings, nor whether a proper or an improper party took the initiative to bring it within the operation of Seiter\u2019s assignment.</p> <p id=\"b692-6\" pgmap=\"692(89) 693(11)\">Bid, then, the land come to the hand of the assignee before appellant filed his bill ? It did in substance, if not in form. It is true that the lands were not conveyed directly by Bamsay\u2019s heirs to Weir, the assignee, but such was the transaction by legal intendment. We view the transaction to be the same as if the Bamsay heirs had deeded the land to Weir, the assignee, and he in turn, by direction of the County Court, had deeded them to the three trustees, in conformity to the order of partial distribution, of August 17, 1895.</p> <p id=\"b693-4\" pgmap=\"693\">The method adopted saved the trouble and expense of making and recording an extra deed. If the act of the Eamsay heirs in deeding these lands to the trustees, had not had the sanction of the County Court, there would be much force in appellant\u2019s contention that the lands are still in the hands of the trustees, tainted with the claimed fraudulent conveyance between Seiter and Eamsay; and so it must be held, that all of Setter\u2019s property which came rightfully into the assignment, no matter by what instrumentality, and which is now being administered by the County Court, is withdrawn from all ordinary remedies at law or in equity, which belong to creditors who do not file their claims.</p> <p id=\"b693-5\" pgmap=\"693\">For anything that appears in this bill, it might, irrespective of the claims of the Chicago creditors, have taken every dollar of property which has come into the assignment, to pay all bona fide claims in full; and if bona fide creditors have agreed to share the estate with those who are no creditors at all, that must be their concern.</p> <p id=\"b693-6\" pgmap=\"693\">If, however, it shall appear that in the assigned estate there is more .than enough to pay the admittedly valid claims filed- against it, and that such excess is in danger of being dissipated in payment of illegal or fictitious claims, then, if equity affords a remedy to such of appellants as have not filed their claims with the assignee, it is plain that such remedy will have to respect the assignment in the County Court, and the powers of the assignee there, and be confined to purging the trust fund of such alleged fictitious or illegal claims upon it. That question is not before us on this record and we express no opinion concerning it.</p> <p id=\"b693-7\" pgmap=\"693\">The action of the Circuit Court being in accordance with the views herein expressed, the decree dismissing the bill and the petition of the intervenors is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
