Lowe, III, J.), entered December 12, 2006, which, to the extent appealed from, denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, unanimously affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Plaintiff contracted to perform the electrical work in the renovation of defendant\u2019s building on Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn for a contract price of $1,399,000. At issue is a claim submitted by plaintiff, on or about September 6, 2002, for $1,229,674 in additional costs allegedly caused by defendant\u2019s breaches of contract, delays, interference and disruptions, and its supplying inadequate contract plans and specifications, thereby preventing plaintiff from completing the work by the scheduled date.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Pursuant to section 5.03 of the standard terms and conditions of the contract, plaintiff was required to submit to the construction manager for approval each month an \u201cApplication for Payment for Work\u201d performed and to be performed during that particular month. Each application was to include a lien waiver \u201cfor all payments for Work including that portion of Work included in the Application for Payment,\u201d entitled \u201cWaiver of Lien to Date,\u201d which contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cTRADE/SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S AFFIDAVIT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\u201c(Name of Officer)_being duly sworn, deposes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">and says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201cI am the (office held)_of Trade/Subcontractor. <em>I make this affidavit for the purpose of inducing Construction Manager I Contractor to make partial payment to us </em>for work, labor and services performed and/or materials furnished, as set forth on our Application for Payment dated_.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201cAll labor employed and materials furnished by us or our subcontractors or vendors in connection with our work on this Project <em>to the date of our Immediate Preceding Application for</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\"><em>Payment dated_have been paid, </em>including any and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">all applicable sales or use taxes and applicable union fringe benefits, and <em>there are no liens or claims existent with respect thereto.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">\u201cTRADE/SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S WAIVER OF LIEN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">\u201cThe undersigned Trade/Subcontractor for One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and valuable consideration received by it, hereby <em>waives and releases the Owner, </em>Construction Manager/ Contractor, and the Project <em>of all claims for payment for work, labor or materials furnished </em>to_, <em>the date of this Application for Payment. . . </em>The undersigned Trade/Subcontractor further covenants and agrees that it shall not in any way claim or file a mechanic\u2019s or other lien against the Project. . . for any work, labor or materials furnished by it or to the Project. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">\u201cThis Trade/Subcontractor\u2019s Affidavit and Waiver of Lien to Date <em>are executed and delivered simultaneously with or after payment for the labor performed and materials furnished to the date of this Application for Payment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">During the course of the renovation, plaintiff executed a total of 38 waivers between April 4, 2000 and February 9, 2004, including 10 executed after its September 6, 2002 claim for extras.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Prior to any discovery, defendant moved for leave to amend its answer to assert a defense of waiver, and for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that plaintiff waived all of its claims. The IAS court granted leave to amend, but denied summary dismissal without prejudice to renewal after additional discovery pertaining to the newly amended answer and the parties\u2019 course of dealing and intent as to the Waiver of Lien document.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-17\">Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to what payments the parties intended the waivers of lien to affect, and as to their course of conduct during the ongoing renovation while defendant was making progress payments. Since the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>waiver and the contract between the parties expressly provide for partial payments upon execution of the waiver, \u201cthe waiver form is construed as merely a receipt for the monies referenced in the waiver. . . . Where a waiver form purports to acknowledge that no further payments are owed, but the parties\u2019 conduct indicates otherwise, the instrument will not be construed as a release\u201d <em>(West End Interiors v Aim Constr. &amp; Contr. Corp., </em>286 AD2d 250, 252 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Thus, defendant\u2019s conduct in subsequently paying plaintiff for work theoretically released by prior payments may reasonably be considered completely inconsistent with its theory of general release. For example, the record indicates that defendant, after making an initial payment on a certain part of plaintiffs work and receiving an executed \u201cWaiver of Lien to Date\u201d with respect thereto, made subsequent payments pursuant to the same \u201cApplication for Payment for Work.\u201d Concur\u2014 Tom, J.E, Mazzarelli, Andrias, Williams and McGuire, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
