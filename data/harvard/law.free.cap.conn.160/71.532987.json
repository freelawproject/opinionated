The facts are not in dispute. On October 1, 1965, the plaintiffs owned a tract of land consisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of 10.96 acres of cultivated nursery land. This land was leased to Johnson\u2019s Nursery, Inc., to be used for growing plants, trees and shrubs. Nurseries are a permitted use in the one-acre residential zone wherein this property is located. On October 1, 1965, the land was fully cultivated with plants, trees, bushes and shrubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On October 28, 1965, the plaintiffs applied to the assessor to classify the land as farmland, but the assessor refused so to classify it. The plaintiffs appealed to the board of tax review. The board sustained the decision of the assessor. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas from the decision of the board of tax review. The trial court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the ground that the land was \u201cfarm land\u201d within the purview of ^ 12-107a\u201412-107e of the General Statutes. From the judgment rendered the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u201cIn 1963, the General Assembly enacted \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a \u201412-107c of the General Statutes, which provided for preferential tax treatment of farmland. In its \u2018 [d] eclaration of policy,\u2019 \u00a7 12-107a declares that it is in the public interest to encourage the preservation of farmland in order ts&gt; maintain a readily available source of food and farm products close to the metropolitan areas of the state and to prevent the forced conversion of farmland to more intensive uses as a result of economic pressures caused by the assessment of the land for purposes of property taxation at values incompatible with their preservation as farmland.\u201d <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Newington, </em>156 Conn. 107, 109, 239 A.2d 478. In addition to the tax aspect of \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a\u201412-107e, the statute is concerned with conservation. As originally enacted by the legislature, \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>12-107e were parts of Public Act No. 490 of the January, 1963, legislative session. That act is entitled: \u201cAn Act Concerning the Taxation and Preservation of Farm, Forest, and Open Space Land.\u201d An examination of this public act clearly indicates that the legislature contemplated more than the mere creation of tax advantages for producers of food products. A portion of Public Act 490, \u00a7 7, was not incorporated into the tax statutes, but rather, became a part of a general statutory provision, \u00a7 7-131a, which is entitled \u201cConservation commissions.\u201d It is thus clear that \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a\u201412-107e, as derived from Public Act 490, are as much conservation statutes as they are tax relief measures. The declaration of policy in \u00a7 12-107a recites, inter alia, that it is in the public interest \u201cto conserve the state\u2019s natural resources\u201d. Indeed, it would appear that the purpose of the tax relief is to aid the conservation effort, and not merely to aid food production itself. Clearly, aid to farm food production is not the sole purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The question decisive of this appeal is whether \u201ccultivated nursery land\u201d constitutes \u201cfarm land,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 12-107b. \u201cThe intent of a statute is to be sought first in the language used, and if that is unambiguous we need not resort to other aids of interpretation.\u201d <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 280, 240 A.2d 886. \u201c[F]arm land\u201d, as defined in \u00a7 12-107b, is \u201cany tract or tracts of land, including woodland and wasteland, constituting a farm unit\u201d. \u201c[F]arm land\u201d is thus not specifically defined. \u201c[F]arm land\u201d is \u201cland constituting a farm unit.\u201d The two are equal. All that is stated is that we must look to the definitions of \u201cfarm\u201d and \u201cunit\u201d to discover what is meant by \u201cfarm land.\u201d Since neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201cfarm\u201d nor \u201cunit\u201d is defined in \u00a7 12-107b, the statute is ambiguous and we must resort to other aids for their definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Under \u00a7 1-1 of the General Statutes, in the construction of statutes, \u201cwords and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d. This would indicate that where, as here, the statute in question is barren as to specific definitions, the approach should be to discover the common usage. Section 1-1, however, continues by defining certain terms. Among them appears: \u201cExcept as otherwise specifically defined, the words \u2018agriculture\u2019 and \u2018farming\u2019 shall include cultivation of the soil . . . , forestry, [and] raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity .... The term \u2018farm\u2019 includes farm buildings, nurseries . . . greenhouses or structures used primarily for the raising of agricultural or horticultural commodities.\u201d Thus, a nursery is expressly included in the statutory definition of a \u201cfarm\u201d. \u201c[F] arming\u201d includes the cultivation of the soil and the raising of any agricultural or horticultural commodity. Since \u201chorticulture\u201d is not defined, we must apply common usage. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201chorticulture\u201d as \u201cthe cultivation of an orchard, garden, or nursery on a small or large scale: the science and art of growing . . . ornamental plants\u201d. The same source defines \u201ccommodity\u201d as \u201ca product of agriculture\u201d. It is thus clear that, by including the raising or harvesting of any \u201chorticultural commodity\u201d, the \u00a7 1-1 definition of \u201cfarming\u201d and \u201cagriculture\u201d does include nurseries.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u201cIt is an elementary principle of statutory construction that \u2018[n]o word in the statute shall be treated as superfluous, void or insignificant, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>there are impelling reasons . . . why the principle cannot be followed.\u2019 <em>General Motors Corporation </em>v. <em>Mulquin, </em>134 Conn. 118, 126, 55 A.2d 732.\u201d <em>Archibald </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>152 Conn. 663, 668, 211 A.2d 692. To search for a definition beyond that in \u00a7 1-1 would require us to ignore the specific direction that \u201cagriculture\u201d and \u201cfarming\u201d <em>shall </em>be defined as stated therein. To do so would be improper. Thus, we must apply the definitions prescribed by the legislature in \u00a7 1-1. The last sentence of the \u00a7 1-1 definitions here considered directs that those definitions \u201cshall not be construed ... to grant any local property tax exemptions other than those granted under the general statutes to real or personal property used in agriculture or farming.\u201d In this case, the \u00a7 1-1 definitions are pertinent because, while \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a\u201412-107c purport to exempt \u201cfarm land,\u201d the term is not defined. In applying the definition found in \u00a7 1-1, therefore, no property exemption not allowed in V 12-107a\u201412-107c is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">This brings us to the definition of the word \u201cunit.\u201d Resorting once again to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary for the common usage, we find the definition to be: \u201ca single thing . . . that is a constituent and isolable member of some more inclusive whole.\u201d Combining the definitions of \u201cfarm\u201d and \u201cunit,\u201d and transplanting them into the \u00a7 12-107b definition of \u201cfarm land\u201d we have, as pertinent to the instant case: a tract or tracts of land making up a portion of a geographical area which is used as a nursery. Thus viewed, the definition is determinative of the issue. Nursery land is \u201cfarm land\u201d within the purview of \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a\u201412-107e of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The defendant argues that in \u00a7 12-81, subparagraphs (39) and (44), the terms \u201c[f]arm produce\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>and \u201c[njursery products\u201d are mutually exclusive, and thus that the legislature did not intend \u201cfarm land\u201d to encompass nurseries. For us to apply \u00a7 12-81 as requested would be to ignore \u00a7 1-1, or to determine that \u00a7 12-81 expresses general legislative intent and that \u00a7 1-1 does not. Neither approach would be correct. Section 1-1 contains general definitions to be used in all cases unless the legislature specifically provides otherwise in a statute. In \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a\u201412-107e there is no definition of \u201cfarm\u201d and we must thus use the \u00a7 1-1 definition. We cannot resort to \u00a7 12-81 to determine intent when, as here, \u00a7 1-1 is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Our interpretation of \u201cfarm land\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a\u201412-107c is supported by the legislative purpose expressed in \u00a7 12-107a. While nurseries do not provide sources of food in close proximity to metropolitan areas, under the accepted definition of \u201cfarm\u201d, they probably do provide \u201cfarm products\u201d. Even were we to accept the defendant\u2019s contention that nursery products are <em>not </em>farm products, as shown by \u00a7 12-81, nurseries would still promote the further purposes of \u00a7 12-107a. They do encourage the preservation of farmland and they do conserve natural resources. By using the terms \u201copen space land\u201d and \u201cwasteland\u201d the statute is most unambiguous in stating that its purpose relates to the condition of the land as much as it does to the type of products produced thereon. The legislative purpose is thus sufficiently broad to include nurseries.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
