Kinne, of which the named defendant is administrator. Both defendants appeared specially and each filed a plea in abatement on the ground that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved persons because they had no interest in the estate. The Superior Court, on a stipulation of facts by all the parties, sustained the pleas. From a judgment rendered thereon, the plaintiffs have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. Burton W. Banne, a resident of Hartford, died intestate on October 13, 1968. He left no spouse, issue, parents, brothers, sisters or issue of brothers or sisters surviving him. His nearest surviving relative was his aunt, the defendant Lindsay, who was a sister of his late mother. Also surviving him were the plaintiffs, the children of the late Wilbur B. Bennett, who was a brother of the late mother. Thus, the plaintiffs are cousins of the intestate. On March 2, 1970, the Probate Court for the district of Hartford adjudged the defendant Lindsay to be the nearest surviving relative of the intestate and sole distributee of his estate. The plaintiffs contend that, as children of the late Wilbur B. Bennett, they legally represent him and, therefore, the Kinne estate should be divided into two equal parts with one to be distributed to them and the other to the defendant Lindsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The dispositive issue before us is whether the plaintiffs are \u201caggrieved\u201d persons within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 45-288.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">We first turn to General Statutes \u00a745-276, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>wMcli the pertinent portion appears in the footnote<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and which governs the distribution of an intestate\u2019s estate such as the one before us. This statute designates \u201cchildren or any legal representatives of them\u201d, \u201cbrothers and sisters of the whole blood and those who legally represent them\u201d and \u201cbrothers and sisters of the half blood and those who legally represent them,\u201d thereby allowing for representation of an intestate\u2019s children and of an intestate\u2019s brothers and sisters. (See General Statutes \u00a7 45-274 for distribution to spouse and children.) Section 45-276 further provides, \u201cthen equally to the next of kin in equal degree, kindred of the whole blood to take in preference to kindred of the half blood in equal degree, and no representatives to be admitted among collaterals after the representatives of brothers and sisters.\u201d The plaintiffs seek to have us interpret this language to mean \u201cthen equally to the next of kin in equal degree or those who legally represent brothers and sisters among next of kin in equal degree.\u201d In the statutory phrase, however, \u201cno representatives to be admitted among collaterals after the representatives of brothers and sisters\u201d, the words \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d mean brothers and sisters of the intestate. This language, read in the light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>of the entire statute, can mean only that the legislature intended to limit representation among collaterals to those to whom the statute had accorded the right, namely, brothers and sisters of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">While we have never examined \u00a7 45-276 under a factual situation identical to that presented here, we have expressed the rule, under an earlier statute of distribution, as to representation by collaterals. In <em>Campbell\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 277, 29 A. 494, the next of kin of the intestate included five first cousins. The appellant was a second cousin of the deceased. This court interpreted the applicable statute, \u00a7 632 of the Revision of 1888, of which the pertinent provisions are identical to General Statutes \u00a745-276, as follows: \u201cAnother first cousin was the mother of the appellant; but as she died before the intestate, and there is no representation among cousins under our statute of distribution, the appellant had no right to share in the inheritance, as one of the next of kin\u201d. Id., 292; see also <em>Culver </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>120 Conn. 97, 108, 179 A. 487; <em>Dickerman </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>83 Conn. 342, 345, 76 A. 362. Clearly, under \u00a7 45-276, cousins and aunts and uncles are classes within the term \u201cnext of kin\u201d. The expressed rule that there is no representation among cousins applies equally to \u201cnext of kin\u201d who are aunts or uncles.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The plaintiffs rely on <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>62 Ohio App. 488, 24 N.E.2d 603, claiming that there the statute of distribution is in all material respects the same as our \u00a7 45-276. Clearly, this is not so, and the claim is without merit. Reliance is also placed on <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>115 Conn. 239, 242, 161 A. 94, and <em>Close </em>v. <em>Benham, </em>97 Conn. 102, 106, 115 A. 626. Neither case has application to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The language of \u00a7 45-276 does not support the construction claimed by the plaintiffs. If there is any doubt as to the legislative intent, one should look to the entire act. <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <em>LeWitt, </em>126 Conn. 588, 592, 13 A.2d 510. Its parts must be construed, so far as possible, as operative and harmonious with every other part. <em>McAdams </em>v. <em>Barbieri, </em>143 Conn. 405, 418, 123 A.2d 182; <em>Savings Bank of Rockville </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>117 Conn. 188, 193, 167 A. 709. If the legislature had wished to extend the right of representation as claimed by the plaintiffs it would have done so. In viewing the statute we find no doubt as to the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 45-288 limits the right of appeal from a decree of a court of probate to one who is aggrieved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, to be \u201caggrieved\u201d within the meaning of this statute, must have not only a pecuniary interest but a pecuniary interest which has been injuriously affected by the decree appealed from. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Houck, </em>143 Conn. 433, 437-38, 123 A.2d 177; <em>Kaskel </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>142 Conn. 379, 384, 114 A.2d 853; <em>Weidlich </em>v. <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>139 Conn. 652, 656, 96 A.2d 547. If the plaintiffs are not parties aggrieved, the appeal is void. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>107 Conn. 354, 357, 140 A. 731. If the plaintiffs are not persons actually aggrieved by the decree, the Superior Court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the appeal. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660; <em>Weidlich </em>v. <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>120 Conn. 405, 409, 182 A. 138. The plaintiffs have failed to show a pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>interest in the estate because, under \u00a7 45-276, they are not distributees of the estate. They have no standing, therefore, to appeal from the decree of the Probate Court. The pleas in abatement were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> \u201cSec. 45-276. when there are no children or representatives op them. If there are no children or any legal representatives of them, then, after the portion of the husband or wife, if any, is distributed or set out, the residue of the estate shall be distributed equally to the parent or parents of the intestate, and, if there is no parent, then equally to the brothers and sisters of the whole blood and those who legally represent them, and, if there is no such kindred, then equally to the brothers and sisters of the half blood and those who legally represent them, and, if there is no parent or brothers and sisters of the whole or half blood or those who legally represent them, then equally to the next of kin in equal degree, kindred of the whole blood to take in preference to kindred of the half blood in equal degree, and no representatives to be admitted among collaterals after the representatives of brothers and sisters\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\"> \u201cSee. 45-288. appeals prom probate.
