DiSesa as executor under the will of Daniel P. B. Hickey to determine the construction of Hickey\u2019s will and the validity and effect of the dispositive provisions of a trust indenture which Hickey had entered into during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The basic facts are not in dispute. Hickey was a graduate of the Yale Law School and between 1911 and 1958 had actively practiced law in Connecticut. He was a trained and experienced lawyer. His first wife died in 1959, at which time he received a share of a trust which she had established in 1921, and of which Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company was trustee. Hickey discussed with one of that bank\u2019s trust officers arrangements for a trust to be created by him and while the trust agreement was in preparation he married Carmela Sassone in March, 1962. In the preparation of the trust instrument Hickey\u2019s attorney was Prank J. DiSesa, who prepared the final version of the trust instrument. DiSesa was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>member of the Connecticut bar and first became associated with Hickey in 1931. They were warm friends and DiSesa performed many legal and personal services for Hickey.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The trust indenture between Hickey and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company was executed on March 19, 1962. Under its terms the trustee was to pay monthly income to Hickey in addition to such accrued income as he directed to be paid. He reserved broad powers to direct the administration of the trust and the right at any time to revoke, alter or amend it. Hickey also retained the power to invade the principal of the trust at any time. Although he did not exercise this latter power he did withdraw from the trust substantial amounts of accumulated income, including $9500 during 1966. Article second of the trust provided that on Hickey\u2019s death, if the trust had not been sooner terminated, the trustee should distribute the trust property to such person or persons as he appointed by his last will and testament and in default of such appointment then to those persons who would take his personal estate under Connecticut law governing the distribution of intestate personal estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In Mareh, 1962, Hickey and his wife moved to Florida but they returned to Connecticut in June, 1964, and thereafter lived in an apartment in Greenwich until Hickey\u2019s death on October 22, 1966. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Starting in November, 1965, Hickey began discussing witb DiSesa as Ms attorney the preparation of a will. At all times both of them were familiar with the provisions of the trust, including its terms providing for a power of appointment and for the disposition of the trust property in default of an exercise of the power of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">On January 20, 1966, Hickey\u2019s will was executed in DiSesa\u2019s office. The will makes no reference whatsoever to the trust agreement nor to the power of appointment reserved to Hickey in article second of the trust agreement. By its terms the will directed the payment of debts, expenses and taxes, appointed DiSesa to be executor and in article second provided: \u201cI direct that my friend and associate of long standing, my attorney and executor . . . shall receive a total fee as my attorney and executor for admiMstering my estate, an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the gross inventory of my estate.\u201d After bequeathing Hickey\u2019s jewelry and automobile to Mrs. Hickey, the will in article fourth devised and bequeathed \u201call of the remainder of my estate, both real and personal, to my said executor, to be distributed nevertheless by him as such executor as follows\u201d: (a) one-half to Mrs. Hickey; (b) $5000 to a nephew, Harold Hickey; (c) $10,000 to a nephew Marvin N. Hickey; (d) $10,000 to a niece, Joan; and (e) $25,000 to establish a scholarship fund with The Stamford Scholarship Foundation. Then in article fifth the will provided: \u201cAll the rest and residue of my estate, of every kind and description not otherwise disposed of herein, I give, devise and bequeath to my niece, Marian Harrell, of 238 Elizabeth Road, San Antonio, Texas, daughter of my said late sister Jessie Standish to be hers absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">When the will was executed there was between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>$743,449.66 and $744,795.57 in the trust estate held by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. There was approximately $23,950.71 in personal property, cash and savings accounts owned jointly in survivor-ship by Hickey with his wife. Hickey then had approximately $28,918.14 in personal property and his own savings and checking accounts. He was seventy-seven years of age when he died, ten months after the execution of the will. At that time the trust assets amounted to $661,364.54, the property owned jointly with his wife amounted to $31,239.08 and his solely owned personal property, savings and checking accounts amounted to $25,920.58. The court\u2019s finding offers no explanation for the $82,085 decrease in the size of the trust estate between January 20, 1966, and Hickey\u2019s death on October 22, 1966, although the court did find that he \u201chad not transferred or disposed of any substantial amounts of assets between the time of the execution of the will and the date of his death.\u201d At the time of his death Mrs. Hickey was his sole heir-at-law and the person who would have taken all of his personal estate under the laws of Connecticut had he died intestate. At no time did Hickey discuss with her the contents of his will or its dispositive provisions nor tell her that she would receive all or any particular amount of his estate. He did tell her that she would have nothing to worry about, that she was to be his \u201cheiress\u201d, and that as he was pleased with the way the bank had handled his trust, the bank would take care of her. At no time did he discuss the will with the officer of the bank in charge of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">All parties in interest were made parties to the executor\u2019s suit and in addition to claims for a decree construing the will, a decree directing to whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>trust estate should be paid, and an allowance from the estate to the several parties for their expenses and counsel fees, the plaintiff sought the answers to five specific questions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The court answered the questions as follows: (a) The value of the jointly-held property should be excluded in making the computations necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>determine the amount to he received by Frank J. DiSesa under article second of said will, but all other assets, including those held in the trust, should be included, (b) The power of appointment reserved by Daniel F. B. Hickey in article second of the inter vivos trust indenture was exercised by the will as a whole, read in the light of all the surrounding circumstances. (c) The portion of the estate passing to Carmela Hickey under article fourth, subdivision (a) of the will shall be computed and paid over before setting aside the legacies provided for in the subsequent paragraphs of the will, (d) As answered in (b) above. (e) Although the trust indenture reserves extensive powers to the grantor and strongly resembles a custodial agreement, the trust indenture was a valid inter vivos trust without compliance with the execution requirements of the New York or Connecticut statute of wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Judgment was entered accordingly, including an allowance from the estate for the expenses of the parties and $10,000 to counsel for DiSesa as executor, $10,000 to counsel for DiSesa in his individual capacity, $6000 to counsel for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, $5000 to counsel for Harold Hickey, Marvin Hickey, Joan Standish and The Stamford Scholarship Foundation, $10,000 to counsel for Marian Harrell, and $11,350 to counsel for Carmela Hickey. From that judgment Carmela Hickey has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Although the appeal raises many questions based on numerous assignments of error, clearly the most important ones concern the question whether the power of appointment reserved by Hickey in the trust indenture was duly exercised by the provisions of his will. Of the remaining assignments of error there are several which relate to matters bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>more or less directly on this main question and others relate to attacks on the finding and to the admission of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We first consider the question as to whether the power of appointment was exercised by Hickey in his will. Some states have by statute provided that a testator whose will purports to dispose of all of his property shall be held to have exercised any power of appointment which he possessed at the time of his death unless the will expresses or implies an intent to the contrary. See note, 16 A.L.R.3d 911, 920; Restatement, 3 Property \u00a7343. We have no such statute in this state and as this court repeated as recently as 1962 in <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>149 Conn. 331, 344, 179 A.2d 604: \u201cIn Connecticut, however, the common-law rule applies .... Under this rule, a testator will not be considered as having executed or having intended to execute a testamentary power of appointment unless the will contains \u2018a reference to the power itself or to the subject of it, [or] unless the intention to execute [the power] is manifest from the fact that the will would remain inoperative without the aid of the power, or is so clearly demonstrated by words or acts . . . that the transaction is not fairly susceptible of any other interpretation.\u2019 <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Shaw, . . . </em>[46 Conn. 248, 252]; <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>99 Conn. 245, 252, 122 A. 105; <em>HartfordConnecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>105 Conn. 57, 69, 134 A. 155. Our rule appears to be in accord with the modern general rule as stated in an annotation in 127 A.L.R. 248 at 249. See also notes, 91 A.L.R. 433, 94 A.L.R. 26, 173.\u201d For a later annotation see 15 A.L.R.3d 346. Paraphrasing and quoting further language from the <em>Huntington </em>case, supra, 345: There is nothing in the will suggestive of an intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>to exercise the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company power of appointment. We can read this will from beginning to end without receiving a suggestion or intimation that the testator had a power of appointment under that trust. The will does not indicate that he even had the power of appointment in mind or that he actually or in fact intended to exercise the power of appointment. \u201cIt is not true that every testator wishes to exercise any and all powers of appointment conferred on him. ... A general residuary clause does express an intention to dispose of a testator\u2019s entire estate and avoid any intestacy. <em>Ministers Benefit Board </em>v. <em>Meriden Trust Co., </em>139 Conn. 435, 447, 94 A.2d 917. It does not, however, express an intention to exercise a power of appointment. Such a power operates on property forming no part of the estate of the donee, and therefore his nonexercise of the power cannot result in any intestacy in his estate. <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Variell, </em>143 Conn. 524, 528, 123 A.2d 874. This is one of the reasons for the common-law rule long in effect in Connecticut, as opposed to the contrary rule which Massachusetts has evolved in its case law and New York has adopted by statute. See <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>46 Conn. 248, 255. Both on principle and authority we consider ours the better rule.\u201d <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>supra, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We have examined with care the court\u2019s finding of fact and are unable to agree that it supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the will exercised the power of appointment. As already noted, the will made no mention of the trust, the assets of the trust or the power of appointment. Applying the further test as stated in <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>supra, we are unable to conclude that despite this omission the intention to exercise the power was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u201cmanifest\u201d or \u201cso clearly demonstrated by words or acts . . . that the transaction is not fairly susceptible of any other interpretation.\u201d An intention is \u201cmanifest\u201d when it is \u201ccapable of being readily and instantly perceived by the senses\u201d; \u201ccapable of being easily understood or recognized at once by the mind\u201d; \u201cobvious.\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. As we indicated in <em>Alling </em>v. <em>Levitt, </em>112 Conn. 586, 592, 153 A. 166, a fact is manifest when it appears upon the face of a record or is \u201creadily apparent from an examination of authoritative sources of information, but not those the truth of which . . . [has] to be determined by the weighing of evidence or the credibility of witnesses, or the balancing of facts and circumstances or by processes of inference or deduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The court found that when the will was prepared both Hickey and DiSesa were familiar with the provisions of the trust including the terms providing for a power of appointment by will and for disposition of the trust property in default of the exercise of the power. Both Hickey and DiSesa were lawyers and we are loath to assume that they did not know or failed to ascertain the long and well-established Connecticut law concerning the testamentary exercise of powers of appointment, See <em>Sadler </em>v. <em>Sadler, </em>107 Conn. 409, 413, 414, 140 A. 639. It appears that the will was drafted between November, 1965, and January, 1966,\u2014within four years of the publication of the decision in the <em>Huntington </em>case. Hiekey had no children and his wife was his sole heir. Accordingly, in default of an exercise of the power of appointment she would take the trust estate.' Hickey had told her that she would have nothing to worry about, that she was to be his \u201cheiress,\u201d that he was pleased with the way the bank had handled the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>and that \u201cthe bank would take care of her.\u201d As his surviving wife Mrs. Hickey was \u201cthe natural object of his bounty.\u201d <em>Salvatore </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>144 Conn. 437, 441, 133 A.2d 622; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>108 Conn. 572, 585, 143 A. 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The appellees place much reliance upon the circumstance that unless the will were construed to be an exercise of the power of appointment there were not sufficient assets in his estate to accomplish in full the objectives of his will providing for specific bequests with a residue to a favored niece. This circumstance is a significant factor in determining whether an intention to exercise a power of appointment is \u201cmanifest\u201d or \u201cclearly demonstrated.\u201d <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>105 Conn. 57, 70, 134 A. 155. See note, 15 A.L.R.3d 346; Restatement, 3 Property \u00a7 343, comment e. In this connection, however, and in contrast to the situation which existed in the <em>Thayer </em>case, Hickey at the time the will was executed had full and complete power to withdraw from the trust any part or all of the principal and had the right to exercise this power right up until the time of his death. He was thus in a position at any time before his death to change the size of the estate which would pass by the terms of his will and thus the ultimate disposition of it by withdrawing from the trust principal which would pass by his will or refraining from such withdrawal and leaving the entire principal to be distributed under the default provisions of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In short, on the basis of the facts found by the trial court it was not justified in finding an intention on the part of Hickey to exercise the power of appointment which was \u201cmanifest\u201d or \u201cso clearly demonstrated by words or acts . . . that the transaction is not fairly susceptible of any other inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>pretation.\u201d \u201c \u2018The intention to execute the power must be apparent and clear, so that the transaction is not susceptible of any other interpretation, and if it is doubtful under all the circumstances, that doubt will prevent it from being deemed an execution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>99 Conn. 245, 255, 122 A. 105. The court was in error in concluding that the power of appointment was exercised by Hickey\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In the light of this conclusion it is unnecessary to discuss all of the appellant\u2019s remaining assignments of error and we confine the balance of our opinion to a consideration of the remaining questions of will construction raised by the appeal and questions necessary to its final disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Although they did not file a cross appeal, the appellees filed an assignment of errors in which they claimed that the trial court committed error in reaching the conclusion that \u201c[ajlthough the trust indenture reserves extensive powers to the grantor and strongly resembles a custodial agreement, the trust indenture was a valid inter vivos trust without compliance with the execution requirements of the New York or Connecticut statute of wills.\u201d They have fully briefed their contention that the trust created by Hickey was not in fact a valid trust but rather an agreement in the nature of a custodial or agency arrangement so that the assets held by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company remained assets of Hickey\u2019s estate and as such passed directly by virtue of the dispositive provisions of his will. Such a claim should properly have been raised by a cross appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 607; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>150 Conn. 366, 382, 190 A.2d 33. As the appellant properly points out, the procedure followed by the appellees could be prejudicial to an appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 619 requires the trial court to set forth in its finding such facts as may be \u201cnecessary to present the questions which the appellant desires reviewed.\u201d The court is not expected, much less required, to speculate as to what issues the appellees might also wish to have reviewed incident to the appellant\u2019s appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 623 permitting the assignment of errors by an appellee is limited to assignments \u201cdirected to the finding of any fact or refusal to find any fact.\u201d The assignment of error by the appellees here is directed not to a finding of fact but to a conclusion of law. As the appellant further properly asserts, an appellant in such circumstances is not adequately protected by the right to file a reply brief since the finding is designed to present to this court the facts necessary to test the issues raised by the appeal as taken and an appellant in submitting his draft finding cannot be expected to incorporate in that draft finding facts adequate to test the then unknown claims of an appellee. Nor would the appellant in preparing his assignment of errors have the opportunity to contest any improper findings relating to the appellee\u2019s then undisclosed claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Since it appears that despite the procedural defect the appellant in this instance has in no wise been prejudiced and the question has been fully briefed, we have decided to consider the merits of the appellees\u2019 claim. We conclude that the powers which Hickey reserved to terminate and to control the investment policy of the trust did not render the trust void as an attempted testamentary disposition. A transfer in trust is not invalid as an attempted testamentary disposition merely because under the terms of the trust the settlor is to receive the income for life and has the power of modification and termina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tion. <em>Cherniack </em>v. <em>Home National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>151 Conn. 367, 369, 198 A.2d 58. Nor do we find that the powers which Hickey reserved to approve the trustee\u2019s investment policy negated the existence of a valid trust. See 1 Scott, Trusts (3d Ed.) \u00a757.2; Restatement (Second), 1 Trusts \u00a7 57, and such cases as <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Joy, </em>315 Mass. 457, 53 N.E.2d 113; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>181 Ill. 49, 54 N.E. 615. As Professor Scott observed in the cited section (1 Scott, op. cit., p. 485), \u201c[t]he trend of the modern authorities is to uphold an inter vivos trust no matter how extensive may be the powers over the administration of the trust reserved by the settlor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">It is unquestioned that the trust agreement was duly and legally executed by the settlor and the trustee, that the assets constituting the trust res were delivered to the trustee and the trustee held legal title to them at the time of Hickey\u2019s death. Contrary to the contention of the appellees, it is not a condition to the creation of a valid trust that the trust instrument create a vested interest in some ascertained beneficiary. It is sufficient that, as here, the trust instrument provide for a determination of the identity of the ultimate beneficiaries by the exercise of a testamentary power of appointment or in default of an exercise of the power then to such persons as would take from the settlor under the statutes governing the distribution of intestate property. 1 Scott, op. cit. \u00a7 56.4; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Horticultural Society, </em>171 Mass. 401, 50 N.E. 936. We find no error in the attacked conclusion of the court that the trust created by Hickey was a valid inter vivos trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We next consider the problem of the proper basis upon which the fee to be paid to DiSesa as executor should be computed. The will provided that DiSesa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u201cshall receive a total fee as my attorney and executor for administering my estate, an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the gross inventory of my estate.\u201d The first question asked of the trial court was an inquiry as to how this fee should be computed. The term \u201cgross inventory\u201d is one not used in our General Statutes or case law. As the trial court noted in its memorandum of decision: \u201cCounsel have been unable to furnish the court with a precedent for its guidance in interpreting the language of the will in this regard.\u201d It does not appear that the trial court was able to find any guiding precedent and neither have we. The court reached the conclusion that the value of the jointly held property should be excluded in making the directed computation to determine DiSesa\u2019s fee, but all other assets, including those held in the trust should be included. In its memorandum of decision the court indicated that it was, \u201c[ujnder all the circumstances . . . adopting\u201d this interpretation. In thus \u201cadopting\u201d an interpretation the court exceeded its powers which were limited to construing the language used. Courts may construe a will but they are powerless to reconstruct one. <em>Smuda </em>v. <em>Smuda, </em>153 Conn. 430, 432, 217 A.2d 59; <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Buchtenkirk, </em>143 Conn. 531, 542, 124 A.2d 231. The term \u201cgross inventory\u201d has no settled meaning in our law and on the record it is impossible to determine what the testator meant by the words. In these circumstances the language of this court in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Pomeroy, </em>64 Conn. 257, 261, 29 A. 534, is pertinent: \u201cThe authorities go far, perhaps dangerously far, in countenancing an elastic exercise of the power vested in the court to make certain an obscure will on the lines of the testator\u2019s actual intent; but in every case, as a condition precedent to any exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of such power, the law demands that the court shall be satisfied that the will in question, with the circumstances lawfully proven, does in fact disclose the actual intent of the testator. In this case we can only venture an unsatisfactory guess at what possibly the testator might have wished to express, and must therefore hold the clause which contains no clearer meaning void for uncertainty.\u201d See <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Merry, </em>136 Conn. 573, 577, 72 A.2d 829; <em>Wordin\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 40, 50, 29 A. 238. Under the circumstances the indefinite instruction concerning the computation of fees to be paid to the executor must be disregarded and that fee be computed upon the usual basis of reasonable compensation under the circumstances for the services rendered. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>98 Conn. 374, 119 A. 341. Of course, in considering the size of the estate as a factor in determining what is reasonable compensation, the fact that the trust res is no part of the estate subject to administration by the executor should be considered by the court in determining the compensation to be paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The only remaining assignment of error which requires comment concerns the counsel fees and expenses allowed in the present suit. The judgment of the court directed that the assets of the trust estate be turned over to DiSesa as executor of Hickey\u2019s will for distribution under the will and made specific allowances for expenses and counsel fees, the fees amounting to $52,350. The allowances were made pursuant to the authority of \u00a7 52-251 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the court had errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ously concluded that the trust estate passed under the will by virtue of an exercise of Hickey\u2019s reserved power of testamentary appointment it had no reason to allocate the fees between the testamentary estate and the trust estate. Since under its decision the trust assets passed by direction of the will, the present suit having been brought \u201cfor the construction of a will\u201d by the executor who was a person acting in a fiduciary capacity \u201cthereunder,\u201d it properly considered the testamentary estate as \u201csuch estate\u201d as that term is used in \u00a752-251. We have concluded, however, that the power of appointment was in fact not exercised by Hickey\u2019s will but, rather, that the trust estate passed by the default provisions of the trust agreement. Accordingly, the trust assets did not become a part of \u201csuch estate\u201d as was subject to administration under the provisions of the will which the fiduciary sought to have construed. Were it not for the pleading filed by the trustee in answer to the executor\u2019s complaint we would be constrained to hold that \u00a7 52-251 did not authorize any allowance to counsel from a source other than the estate passing under the provisions of Hickey\u2019s will. In its \u201cAnswer and Claim\u201d filed in response to the executor\u2019s complaint, however, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company expressly claimed \u201cthat it is entitled to a decree . . . setting forth the person or persons to whom the principal and income of the Trust . . . should be distributed and the respective shares thereof to which such person or persons are entitled.\u201d We conclude that this affirmative plea for advice as to distribution of the trust by the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>company acting in a fiduciary capacity \u201cthereunder\u201d suffices to render the trust estate subject to the statutory allowances authorized by \u00a7 52-251 \u201cto be paid out of such estate.\u201d Because the judgment did not distinguish between the two estates in making its allowances for expenses and counsel fees, a further hearing will be necessary to determine what allowances from each are equitable under the circumstances. Since the allowances must be allocated and on rehearing may be changed in amount we do not now decide on the merits of the appellant\u2019s claim that the court erroneously concluded that as made they were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In summary and specific answer to the questions propounded: (a) The portion of article second of the will providing a formula for computing the amount to be received by DiSesa for services as executor and attorney is void for uncertainty. The amount of his fee should be fixed in a reasonable amount considering the factors mentioned in <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>supra, 384, as well as the circumstance that the trust assets and jointly owned property are not portions of Hickey\u2019s estate passing by his will and subject to administration by the executor. (b) The power of appointment reserved by Hickey in article second of the trust indenture was not exercised in his will, (c) The portion of the estate passing to Carmela Hickey under article fourth, subdivision (a) of the will is to be computed and paid over before setting aside the legacies provided for in the subsequent paragraphs of the will, (d) As answered in (b) supra, (e) In accordance with the provisions of article second of the trust indenture and because Hickey did not exercise his reserved power of appointment, the trustee should assign and pay over the trust estate to Carmela <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Hickey, as she is the person to whom Hickey\u2019s entire personal estate would have been distributed under the Connecticut statutes in force at the time of his death if he had died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">There is error in the court\u2019s answers to the questions propounded and in the allowance for expenses and counsel fees. The judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings and thereafter for judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> \u201cSecond: Upon the death of the grantor and upon condition that the trust shall not have been theretofore terminated in the manner provided in Clause Third hereof, the trustee shall transfer, assign and pay over the principal of the trust estate to such person or persons as the grantor may by his last will and testament appoint or in default of such appointment to those persons to whom and in the proportions in which the personal estate of the grantor would be distributed, if he should die intestate, under the law and statutes of the State of Connecticut in force at the death of the grantor, governing the distribution of intestate personal estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"> \u201c(a) Whether, any portion of the value of the trust assets, or any portion of the value of the jointly owned property, included in the total inventory filed and accepted by said Probate Court, should be excluded in making the computations necessary to determine the amount to be received by Frank J.
