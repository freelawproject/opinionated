First is whether there is a delivery under the Michigan Controlled Substances Act (1971 PA 196, MCL 335.341; MSA 18.1070[41] when a physician gives a prescription or dispenses a box of pills. Second is whether a licensed physician can be prosecuted under MCL 335.341(1)(b); MSA 18.1070(41)(1)(b), for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. The third is whether as a matter of law the defense of entrapment was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The appellant, Dr. Alford, was charged with two counts of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. The first count was for giving prescriptions for 120 capsules containing amphetamines to an undercover police officer in the names of persons never examined by the doctor. The second count was for actually giving 103 capsules containing barbiturates to the same undercover police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The trial court granted a pretrial motion to quash the information finding (1) physicians dispensing and/or prescribing controlled substances are not subject to prosecution under MCL 335.341(l)(b); MSA 18.1070(41)(1)(b) and (2) the appellant was entrapped as a matter of law. The Court of Appeals reversed on both grounds, <em>People v Alford, </em>73 Mich App 604; 251 NW2d 314 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">In <em>People v Kerwin, </em>56 Mich App 483; 224 NW2d 113 (1974), a panel of the Court of Appeals held physicians were not subject to prosecution under MCL 335.341(1)(b); MSA 18.1070(41)(1)(b). The opposite conclusion was reached by the Court in <em>Alford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>We granted leave to appeal August 31, 1977, 401 Mich 804 (1977), to resolve a conflict in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We agree with the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Alford. </em>Physicians not acting in good faith \"in the course of professional practice or research\u201d are prosecutable under MCL 335.341(1); MSA 18.1070(41)(1). We also agree with their determination that the defense of entrapment was not established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We affirm the Court of Appeals in <em>Alford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">On March 12, 1973, Justin Kukalis, an officer of the Department of State Police, Intelligence Division, Diversion Investigation Unit, visited Dr. Alford at his office. Kukalis posed as a patient and gave the name James Kase. He complained of being overweight. The doctor weighed him and took his blood pressure by placing the blood pressure cuff over his jacket on his arm. The doctor gave him medication<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (92 small white and 30 small flat pink double-scored tablets) and a prescription for 30 amphetamine capsules. He did not tell him what the medication was, but gave him directions on dosage, one tablet a day. The doctor told him to return in two weeks. Officer Kukalis paid for the visit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">As noted by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">\"Kukalis returned on approximately eight or nine occasions thereafter, and on these occasions he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>given a further medical examination, although on some of the return visits he was weighed and on others he was asked about his weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\"On these occasions when Kukalis returned to Dr. Alford\u2019s office, Dr. Alford usually handed Kukalis drugs containing amphetamines. On some occasions he handed Kukalis drugs containing barbiturates, and on some of these occasions he wrote prescriptions for Kukalis for amphetamine drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">On June 1, 1973, Kukalis went to the doctor\u2019s office. The doctor informed Kukalis he had no amphetamines available and that he did not like writing prescriptions so often. The doctor then wrote a prescription for Kukalis for 30 amphetamine capsules. The doctor asked who else needed a prescription. Kukalis supplied the names and addresses of fictitious people, Neil Harris and Karen Kase. The doctor wrote prescriptions for them. Kukalis then supplied the name Donald Hollis and the doctor supplied an address as he wrote the prescription. Kukalis also requested and received a small white box of red capsules, 59, and some blue and clear capsules, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The four prescriptions received by Kukalis from Dr. Alford on June 1, 1973 were filled by a drug inspector in the Department of Licensing and Regulation assigned to the Diversion Investigation Unit. The drug inspector was a pharmacist. The contents of each prescription were analyzed by the Michigan State Police Scientific Laboratory. Each prescription was for amphetamine sulphate, 30 capsules, a schedule 2 controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The medication directly received by Kukalis on June 1, 1973 was also analyzed by the Michigan State Police Scientific Laboratory. The 59 orange capsules contained secobarbital, a schedule 3 controlled substance. The 44 blue and clear capsules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>contained amobarbital, also a schedule 3 controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Based on the drugs received on June 1, 1973, a two-count information was filed against Dr. Alford charging that he (1) \"did unlawfully deliver a controlled substance, to-wit: 120 capsules containing amphetamine, contrary to the provisions of MCL 335.341(l)(b);\u201d and (2) \"did unlawfully deliver a controlled substance, to-wit: 103 capsules containing barbituates <em>[sic], </em>contrary to the provisions of MCL 335.341(1)(b)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">After the preliminary examination the defendant was bound over for trial on both counts. The defendant filed a motion to quash the information which was granted by the trial court. The judge held that writing prescriptions was not a delivery or constructive delivery within the meaning of MCL 335.341(l)(b); MSA 18.1070(41)(1)(b). The judge also held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\"that this statute either frees licensed physicians, without qualification, to hand out barbiturate drugs, or it permits them to hand out such drugs to people who come, to their offices for professional consultation regardless of whether the physicians\u2019 conduct falls short of the standards of skill, care and ethics customarily employed by their co-professionals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In conclusion the judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\"as a matter of law, that the defendant was entrapped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court holding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">\"that a practitioner is not exempt from prosecution under MCL 335.341(1); MSA 18.1070(41)(1), merely because of his registered status. The practitioner\u2019s activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ties are only protected to the extent they are performed within the course of professional practice.\u201d 73 Mich App 604, 614.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The Court also found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">\"[t]he facts in the case at bar do not indicate the government conduct was of such a nature as to give rise to a finding of entrapment.\u201d 73 Mich App 604, 615.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">II. Applicable Portions of the Controlled Substances Act of 1971</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">MCL 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41) establishes the basic penalties for violation of the Controlled Substances Act of 1971 and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">\"(1) Except as authorized by this act, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance. Any person who violates this subsection with respect to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\"(b) Any other controlled substance classified in schedules 1, 2 or 3, except marihuana, is guilty of a felony and upon conviction may be imprisoned for not more than 7 years or fined not more than $5,000.00, or both.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Specific definitions are provided for the terms used in this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\" 'Person\u2019 means an individual, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership or association, or any other legal entity.\u201d MCL 335.307(1); MSA 18.1070(7)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\" 'Deliver\u2019 or 'delivery\u2019 means the actual, constructive or attempted transfer from 1 person to another of a controlled substance, whether or not there is an agency relationship.\u201d MCL 335.304(1); MSA 18.1070(4)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">These provisions must be considered in light of other sections relating to physicians:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\" 'Practitioner\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">\"(a) A physician, dentist, veterinarian or pharmacist as defined in subdivisions (o), (p), (q) and (w) of section 1 of Act No. 151 of the Public Acts of 1962, as amended, being section 338.1101 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, scientific investigator as defined by rule of the administrator, or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted to distribute, dispense, conduct research with respect to or to administer a controlled substance <em>in the course of professional practice </em>or research in this state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) MCL 335.307(3); MSA 18.1070(7)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">\" 'Dispense\u2019 means to deliver or issue a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject by or pursuant to the lawful order of a practitioner, including the prescribing, administering or compounding necessary to prepare the substance for that delivery or issuance.\u201d MCL 335.304(2); MSA 18.1070(4X2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">\"(1) Every person who manufactures, distributes, prescribes or dispenses any controlled substance within this state or who proposes to engage in the manufacture, distribution, prescribing or dispensing of any controlled substance within this state, shall obtain annually a registration issued by the administrator in accordance with its rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">\"(2) Persons registered by the administrator under this act to manufacture, distribute, prescribe, dispense or conduct research with controlled substances may possess, manufacture, distribute, prescribe, dispense or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>conduct research with those substances to the extent authorized by their registration and in conformity with the other provisions of this chapter.\u201d MCL 335.332; MSA 18.1070(32).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">These sections provide the focal point of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">III. \"Delivery\u201d Under the Act</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Counts 1 and 2 charged defendant \"did unlawfully deliver a controlled substance\u201d. For Count 1, the proofs were that defendant wrote prescriptions for Officer Kukalis and for three fictitious people, with the defendant supplying a fictitious address for the last one. For Count 2, the proofs were that defendant handed or dispensed to Officer Kukalis a box of pills. <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Therefore two questions relating to delivery exist: A. Is prescribing delivery? B. Is handing/dispensing delivery?</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">\n<em>A. Prescribing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">MCL 335.304(1); MSA 18.1070(4X1), as noted above, reads in part: \" 'Deliver\u2019 * * * means the actual, constructive or attempted transfer * * * of a controlled substance\u201d. MCL 335.304(2); MSA 18.1070(4)(2), as noted above, reads in part: \" 'Dispense\u2019 means to deliver * * * by or pursuant to the lawful order of a practitioner, including the prescribing * * As a consequence, prescribing is included in the definition of deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">\n<em>B. Handing/Dispensing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">The two statutory definitions examined in <em>A. Prescribing </em>also demonstrate that handing or dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>pensing pills is included within the definition of \"deliver\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">IV. Application to Physicians</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The statute prohibits \"any person\u201d from delivering a controlled substance. This blanket prohibition by itself would prevent physicians from dispensing any medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The statutory restriction on the delivery of controlled substances is clear. The term \"person\u201d as defined by the statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not exclude physicians or any other group. We find this categorical approach consistent with the legislative desire to establish the most comprehensive system of controls to regulate the use and abuse of controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Physicians, however, do possess a limited exemption from prosecution in MCL 335.332(2); MSA 18.1070(32)(2) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\"Persons registered by the administrator under this act to manufacture, distribute, prescribe, dispense or conduct research with controlled substances may possess, manufacture, distribute, prescribe, dispense or conduct research with those substances to the extent authorized by their registration and in conformity with the other provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">To maintain their exemption they must be in compliance with their registration under the act and conform to the other provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">But MCL 335.307(3)(a); MSA 18.1070(7)(3)(a) provides a limitation on their license to dispense controlled substances. This section defines a \"practitioner\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\"A physician, * * * or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted to distribute, dispense, conduct research with respect to or to administer a controlled substance <em>in the course of professional practice </em>or research in this state.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Therefore physicians must act \"in the course of professional practice or research\u201d to retain their limited exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We find support for our interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act of 1971 in <em>United States v Moore, </em>423 US 122; 96 S Ct 335; 46 L Ed 2d 333 (1975). In <em>Moore </em>a licensed physician registered under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801 <em>et seq., </em>was convicted of a violation of 21 USC 841(a)(1) which made it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\"unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014 * * * to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance;\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Our act substantially parallels the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 801 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The United States Supreme Court extensively analyzed the Federal Controlled Substances Act and its legislative history and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">\"that registered physicians can be prosecuted under \u00a7 841 when their activities fall , outside the usual course of professional practice.\u201d 423 US 122, 124.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">An interesting question raised by defendant is whether he can be prosecuted under MCL 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41) in light of MCL 335.342; MSA 18.1070(42) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\"(1) It is unlawful for any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\"(a) Who is subject to chapter 3, to distribute, prescribe or dispense a controlled substance in violation of section 38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">\"(b) Who is a registrant, to manufacture a controlled substance not authorized by his registration, or to distribute, prescribe or dispense a controlled substance not authorized by his registration to another registrant or other authorized person, except as authorized by rules promulgated by the administrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">\"(2) Any person who violates this section may be punished by a civil fine of not more than $25,000.00 in a proceeding in the circuit court. However, if the violation is prosecuted by a criminal indictment which alleges that the violation was committed knowingly or intentionally, and the trier of the fact specifically finds that the violation was committed knowingly or intentionally, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction may be imprisoned for not more than 2 years or fined not more than $25,000.00, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Defendant contends that MCL 335.342; MSA 18.1070(42) establishes a separate and distinct penal system for persons registered under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">This very point was considered in <em>Moore </em>because 21 USC 842 is comparable to MCL 335.342; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>18.1070(42). <em>Moore </em>was decided adversely to defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\"Respondent nonetheless contends that \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 822(b) must be interpreted in light of a congressional intent to set up two separate and distinct penalty systems: Persons not registered under the Act are to be punished under \u00a7 841, while those who are registered are to be subject only to the sanctions of \u00a7\u00a7 842 and 843. The latter two sections, the argument goes, establish modest penalties which are the sole sanctions in a system of strict administrative regulation of registrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\"The operative language of those sections provides no real support for the proposition that Congress intended to establish two mutually exclusive systems. It is true that the term 'registrants\u2019 is used in \u00a7\u00a7842 and 843, and not in \u00a7 841. But this is of limited significance. All three sections provide that '[i]t shall be unlawful for any person * * * [to commit the proscribed acts].\u2019 Two of the eight subsections of \u00a7 842(a), one of the five subsections of \u00a7 843(a) and \u00a7 842(b) further qualify 'any person\u2019 with 'who is a registrant.\u2019 The other subsections of \u00a7\u00a7 842 and 843 are not so limited. In context, 'registrant\u2019 is merely a limiting term, indicating that the only 'persons\u2019 who are subject to these subsections are 'registrants.\u2019 There is no indication that 'persons\u2019 means 'nonregistrants\u2019 when introducing the other subsections.\u201d 423 US 122, 133-134.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Moore </em>has been used by two jurisdictions to support a finding that physicians are subject to prosecution for violations similar to those in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In <em>State v Vaccaro, </em>142 NJ Super 167, 173; 361 A2d 47 (1976), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\"A physician who is honest and ethical, and dispenses the prohibited drugs in a good faith effort to treat and cure patients, has no fear of the criminal sanctions of the statute. However, his mere status as a licensed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>physician who has been properly registered as a dispenser of the prohibited drugs does not give him the blanket right to abuse his authority and profession by dispensing drugs without relation to his sworn professional obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In <em>State v Fearing, </em>30 Md App 134; 351 A2d 896 (1976), the Court reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We hold that physicians can dispense controlled substances only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\"to the extent authorized by their registration and in conformity with the other provisions of this chapter.\u201d MCL 335.332(2); MSA 18.1070(32)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">A physician dispensing controlled substances not in the course of professional practice or research can be prosecuted for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. Whether a physician or any other person listed in MCL 335.307(3)(a); MSA 18.1070(7)(3)(a) is acting in good faith in the course of professional practice or research is a question of fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">V. Entrapment</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">This Court in <em>People v Turner, </em>390 Mich 7; 210 NW2d 336 (1973), adopted the objective test for entrapment articulated by Justice Stewart\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>United States v Russell, </em>411 US 423; 93 S Ct 1637; 36 L Ed 2d 366 (1973). This test focuses on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\"whether the actions of the police were so reprehensible under the circumstances, that the Court should refuse, as a matter of public policy, to permit a conviction to stand.\u201d 390 Mich 7, 22.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The adoption of the objective standard does not automatically preclude the use of undercover agents, but only conduct so reprehensible that it cannot be condoned by the judicial system. After discussing the objective standard of entrapment, Justice Stewart noted in his dissent in <em>Russell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\"This does not mean, of course, that the Government\u2019s use of undercover activity, strategy, or deception is necessarily unlawful. <em>Lewis v United States, </em>385 US 206, 208-209 [87 S Ct 424; 17 L Ed 2d 312] (1966). Indeed, many crimes, especially so-called victimless crimes, could not otherwise be detected. Thus, government agents may engage in conduct that is likely, when objectively considered, to afford a person ready and willing to commit the crime an opportunity to do so. <em>Osborn v United States, 385 </em>US 323, 331-332 [87 S Ct 429; 17 L Ed 2d 394] (1966). See also <em>Sherman v United States </em>[356 US 369, 383-384; 78 S Ct 819; 2 L Ed 2d 848 (1958)]. (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\u201d 411 US 423, 445.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In <em>People v D\u2019Angelo, </em>401 Mich 167; 257 NW2d 655 (1977), we made it clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\"[t]he policy considerations which moved us to adopt the objective test of entrapment compel with equal force the conclusion that the judge and not the jury must determine its existence. The thesis is that law enforcement conduct which essentially manufactures crime is a corruptive use of governmental authority which, when used to obtain a conviction, taints the judiciary which tolerates its use. It is a practice which relies for its success upon judicial indifference, if not approval, and it must be deterred. Its deterrence is a duty which transcends the determination of guilt or innocence in a given case and stands ultimately as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>responsibility of an incorruptible judiciary.\u201d 401 Mich 167, 173-174.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In <em>D\u2019Angelo </em>we also defined the burden of proof required and the standard to be used on review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\"We hold therefore that the defendant shall have the burden of proving the claim of entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\"The trial court\u2019s finding will be subject to appellate review under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d 401 Mich 167, 183.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Defendant in this case failed to make a case of entrapment. Officer Kukalis did not attempt to create any special friendship with the doctor to facilitate a delivery of drugs. He did not cajole or induce the doctor to give him drugs. Officer Kukalis merely presented himself at the doctor\u2019s office and asked for drugs, which he received.

A physician registers as a physician and is implicitly authorized to dispense or prescribe drugs in the exercise of his profession for medical purposes. A physician\u2019s registration does not, however, authorize distribution of controlled substances for no medical purpose whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">It does not follow that because a physician may not traffic in drugs he can be prosecuted for simple departures from generally accepted standards of professional practice and ethics. Doctors not infrequently prescribe for patients who are not in their office, whom they have not examined, and over the telephone. Carelessness, bad judgment or malpractice is one thing; intent to traffic in drugs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>distributing in bad faith for a non-medical purpose is quite another.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In <em>People v Downes, </em>394 Mich 17, 33; 228 NW2d 212 (1975), a case decided under the prior controlled substances act, this Court declared that \"[t]he instructional focus under such law must always be upon defendant\u2019s state of mind\u201d. A physician may prescribe drugs carelessly, hastily or over-zealously, but he does so as a physician, albeit a poor one, as long as he acts in a good-faith belief that he is doing so for a medical or professionally recognized purpose. It is only when this subjective good-faith intent is lacking that he exceeds the privilege of his registration, acts outside the scope of his profession, and criminal intent may be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The Court has adopted an objective test of entrapment, focusing on the propriety of the police conduct rather than the defendant\u2019s predisposition to engage in the proscribed activity. <em>People v Turner, </em>390 Mich 7; 210 NW2d 336 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Whether a defendant was entrapped is a question for the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\"In deciding the entrapment question the trial court should make specific findings of fact.

Alford did ask if he was selling the drugs; the officer denied that he was. The officer did tell Alford that his wife was overweight and therefore needed similar prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The officer made eight or nine visits to Alford for the sole purpose of encouraging him to commit a crime.

MCL 335.341(l)(b); MSA 18.1070(41)(l)(b). The first count defines the unlawful delivery as the writing of a prescription for 120 capsules containing amphetamines. The second count defines unlawful delivery as the actual dispensing by the doctor of 103 capsules containing barbiturates.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Inherent in the very wording of the information are the presumptions that prescribing and dispensing can be equated with \"delivery\u201d under the Michigan Controlled Substances Act (1971 PA 196, MCL 335.341; MSA 18.1070[41]), and that a registered physician can be prosecuted for unlawful delivery under the act. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">In order to put the facts of the instant case in perspective, it is essential to set out the various relevant sections of the Controlled Substances Act of 1971. The basic penalty provisions of the act are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>found in \u00a7\u00a7 41, MCL 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41) and 42, MCL 335,342; MSA 18.1070(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Section 41 provides in pertinent part:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\"(1) Except as authorized by this act, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance. Any person who violates this subsection with respect to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\"(b) Any other controlled substance classified in schedules 1, 2, or 3, except marihuana, is guilty of a felony and upon conviction may be imprisoned for not more than 7 years or fined not more than $5,000, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">On the other hand, \u00a7 42 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">\"(1) It is unlawful for any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">\"(a) Who is subject to chapter 3, [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] to distribute, prescribe or dispense a controlled substance in violation of section 38.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\"(2) Any person who violates this section may be punished by a civil fine of not more than $25,000.00 in a proceeding in the circuit court. However, if the violation is prosecuted by a criminal indictment which alleges that the violation was committed knowingly or intentionally, and the trier of the fact specifically finds that the violation was committed knowingly or intentionally, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction may be imprisoned for not more than 2 years or fined not more than $25,000.00, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Further, the act provides specific definitions of terms which must be viewed in conjunction with the penalty provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">1. \" 'Deliver\u2019 or 'delivery\u2019 means the actual, constructive or attempted transfer from 1 person to another of a controlled substance, whether or not there is an agency relationship.\u201d MCL 335.304(1); MSA 18.1070(4)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">2. \" 'Dispense\u2019 means to deliver or issue a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject by or pursuant to the lawful order of a practitioner, including the prescribing, administering or compounding necessary to prepare the substance for that delivery or issuance.\u201d MCL 335.304(2); MSA 18.1070(4)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">3. \" 'Person\u2019 means an individual, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership or association, or any other legal entity.\u201d MCL 335.307(1); MSA 18.1070(7X1).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">4. \" 'Practitioner\u2019 means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\"(a) A physician, dentist, veterinarian or pharmacist as defined in subdivisions (o), (p), (q) and (w) of section 1 of Act No. 151 of the Public Acts of 1962, as amended, being section 338.1101 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, scientific investigator as defined by rule of the administrator, or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted to distribute, dispense, conduct research with respect to or to administer a controlled substance in the course of professional practice or research in this state.\u201d MCL 335.307(3); MSA 18.1070(7)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>These provisions taken together provide the backdrop for our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Our outline of the pertinent sections of the Michigan Controlled Substances Act and even a cursory reading of the remaining provisions of the act makes one thing perfectly clear: there is little clarity in this circuitously woven piece of legislation. In this morass, however, we do find certain things that do stand out.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In the instant case defendant physician was charged with unlawful \"delivery\u201d of a a controlled substance by \"prescribing\u201d certain amphetamines and by \"dispensing\u201d certain barbiturates. Unlike the Federal statute, the Michigan definitional section encompassing delivery does not include the word \"dispensing\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the Michigan legislation was clearly modeled after the Federal legislation, it is very significant that the Michigan Legislature chose not to include the word dispensing or its corollary, prescribing, in the definition of delivery. It indicates an intent upon the part of the Legislature not to equate the term delivery with the terms dispensing or prescribing.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">This position is further bolstered by the fact that the Legislature set forth one statutory provision regulating the delivery of drugs and another statutory provision regulating the dispensing and prescribing of drugs. Section 41 governs prohibitions for unlawful delivery under the act, while \u00a7 42 contains restrictions on dispensing and prescribing.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Since the Legislature delineated separate sections and differing rules for delivery and dispens<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>ing, it is evident that the Legislature did not equate the two. Had the Legislature intended to subject doctors to liability under both \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42, they could have said so plainly. Their failure to so indicate leads us to conclude that the Legislature did not intend a dual liability for doctors under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Our interpretation of the Legislature\u2019s intent may be underlined by recent legislative amendments to the Michigan Controlled Substances Act. In 1978 PA 147 the Legislature amended Section 41 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\"(1) Except as authorized by this act, a person shall not manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance. A practitioner registered by the administrator under this act shall not dispense, prescribe, or administer a controlled substance in a manner which is not for legitimate medical or therapeutic purposes and which is not in the course of the practitioner\u2019s professional practice.\u201d MCL 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Since \u00a7 42 remains virtually intact under the new amendments, it is obvious that the Legislature now intends that practitioners, including doctors, can be liable under both sections of the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is noted, it could be said that the \"new\u201d amendments are not so much new as they present a clarification of what the Legislature intended all along.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We think there is a better view. It is our position that the Legislature in its original enactment did not intend to cover doctors under \u00a7 41; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>with its recent enactment the Legislature has changed its view. Support for our position rests in the notion that if the Legislature had intended mere clarification and, therefore, retroactive application, the Legislature would have said so. It did not; thus, the amendment must be viewed as a total change and a complete abrogation of the old view.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Further, we are cognizant of the fact that our conclusion seems to run contrary to that of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v Moore, </em>423 US 122; 96 S Ct 335; 46 L Ed 2d 333 (1975). However, we have already pointed out that there are significant differences between the Michigan Controlled Substances Act and the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which was interpreted in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In addition, we are also aware that at least three other jurisdictions have declined to follow <em>Moore </em>and have found that physicians and other registrants are not subject for violations similar to those presented in the instant case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of particular relevance is the poignant statement of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in <em>Haney v State, </em>544 SW2d 384 (Tex Crim App, 1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\"Obviously 'dispense\u2019 is a special and limited means of delivery provided by statute and would control over the broad general definition of 'delivery,\u2019 which relates to the transfer, actual or constructive, of a controlled substance. 'Dispense\u2019 relates to those instances where dispensing is pursuant to the lawful order of a practitioner. * * * [I]t can readily be seen that 'dispense\u2019 has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>a separate and distinct meaning from, 'delivery\u2019 for purposes of the Act.\u201d <em>Haney, supra, 388, </em>fn 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">\"We are not unaware of the decision of <em>United States v Moore, </em>* * * that registered physicians may be prosecuted for violation of the Federal Controlled Substances Act * * * when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice. However, because of the difference in language of the Federal and State statute, the decision is distinguishable from the instant case.\u201d <em>Haney, supra, </em>388.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><em>Moore </em>is also distinguishable on another important level. In our analysis of the Michigan Controlled Substances Act, we find no standard by which to measure the culpability of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Under the Michigan act, physicians and other registrants clearly possess an exemption from prosecution. This exemption is found in chapter 3, MCL 335.332(2); MSA 18.1070(32)(2), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\"Persons registered by the administrator under this act to manufacture, distribute, prescribe, dispense or conduct research with controlled substances may possess, manufacture, distribute, prescribe, dispense or conduct research with those substances to the extent authorized by their registration and <em>in conformity with the other provisions of this chapter. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">It has been argued that this \u00a7 32 exemption is specifically limited by language in chapter 1, \u00a7 7, which defines a practitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\" 'Practitioner\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\"(a) A physician, dentist, veterinarian or pharmacist as defined in subdivisions (o), (p), (q) and (w) of section 1 of Act No. 151 of the Public Acts of 1962, as amended, being section 338.1101 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, scientific investigator as defined by rule of the administrator, or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted to distribute, dispense, conduct research with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>respect to or to administer a controlled substance <em>in the course of professional practice </em>or research in this state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) MCL 335.307(3); MSA 18.1070(7)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">According to that argument, physicians must act \"in the course of professional practice\u201d to retain their limited exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The limiting argument is patently faulty for three reasons. First, the exemption language found in chapter 3, \u00a7 32 applies as long as the registrants\u2019 actions are \"in conformity with the other provisions of this chapter\u201d. Thus, any limitation on the exemption must be found in chapter 3, not chapter 1 where the definition of practitioner is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">But even if this were not the case, there is a second reason found in the very wording of the definition of practitioner which casts doubt on whether that language was intended to limit the exemption in \u00a7 32. The phrase \"in the course of professional practice\u201d occurs at the very end of the statutory definition of practitioner. It is arguable that that phrase was intended to modify all the particular persons defined as practitioners within the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">There is a better position, however. Since the phrase appears fully 65 words after the word \"physician\u201d, it was not intended to modify physician but only the clause which immediately preceded it, that being \"or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted to distribute, dispense, conduct research * * * or to administer a controlled substance\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Although both interpretations are plausible we are compelled to accept the latter one, <em>Le., </em>the phrase did not intend physician as its antecedent. This is so because of a basic hornbook rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>criminal law that a criminal statute should be strictly construed in favor of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">There is a third reason even more compelling than the first two for rejecting the argument that the phrase \"in the course of professional practice\u201d forms a limitation on the physician registrant\u2019s exemption. The phrase is vague in and of itself, neither connoting an objective standard of culpability nor a subjective standard of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">This Court in <em>People v Downes, </em>394 Mich 17; 228 NW2d 212 (1975), considered a conviction for violation of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, MCL 335.51 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 18.1071 <em>et seq., </em>the predecessor of the Michigan Controlled Substances Act. The facts of <em>Downes </em>were that a doctor was charged with and convicted of prescribing certain narcotic drugs to known addicts. The conviction rested on \u00a7 7 of the act which read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\"(1) A physician or dentist, <em>in good faith and in the course of his professional practice only, </em>may prescribe, administer, and dispense narcotic drugs * * (Emphasis added.) MCL 335.57; MSA 18.1077.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Defendant Downes argued that \"good faith\u201d as limited by the words \"in the course of his professional practice\u201d must present an objective standard of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">This court rejected defendant\u2019s argument. Justice Fitzgerald, writing for a unanimous Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\"The interjection of the modifying terms 'in the course of his professional practice\u2019 into the statutory formulation does not change the obvious and clear import of 'good faith\u2019 in the absence of express manifestation of legislative intention indicating such change. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Moreover, to construe the statute as defendant would have us construe it would be to acknowledge that the statute may measure criminality by lack of conformity to professional standards which are not set forth in coghizable form in the statute itself. The source of such standards is unclear and, indeed, the standard of 'proper\u2019 professional conduct is the subject of considerable dispute within the profession * * *. Such a construction would necessarily require a finding of unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Downes, supra, </em>26-27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Therefore, the phrase \"in the course of professional practice\u201d in the Michigan Controlled Substances Act creates no standard by which to measure a physician\u2019s culpability. It suggests neither an objective standard nor a subjective standard. This nebulous phraseology is therefore fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">While we do not condone what we view as the reprehensible conduct of defendant doctor in the present case, we hold that the terms prescribing and dispensing cannot be equated with the term delivery under the Michigan Controlled Substances Act and that a registered physician cannot be prosecuted for unlawful delivery under the act of 1971. We, therefore, reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court quashing the information.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-10\"> We note at the very outset that \u00a7 41 does not include the word \"dispense\u201d among the unlawful activities proscribed. This may be contrasted with the similar provision under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC 841(a)(1), which makes it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">\"unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">\"* * * to manufacture, distribute, or <em>dispense, </em>or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or <em>dispense </em>a controlled substance\u201d. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">Since the Michigan act is modeled directly on the Federal act, it is of critical significance that the Michigan Legislature chose to delete the word \"dispense\u201d from those act? forbidden by \u00a7 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-15\"><em> </em>Chapter 3, MCL 335.331 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 18.1070(31) <em>et seq., </em>sets out the general provisions regarding registration and who must be registered under the act and control of manufacture, distribution and dispensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-16\"> Section 38, MCL 335.338; MSA 18.1070(38), sets out the general rules for prescription, distribution and dispensation by a practitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\"> See footnote 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> This last statement must be read with some caution. While it is clear that the newly amended \u00a7 41 encompasses both \"delivery\u201d and \"dispensing\u201d under its definitional mantle, it is less than clear whether the subdivisions which outline what is prohibited under \u00a7 41 apply to both unlawful delivery and unlawful dispensing. However, since this question is not before the Court, we take no position on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\"> See <em>State v Best, </em>292 NC 294; 233 SE2d 544 (1977); <em>Haney v State, </em>544 SW2d 384 (Tex Crim App, 1976); <em>McLean v State, </em>527 SW2d 76 (Term, 1975). While the <em>McLean </em>decision involved a pharmacist and preceded <em>Moore </em>by several months, its analysis was similar to that of the <em>Best </em>and <em>Haney </em>courts and <em>to </em>the analysis we employ in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
