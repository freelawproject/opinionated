The sole issue before this Court is whether the Michigan criminal obscenity statute, MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1), which proscribes the knowing dissemination of obscene materials, is constitutionally valid and enforceable on its face as it pertains to consenting adults under the First Amendment of the United States Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Article 1, \u00a7 5, Michigan Constitution of 1963.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Today this Court, authoritatively construes the Michigan criminal obscenity statute as constitutionally proscribing the knowing dissemination of obscene materials to consenting adults. <em>Miller v California, </em>413 US 15; 93 S Ct 2607; 37 L Ed 2d 419 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On October 21, 1975, defendant Neumayer was charged in the 50th District Court with two counts of violating MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1). Specifically, the charges were possession with intent to show and showing two motion pictures (\"All the Way\u201d and \"Final Blow\u201d) at the Campus Theatre in Pontiac, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On January 13, 1976, after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted on the \"showing\u201d count and he was sentenced on February 10, 1976, to two years probation. The \"possession\u201d count was dismissed by the district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Defendant appealed his conviction to the Oakland Circuit Court. The circuit court reversed the conviction, holding that the instant criminal obscenity statute applied only to the dissemination of obscene materials to juveniles and unconsenting adults but not to consenting adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The Michigan Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal, citing as authority <em>People v Bloss, </em>394 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Mich 79; 228 NW2d 384 (1975), and <em>Kent County Prosecutor v Robert Emmett Goodrich Corp, </em>53 Mich App 267, 275; 218 NW2d 771 (1974), <em>aff'd </em>396 Mich 253; 240 NW2d 242 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Upon appeal to this Court, the instant case was held in abeyance pending a decision in <em>People v </em>Llewellyn, 401 Mich 314; 257 NW2d 902 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That decision was not dispositive of the issue presented herein, so we granted leave to appeal. 402 Mich 802 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We reverse the circuit court\u2019s determination as to the criminal obscenity statute, but we affirm the reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction because at the time he committed the conduct charged, this Court had not construed the statute to proscribe such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>II. The Current Status of the Federal Constitutional Law on Obscenity</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In <em>Miller v California,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court simultaneously reaffirmed its previous position that obscenity is not constitutionally protected speech<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and fashioned a new, more restrictive definition of constitutionally protected speech.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v Slaton, </em>413 US 49; 93 S Ct 2628; 37 L Ed 2d 446 (1973), released with <em>Miller, </em>the Court also unequivocally rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the de facto holding of <em>Redrup v New York,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>386 US 767; 87 S Ct 1414; 18 L Ed 2d 515 (1967), that state police powers could not regulate obscene materials if displayed only to consenting adults. The Court announced that \"there are legitimate state interests at stake in stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even assuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards against exposure to juveniles and to passersby.\u201d 413 US 49, 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">After dismantling the <em>Redrup </em>protection accorded to materials restrictively displayed, the Court proceeded in <em>Miller </em>to broaden the scope of the obscenity standard previously enunciated in <em>Memoirs v Massachusetts,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>383 US 413; 86 S Ct 975; 16 L Ed 2d 1 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Under the new <em>Miller </em>formulation, the Court declined to \"propose regulatory schemes for the States\u201d, <em>Miller, supra, </em>25, but instead revised the <em>Memoirs </em>test in order to provide guidelines for the trier of fact to determine what is constitutionally obscene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\"(a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\"(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxMf\">\"(c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d (Citations omitted.) 413 US 15, 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Concomitant with its expansion of the scope of unprotected speech, the Court\u2019s majority emphasized that state statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be \"specifically defined\u201d and \"carefully limited\u201d either as written or <em>as authoritatively construed by the state courts. </em>The Court offered two examples \"of what a state statute could define for regulation under the second part (b) of [the <em>Miller </em>test]\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\"(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\"(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d 413 US 15, 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">See, also, <em>United States v 12 200-ft Reels of Super 8mm Film, </em>413 US 123, 130, fn 7; 92 S Ct 2665; 37 L Ed 2d 500 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The majority was also careful to point out that its entire consideration of the question of obscenity was limited to the minimum protections afforded by the United States Constitution. That is, the Court did not \"undertake to tell the States what they must do, but rather to define the area in which they may chart their own course in dealing with obscene materials\u201d. 413 US 49, 53-54. Therefore, under the guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the states may not use their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>police powers to regulate speech in a more restrictive fashion than allowed by <em>Miller et </em>al.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">III. The Constitutionality of the Michigan Obscenity Statute Under Current Federal and State Law</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Michigan criminal obscenity statute, 1957 PA 265 as amended, MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1), prohibits the knowing dissemination (or possession with intent to disseminate) of obscene materials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">\"Any person who knowingly either sells, lends, gives away, distributes, shows or transmutes or offers either to sell, lend, give away, distribute, show or transmute, or has in his possession with intent either to sell, lend, give away, distribute, show or transmute, or advertise in any manner, or who otherwise knowingly offers for either loan, gift, sale or distribution, any obscene, lewd, lascivious, \u2022 filthy or indecent, sadistic or masochistic book, magazine, pamphlet, newspaper, story paper, writing, paper, phonograph record, picture, drawing, photograph, motion picture film, figure, image, wire or tape recording or any written, printed or recorded matter of an indecent character which may or may not require mechanical or other means to be transmuted into auditory, visual or sensory representations of such character, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 1 year or by a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or by both such fine and imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\"For the purpose of this section, possession of 6 or more identical copies, or 6 or more articles of any obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent book, magazine, pamphlet, newspaper, story paper, writing, paper, phonograph record, picture drawing, photograph, slide, motion picture film, figure, image, wire or tape record<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ing, or any written, printed or recorded matter of an indecent character, shall be prima facie evidence of possession with intent to sell, lend, give away, distribute, show or transmute the thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The standard to be employed by the trier of fact in determining whether certain materials are \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent, sadistic or masochistic\u201d is found in MCL 750.343b; MSA 28.575(2) (1958 PA 127):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\"The test to be applied in cases under section 343a of this act shall not be whether sexual desires or sexually improper thoughts would be aroused in those comprising a particular segment of the community, the young, the immature or the highly prudish, or would leave another segment, the scientific or highly educated or the so-called worldly wise and sophisticated, indifferent and unmoved. But such test shall be the effect of the book, picture or other subject to complaint considered as a whole, not upon any particular class, but upon all those whom it is likely to reach, that is, its impact upon the average person in the community. The book, picture or other subject of complaint must be judged as a whole in its entire context, not by considering detached or separate portions only, and by the standards of common conscience of the community of the contemporary period of the violation charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In <em>People v Bloss, supra, </em>this Court was first presented with an opportunity to examine these two statutes in light of the test set forth in <em>Miller, supra. </em>However, the Court declined the invitation to decide whether the statutes could be validly applied to the dissemination of obscene material to consenting adults:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\"We are persuaded that defendant\u2019s conviction cannot stand for the reason that at the time he did the act complained of this Court had not construed the obscen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ity statute (as permitted in <em>Miller) </em>to proscribe such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\"We are unanimously of the opinion that the Michigan statutes regulating the dissemination of 'obscene\u2019 material as applied to juveniles and unconsenting adults are valid and enforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\"We are divided as to whether such statutes can properly be construed by us without further legislative expression as proscribing the dissemination of 'obscene\u2019 material to consenting adults. See Const 1963, art 1, \u00a75.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The people once again invite us, and indeed argue that we are compelled, to \"authoritatively construe\u201d the foregoing statutes so as to conform to the <em>Miller </em>standards and thus preserve their constitutionality. <em>Miller, supra, </em>24, fn 6. Also see <em>Hamling v United States, </em>418 US 87, 112-116; 94 S Ct 2887; 41 L Ed 2d 590 (1974), and <em>Ward v Illinois, </em>431 US 767; 97 S Ct 2085; 52 L Ed 2d 738 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The defendant maintains that the instant statutes are constitutionally vague and overbroad, and fail to incorporate the minimum constitutional requirements set forth in <em>Miller. </em>Furthermore, the defendant contends that these statutes cannot be authoritatively construed to conform to <em>Miller </em>because the Michigan Constitution of 1963, art 1, \u00a7 5, contains a less restrictive definition of freedom of speech than that found in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\n<em>A. Vagueness and Overbreadth: Miller</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Even a cursory comparison of the Michigan criminal obscenity statutes with the detailed requirements set forth in <em>Miller </em>reveals that the statutes lack the specificity required of a statute which seeks to regulate speech and thus unquestionably fail to pass Federal constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The terms employed in MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1) \u2014 \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent, sadistic or masochistic\u201d \u2014 are neither \"specifically defined\u201d nor \"carefully limited\u201d as constitutionally required of any statute designed to regulate speech or expression. <em>Miller, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Likewise, MCL 750.343b; MSA 28.575(2) does not contain, <em>inter alia, </em>the necessary limitation that the material in question lack \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\u201d in order to be found obscene. <em>Miller, supra. </em>Insofar as this statute defines \"obscenity\u201d, it appears to adopt the since-abandoned test announced in <em>Roth v United States, supra, </em>by asking \"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest\u201d. 354 US 476, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">To define obscenity for constitutional purposes <em>solely </em>in terms of the capacity of the material to excite sexual thoughts or desires is clearly incompatible with <em>Miller v California. </em>Under <em>Miller, </em>statutes designed to suppress obscene material must, as written or construed, be limited not only to works which (a) appeal to prurient interests, but also to those which (b) depict or describe, \"in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law\u201d, and which (c) taken as a whole, lack \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1) and MCL 750.343b; MSA 28.575(2) are not so limited. These statutes are vague and overbroad,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>unconstitutional on their face, as the people concede.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\n<em>B. Michigan Constitution of 1963, Article 1, \u00a7 5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF0\">It is clear, as the defendant contends and the people concede, that the Michigan criminal obscenity statute, as presently written, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under First Amendment and <em>Miller </em>analysis. However, the people urge us to \"construe\u201d this obscenity statute, as <em>Miller </em>expressly permits,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to conform to the <em>Miller </em>stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>dards and thus prospectively preserve its constitutionality.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">It is axiomatic that this Court will presume that all legislation is constitutional and will attempt to construe legislation so as to preserve its constitutionality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\"We are duty bound under the Michigan Constitution to preserve the laws of this state and to that end to construe them if we can so that they conform to Federal and state constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>People v Bricker, </em>389 Mich 524, 528; 208 NW2d 172 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The First Amendment provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\"Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">This First Amendment right to freedom of speech is guaranteed to citizens of the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Book Tower Garage, Inc v Local No 415, International Union, UAWA(CIO), </em>295 Mich 580, 586; 295 NW 320 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">But, as we discussed earlier, the United States Supreme Court has determined that obscenity is <em>not </em>within the scope of speech protected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>First Amendment. <em>Miller, supra, </em>23. Therefore, we hold that the Michigan criminal obscenity statute, under the authoritative construction as to definitional limits<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> given it today, does not conflict with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">However, the freedom of expression guarantee found in the Michigan Constitution is phrased somewhat differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\"Every person may freely speak, write, express and publish his views on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right; and no law shall be enacted to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The defendant, among others,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> urges us to hold that Michigan\u2019s freedom of expression clause has a wider scope than the First Amendment and confers greater protection than its Federal counterpart on the dissemination of obscene materials to consenting adults.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>While we agree that, in certain instances, the Michigan Constitution may confer broader protection upon certain types of expression, we do not agree that the right to freedom of expression in Michigan is unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Furthermore, upon careful examination, we find nothing either in the provision itself or in the history<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the constitutional convention which even remotely leads us to believe the drafters ifitended to afford obscenity unlimited constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On the contrary, the phrase \"being responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>for the abuse of such right\u201d indicates that the drafters foresaw situations in which certain types of speech would not fall within the protection guaranteed by the provision. We believe that obscenity, as presently defined by the United States Supreme Court, represents an \"abuse of such right\u201d and therefore does <em>not </em>fall within the purview of the protection assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Additionally, we must not forget that constitutional provisions must be interpreted within the context of the times. <em>Weems v United States, </em>217 US 349; 30 S Ct 544; 54 L Ed 793 (1910). The drafters of such provisions, even those who drafted such provisions as recently as the early 1960\u2019s, could not anticipate all societal needs. The proliferation of obscene publications and films together with the commercial establishments which deal in such items have become commonplace in many areas and, as such, constitute a blight on our commercial and residential neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The Legislature has determined that the dissemination of obscene materials within this state is injurious to society. Therefore, the Legislature has decided, as a matter of public policy, to proscribe the dissemination of obscene materials. \"The public policy of this state is a mandate upon us.\u201d <em>Bricker, supra, </em>529.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">We do not agree that the intervening<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 1963 Michigan Constitution, art 1, \u00a7 5, provides greater protection for the knowing dissemination of obscene materials to consenting adults than that afforded by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Nor do we find any indication of legislative intent that the instant statute be applied only to the dissemination of obscene mat\u00e9<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>rials to juveniles and unconsenting adults, but not to consenting adults. See Bloss, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Despite prior suggestions from this Court<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that the Legislature revise the present criminal obscenity statute in light of <em>Miller v California, supra, </em>to provide a specific definition of obscenity and specific standards for the trier of fact in determining what is constitutionally obscene, the Legislature has not seen fit to act in this regard.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">However, in view of previously expressed legislative public policy, we refuse to leave Michigan without a valid criminal obscenity statute. Therefore, with some reluctance,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we announce today <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>that prospective from the date of this opinion the courts of this state shall construe MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1), so that it conforms to the minimum standards set forth in <em>Miller v California, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Specifically, we hold that the standards to be employed by the trier of fact in determining what is constitutionally obscene are those formulated in <em>Miller:</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\"(a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\"(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKZ\">\"(c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d (Citations omitted.) 413 US 15, 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Furthermore, in defining the terms \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent, sadistic or masochistic\u201d, MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1), we incorporate the <em>Miller </em>definitions into the existing statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\"(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\"(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d 413 US 15, 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In conclusion, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s determination that the instant criminal obscenity statute has no applicability to the dissemination of obscene materials to consenting adults. As for defendant Neumayer, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s reversal of his conviction because at the time he committed the conduct charged, this Court had not construed the statute <em>per Miller </em>to proscribe such conduct.</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-7\">Coleman, C.J., and Williams, Fitzgerald, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Blair Moody, Jr., J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\"> \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-12\"> \"Every person may freely speak, write, express and publish his views on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of such right; and no law shall be enacted to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> <em>Llewellyn </em>was an appeal of convictions for exhibition of two allegedly obscene films under an East Detroit anti-obscenity ordinance. Defendants argued that their convictions must be reversed because the anti-obscenity ordinance in question was pre-empted by the existing state statutory scheme governing criminal obscenity offenses, and was thus unconstitutional under Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Given the comprehensive coverage of the field under the state statutory scheme, MCL 750.343a <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 28.575(1) <em>et seq., </em>and the need for a uniform, statewide definition of criminal obscenity offenses for purposes of protecting free speech and effectively deterring obscenity, this Court held that East Detroit\u2019s anti-obscenity ordinance was pre-empted by the existing state statutory scheme and was thus unconstitutional under Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">\u25a0The Court opined that statewide definition of obscenity allowed for both vigorous, effective local prosecution under state law and the protection of legitimate freedom of expression. Moreover, localities could supplement the protection afforded them under the state obscenity statutory scheme with municipal zoning, such as that recently promulgated in Detroit, designed to regulate the location of establishments featuring so-called \"adult entertainment\u201d. Such municipal zoning ordinances were declared outside the field of prohibition occupied by the state statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">The Court, however, was not presented with and therefore did not reach the question of whether the state criminal obscenity statute <em>itself </em>was constitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> The United States Supreme Court released seven other opinions along with <em>Miller. </em>While <em>Miller </em>was the principal opinion, the other opinions dealt in detail with related obscenity issues.

Logically extending from this premise, the Court articulated as the appropriate test for obscenity whether the \"dominant theme\u201d of the material challenged \"taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest\u201d of \"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u201d. <em>Roth, supra, </em>489.

In so doing, the Court, again under the leadership of Justice Brennan specified that the proper test of obscenity required that the materials challenged must meet each of three Federal constitutional criteria independently: the material must appeal to prurient interests; it must be patently offensive; and it must be \"utterly without redeeming social value\u201d. This so-called <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>test remained as the controlling doctrine until 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\"> The plurality opinion in <em>Memoirs </em>represented only one of seven approaches taken in that case. The position this opinion occupied in the spectrum of viewpoints allowed it, in effect, to be decisive. But because of the multiplicity of viewpoints, many subsequent cases were decided according to an approach developed in <em>Redrup v New York. </em>In <em>Redrup, </em>the Court reversed several state convictions, explaining in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion that the publications in question were constitutionally protected no matter which of the prevailing views was applied. Thereafter, the Court disposed of 31 obscenity cases in this manner, often giving no explanation other than a citation to <em>Redrup.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\"> The <em>Memoirs </em>standard was a plurality, not a majority, position.

A criminal statute will be found vague and thus void on its face if it fails to provide fair notice of what the state commands or forbids or if it invites arbitrary and erratic enforcement. This is quite apart from whether or not it interferes with liberty of speech or expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">A law suppressing speech is subject, however, to especially strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>standards of specificity. Freedom of expression is vulnerable to greatly damaging but barely visible encroachments. Vague prohibitions engender the possibility that people will restrict their conduct only to that which is unquestionably safe. Free speech may not be so chilled. Thus even greater clarity and precision than in other contexts is required of statutes regulating expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In this respect, the problem of vagueness in the area of protected expression is closely related to that of overbreadth. A law may be unconstitutionally overbroad, even though perfectly definite, if its terms deter the exercise of rights protected by the First Amendment. Such a law is also void on its face; even a litigant whose conduct falls outside the First Amendment may assert that the statute applied against him is unconstitutionally overbroad.

See <em>Commonwealth v Horton, </em>[365 Mass 164] 310 NE2d 316, 319-322 (1974); <em>Art Theater Guild, Inc v State, </em>510 SW2d 258, 260-261 (Tenn, 1974); <em>Mohney v State, </em>[261 Ind 56] 300 NE2d 66, 67 (1973); <em>State v Wedelstedt, </em>213 NW2d 652, 656-657 (Iowa, 1973); <em>State v Shreveport News Agency, Inc, </em>287 So 2d 464, 468-470 (La, 1973). In Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Tennessee, state legislatures enacted replacement obscenity statutes satisfying the <em>Miller </em>specificity requirement. See La Rev Stat Ann \u00a7 14:106 (West 1974); Mass Gen Laws Ann, ch 272, \u00a7 31 (1975); Tenn Code Ann \u00a7 39-3010 (Supp 1974). The Iowa legislature elected to do without a statute criminally punishing distribution of obscenity to consenting adults, but instead passed a law prohibiting dissemination of obscenity to minors. See ch 1267, [1974] Iowa Acts 977. In Indiana, local ordinances have filled the gap left by invalidation of the state statute. See Note, <em>Defects in Indiana\u2019s Pornographic Nuisance Act, </em>49 Ind L J 320, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>331 (1974). Other state courts, however, dealing with essentially similar statutes, have held that the requisite specificity may be achieved through judicial construction. Many of the courts engaging in statutory construction simply read into state obscenity laws <em>Miller\u2019s </em>examples of specific definitions, see 413 US at 25.

As a result, for over three years Michigan has had no effective obscenity statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>applicable to consenting adults. Nevertheless, and despite this Court\u2019s notice, the Legislature has chosen to abide this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The legislative inaction over such a sustained period weighs heavily on any interpretation of legislative intent. See <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co (On Rehearing), </em>380 Mich 513, 520; 158 NW2d 473 (1968). This long period of legislative inaction contrasts not only with the situation in other jurisdictions in which courts have chosen to \"authoritatively construe\u201d their obscenity statutes, the majority of such decisions following closely on the heels of the <em>Miller </em>decision and before the Legislature had any substantial period in which to act, but, also, with the Legislature\u2019s own usual promptness in responding to court decisions affecting the constitutionality of its obscenity statutes. Indeed, MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1) was enacted within less than a year of the invalidation of the state\u2019s previous obscenity statute in <em>Butler v Michigan, </em>352 US 380; 77 S Ct 524; 1 L Ed 2d 412 (1957). Similarly, the amendments to the criminal obscenity statute contained in 1964 PA 143, \u00a7 1, effective August 28, were a direct response to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Villano, </em>369 Mich 428; 120 NW2d 204 (1963), and were enacted shortly after the decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The Legislature has enacted a new statute aimed at preventing dissemination of obscene materials to minors, 1978 PA 33. That statute contains precise definitions of the types of sexual conduct the depiction or description of which may be deemed obscene. Its passage demonstrates that the Legislature is not at a loss for innovative responses to the problems posed by the decision in <em>Miller. </em>The new statute, however, so clearly designed to avoid any constitutional problems exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ing under former MCL 750.343e; MSA 25.575(5), applies <em>only </em>to minors. The legislative inaction with respect to the regulation of sexually oriented materials disseminated to consenting adults assumes a telling significance in light of the specificity which the Legislature has demonstrated in its effort to devise a constitutional regulation of obscenity with respect to minors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Whatever the legislative policy may once have been, the Legislature\u2019s intent as presently manifested is sufficiently ambiguous to warn this Court against trying to rescue the statute by reluctantly adopting an interpretation allegedly mandated by a clear legislative purpose. The Court\u2019s decision supplies a legislative intent which the Legislature itself was unwilling to express despite this Court\u2019s advice and our previous refusal to construe the statute with respect to consenting adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Running through the majority\u2019s attempt to salvage this obscenity statute is the concept that this Court has a duty to \"construe\u201d it, to whatever extent necessary, so that it conforms to minimal constitutional requirements. The majority\u2019s reasoning derives from this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v Bricker, </em>389 Mich 524; 208 NW2d 172 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\"><em>Bricker </em>involved the issue of the constitutionality of Michigan\u2019s abortion statute, which was enacted to \"prohibit all abortions except those required to preserve the health of the mother\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 529. The constitutionality of the statute was questioned as a result of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973), where it was held that first trimester abortions authorized by the attending physician could not constitutionally be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The only question involved in <em>Bricker </em>was whether the statute should be interpreted to include <em>Roe\u2019s </em>first trimester exception. The Court held that when faced with two competing interpretations, one constitutional and the other unconstitutional, it was under a duty to preserve the constitutionality of the statute by choosing the constitutional interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We are convinced that <em>Bricker </em>is inapplicable. It is one thing to judicially construe legislation that legitimately and by fair inference admits of but two constructions, one constitutional and the other not. We will rightly opt for the former. But that is not what we are asked to do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>has determined that statutes regulating sexually oriented material must specifically define the sexual conduct depicted or described in \"obscene\u201d materials. The Michigan obscenity statute does not enumerate specific kinds of sexual conduct, but proscribes obscene depiction or description of <em>all </em>sexual conduct. In an effort to save the statute, the majority chooses which depictions or descriptions of various types of sexual conduct are to be read into the statute and does so without legislative guidance. The danger of such an exercise of judicial power is suggested in <em>United States v Reese, </em>92 US 214, 221; 23 L Ed 563 (1876):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\"We are, therefore, directly called upon to decide whether a penal statute enacted by Congress, with its limited powers, which is in general language broad enough to cover wrongful acts without as well as within the constitutional jurisdiction, can be limited by judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>construction so as to make it operate only on that which Congress may rightfully prohibit and punish. * * * The question, then, to be determined, is, whether we can <em>introduce </em>words of limitation into a penal statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it is general only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\"><em>\"It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large. This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government. </em>* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\"To limit this statute in the manner now asked for would be to make a new law, not to enforce the old one. <em>This is no part of our duty. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">See, also, <em>Marchetti v United States, </em>390 US 39, 58-61; 88 S Ct 697; 19 L Ed 2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The majority, on the authority of <em>Miller, Hamling v United States, </em>418 US 87; 94 S Ct 2887; 41 L Ed 2d 590 (1974); <em>Ward v Illinois, </em>431 US 767; 97 S Ct 2085; 52 L Ed 2d 738 (1977), and various state court decisions, adopts what <em>Miller </em>suggests were only \"a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation\u201d, <em>Miller, supra, </em>p 25, as part of its definition of obscenity under the statute. Being examples, the <em>Miller </em>definitions are not constitutionally mandated nor intended to be binding upon the states\u2019 interpretation of their statutes. \"We emphasize that it is not our function to propose regulatory schemes for the States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the United States Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>indicated that states could construe their obscenity statutes along the lines of the <em>Miller </em>definitions without violating the Federal Constitution, see <em>Ward v Illinois, supra, </em>the Court did not require state courts to follow such a path. That choice is left to each state.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>It is unclear why the majority adopts the <em>Miller </em>definitions. Although they were approvingly set forth in its decision, it appears the <em>Miller </em>Court also gave qualified approval to the obscenity statutes adopted by Hawaii (Hawaii Penal Code, title 37, \u00a7\u00a7 1210-1216; 1972 Hawaii Sess Laws, act 9, ch 12, part II, pp 126-129) and Oregon (Or Laws 1971, ch 743, art 29, \u00a7\u00a7 255-262). <em>Miller, supra, </em>p 24, fn 6. As these statutes appear to be approved by the Court and seem, in their definitions of sexual conduct, to be broader than the Court\u2019s examples are, there is no apparent reason to choose the Court\u2019s definitions over the definitions in these statutes. Yet the majority does so without articulating the rationale for its decision. See <em>State v Shreveport News Agency, Inc, </em>287 So 2d 464, 472 (La, 1973) (Calogero, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">There being no principled basis for choosing between the many and varied constitutionally acceptable definitions of sexual conduct, it is particularly inappropriate for the judiciary to make an unguided, arbitrary choice. The choice should be made by the Legislature and this Court should not usurp its prerogative. This Court should refuse to enforce MCL 750.343a; MSA 28.575(1) until the Legislature complies with the <em>Miller </em>mandate and, as it has done with the obscenity statute relating to minors, explicitly defines that sexual conduct which may not be obscenely depicted or described.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\"> Inasmuch as we find the majority\u2019s construction of the statute harmonizing it with the standards of <em>Miller v California, </em>413 US 15; 93 S Ct 2607; 37 L Ed 2d 419 (1973), unwarranted, we do not reach the question whether that construction comports with Const 1963, art 1. \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> We express no view as to the constitutionality of 1978 PA 33, MCL 722.671 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.254(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
