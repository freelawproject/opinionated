Butterfield. The question in this case is whether the word \"issue\u201d, used by the testator to define the class of income beneficiaries under the trust, refers to all lineal descendants, which would include great-grandchildren, or whether it is limited solely to grandchildren, <em>i.e., </em>the testator\u2019s children\u2019s children. The trial court and the Court of Appeals found the class of income beneficiaries limited to grandchildren of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We reverse and find that \"issue\u201d under the circumstances of this case must be read more broadly to include all lineal descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The facts of this case are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">In 1933, Walter S. Butterfield, at age 65, executed his last will and testament. At that time he was married to his third wife, had five living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>daughters<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and six grandchildren. To date, there have been 19 grandchildren born<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 31 great-grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The will was drafted by the Lansing law firm of Shields, Ballard, Jennings and Taber; the actual scrivener is thought to be Edmund C. Shields, who died in 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Paragraphs 1 through 22 of the will make certain specific bequests. In paragraph 24, the testator created a testamentary trust for the distribution of the remainder of his estate. Paragraph 25 designates certain life-income and estate-for-years beneficiaries. Paragraphs 26 through 29 provide for the distribution of the remainder of the trust income and paragraph 30 provides for the dissolution of the trust and distribution of the corpus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>particular, paragraph 27 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\"27. Subject to the preceding annuities and conditions attached thereto, I direct my said trustees to pay out of the net income from my estate as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\"To my wife, Irene Daley Butterfield, annually during her lifetime, thirty (30%) percent of said net income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and the remainder of said net income to be divided in equal shares, and, one share paid to each of my children, and if, during the lifetime of my wife, Irene Daley Butterfield, any of my said children shall have died, leaving issue of him or her surviving, then the said issue shall receive the parent\u2019s share herein provided for, divided share and share alike, until the termination of said trust estate, as hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The testator died in 1936, and for over 35 years trust income was distributed in amounts of 30 percent to Irene Butterfield Goodwin (the testator\u2019s widow) and 70 percent to the testator\u2019s five children, or per stirpes to grandchildren of the testator upon the death of one of the children. However, in December of 1972, Francis K. Berry, II, a grandchild of the testator, died leaving two children, three-month-old David and three-year-old Frank A. Berry, appellants herein. Francis K. Berry, II, succeeded to a portion of the trust income,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> along with his brothers and sister, per stirpes, when his mother, Helen Berry, a daughter of testator, died. The death of Francis Berry, II, was the first time that a grandchild died leaving children, i.e., great-grandchildren of the testator. The question then arose whether Francis Berry\u2019s share should be distributed per stirpes to his children, David and Frank (great-grandchildren of testator), or whether his share should go to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>surviving brother and sister, Paul and Susan Berry, appellees herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\">In January of 1975, two years after the initiation of this suit, Caroline A. Bidwell, another grandchild of the testator, died leaving five children (great-grandchildren of the testator). The direction of distribution of Caroline Bidwell\u2019s share of income involves the same issue as Francis Berry\u2019s share, <em>i.e., </em>whether Caroline Bidwell\u2019s share of income should go to her brother and sister or to her own children who are the great-grandchildren of the testator. As with the case of Francis Berry, the trustees are holding Caroline Bidwell\u2019s portion of income pending the outcome of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The trustees, who take a position of neutrality in this litigation, sought interpretation or construction of the will in the Calhoun Circuit Court in 1973. That court decided that the word \"issue\u201d as used by the testator was restrictive, <em>i.e., </em>that \"issue\u201d was meant to only include children of the testator\u2019s children, or testator\u2019s grandchildren. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court\u2019s opinion. <em>Gowthorpe v Goodwin, </em>72 Mich App 648; 250 NW2d 514 (1976). We granted leave to appeal June 2, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">II. Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The question presented in this action is the proper interpretation of the word \"issue\u201d in connection with testator\u2019s children in paragraph 27 of the will; whether \"issue\u201d as used in the will means all lineal descendants of testator\u2019s children, <em>i.e. </em>great-grandchildren of testator as well as grandchildren, or only grandchildren of the testator. If \"issue\u201d means all lineal descendants, then great-grandchildren would receive their parent\u2019s share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>of income upon the parent\u2019s death. If \"issue\u201d is limited to grandchildren, then upon the death of a grandchild the income would be divided equally among the grandchild\u2019s siblings to increase their existing shares, or absent surviving siblings, it would be divided among the other children or grandchildren per stirpes.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">III. Meaning of the Word \"Issue\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ayh\">The primary duty of any court faced with the task of resolving a disputed testamentary disposition is to effectuate as nearly as possible the intention of the testator. Where there is no ambiguity, that intention is to be gleaned from the four corners of the instrument, <em>In re Scheyer\u2019s Estate, </em>336 Mich 645, 648-649; 59 NW2d 33 (1953); <em>Wheeler v Wood, </em>104 Mich 414; 62 NW 577 (1895), and the court has merely to interpret and enforce the language employed. If the intention of the testator cannot be gleaned solely by reference to the instrument, in other words, if the document evidences a patent or latent ambiguity,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> there are two external sources through consideration of which a court may establish the intent of the testator: (1) surrounding circumstances and (2) rules of construction. We find no ambiguity to exist in this case; therefore we resolve this dispute by interpretation of the language within the four corners of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The dispute in this case arises because paragraph 30, dealing with the distribution of trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>corpus on dissolution, and paragraph 27, dealing with distribution of trust income, employ different language.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Paragraph 30, as set forth in full in footnote 4, <em>supra, </em>establishes that the trust shall be dissolved upon the death of the last survivor among the testator\u2019s wife and children. There is provision for the setting aside of sufficient amounts of principal to pay income to any possible surviving designated life annuitants, but beyond this, distribution of corpus is to be made to all <em>grandchildren </em>of the testator then living, or in the event of no living grandchildren, to the testator\u2019s heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In contrast to this reference to grandchildren, paragraph 27, also set forth in full in footnote 4, incorporates reference to the payment of trust income to designated annuitants during their lives, authorizes payment of 30 percent of the net income from the trust to the testator\u2019s widow, and provides that the remainder of the net income from the trust (including, upon the death of the wife, her 30 percent life estate in the net income) be divided in equal shares for payment to Butter-field\u2019s children, and in the case of the death of a child who is survived by issue, then the issue are to receive and divide equally the parent\u2019s share until termination of the trust.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">As is discussed below, the word \"issue\u201d is defined in Michigan to mean all lineal descendants. As a consequence, there would be no question here but for the fact that the term \"issue\u201d is used in paragraph 27 to designate income distributees of the trust and the term \"grandchildren\u201d is used in paragraph 30 to designate corpus distributees on dissolution of the same trust.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellees assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>that both terms are thereby rendered ambiguous and must be construed as referring to the same class of people, and that that class is limited to \"grandchildren\u201d, excluding great-grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We do not agree with appellees that the term \"issue\u201d is rendered ambiguous by the use of the term \"grandchildren\u201d in paragraph 30, but find that \"issue\u201d must be given its clear meaning and by law refer to all lineal descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">Although each case must be determined under its individual circumstances, in general, the testamentary disposition of trust corpus and trust income in different manners cannot logically compel a finding of ambiguity. See <em>In re Hicks Estate, </em>345 Mich 448, 452-453; 75 NW2d 819 (1956). If such a testamentary scheme were to be considered inherently ambiguous, we would greatly increase the necessity of judicial construction of wills and unreasonably constrain the use of language presently considered clear and unambiguous; the net result would doubtless be interference with the longstanding and jealously guarded power to devise and bequeath. See MCL 702.1; MSA 27.3178(71) and MCL 702.4; MSA 27.3178(74).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Clearly, then, a given testator may intend different recipients of income and corpus, <em>In re Hicks Estate, supra. </em>Further, it is beyond dispute that in the instant case, at least as to certain income beneficiaries, this is exactly what the testator intended. The testator specifically designated certain life annuitants to take income under the trust while these same individuals were not to take corpus upon dissolution, despite the fact that they might survive the life of the trust.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In the instant case, because there is no ambiguity created under such a scheme, we must interpret each word of the will in accordance with its clear meaning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\"The authorities are overwhelming that when there is no patent or latent ambiguity in the provisions of a will, the intention to be ascribed to the testator is that intention demonstrated in the will\u2019s plain language.\u201d <em>In re Willey Estate, </em>9 Mich App 245, 249; 156 NW2d 631 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In Michigan the meaning of \"issue\u201d is set forth in the statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">\"The word 'issue\u2019 as applied to the descent of estates means all lawful lineal descendants of the ancestor.\u201d MCL 8.3h; MSA 2.212(8).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">This statutory definition codifies both the general and technical meaning of \"issue\u201d in Michigan; it was in effect in 1933 when the will was drafted and remains in effect today.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Further, although external rules of construction are not necessary when interpreting the language of a will because the testator\u2019s intention can be gleaned from the four corners of the document, there are two qualifications or exceptions to this principal rule. Atkinson, Law of Wills (2d ed), ch 15, \u00a7 146, p 811. Even when we can arrive at the testator\u2019s intent by limiting our analysis to the document itself, these two qualifications apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">\"[I]f the testator employed a draftsman skilled in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>use of technical words these must be given their technical meaning. It is practically necessary that the testator\u2019s intent should be identified with that of the agent whom he employed to express the intent. Furthermore, to the extent that either a statute or established rule of decision attributes a certain meaning to particular words, that meaning must be accepted.\u201d (Authority omitted.) Atkinson, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az8\">These qualifications and the facts that the will was drafted by a lawyer and the statute defines \"issue\u201d to comprise all lineal descendants, as well as the clear general meaning of the word \"issue\u201d in this state, lead us to the necessary conclusion that the great-grandchildren, as issue, are entitled to their parent\u2019s share of the income under paragraph 27 of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Although we are impressed with the scholarly opinion of the trial court, we do not reach the same conclusion. In the case at bar, all available facts are stipulated by the parties and, therefore, we do not deal with findings of fact which are not set aside unless clearly erroneous, GCR 1963, 517.1, but with application of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The plain meaning of the word \"issue\u201d in this state leads us to the necessary conclusion that under paragraph 27 of the will, the great-grandchildren are intended \"issue\u201d entitled to income. We find no demonstrable intent to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-10\">Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, Levin, Fitzgerald, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\"> Although the words \"construction\u201d and \"interpretation\u201d are frequently used interchangeably in regard to a court\u2019s duties in cases such as this, at least one legal treatise finds benefit in distinguishing between these terms.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">\"While the difference is not always recognized, it is helpful to draw a distinction between interpretation and construction. The former is the process of discovering the meaning or intention of the testator from permissible data. Construction, in its narrow sense, consists of assigning meaning to the instrument when the testator\u2019s intention cannot be ascertained from proper sources. If interpretation answers all questions relative to disposition of the testator\u2019s property, there is no need of embarking upon the field of construction. In other words, construction is necessary only when interpretation fails.\u201d Atkinson, Law of Wills (2d ed), ch 15, pp 809-810.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">In the instant case we will analyze the will through interpretation of the document itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\"> A daughter, Mitties L.
