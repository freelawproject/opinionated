The question presented is whether voluntary statements made by the defendant to a detective and an assistant prosecuting attorney after knowingly and understandingly waiving his right to an attorney and his right to remain silent must nonetheless be suppressed if the assistant prosecuting attorney violated Disciplinary Rule 7-104(A)(l) of the legal profession\u2019s Code of Professional Responsibility, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">\"During the course of his representation of a client a lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-12\">\"(1) Communicate or cause another to communicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>on the subject of the representation with a party he knows to be represented by a lawyer in that matter unless he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or is authorized by law tp do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The Court of Appeals ruled, one judge dissenting, that an ethics violation alone does not warrant or require the suppression of voluntary statements. 74 Mich App 351; 253 NW2d 763 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">On October 19, 1974 at approximately 8:30 p.m., the victim left her home and drove to a nearby market to purchase some milk. She took her six-month-old child with her. Patrons of the market and a cashier saw her in the market with her child just before closing at approximately 8:45 p.m. Her husband awoke from a nap at approximately 11:45 p.m. and became worried when he discovered that she was not yet home. He telephoned a relative and together they began looking for her. At approximately 12:30 a.m., they found her car in the market parking lot with the keys in it and the child asleep on the front seat. After a futile search of the surrounding area, they drove the car home and telephoned the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The victim\u2019s whereabouts remained unknown until the late afternoon of October 21 when some hunters found her body floating in a nearby river. An autopsy performed the next day revealed that she had been stabbed once in the back and once in the chest. The chest wound was near the sternum. It penetrated through some soft tissue between the fourth and fifth ribs and continued through the front and back walls of the victim\u2019s heart. The back wound penetrated through both walls of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>victim\u2019s left lung. The cause of death was shock and hemorrhaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">On October 23 a citizen spoke to the police and implicated the defendant in the murder. A police officer visited the man at his home and, while the officer listened on an extension, the man telephoned the defendant and expressed concern about the possibility of fingerprints or other incriminating evidence. The defendant said not to worry about these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On October 24 the police arrested the defendant and booked him for murder. The detective in charge of the case then drove the defendant to the area where the victim\u2019s body had been found and advised the defendant of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights by reading from a card that said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions and you have the right to have a lawyer present with you while you are answering these questions. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questions if you wish one. You have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">On the back of the card were these questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\"Do you understand each of these rights I have explained to you? Do you want to talk to a lawyer before any questions? Will you waive your right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>remain silent and answer any questions we may ask you?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The defendant indicated that he understood his rights and would waive them. He then denied having any knowledge of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">On October 28 the defendant sent a message to the detective asking to speak with him. The defendant complained that the guards at the jail were harassing him. That afternoon the detective visited the defendant at the jail. After hearing his <em>Miranda </em>rights and again waiving them, the defendant proffered a statement concerning his supposed whereabouts on the night of the crime and again denied having any knowledge of the murder. At the end of this discussion the detective asked the defendant if he was telling the truth and the defendant said that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">On October 31 counsel was appointed to represent the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">On November 19 the man who originally implicated the defendant in the murder testified against the defendant at the preliminary examination. He had been the defendant\u2019s homosexual lover until the day of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">According to this witness, the defendant arrived at the home of a mutual acquaintance between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on October 19, 1974. At approximately 11 p.m. they all decided to go to a party in Detroit. As they entered the defendant\u2019s car, the defendant asked the acquaintance to hand him the coat lying on the back seat because \"there\u2019s something in there that probably would be dangerous to him\u201d. After they returned from Detroit, the acquaintance was taken home. The defendant then said that he had something to tell the witness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that the witness could not tell anyone else about it. The defendant reached underneath the front seat of his car, pulled out a large knife and said that he \"had just killed his old lady\u201d. When the witness expressed disbelief, the defendant said, \"I\u2019m serious\u201d and proceeded to detail the circumstances of the crime. He said he stabbed her in the chest and \"it went in easy\u201d. (To illustrate the location of the wound, he put the point of the knife on the chest of the witness near the witness\u2019s sternum.) He also said he left her keys and her sleeping child in her car and had dumped her body in the water near the area where the body eventually was found. When the witness continued to express disbelief, the defendant pointed to what he said was a bloodstain on the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Shortly after this conversation, at approximately 4 a.m. on October 20, the defendant and the witness entered another car with some friends who were taking one of the passengers home. On the way to that residence, the defendant asked the driver to take a slight detour. The detour led past the market where the victim\u2019s car had been found. The defendant said that he wanted to \"check out something\u201d. As they drove past the market, the defendant said, \"It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Primarily on the basis of this testimony, the defendant was bound over for trial on an open charge of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Sometime during the middle of November, the defendant again sent word to the detective, asking to speak with him. The detective and the assistant prosecuting attorney assigned to the case visited the defendant at the jail. However, when the detective advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant indicated that he wanted to speak with his attorney before talking further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>about the case. The discussion ceased immediately at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Near the end of January, 1975, the defendant again sent word to the authorities expressing a desire to talk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 29 the detective and the assistant prosecuting attorney spoke with each other and then visited the defendant at the jail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They did not communicate with the defendant\u2019s attorney. The detective advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant waived his rights and said that he wanted to talk to the authorities without his attorney present.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The detective asked about the murder and the defendant proceeded to tell an exculpatory story about driving to a store on the night of the crime to purchase some wine and meeting a man who revealed a large knife and said something about \"killing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>this bitch\u201d. The defendant said he gave this man a ride to a bar and later discovered that the man had managed to slip the knife underneath the defendant\u2019s coat in the back seat of the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant said he threw the knife in some bushes next to a restaurant parking lot in Detroit. He refused to identify the man. At the end of this story, the assistant prosecuting attorney, who, up to that point, had only been taking notes, asked the defendant if he was telling the whole truth. The defendant said that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Prior to trial an evidentiary hearing was held to determine the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statements. After testimony was taken, defense counsel objected to the admission of the January 29 statements on the ground that the defendant had not been advised prior to making the statements that the penalty for first-degree murder was mandatory life. In passing, defense counsel added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\"I just think for an assistant prosecuting attorney and Detective Blum to interrogate Ernest Green and not advise him of that or even volunteer to invite me to the jail, I don\u2019t think that the admissions made on January 29, 1975 should be admissible.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The trial judge overruled the objection and the statements were ultimately admitted into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The jury convicted the defendant of first-degree premeditated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">On appeal the defendant has not argued that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>statements were involuntary or that the authorities failed to comply with the <em>Miranda </em>requirements. Instead he contends that the statements should have been suppressed because the assistant prosecuting attorney violated DR 7-104(A)(l). Alternatively he contends that the statements should have been suppressed because the assistant prosecuting attorney\u2019s conduct was so fundamentally unfair and shocking to the sensibilities of reasonable persons that it violated general notions of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The state responds that there was no violation of DR 7-104(A)(l) in this case because the defendant initiated the January 29 discussion, waived his right to counsel and indicated that he wanted to \u2022talk to the authorities without his attorney present. Further, the state argues that the assistant prosecuting attorney played only a minor role in the discussion, listening to the defendant and taking notes, and that there was no overreaching of any kind. Alternatively the state contends that the exclusionary rule does not apply to violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The proper action is disciplinary proceedings against the offending attorney. Finally, the state argues that if the admission of the defendant\u2019s statements at trial was error, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The threshold question is whether the assistant prosecuting attorney violated DR 7-104(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that the assistant prosecuting attorney had acted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The state has conceded in its brief that prosecuting attorneys are not exempt from the strictures of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>DR 7-104(A)(l).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state argues, however, that no violation of DR 7-104(A)(l) occurred in this case because of the defendant\u2019s intention to speak with the authorities without his attorney present and because of the lack of overreaching by the assistant. prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The argument that the defendant\u2019s request to speak out of the presence of his attorney obviates the necessity of notifying the defendant\u2019s attorney and obtaining his or her consent is contrary to opinions by both the American Bar Association and Michigan State Bar Association Committees on Professional Ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In ABA Formal Opinion 108 issued in 1934, the Committee was asked to interpret the forerunner of DR 7-104(A)(l), old Canon 9, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\"A lawyer should not in any way communicate upon the subject of controversy with a party represented by counsel; much less should he undertake to negotiate or compromise the matter with him, but should deal only with his counsel. It is incumbent upon the lawyer most particularly to avoid everything that may tend to mislead a party not represented by counsel, and he should not undertake to advise him as to the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The question before the committee was whether the plaintiffs attorney in a civil case could ethically interview the defendant in the absence of the defendant\u2019s attorney if the defendant was willing to discuss the case. The committee unanimously answered in the negative and, after quoting Canon 9, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">\"The reasons for such a prohibition are equally clear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>They arise out of the nature of the relation of attorney and client and are equally imperative in the right and interest of the adverse party and of his attorney. To preserve the proper functioning of the legal profession as well as to shield the adverse party from improper approaches the Canon is wise and beneficent and\\ should be obeyed.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In Michigan State Bar Opinion 202, issued in 1965 and approved by the State Bar Board of Commissioners in 1966, the committee was faced with the question whether Canon 9 prohibited a prosecuting attorney from interviewing a criminal defendant without first obtaining the consent of the defendant\u2019s attorney even if the defendant requested the interview without informing his or her attorney. The committee unanimously answered in the negative.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The quotation from ABA Formal Opinion 108 set forth above indicates that there is more to this ethical prohibition than just the prevention of overreaching. The rights and interests of the adverse party\u2019s attorney and the proper functioning of the legal system are involved as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Ethical Consideration 7-18, adopted by the American Bar Association in 1975, emphasizes the importance of this ethical prohibition to the functioning of the legal system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\"The legal system in its broadest sense functions best when persons in need of legal advice or assistance are represented by their own counsel. For this reason a lawyer should not communicate on the subject matter of the representation of his client with a person he knows to be represented in the matter by a lawyer, unless pursuant to law or rule of court or unless he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the consent of the lawyer for that person.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Other authorities have not exempted prosecuting attorneys from the strictures of DR 7-104(A)(l) in fact situations where the defendant requested an interview or was willing to speak and where there was no overreaching.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The language of DR 7-104(A)(l) is clear and contains only two exceptions. It says \"a lawyer shall not * * * communicate * * * with a party he knows to be represented by a lawyer * * * <em>unless </em>he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing [that] party or is authorized by law to do so\u201d. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The state has not presented any reasons for a distinction between civil and criminal cases based on the defendant\u2019s willingness to speak and the lack of overreaching. Nor has the state addressed the concerns in addition to the prevention of overreaching expressed in the ethics opinions noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">We hold that while this defendant\u2019s initiative and willingness to speak and the lack of overreaching by the assistant prosecuting attorney are factors to be considered in mitigation, they do not excuse compliance with the standard of professional conduct prescribed by DR 7-104(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Our resolution of the question above brings us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the principal dispute in this appeal \u2014 whether the voluntary statements made by the defendant after knowingly and understandingly waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights must nonetheless be suppressed solely because the assistant prosecuting attorney violated DR 7-104(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The Court of Appeals majority held that an ethics violation standing alone does not warrant or require the suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The defendant has argued that the violation of DR 7-104(A)(l) was a violation of his rights and that unless his statments are suppressed, he will have no effective remedy to redress the wrong done to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">This argument rests upon a basic misconception of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The provisions of the code are not constitutional or statutory rights guaranteed to individual persons. They are instead self-imposed internal regulations prescribing the standards of conduct for members of the bar.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although it is true that the principal purpose of many provisions is the protection of the public, the remedy for a violation has traditionally been internal bar disciplinary action against the offending attorney. The sanctions available are by no means trivial. The attorney faces permanent disbarment. In these respects the provisions of the code are no different from the provisions found in the codes of conduct for other professions, such as medicine or architecture. They are all self-governing, in-house regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The admissibility of evidence in a court of law, on the other hand, is normally determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>reference to relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, applicable court rules and pertinent common-law doctrines. Codes of professional conduct play no part in such decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">New courts have mixed the standard of conduct found in DR 7-104(A)(1) or any other provision of a code of professional responsibility into questions concerning the admissibility of evidence in criminal or civil cases. Even the courts which have embraced this novel concept have linked their decisions to do so with constitutional doctrines or statutory provisions not recognized or present in Michigan\u2019s jurisprudence. See, for example, <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; 348 NE2d 894; 384 NYS2d 419 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The defendant also has argued that if his statements are not suppressed this Court would in effect give its stamp of approval to unethical conduct. As this opinion clearly indicates in part III above, such a conclusion is unsupported. To the contrary, part III reflects a commitment by the Court to insure that future violations do not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The facts in the case at bar provide a good example why a violation of DR 7-104(A)(l) standing alone should be dealt with by bar disciplinary action rather than by withholding relevant and material evidence from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The defendant had a story he wanted to tell to the authorities, presumably to clear himself of the murder charge lodged against him. He sent word to the authorities and asked to speak with them. He waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights with full knowledge of what he was doing. He specifically stated that he wanted to talk without his attorney present. The assistant prosecuting attorney and the detective did little except listen to what the defendant had to say and take notes. The defendant\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ments were completely voluntary and there was no overreaching of any kind. When asked if he was telling the whole truth, defendant said that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Reversal of the conviction and grant \u00f3f a new trial (if in fact the witnesses and evidence presented in 1975 could be obtained for a second trial) solely because of this less than consequential violation of DR 7-104(A)(l) would constitute reprehensible \"overkill\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In cases such as this, bar disciplinary action directed against the offending attorney would be a more appropriate response and would serve as a more effective deterrent than the indirect sanction of the exclusionary rule. Although the presence of a prosecuting attorney is still one factor to be considered in assessing the \"totality of the circumstances\u201d in order to determine whether a defendant\u2019s statements are constitutionally admissible, we find no unconstitutional intrusion in this factual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">This resolution makes it unnecessary to consider the state\u2019s argument that if admission of the defendant\u2019s statements at trial was error, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The final question is whether the assistant prosecuting attorney\u2019s conduct was so fundamentally unfair and shocking to the sensibilities of reasonable persons that it rises to the level of a violation of due process of law. We find that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">As noted above, the assistant prosecuting attorney\u2019s conduct, although a violation of DR 7-104(A)(1), was relatively innocuous. It pales in comparison to the cases in which a due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>violation has been found. See, for example, <em>Rochin v California, </em>342 US 165; 72 S Ct 205; 96 L Ed 183 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">This is not a case in which the authorities used deception or force to extract a confession from an ignorant and helpless defendant. (Compare <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 US 387; 97 S Ct 1232; 51 L Ed 2d 424 [1977], dealing with the right to counsel.) At most they acquiesced in a course of conduct initiated by a defendant who knew precisely what he was doing after they offered him the right to have counsel present and after that right was refused. We do not find this so unfair or so shocking that the defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-6\">Ryan, J., concurred with Coleman, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> Trial transcript, pp 15-16</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\"> <em>Id., </em>pp 16-17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> At the <em>Walker </em>hearing before trial the detective testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\"><em>\"Q.

However, while I agree that the assistant prosecuting attorney\u2019s action did not rise to the level of a violation of due process of law, I disagree that his action was \"innocuous\u201d. I would affirm but order the Clerk to report this matter to bar grievance authorities for appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The \"prophylactic exclusionary rule\u201d is an indirect method to deter wrongful police action. Since the courts have no effective direct method of disciplining police officers, this indirect method, which costs the public a retrial, has been justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">However, with respect to attorneys, including prosecuting attorneys, the courts do have a direct method of discipline to deter their wrongful action. Attorneys can be disciplined by the bar grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>authorities, and the courts can refer attorneys to them for appropriate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Therefore, to deter future action as here committed, without burdening the public criminal justice system with a retrial, and to directly reach the alleged wrongdoer, I would order the Clerk to report the assistant prosecuting attorney\u2019s action in this matter to the grievance authorities for appropriate action.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-5\">Fitzgerald, J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b361-6\">Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALi\"><em>(concurring in part; dissenting in part). </em>I concur in the holding that the prosecutor violated DR 7-104(A)(l) when he took part in the questioning of Ernest Green without first notifying defense counsel.

Violation of such rules, it is asserted, does not affect the admissibility of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The opinion also rejects the defendant\u2019s argument that without suppression of his statements he will have no redress for the wrong done to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">I am convinced both the opinion and the defendant\u2019s argument misperceive the error and ignore this Court\u2019s duty to supervise the procedure of trial as well as the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Here the evidence sought to be introduced was obtained in violation of one of this Court\u2019s established rules of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">This action by the prosecutor is an affront to the whole profession for it diminishes the effectiveness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of the attorney-client relationship, and enfeebles defendant\u2019s Fifth- and Sixth-Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">But we should not here be diverted by consideration of any violation of defendant\u2019s rights.

Under the circumstances of this case, I do not agree that the defendant\u2019s statements should be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The prosecutor was a direct participant in the preparation for and the conducting of this interview. The influence of the prosecutor\u2019s presence upon the defendant is immeasurable. Defense counsel\u2019s presence could have substantially altered the interrogation. Furthermore, the prosecutor twice accompanied the detective to interrogate Green without notification to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The general rule should be that a prosecutor must be prohibited from interviewing a defendant without first obtaining the consent of defense counsel or the affirmation of defense counsel that he has advised the defendant of his rights and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>following this advice, the defendant still wishes to be interviewed without him. Failure to do so should result in the suppression of any resulting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Accordingly, the conduct of the prosecutor in this case necessitates reversal.

This Court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We all agree that the rule was violated and that it is applicable in criminal as well as in civil cases. We disagree whether the statement should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\"During the course of his representation of a client a lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">\"(1) Communicate or cause another to communicate on the subject of the representation with a party he knows to be represented by a lawyer in that matter unless he has the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or is authorized by law to do so.\u201d Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 7-104(A)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The prohibition of <em>any </em>communication with an adverse party represented by a lawyer makes irrelevant who sought the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">It is well-established in Michigan that old Canon 9,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the forerunner of DR 7-104(A)(1), prohibited a prosecutor from interviewing a defendant without first obtaining the consent of his lawyer, even if the defendant requested the interview.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">A primary purpose of the rule is to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>persons represented by a lawyer from harming their cases by \u201cstatements to opposing lawyers. Only suppression of a statement obtained in violation of the rule will vindicate that interest which the rule was designed to protect. This is as true in criminal as civil cases. Disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer who violates the rule will not undo the harm done another lawyer\u2019s client by violation of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The concept that persons are benefited by retention of and active representation by a lawyer is deeply ingrained in our legal system. The status we afford this belief is most evident in the development of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">While many courts have ruled that a defendant who is represented by a lawyer may be deemed to have waived his lawyer\u2019s assistance by waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> other courts, on the authority of the Supreme Court\u2019s summary reversal in <em>McLeod v Ohio, </em>381 US 356; 85 S Ct 1556; 14 L Ed 2d 682 (1965), have adopted a per se rule forbidding inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>rogation of a defendant represented by a lawyer in his absence once adversary proceedings have commenced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Still other courts have indicated that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel can be waived by a represented individual, but that being read a standardized form of <em>Miranda </em>rights does not provide the necessary information for an intelligent and understanding waiver.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The standardized form of <em>Miranda </em>rights states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\"You have a right to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions and you have the right to have a lawyer present with you while you are answering these questions. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questions if you wish one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">A <em>pro forma </em>offer to appoint a lawyer for a defendant who already has one indicates that advice in that form is perfunctory and inappropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These courts, stressing the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Brewer v Williams, </em>430 US 387, 404; 97 S Ct 1232; 51 L Ed 2d 424 (1977), \"[t]his strict standard applies equally to an alleged waiver of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>counsel whether at trial or at a critical stage of pretrial proceedings\u201d, require an in-depth inquiry similar to that made when a defendant waives assistance of counsel at trial. \"[The defendant] should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that 'he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open\u2019. <em>Adams v United States ex rel McCann, </em>317 US [269,] 279 [63 S Ct 236; 87 L Ed 268; 143 ALR 435 (1942)].\u201d <em>Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806, 835; 95 S Ct 2525; 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Adherents to this position would minimally require explanation to the defendant of the nature of the charges against him, the range of possible punishments, and <em>how a </em>lawyer can assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">This on-going constitutional debate reflects the high importance many attach to protecting a litigant, not only from the approaches of his adversary\u2019s lawyer, but from the folly of his own well-meaning initiatives and the generally unfortunate consequences of his ignorance. The same concept is reflected in DR 7-104(A)(l).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The lead opinion states that the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Disciplinary Rules are designed to protect \"attorney[s]\u201d, the \"proper functioning of the legal system\u201d and \"the public\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The opinion avoids acknowledging that any citizen, any plaintiff, any defendant, any individual human being who is not a lawyer has an interest protected by the code. Having failed to acknowledge that anyone other than a lawyer has a protected interest, it need not come to grips with the effective protection of that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">A primary purpose of the rule is to \"shield the adverse party\u201d, not, as the lead opinion states, the \"adverse party\u2019s attorney\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\"The reasons for such a prohibition are equally clear. They arise out of the nature of the relation of attorney and client and are equally imperative in the right and interest of the adverse party and of his attorney. To preserve the proper functioning of the legal profession as well as <em>to shield the adverse party </em>from improper approaches the Canon is wise and beneficent and should be obeyed.\u201d ABA Committee on Professional Ethics, Formal Opinion 108 (1934) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The emphasis on the protection of people goes beyond abstract concerns about the public reputation of the bar and general harm to society; the code recognizes that individuals can be concretely harmed by violations of ethical standards. This is a recurrent theme throughout the code and the opinions of the ABA committee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The public is not an abstract entity; it consists of individuals who are the intended beneficiaries of the Court\u2019s actions in regulating the conduct of the bar. It would be anomalous for the Court to claim to be acting for the \"protection of the public\u201d and in the interest of \"the administration of justice\u201d and then refuse in individual cases to assure that particular persons are not harmed by unethical practices; the Court cannot protect the public except by protecting individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The code\u2019s purpose of protecting individuals from becoming the victims of unethical behavior has led courts to assume an active role in its enforcement, going beyond mere review of disciplinary proceedings that may reach the courts. Rather than sit by and await possible disciplinary proceedings, the courts have exercised their supervisory power in particular cases to undo the damage caused individual human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Courts have required counsel, on the authority of the disciplinary rules and canons,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>between withdrawing from the case and having his otherwise admissible testimony on behalf of his client barred. This has been required not only in civil,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but also in criminal cases where the rule has been applied to both defense<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and prosecuting attorneys.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Courts have also acted pursuant to the disciplinary rules and canons, in both civil and criminal cases, to protect a former client when his lawyer subsequently represents an adverse interest.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>yers have been disqualified in such circumstances,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and judgments in favor of the lawyer\u2019s new client have been reversed when necessary to protect effectively the interests of the former client.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In criminal cases, courts have found the Code of Professional Responsibility an independent basis for disqualifying a prosecutor from handling a case because of a personal or other relationship with the accused making it inappropriate for him to prosecute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Also, indictments have been quashed or dismissed, and convictions reversed or habeas corpus relief granted.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Recently, in <em>In re April 1977 Grand Jury Subpoenas, </em>573 F2d 936 (CA 6, 1978), a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found that the Attorney General\u2019s appointment of an Internal Revenue Service lawyer to conduct a grand jury investigation of General Motors was violative of Canon 9 of the Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Professional Responsibility. The panel stated that the IRS lawyer who had conducted a civil investigation of General Motors had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\"been placed in a conflicting and intolerable position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\"[T]he function of the prosecutor * * * is also to protect citizens against unfounded criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\"In the present case the worry of GM is that [the IRS lawyer] has an axe to grind and is more interested in justifying his previous investigations, his recommendations, and the conduct of IRS agents than in protecting GM against unfounded criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 943.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">While the Sixth Circuit <em>en banc </em>reversed the panel\u2019s opinion on the procedural ground that certification of the appeal was improvident,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> what is relevant for present purposes is the relief that the Sixth Circuit panel deemed appropriate. The panel ordered that the cause be remanded \"with instructions to terminate the grand jury investigation as invalid, and <em>to enter necessary protective orders relative to the use of the grand jury information\". Id., </em>p 945 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>In re Karabatian\u2019s Estate, </em>17 Mich App 541, 546-547; 170 NW2d 166 (1969), held that a lawyer who drafted a will under which he was a substantial beneficiary was without standing to contest a later will: \"[Apparently warnings do not suffice. If an attorney\u2019s conduct so violates <em>the spirit of the lawyer\u2019s code of ethics, </em>it also runs contrary to the public policy of this state. The bequest to contestant being void, he has no standing to contest the later will.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">One theme runs through the varied factual cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cumstances and results of these cases: courts do not rely on disciplinary proceedings alone to effectuate the purposes of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> They will do what is necessary to undo the results of unethical behavior and thereby protect individuals who may have been harmed by such behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">I have not found a single civil case in any jurisdiction in which a court has suggested that disciplinary proceedings are the only appropriate and available \"remedy\u201d for a party who has been directly harmed by conduct violative of DR 7-104(A)(1). In civil cases, the courts have acted to protect individuals who would otherwise have been victimized by violations of the rule.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>DR 7-104(A)(1)\u2019s prohibitions apply equally in criminal and civil cases. There is no principled basis for enforcing the rule in civil, but not criminal, cases. Since the stakes in criminal cases are generally higher, and incarceration tends to put defendants under pressure to seek out the prosecutorial authorities in a generally hapless effort to extricate themselves,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the need for protecting defendants in criminal cases is most compelling. Both the Michigan and ABA ethics committees have refused to draw any distinction between violations of the rule in criminal and civil cases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The heart of the matter is that if the rule\u2019s purpose of protecting people is to be achieved, evidence obtained in violation of the rule must be suppressed. Disciplinary proceedings against a prosecuting attorney do not undo the harm caused an individual who otherwise might not have been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Further, it is uncertain what, if any, grievance action will be taken. It will often be left to the defendant or his attorney to report ethical violations and initiate disciplinary proceedings. It flies in the face of reason to expect a defendant to risk a prosecutor\u2019s actual or imagined displeasure by instituting proceedings that cannot directly benefit him. The defendant may not unreasonably believe such action will adversely affect his case in subsequent proceedings at the trial, on appeal or at a retrial following an appeal, or his later chances for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">It is unlikely that a defendant has any cause of action for damages against a prosecutor.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even if a defendant has such a remedy, few will think that a loss of liberty can be adequately compensated, especially, as here, where the defendant has been imprisoned for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419; 258 NW2d 414 (1977), this Court recognized the need for providing effective remedies. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>sustained the action of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board in dismissing employer appeals for violation of a statute requiring payment during an employer\u2019s appeal to a claimant of 70% of the weekly benefit rate ordered by a hearing referee. The statute did not explicitly require or authorize dismissal. Other remedies might have been employed, such as entry of an immediately enforceable monetary judgment. This Court held, however, that the purposes of the statute would be rendered meaningless unless the board could dismiss the appeals of those who violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In the instant case the only meaningful remedy is suppression of the unethically obtained evidence. The Court cannot justify promulgation of DR 7-104(A)(l), designed to protect people, often from themselves, but, when actual abuse occurs, failure to enforce that protection in a meaningful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">An excuse is sometimes offered that the overriding importance of disclosing the truth justifies a court\u2019s failure to suppress illicitly obtained evidence. But our legal system operates on the principle that the goal is the ascertainment of truth within the limitations imposed by law. Lawyers\u2014 prosecutors especially \u2014 play an important role in the administration of justice and thus the Code of Professional Responsibility regulating their conduct in relation to those who encounter the system is part of the very fabric of the law. There can be no ordered system of law if those for whose protection the code has been promulgated are not effectively protected from harm caused by its violation. No lawyer should be permitted to advance his client\u2019s cause with evidence obtained from another lawyer\u2019s client in violation of a rule designed as a safeguard against that very violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Courts have suppressed evidence in criminal cases where a violation of DR 7-104(A)(l) has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In <em>United States v Thomas, </em>474 F2d 110, 112 (CA 10, 1973), a written statement was obtained from the defendant in the absence of and without the knowledge of his lawyer. The statement was obtained at an interview requested by the defendant at which he read and signed a Miranda-type waiver of rights form. The Court held that the ethical violation required suppression of the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\"[O]nce a criminal defendant has either retained an attorney or had an attorney appointed for him by the court, any statement obtained by interview from such defendant may not be offered in evidence for any purpose unless the accused\u2019s attorney was notified of the interview which produced the statement and was given a reasonable opportunity to be present. <em>To hold otherwise, we think, would be to overlook conduct which violated both the letter and the spirit of the Canons of Ethics. </em>This is obviously not something which the defendant alone can waive.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The New York Court of Appeals in <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479; 384 NYS2d 419; 348 NE2d 894 (1976), held that New York\u2019s constitutional protections<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> prevented a defendant in custody, represented by a lawyer, from waiving his right to counsel in the absence of his lawyer. The Court said that apart from the constitutional violation, the statements should have been excluded under the Code of Professional Responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\"Moreover, an attempt to secure a waiver of the right of counsel in a criminal proceeding in the absence of a lawyer, already retained or assigned, would constitute a breach of professional ethics, as it would be in the least-consequential civil matter (see ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 7-104, subd [A][l]) * * *. Since the Code of Professional Responsibility is applicable, <em>it would be grossly incongruous for the courts to blink its violation in a criminal matter. \u201d Id., </em>pp 484-485.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The Court then explained why it is important to enforce DR 7-104(A)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\"[T]he principle is not so much, important as that is, to preserve the civilized decencies, but to protect the individual, often ignorant and uneducated, and always in fear, when faced with the coercive police power of the State. <em>The right to the continued advice of a lawyer, already retained or assigned, is his real protection against an abuse of power by the organized State. </em>It is more important than the preinterrogation warnings given to defendants in custody. These warnings often provide only a feeble opportunity to obtain a lawyer, because the suspect or accused is required to determine his need, unadvised by anyone who has his interests at heart. The danger is not only the risk of unwise waivers of the privilege against self incrimination and of the right to counsel, but the more significant risk of inaccurate, sometimes false, and inevitably incomplete descriptions of the events described.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 485 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">I do not believe that the Court intends to circumscribe its powers to the extent that it cannot enforce the Code of Professional Responsibility except through disciplinary proceedings. Just a year ago, in <em>Smith v Arc-Mation, Inc, </em>402 Mich 115; 261 NW2d 713 (1978), the Court indicated its willingness to enforce the canons in individual cases. Although we found no violation of the canons warranting the attorney\u2019s disqualification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>there was no hint that a court could not act in cases before it but must await disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Adoption of such a limiting rule of law might prevent, for example, a court granting relief to an individual charged an excessive contingent fee in violation of GCR 1963, 928, adopted pursuant to the same supervisory authority as the Code of Professional Responsibility. The Court surely does not intend such far-reaching results and yet they are implicit in a holding that disciplinary proceedings are the only proper remedy for violations of Court-promulgated standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">If the Court chooses later to avoid such results by holding that the code is enforceable in civil cases but not in criminal cases, or in some criminal cases but not first-degree murder cases, it will, I think, be extremely difficult to advance a principled basis for such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">DR 7-104(A)(l) was violated in this case. As a result, the prosecutor who violated the rule obtained statements he might not otherwise have obtained which were used against Green. DR 7-104(A)(1) is designed to protect people, not abstractions.

When she failed to return, her husband went to look for her and found her car in the market parking lot with the milk and keys in it and the little boy asleep. The police were called. Two days later her body was found floating in a river approximately one mile from the market. An autopsy established that she had died from shock apd hemorrhage due to penetrating wounds of the heart and lung.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">On October 24, 1974 Green was arrested and charged with the murder. Green was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights by a detective and questioned after he indicated that he waived them. Green denied knowledge of the murder. Four days later Green sent a message from the Oakland County Jail to the detective asking to speak with him about harassment by the jail guards. He visited Green that afternoon, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and obtained a waiver. Green again denied having knowledge of the murder and gave the detective a detailed statement of his whereabouts that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">On October 31 counsel was appointed for Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">On November 6 and 19 a preliminary examination was held, after which Green was bound over for trial. William Terry, Green\u2019s homosexual lover until the day of his arrest, testified at the examination that he and Green had driven from Pontiac to Detroit and back on the night the crime was committed. Terry testified that when he and an acquaintance entered Green\u2019s car to go to a party in Detroit, Green asked the acquaintance to hand him the coat lying on the back seat because \"there [is] something in there that probably would be dangerous to him\u201d. Terry further testified that upon their return to Pontiac, Green looked for something under the car seat, found a knife, indicated to Terry that he \"had just killed his old lady\u201d with the knife, and proceeded to detail the circumstances of the crime. Shortly after this conversation, according to Terry, he and Green entered another car with some friends who were taking one of the passengers home. Green asked the driver to take a detour that led past the market where Mrs. McPhail\u2019s car was found so that he could \"check out something\u201d. As they drove past, Green said, \"It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">In November, 1974, Green again requested that the detective come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>to the jail. The detective <em>and </em>the assistant prosecuting attorney assigned <em>to the case </em>visited Green <em>at the </em>jail. After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights Green indicated that he wished to talk to his lawyer before he talked to the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">On January 29, 1975, the detective and the assistant prosecuting attorney again came to the jail at Green\u2019s request. They did not attempt- to communicate with Green\u2019s attorney. The detective again advised Green of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. This time he waived his rights and said he wanted to discuss the case without his lawyer being there. The detective asked about the murder and Green proceeded to tell an exculpatory story about driving to a store on the night of the murder, meeting and giving a ride to a man who revealed a large knife and said something about \"killing this bitch\u201d, and later discovering that the man had slipped the knife under Green\u2019s coat in the back seat of the car. He said he threw the knife into some bushes next to a restaurant parking lot in Detroit. He refused to identify the man he had allegedly met and given a ride to. At the completion of his statement, the assistant prosecuting attorney, who up to that point had only been taking notes, asked Green if he was telling the whole truth. Green said that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">Prior to trial a <em>Walker </em>hearing was held to determine the admissibility of Green\u2019s statement of January 29. Green\u2019s lawyer objected to admission of the statement on the grounds that it was obtained without granting Green his right to counsel and, specifically, without advising him prior to making his statements that the penalty for first-degree murder was mandatory life. The judge overruled the objection and the statements were introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Green was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to serve the mandatory life term in prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> \"A lawyer should not in any way communicate upon the subject of controversy with a party represented by counsel; much less should he undertake to negotiate or compromise the matter with him, but should deal only with his counsel.

The hearing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>not only called this incident to the attention of the state bar, but refused to accept or consider the declaration because defendant\u2019s lawyer had not been notified or consulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">'In <em>Obser v Adelson, </em>96 NYS2d 817 (Sup Ct, 1949), <em>aiFd </em>276 App Div 999; 95 NYS2d 757 (1950), a motion to suppress evidence was at issue. An action was brought on behalf of an infant injured as a result of alleged negligence. The infant\u2019s father retained a lawyer who advised defendants of the infant\u2019s claim. Defendants\u2019 lawyer was also notified of the claim by plaintiffs lawyer. Subsequently, a representative of defendants\u2019 lawyer obtained a statement from the infant\u2019s mother. The court directed that the statement be \"suppressed and that the defendants be not permitted to use the same for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">See, also, <em>Chilcutt v Baker, </em>355 SW2d 338 (Mo, St Louis Ct App, 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> Once a defendant has exercised his right to counsel, the question of waiver of his counsel\u2019s assistance should not depend on the outcome of the \"almost inevitable 'swearing contest\u2019 over what happened behind the closed doors\u201d.
