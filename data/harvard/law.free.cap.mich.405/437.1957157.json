After being advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights he was transported to the Washtenaw County jail where, later in the evening after once again being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he made and signed a written statement confessing to the murder of Thomas Brown and Arland Withrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">On the following day, on the basis of his written statement to the effect that he killed Withrow on a Federal reservation in Milan, Michigan, Nuss was charged with the Withrow murder in the United States District Court.

The state shall defray all expenses of such person while so confined in a state institution and may recover the amount so paid from such person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On March 14, 1967, the same day the defendant filed his petition for a criminal sexual psychopath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>hearing, he also filed a \"Demand for Speedy Trial\u201d in the pending Brown murder case. As the circuit court declared in its certified concise statement of the proceedings and facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\"That petition formally advised the prosecution and the court of the status of the Federal charge; attached a copy of the Federal dismissal; noted that the prosecutor already had possession of confessions in both the Brown and Withrow matters; alleged that since under the criminal sexual psychopath statute appellee had to present evidence of his sexual psychopathic condition, and since he would of necessity present evidence of both homicides, he was being placed in a position of having to waive constitutional rights to be free from self-incrimination in order to make use of the statute; and concluded by demanding a speedy trial in the Withrow matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Despite his demand for speedy trial, no action was taken by state authorities to prosecute Nuss until January 7, 1975, some eight years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The year following Nuss\u2019 commitment as a criminal sexual psychopath, the Legislature repealed the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act by 1968 PA 143. Under \u00a7 1 of the new legislation, persons who had been committed as criminal sexual psychopaths under the former act were continued in confinement in state institutions under the jurisdiction of the state Department of Mental Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Because it was unclear in the new legislation where jurisdiction lay to conduct hearings to ascertain whether persons committed as criminal sexual psychopaths had recovered, this Court issued Administrative Order 1969-4 which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">\"It appearing upon repeal of PA 1939, No 165, that jurisdiction to hear petitions to test the recovery of persons committed as criminal sexual psychopaths un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>der the provisions of said act remains unresolved, that proceedings in various courts wherein relief has been sought have been dismissed with the result that a situation has continued for several months wherein the proper forum for reviewing the propriety of continued custody of persons committed under the provisions of said law remains in question, that protection of the basic rights of such persons and the uninterrupted administration of justice requires designation of a proper forum for hearing said matters until such time as the legislature shall provide clarification, now therefore * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\"It is ordered, that until such time as there is further legislative clarification of jurisdiction of proceedings for testing recovery of persons committed under the provisions of said PA 1939, No 165, as amended, jurisdiction shall continue in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of said act * * 382 Mich xxix (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The order remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">On April 9, 1973, a three-judge panel of the Third Judicial Circuit Court (Wayne County) found the commitment and release provisions of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act to be unconstitutional and ordered the release of Louis Smith, the appellee in the companion case of <em>People v Smith, ante, </em>405 Mich 418; 275 NW2d 466 (1979), which is decided today. Smith was then being temporarily detained in Wayne County during the pendency of a civil action in which he was the named plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Prior to issuance of the trial court opinion in <em>Doe v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>state mental health authorities afforded Nuss an opportunity to be transferred to Northville State Hospital which was located in Wayne County, ostensibly to afford him the benefit of the widely anticipated ruling of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>unconstitutionality of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act by the trial court panel. The mental health authorities informed Nuss that if the Wayne Circuit Court held the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act unconstitutional, the ruling would only apply to those criminal sexual psychopathic persons detained in Wayne County. Nonetheless, Nuss chose to remain in the Ionia State Hospital to continue his treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On July 13, 1973, defendant was paroled from Ionia State Hospital by the hospital superintendent after the latter made the statutory determination that \"there are reasonable grounds to believe that [Nuss] has recovered from [his] psychopathy and is not a menace to the safety of himself and others\u201d. MCL 330.35b; MSA 14.825(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Approximately a year and a half later, following release of the Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v Smith, supra, </em>the Washtenaw County prosecutor, for the first time, charged Nuss with first-degree murder in the Withrow matter and reactivated the first-degree murder charge in the Brown matter. The two cases were consolidated for preliminary examination in the Fourteenth District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">. At his preliminary examination defendant moved to quash the complaints and the warrants, alleging violation of his state and Federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial and against double jeopardy and pleading the statutory bar to prosecution contained in \u00a7 8 of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act. The motions were denied and Nuss was bound over to the Washtenaw Circuit Court to stand trial. Identical motions were brought in the circuit court and similarly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">On October 6, 1975, the circuit court certified the questions at issue in these motions for interlocutory appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>People v Nuss, 75 </em>Mich App 346; 254 NW2d 883 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Judge Maher, writing for the majority, reasoned that the statutory bar contained in \u00a7 8 of the repealed Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act prohibited prosecution of defendant for the Brown murder, and that his due process right not to be prejudiced by an unexcusable delay between the date of the offense and the date of the trial precluded his prosecution for the Withrow murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 400 Mich 824 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">We affirm the Court of Appeals with respect to both of these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">I. The Brown Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Our analysis begins with the uncontroverted fact that the circuit court made a final and binding determination that Nuss was a criminal sexual psychopathic person and committed him to the Department of Mental Health pursuant to the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act. The principal motivating event underlying the defendant\u2019s criminal sexual psychopath petition and the court\u2019s order of commitment was the murder of Tom Brown, an offense with which the defendant stood charged at the time the petition was filed. The language of \u00a7 8 of the now repealed Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act provides that a \"person who is found * * * to be a criminal sexual psychopathic person and such finding having become final\u201d may not thereafter be tried for an offense with which he originally stood charged in the committing court at the time the petition requesting a criminal sexual psychopath hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>filed. Accordingly, the state is statutorily barred from prosecuting defendant for the Brown murder unless a showing can be made that the \u00a7 8 bar to prosecution is somehow now inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We conclude that neither the repeal of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act in 1968 nor the Wayne Circuit Court decision addressing the constitutionality of the detention of John Doe<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> affected the final adjudication of defendant Nuss\u2019 psychopathy or the concomitant bar to prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The principle is elemental that all statutes are prospective in their application unless the contrary clearly appears from the context of the statute itself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Wylie v City Commission of Grand Rapids, </em>293 Mich 571, 585; 292 NW 668 (1940); <em>Detroit Trust Co v </em>Detroit, 269 Mich 81, 84; 256 NW 811 (1934). There is nothing in the language of the repealing statute, 1968 PA 143, to justify a construction of retrospective application.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument that the Wayne Circuit Court\u2019s judgment in the unreported case of <em>Doe v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, supra, </em>that the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act is unconstitutional in its confinement and release provisions is binding in the case before us is without merit. That decision may have been binding upon the parties to it and arguably all other criminal sexual psychopath persons then being detained in Wayne County, but defendant Nuss was neither. He did not consent to the jurisdiction of the Wayne Circuit Court and was not a party to those proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ings, being confined at the time in the Ionia State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">This Court has previously entertained and rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act in <em>People v Chapman, </em>301 Mich 584; 4 NW2d 18 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We note further that Nuss was not released from his commitment following the Wayne County proceedings in the <em>Doe </em>case but was continued in confinement until, in due course and in compliance with the release provisions of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act, the hospital superintendent determined Nuss had so far recovered from his psychopathy that he could be paroled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The statutory bar of \u00a7 8 which was operative at the time of Nuss\u2019 commitment precludes subsequent criminal proceedings against a person finally found to be a criminal sexual psychopath for those offenses with which he stood charged or convicted at the time the petition requesting the criminal sexual psychopath determination was filed. Because the defendant was charged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>murder of Tom Brown at the time his petition requesting the criminal sexual psychopath determination was filed, the state is barred from trying him for the Brown murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">II. The Withrow Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">With respect to the first-degree murder charge in the Withrow murder, we are faced with a somewhat different situation. Initially, the defendant was charged with the Withrow murder in Federal court. After an investigation disclosed a lack of Federal jurisdiction, the charge was dropped. Three days prior to the date on which the Federal charge was dismissed, defendant filed his petition in the state court requesting a criminal sexual psychopath determination in connection with the Brown murder. Although a murder charge in the Withrow matter was pending at the time the criminal sexual psychopath petition was filed, the charge had been brought in the Federal court rather than in the state circuit court. Consequently, later criminal prosecution of the defendant for the Withrow murder was not barred by \u00a7 8 of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act which provides: \"No person who is found in such original hearing to be a criminal sexual psychopathic person and such finding having become final, may thereafter be tried or sentenced <em>upon the offense with which he originally stood charged, or convicted, in the committing court </em>at the time of the filing of the original petition.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Although \u00a7 8 of the repealed Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act does not bar the prosecution of the defendant for the Withrow murder, principles of due process<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> may require dismissal of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>against him if there is evidence that an unjustified delay between the commission of the offense and the filing of the information substantially prejudiced his right to a fair trial. <em>United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307, 324-326; 92 S Ct 455; 30 L Ed 2d 468 (1971); <em>United States v Feinberg, </em>383 F2d 60 (CA 2, 1967); <em>Woody v United States, </em>125 US App DC 192; 370 F2d 214 (1966); <em>Ross v United States, </em>121 US App DC 233; 349 F2d 210 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In 1967, before the final criminal sexual psychopath determination was made in his case, the defendant, apparently recognizing the inapplicability of the \u00a7 8 bar to prosecution in the Withrow matter, filed a pleading in the Washtenaw Circuit Court notifying the court that the Federal charge had been dropped in the Withrow case and demanding a speedy trial in both the Withrow and the Brown cases. Despite this request and the fact that the Washtenaw County prosecutor already had possession of defendant\u2019s confession in the Withrow murder, the prosecutor did not charge defendant with Withrow\u2019s murder until January 17, 1975, almost eight years later, more than a year and a half after his parole from confinement as a criminal sexual psychopath. Apparently the prosecutor reasoned that as long as the defendant was detained pursuant to a commitment as a criminal sexual psychopath, there was no practical benefit to the prosecution to pursue the Withrow matter. Aside from this practical consideration the prosecutor suggests no justification for his failure to file charges against Nuss, especially in view of Nuss\u2019 demand to be speedily tried for the Withrow killing. As discussed above, \u00a7 8 of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act did not bar the institution of criminal proceedings nor is there any allegation on the part of the prosecutor that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>insufficient evidence upon which to proceed. In fact, given the strength of the case which derives from the defendant\u2019s detailed confession, the prosecutor had little to lose from the delay. In view of the foregoing, we are persuaded that the lengthy delay between the offense and the filing of the information was unjustifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Against this backdrop of unjustifiable delay we review the record for a showing of prejudice to defendant by reason thereof. <em>United States v Marion, supra, </em>at 325; <em>United States v Feinberg, supra, </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The witnesses who testified at the preliminary examination concerning defendant\u2019s confession admitted that they could not recall many of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s statement, including the number of police officers who were present. In addition, Dr. Alexander Dukay, one of the psychiatrists who examined defendant and testified at defendant\u2019s criminal sexual psychopath hearing, is now deceased. While the prosecutor argues that Dr. Dukay\u2019s transcribed testimony would be admissible at a subsequent murder trial under MRE 804(b)(1) as former testimony, it is not at all clear that he is correct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Even if it be assumed that Dr. Dukay\u2019s testimony is now admissible, its probative value is minimal. Dr. Dukay testified at the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act hearing that Nuss was reacting to an irresistible impulse, a form of insanity. But there was absolutely no development of that point and no defense motive to develop it since a finding of insanity would have precluded a determination that Nuss was a criminal sexual psychopath under the act. Consequently, the witness was not examined fully upon a matter which would now be absolutely crucial to a successful defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The purpose for which Dr. Dukay\u2019s expertise was sought and his testimony received in 1967 was wholly different than would be the case today. Moreover, as experienced trial attorneys are so well aware, the probative force of the testimony of an expert being examined and cross-examined before the jury is immeasurably greater than that which is generated by the reading of an eight-year-old transcript of his testimony dealing with a distinctly different aspect of the defendant\u2019s mental state. For all practical purposes, Dr. Dukay\u2019s death has deprived the defendant of probably favorable testimony crucial to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">There can be little question that any expert opinion testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s 1967 mental state which is obtained and presented in 1979 is of severely diminished value. As Judge Bazelon observed in <em>Williams v United States, </em>102 US App DC 51; 250 F2d 19, 23 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\"Passage of time makes proof of any fact more diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>cult. When the fact at issue is as subtle as a mental state, the difficulty is immeasurably enhanced.\u201d See, also, <em>Dickey v Florida, </em>398 US 30, 40; 90 S Ct 1564; 26 L Ed 2d 26 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">When the \"passage of time\u201d is eight years, during which the subject has undergone six years of treatment and has been pronounced recovered, the difficulty of proof of the earlier mental state is still greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Finally, and most importantly, if the defendant had been charged with the murder of Withrow within a reasonable time after the commission of the offense, he would in all likelihood have successfully invoked the provisions of the now repealed Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act and future criminal proceedings on the Withrow charge would have been barred by \u00a7 8 of the repealed act.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Record evidence suggests that the circumstances surrounding both murders were extremely similar and Nuss had already been found to be a criminal sexual psychopath in connection with the Brown murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">As the situation now stands, defendant is denied statutory protections which otherwise would have been available to him. In so doing we conclude that the defendant was substantially prejudiced by the eight-year delay. This prejudice to defendant was the direct consequence of the prosecutor\u2019s failure to reasonably charge defendant with the Withrow murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">We hold that the substantial prejudice resulting from the unjustifiable delay in commencing criminal proceedings against the defendant precludes a trial on the Withrow matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-11\">Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, Williams,</judges>\n<judges id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Levin, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\"> FBI agents learned that Nuss made a statement to a state police official that the Withrow killing took place not on the Federal reservation but in Augusta Township of Washtenaw County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b507-12\"> The Washtenaw County authorities\u2019 earlier deferral to Federal authorities was apparently a matter of policy since state authorities had jurisdiction to prosecute whether or not the killing took place on a Federal reservation.

Prior to any such parole, release or discharge, the superintendent of the institution to which such person is committed or held, must first give written notice by certified mail to the prosecuting attorney and chief of police of the county from where such person was committed, and the prosecuting attorney and chief of police of the county to which such person will be released.\u201d MCL 330.35b; MSA 14.825(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> US Const, Am XIV; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> Section 4 of the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act, as it read in Compiled Laws of 1948, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\"Sec. 4.
