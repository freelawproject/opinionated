Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b677-15\">In 1972, plaintiff deeded her home to Louis Tibolla as security in connection with an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ment by Tibolla to repair plaintiffs home after a fire. The conveyance itself was intended as a down payment of $5,500 on the total cost of repairs said to be $17,100. The balance of the amount due for the repairs was to be paid by plaintiff under a land contract to repurchase. The land contract had a clause authorizing Tibplla to mortgage the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In September, 1972, Tibolla granted a mortgage to defendant Colonial Federal Savings and Loan Association of Grosse Pointe Woods (hereinafter Colonial), gave a personal note as well as a security interest in the property, and received from Colonial $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Later in 1972 plaintiff filed her initial lawsuit against Tibolla alleging that he had breached his contract of repair, committed fraud, used secondhand materials, made shoddy repairs and fail\u00e9d to apply half the proceeds of the land contract to pay off the mortgage. By amended complaint, plaintiff joined Colonial as a party and sought rescission of the mortgage , between Tibolla and Colonial. Colonial denied that it was a party to any wrongful conduct and, at pretrial conference, January 8, 1975, plaintiffs attorney in the first case agreed to a dismissal of Colonial with prejudice. At the same time a default judgment was entered against Tibolla for the full amount of plaintiffs claim, $17,100, together with costs, interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Nine days later plaintiff filed the instant suit against Colonial, seeking rescission of the mortgage based on a claim that violation of the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 USC 1635,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> gave plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>a right to rescission. Colonial moved for and received an accelerated judgment on the basis of res judicata and election of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Appeal was taken by plaintiff to the Court of Appeals which affirmed by memorandum opinion of June 22, 1976. Plaintiff filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court and leave was granted March 7, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">II. Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Res judicata is a manifestation of the recognition that endless litigation leads to vexation, confusion and chaos for the litigants, and inefficient use of judicial time. See generally 46 Am Jur 2d, Judgments, \u00a7 395, p 559. The scope of res judicata has been framed in this jurisdiction in two distinct manners, one of which is literal and narrow and the other of which is broad. The former literal statement of the rule appears in the case of <em>Clements v Constantine, </em>344 Mich 446; 73 NW2d 889 (1955). In that case the scope of the doctrine was set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\" 'The first essential of the rule of <em>res judicata </em>is the identity of the matter in issue. The \"matter in issue\u201d is defined to be \"that matter upon which the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>proceeds by his action, and which the defendant controverts by his pleadings.\u201d See Chand, Res Judicata, p 35. If the same subject matter comes in question in. a second action in a court of last resort, it is bound by its own former decision. Bigelow on Estoppel (1st ed), p 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\" ' <em>\"A matter or question, either of law or fact, is res judicata, or set at rest, </em>as to adverse parties and their respective privies, <em>if it was a material issue in the proceeding, directly involved, and not merely incidentally cognizable nor collaterally in question, and was adjudicated after a contest, by a final judgment on the </em>merits1 Van Fleet, Res Judicata, p 2.\u2019\u201d <em>Clements, supra, </em>453-454. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Literally res judicata means \"[a] matter adjudged\u201d and is further defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed) as a \"[rjule that final judgment or decree on merits * * * is conclusive of rights of parties or their privies in all later suits <em>on points and matters determined in former </em>suit\u201d (emphasis added). What clearly stands out in these definitions is that issues <em>not litigated </em>in a former suit are <em>not </em>res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">However, the rule has also been framed more broadly. An example of this more inclusive statement of the doctrine can be found in three cases which deal with the res judicata of prior consent judgments, <em>Gursten v Kenney, </em>375 Mich 330; 134 NW2d 764 (1965); <em>Shank v Castle, </em>357 Mich 290, 295; 98 NW2d 579 (1959); <em>Prawdzik v Heidema Brothers, Inc, </em>352 Mich 102; 89 NW2d 523 (1958). In <em>Gursten </em>the rule was stated in dicta as follows,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">\" ' \"The plea of <em>res judicata applies, </em>except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but <em>to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, </em>and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>brought forward at the time.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Gursten, </em>p 335.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Whatever the correct scope of the rule, its main purpose is to insure finality in a cause of action. Plaintiff asserts that the cause of action she presently sues upon is different, separate and distinct from that in the prior suit, thereby precluding application of res judicata, and even if this were not the case, her second suit is saved by virtue of the waiver provision of GCR 203.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Because we find this case controlled by GCR 203.1, and because there was no objection as discussed in the last sentence of that rule, we need not decide whether plaintiff\u2019s second suit should have been part of her first suit under Michigan\u2019s rather broad definition of \"cause of action\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or the broad definition of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">GCR 203.1 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">\"A complaint shall state as a claim every claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>either legal or equitable which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject-matter of the action and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. <em>Failure by motion </em>or at the pretrial conference <em>to object to improper </em>joinder of claims or to a <em>failure to join claims </em>required to be joined <em>constitutes a waiver </em>of the required joinder rules <em>and the judgment shall not merge more than the claims actually litigated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The first sentence of the above court rule codifies Michigan\u2019s longstanding decisional rule against splitting a cause of action. That decisional rule is grounded on the same general policy considerations as the doctrine of res judicata and, to the extent the rule encompasses or mitigates res judicata, it must control.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">III. GCR 203.1</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In examining the instant case under GCR 203.1, the matter which must be decided by this Court is the impact, if any, of the waiver provision found in the second sentence of the rule. A Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>peals opinion which previously considered the rule is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In <em>Malesev v Garavaglia, </em>12 Mich App 282; 162 NW2d 844 (1968), Justice Thomas Giles Kavanagh, then Presiding Judge of the Court of Appeals, was faced with a case similar to the instant one. Plaintiffs had initially brought a tort action to recover property damage suffered during defendants\u2019 construction of a drain water intake system pursuant to a contract with the Wayne County Board of Road Commissioners. Defendants were awarded an accelerated judgment based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the three-year statute of limitations governing personal injury or property damage claims. Less than two months later the plaintiffs brought a second, separate action against the same defendants claiming they were third-party beneficiaries under the contract between the road commission and defendants and that defendants had breached that contract. Unlike their initial suit, plaintiffs\u2019 second suit sounding in contract was subject to a six-year rather than three-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Defendants were granted an accelerated judgment in the second suit based on res judicafa, On appeal, then Presiding Judge Kavanagh correctly found the application of res judicata to be erroneous, given the circumstance that plaintiffs had not received an adjudication on the merits of any portion of their claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, in light of GCR 203.1, he found that plaintiffs\u2019 second suit was not barred despite the fact that they should properly have joined a separate claim for breach of contract in conjunction with the original suit. This was so because \"defendant made no objection at that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>for failure to join all actions, consequently nothing bars the bringing of [plaintiffs\u2019] separate action now. (GCR 1963, 203.1)\u201d. <em>Malesev, supra, </em>285. See also <em>Roberts v Duddles, </em>47 Mich App 601, 604; 209 NW2d 720 (1973).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">We find that the rule was interpreted and applied in the only logical manner by then Presiding Judge Kavanagh in <em>Malesev. </em>As quoted above, the language of the rule specifically states that \"failure * * * to object * * * to a failure to join claims required to be joined constitutes a waiver of the required joinder rules\u201d. This language is clear. Its obvious impact is that waiver by the defendant precludes later assertion of the waived defense during a subsequent suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">While at first glance the court rule\u2019s waiver provision may appear to create a vast change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>this area of law, we note that further reflection persuades us otherwise. The defenses of merger and bar have always been waivable by a defendant. The only innovative aspect of the rule\u2019s waiver provision is that a defendant must now assert his or her objection during the first suit when there exists an opportunity for plaintiff to cure the nonjoinder defect. In substance, the harshness of the prior rule is merely mitigated by the new requirement of timely motion. 1 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), Committee Notes, Rule 203, p 472 and Authors\u2019 Comments, pp 474-475 to Rule 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">IV. \"Merger\u201d/\u201dBar\u201d and GCR 203.1</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Justice Ryan\u2019s opinion, in its interpretation of the instant case, would limit the scope of GCR 203.1 to cases falling within the technical limits of \"merger\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the ground that the rule makes specific reference to \"merger\u201d without similar specific reference to \"bar\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Under such an interpretation, if a plaintiff had <em>won </em>a prior suit during which a defendant had failed to object to plaintiff\u2019s nonjoinder, GCR 203.1 would operate to allow the maintenance of a second suit because the defense of \"merger\u201d would have been waived. If a plaintiff had <em>lost </em>the prior suit, as occurred herein, however, under Justice Ryan\u2019s interpretation GCR 203.1 would be inapplicable despite a defendant\u2019s similar failure to object. This inconsistent result would obtain because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>a defendant could waive assertion of the defense of \"merger\u201d but could not waive assertion of the defense of \"bar\u201d under his reading of the rule, although in fact both actions were almost identical. We cannot agree that the rule can be interpreted in this manner for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">First, Justice Ryan\u2019s interpretation would mean that <em>Malesev, </em>which we believe correctly interpreted and applied GCR 203.1, was incorrectly decided. In <em>Malesev, </em>the plaintiff was unsuccessful in his first suit, but then Judge Kavanagh found that plaintiff could maintain a second suit because the waiver provision of GCR 203.1 precluded defendant\u2019s assertion of <em>bar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Second, we note that the concepts of merger and bar are almost identical despite their technical distinction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact the terms \"merger\u201d and \"bar\u201d are often used interchangeably to convey the same meaning. In specific reference to the waiver provision of GCR 203.1, an example of this interchangeability in common usage can be found in Wayne Circuit Judge Horace W. Gilmore\u2019s oft-cited treatise, Michigan Civil Procedure Before Trial. The treatise states in \u00a7 8.103,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\"failure * * * to object to * * * failure to join claims required to be joined, constitutes a waiver of the required joinder, and the judgment does not <em>merge </em>more than the claims actually litigated.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">In the very next section, \u00a7 8.104, the treatise states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">\"[a]s pointed out in the previous section, \u00a78.103, failure to object to the nonjoinder of mandatory claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>means that the action does not <em>bar </em>a subsequent suit on that unjoined claim.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The fact that the terms are frequently not distinguished in common usage is further demonstrated by the fact that this limited interpretation of the waiver provision solely to those cases falling within the technical definition of merger has not arisen in prior Court of Appeals cases examining GCR 203.1.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Third, even if merger is given its technical meaning, we do not find the language discussing merger to control that which precedes it. The second sentence of GCR 203.1 contains two clauses. The first states, \"failure * * * to object * * * constitutes a waiver of the required joinder rules\u201d. This clause unequivocally waives all joinders, whether plaintiff won or lost. So the technical difference between \"merger\u201d and \"bar\u201d does not come into play at all. We hold this clause is absolute and controlling. The second clause states \"* * * and the judgment shall not merge more than the claims actually litigated\u201d. We find the language in the second clause subordinate to the language contained in the first clause and hold that the term \"merge\u201d in the second clause is used in its more general sense. Waiver of the joinder rules necessarily includes waiver of the defense of \"bar\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>This reasoning is substantiated by the Committee Notes discussing the \"harshness\u201d the waiver provision is meant to mitigate: \"[t]he harshness of the present practice as it relates to the enforcement of compulsory joinder provisions * * * is the fact it almost always is enforced after the fact, through the doctrine of merger <em>and res judicata\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Res judicata includes both the doctrines of merger <em>and bar. </em>James, Civil Procedure (Little, Brown &amp; Company, 1965), p 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Further, and perhaps of greatest significance, to apply the GCR 203.1 waiver provision solely to merger and not to bar does not make sense in light of a primary purpose of the waiver provision. That purpose is to encourage a defendant to assert, by motion, an objection to plaintiff\u2019s nonjoinder in the first suit when the defect can be cured.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>At this point it could not be known whether plaintiff would win or lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The introduction of fairness and certainty into this area of litigation is the obvious beneficial impact intended by the rule in requiring assertion in the first suit. For example, if a plaintiff initially fails to join all claims and there is <em>no objection </em>made by defendant to this defect, then all parties are on express notice that plaintiff may later institute suit on matters not actually litigated therein. Conversely, if plaintiff fails to join all claims and defendant <em>does object, </em>all parties know that plaintiff will be precluded from suing again absent an amendment in plaintiff\u2019s complaint joining those additional claims. Hence, as stated in the Committee Notes and Authors\u2019 Comments, the unfairness or harshness of the joinder rule is mitigated by bringing the matter to the fore in the original suit when the nonjoinder defect can be cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Clearly, if the waiver provision were solely applied to cases which, once litigated, come within the technical definition of \"merger\u201d, there could be no certainty until plaintiff\u2019s success was determined; that very certainty sought to be realized by the rule <em>during </em>the original suit would be frustrated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We cannot and do not find that this rule drafted to effectuate fairness and certainty during an original action, can be interpreted to render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the matter uncertain until <em>after </em>finality of the original action.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Finally, the unreasonableness of interpreting the waiver provision as restricted only to cases falling within the technical definition of \"merger\u201d is further supported by the fact that we cannot logically find that the provision was intended to avoid harshness only with respect to the successful plaintiff. If a choice had been undertaken by the rule \u2014 and we do not find that one was \u2014 it would appear to us far more logical to assist the plaintiff suffering most significantly by the harshness of the traditional compulsory joinder requirement, <em>i.e., </em>the plaintiff who has been unsuccessful and therefore recovered nothing from the defendant as a result of the original suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">For the above reasons we cannot conclude that the GCR 203.1 waiver provision applies only to cases falling within the technical scope of merger and therefore only in favor of previously successful plaintiffs. We find the waiver provision to mean what it says \u2014 a defendant who fails to object to a plaintiffs nonjoinder waives the use of the defense in a subsequent suit based on additional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Consistent with the purpose and language of the rule, we find that defendant has waived the right to preclude the instant suit as a result of its failure to make timely objection in the original suit. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for trial on plaintiffs Federal Truth-in-Lending claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Costs to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b690-9\">Levin and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> The Federal statute affords a right to rescind security transactions involving real estate and places an affirmative duty to disclose on the creditor.

Having made that choice, he was under obligation to pursue it [by appeal] or abide by an adverse result\u201d, <em>Gursten, </em>p 335. Despite this, the Court attempted to deal with the inconsistency of the two above statements of the rule by distinguishing three older cases which had employed the narrower doctrine of res judicata <em>(Detroit Trust Co v Furbeck, </em>324 Mich 401; 37 NW2d 151 [1949]; <em>Meister v Dillon, </em>324 Mich 389; 37 NW2d 146 [1949]; <em>MacKenzie v Union Guardian Trust Co, </em>262 Mich 563; 247 NW 914 [1933]).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">The <em>Gursten </em>opinion distinguished the three older cases by finding that the matters raised in the second suits in those cases did not properly belong in the original suits or did not have to be raised at the time of the original suits and went on to find the broader rule preferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\"> See 1 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), Authors\u2019 Comments, Rule 203, p 474, citing the Committee Comments to that Rule 203.1 and 1 Michigan Law &amp; Practice, Action \u00a7\u00a7 22-25, pp 132-140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> GCR 203.1 has no impact on the narrow rule of res judicata, <em>i.e., </em>matters actually litigated.

In other words, it is a compulsory joinder provision for claims arising out of the same transaction. The second sentence containing the waiver provision requires objection to failure to join that which should be joined under the rule, <em>i.e., </em>matters arising out of the <em>same </em>transaction or occurrence. Colonial\u2019s contention is contrary to the very language of the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\"> Technically, merger occurs only when a prior judgment has been rendered in favor of a plaintiff; plaintiff's cause of action is merged if he or she wins. Bar, on the other hand, technically occurs when the plaintiff has been unsuccessful in the prior action; plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is barred if he or she lost.

In September of 1972, Tibolla mortgaged the home to Colonial as security for a loan of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Later that year, Ms. Rogers filed suit against Tibolla and joined Colonial as a party. The final amended complaint in the suit alleged that Ms. Rogers had contracted with Tibolla to repair some fire damage to her home and that the repairs were to be financed under the contract by Ms. Rogers giving a warranty deed to Tibolla in exchange for a land contract under which she would repurchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the premises. The land contract contained a clause stating that Tibolla could mortgage the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Ms. Rogers\u2019 complaint prayed that the deed, land contract and mortgage be set aside on the grounds that the repairs were not made in compliance with the agreement to repair, resulting in a failure of consideration. No wrongful conduct on the part of Colonial was alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In its answer to the suit, Colonial denied being a party to the repair agreement or to any fraudulent conduct and, by way of affirmative defense, asserted that it was without \"any knowledge of any wrongful or fraudulent conduct on the part of defendant\u201d and that it had acted in good faith reliance upon Tibolla\u2019s record title and authority under the land contract to mortgage the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The suit was concluded on January 8, 1975, when Rogers obtained a default judgment against Tibolla and agreed to a dismissal \"with prejudice\u201d as to Colonial. Tibolla thereafter apparently left the jurisdiction, leaving the plaintiffs judgment unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Ms. Rogers filed the instant suit nine days later, alleging that the transaction with Tibolla was subject to the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Tibolla failed to make the disclosures required by that act, and that Rogers had a statutory right to rescind the agreement with him and recover the security. She alleged that Colonial knew that the act applied to the transaction and that the required disclosures were never made and prayed that Colonial\u2019s interest in the premises be declared void.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Colonial moved for accelerated judgment pursuant to the provisions of GCR 1963, 116, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that under the doctrine of res judicata, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>entry of judgment adverse to the plaintiff in the original action was a bar to the second suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court agreed and granted the motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed in a memorandum opinion dated June 22, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Under traditional notions of res judicata, a final valid judgment taken in a case terminates all litigation between the parties on the cause of action sued upon. Where a judgment is rendered 'in favor of the plaintiff the cause of action upon which the judgment is based is said to be <em>merged </em>in the judgment and the plaintiff cannot thereafter maintain another action on the original cause of action. If the judgment is rendered in favor of the defendant on the merits, the original cause of action is <em>barred </em>by the judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Clements v </em>Constantine, 344 Mich 446; 73 NW2d 889 (1955); Restatement Judgments, \u00a7\u00a747, 48, pp 181, 191. The term \"cause of action\u201d has been defined rather broadly in terms of all claims against the defendant arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Application of these rules seeks to protect parties from vexatious litigation and to promote judicial economy by encouraging the settlement of all rights between parties arising out of a single transaction in one suit. <em>Clements v Constantine, supra; </em>1 Honigman and Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), Committee Notes, p 472. A party may not, then, \"split a cause of action\u201d by dividing a single or indivisible cause of action into several claims or demands and bringing several actions thereon. <em>Tuttle v Everhot Heater Co, </em>264 Mich 60; 249 NW 467 (1933); <em>Dutton v Shaw, </em>35 Mich 431 (1877).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The rule against splitting may therefore, through the doctrine of merger, operate to prevent a plaintiff, who has successfully litigated to completion part of a cause of action, from seeking complete recovery by maintaining successive actions on the unlitigated claims. See, <em>e.g., Arnold v Masonic Country Club, </em>268 Mich 430; 256 NW 472 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Analogously, and more fundamentally, rules of res judicata operate to require a party to bring forth all of the grounds and theories available to support the cause of action or be barred from raising them in a subsequent suit. We have repeatedly applied our holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">\" 'The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harrington v Huff &amp; Mitchell Co, </em>155 Mich 139, 142; 118 NW 924 (1908) quoting from <em>Henderson v Henderson, </em>3 Hare 100, 115 (67 Eng Rep 313).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>See, <em>e.g., Gursten v Kenney, </em>375 Mich 330, 335; 134 NW2d 764 (1965); <em>Shank v Castle, </em>357 Mich 290, 295; 98 NW2d 579 (1959); <em>Prawdzik v Heidema Brothers, Inc, </em>352 Mich 102; 89 NW2d 523 (1958). See also Restatement Judgments, \u00a7 63, p 257.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Where, however, a subsequent suit asserts a different cause of action it will not be barred by a prior judgment. <em>Clements v Constantine, supra; Hewett Grocery Co v Biddle Purchasing Co, </em>289 Mich 225; 286 NW 221 (1939); <em>Creek v Laski, </em>248 Mich 425; 227 NW 817 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"ANC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Colonial claims that Ms. Rogers has attempted to split a single cause of action and bring separate suits upon it and that she is barred from doing so by reason of the aforementioned principles of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Ms. Rogers replies that her instant truth-in-lending claim is a cause of action separate and distinct from the claim she first litigated, but that even if it is not, she is permitted to split her claim and bring this second suit by reason of the waiver provision of GCR 1963, 203.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">We conclude that the plaintiff has indeed improperly split a single cause of action and that, in consequence, her instant suit is barred by application of the res judicata rule. We reach that conclusion despite the provisions of GCR 1963, 203.1, because we are persuaded that although Rule 203.1 has modified the traditional res judicata doctrine somewhat, it has not done so in ways determinative of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Prior to instituting her original suit, Ms. Rogers had a single cause of action against Colonial for cancellation of the mortgage lien in question. That cause of action arose out of a single transaction or occasion; her scheme to finance repairs to her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">In her first suit Ms. Rogers alleged no wrongful conduct on Colonial\u2019s part but merely claimed entitlement to a cancellation of the mortgage held by Colonial which she alleged had been \"fraudulently\u201d executed by the then codefendant Tibolla. In response, and by way of affirmative defense, Colonial denied \"any knowledge of any wrongful or fraudulent conduct on the part of defendant Tibolla * * In this, the second suit, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tiff again seeks cancellation of the mortgage, but this time on the theory that Colonial had knowledge of Tibolla\u2019s failure to make certain disclosures under the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act. In so doing she has split her single or indivisible cause of action into two claims by advancing alternate grounds or theories of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The first suit was brought to a conclusion by a dismissal <em>with prejudice </em>pursuant to an agreement of the parties. A dismissal with prejudice operates as an adjudication on the merits and will bar a subsequent action on the same matter. <em>Waddell v </em>Waddell, 335 Mich 498; 56 NW2d 257 (1953); <em>Edgar v Buck, </em>65 Mich 356; 32 NW 644 (1887). A judgment dismissing a suit with prejudice, entered pursuant to an agreement of the parties, is given similar effect for purposes of res judicata. See <em>Shank v Castle, supra; Prawdzik v Heidema Bros, Inc, supra; Smoot v Fox, </em>340 F2d 301 (CA 6, 1964); Anno: <em>Res judicata as affected by fact that former judgment was entered by agreement or consent, </em>2 ALR2d 512. Consequently, since the judgment entered in the original litigation was a final adjudication on the merits, under traditional res judicata principles the instant action would be barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The plaintiff claims, however, that the innovative waiver provision of the. second sentence of GCR 1963, 203.1 modifies the traditional res judicata doctrine in a way which permits her to maintain her second suit. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\"Claims. A complaint shall state as a claim every claim either legal or equitable which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject-matter of the action and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Failure by motion or at the pretrial conference to object to improper joinder of claims or to a failure to join claims required to be joined constitutes a waiver of the required joinder rules and the <em>judgment shall not merge more than the claims actually litigated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">According to plaintiff, Colonial\u2019s failure \"by motion or at the pretrial conference to object * * * to a failure to join [the truth-in-lending claim] * * * constitutes a waiver of the required joinder\u201d and, in effect, permitted her to split her cause of action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Prior to the adoption of Rule 203.1, the rule was unqualified that a party may not split a cause of action by dividing a single or indivisible cause of action into several claims or demands and bring several actions thereon. <em>Tuttle v Everhot Heater Co, supra; Dutton v Shaw, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The language of GCR 203.1 indicates a purpose that certain claims that might otherwise be concluded by a judgment will not become extinguished by a final adjudication in the absence of an opposing party\u2019s objection in the former suit. That is accomplished by the provisions of the second sentence of the rule, particularly the so-called waiver provision. The rule is a unique one and application of it is a question of first impression in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The drafting Committee Notes to Rule 203.1 indicate the extent to which the waiver provision of the second sentence of the rule was intended to apply. Its narrow purpose, according to its authors, is to alleviate the harshness of the \"merger\u201d doctrine. The Committee Notes recite in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\"The harshness of the present practice as it relates to the enforcement of compulsory joinder provisions (this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>is sometimes referred to as the rule against splitting causes of actions) is the fact that it almost always is enforced after the fact, through the doctrine of <em>merger.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\"In other words, the scope of the action that will be <em>merged </em>will be determined in the first litigation when it can be corrected rather than in the second litigation when it cannot be corrected.\u201d 1 Honigman and Hawkins, <em>supra, </em>Committee Notes, Rule 203, pp 472-473. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">A careful reading of the rule, together with the Committee Notes, indicates an intention by the -drafters to preclude in certain cases the <em>merger </em>into a prior judgment of claims not actually litigated in the case although arising out of the same cause of action. It is <em>merger </em>which is precluded by the waiver provision of the rule, not <em>bar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">But the merger doctrine is inapplicable to the case before \u00fcs. There can be no merger of a subsequent claim into a prior judgment unless the claimant prevailed in the prior case and obtained a judgment into which the cause of action can merge. Merger is the label traditionally assigned to describe the result which obtains when a claimant, usually but not always a plaintiff, splits a cause of action and prevails in the first suit. Bar is the label traditionally assigned to the situation in which a claimant who has split a cause of action and suffered an adverse judgment in the first suit is foreclosed from bringing a subsequent suit upon the same cause of action for the remainder of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">We agree that Ms. Roger\u2019s truth-in-lending claim did not merge into the judgment entered in the first case, not because of the waiver provisions of Rule 203.1 but because, although she indeed split her cause of action, she did not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Instead, in the language of the traditional res judicata doctrine, Ms. Rogers\u2019 subsequent suit seeking recovery on alternate grounds is <em>barred </em>by the prior determination on the merits in <em>Colonial\u2019s favor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We are convinced that the drafters of Rule 203.1 chose to use the merger language of the traditional res judicata doctrine for a particular reason. The language of the rule does not refer to bar and we are hesitant to conclude that the drafters sought to work a sweeping change of that doctrine without even alluding to it. On. the contrary, we are convinced that the drafters sought to provide relief from harshness in a narrow category of cases and did not intend to create a situation in which claimants who suffer an adverse judgment on those claims first advanced can hold back alternate grounds and theories for later use and then proceed upon them if another theory has failed. If that was permitted in the case before us, and Ms. Rogers were allowed to proceed upon her instant claim and lose, she could sue Colonial still again, alleging knowledge of lack of delivery of the deed, or incompetency, or some other theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In summary, an unsuccessful party may not bring a series of successive suits raising claims arising out of a single transaction or occurrence by each time alleging some variation in the facts and corresponding legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">While the waiver provisions of Rule 203.1 affords the successful claimant some relief from the harsh effects of the merger doctrine, an unsuccessful party, such as Ms. Rogers, who has litigated a portion of her cause of action to a final adjudication, will continue to have further claims arising out of the same cause of action <em>barred </em>by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>We would affirm, with no costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-5\">Coleman, C.J., and Fitzgerald, J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"APD\">October 18, 1979</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">On order of the Court, a stipulation signed by the attorneys for the parties agreeing to dismissal of this appeal is considered.
