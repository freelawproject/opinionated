Bush, individually and as next friend, commenced this action against Oscoda Area Schools, its superintendent, the principal and the classroom teacher. The circuit judge granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed as to the school district and the superintendent and reversed as to the principal and teacher.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We conclude that the complaint states claims as to all defendants, and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Foxworth attended Oscoda High School and was enrolled in Introductory Physical Science. The class had been conducted in the chemistry laboratory, but due to increased enrollment was rescheduled to meet in a non-laboratory room. The chemistry laboratory was equipped with a safety shower, ventilation or exhaust hoods, sinks, enclosed storage areas, stationary laboratory desks and water and gas outlets. The substitute room was not so equipped.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">The classroom teacher had complained to the school principal about the substitute room: She said<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \"[y]ou cannot keep sending us this many students and expect us to do lab work in rooms this size where the tables move too easily. It\u2019s just too crowded\u201d. \"When you throw more students in that classroom * * * [y]ou have more hands to get into things, more bodies in the small amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>space, more confusion at times. People sometimes bump into each other. You tend to have more clumsiness occurring and it\u2019s just too hard to manage too many students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Introductory Physical Science is the first science course offered the high school students. The course experiments are relatively simple. During the first six to ten weeks the experiments concentrate on measuring. At about the eighth to tenth week the experiments require heat, and burners are used in two experiments. In the chemistry laboratory the students use gas-fired burners which are connected to a permanent installation for the gas supply. In the substitute room portable alcohol burners were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The alcohol was stored in the chemistry lab. A practice developed of pouring the alcohol into a plastic jug for transport to the substitute classroom. Before school the classroom teacher poured enough alcohol into the jug for the day\u2019s classes. The alcohol jug and burners were put on the rear counter. The jug had an open top. Students filled their burners at the counter and took them to their desks. The classroom teacher lit the burners at the desks. Goggles were worn during the experiment. After the experiment the students were to extinguish the burners and return them to the counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">At the time of the accident Foxworth was returning her burner and noticed a lighted burner on the counter. She picked it up and as she attempted to extinguish it an explosion occurred and she caught fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Foxworth panicked. Another teacher came into the room. The fire extinguisher, which was kept at the opposite end of the room, was given to the classroom teacher and she put out the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Foxworth suffered second- and third-degree burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the school district is not immune from suit because:</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">i) the governmental tort liability act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is unconstitutional, or, alternatively,</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">ii) the operation of a school is not a \"governmental function\u201d within the meaning of that act, and, in any event,</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">iii) it is liable under the defective building provision<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the act because the classroom lacked necessary safety equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">Three Justices have indicated in other opinions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that a school district is subject to liability for negligence<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in the operation of a school and would therefore find it unnecessary to decide whether the complaint states a claim within the defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>building provision. Because there is no majority to so hold, we must determine whether the complaint states a claim within the defective building provision. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The defective building provision, in relevant part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">\u201cGovernmental agencies have the obligation to repair and maintain public buildings under their control when open for use by members of the public. Governmental agencies are liable for bodily injury and property damage resulting from a dangerous or defective condition of a public building.\u201d MCL 691.1406; MSA 3.996(106).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The school district contends that the provision \"impose[s] liability only for those injuries resulting from defective conditions in public buildings <em>caused </em>by inadequate or negligent repairs or maintenance [emphasis in original]\u201d. The duty is only to \"repair and maintain\u201d, and unless that duty is breached there can be no liability. Plaintiffs have not alleged a failure to \"repair or maintain\u201d the building and have therefore failed to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">In an analogous situation involving defective highways, this Court has rejected similar arguments. Statutes imposed a duty to keep highways \"in reasonable repair\u201d and \"reasonably safe and fit [or 'convenient\u2019] for travel\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It was unsuccessfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>argued that \"reasonable repair\u201d qualifies and limits \"reasonably safe and fit [convenient] for travel\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In <em>Joslyn v Detroit, </em>74 Mich 458, 459, 460; 42 NW 50 (1889), the city claimed that it was not liable \"because the injury did not result from a want of repair of the street\u201d,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in <em>Finch v Village of Bangor, </em>133 Mich 149, 150; 94 NW 738 (1903), the village argued that it was not liable because \"want of repair was not the immediate cause of the injury\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court construed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>statutes as imposing a duty to keep the highway both in \"good repair\u201d and in a condition \"reasonably safe and fit for travel\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In <em>Malloy v Walker Twp, </em>77 Mich 448, 458; 43 NW 1012 (1889), the plaintiff did not claim any failure to repair, but asserted that the township had been negligent in not providing barriers or railings along the side of an embankment. The township asserted that liability could not be imposed \"on account of a plan or scheme of construction of a road\u201d. This Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\"A municipality cannot construct a dangerous and unsafe road, \u2014 one not safe and convenient for public travel, \u2014 and shield itself behind its legislative power to adopt a plan and method of building and constructing in accordance therewith.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 462.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The defective building provision is structurally similar to the defective highway provisions. It states a duty, \"repair and maintain\u201d, and in providing a cause of action extends it to \"a dangerous or defective condition of a building\u201d. We construe the defective building provision as we have the defective highway provision. Governmental agencies are subject to liability for a dangerous or defective condition of a public building without regard to whether it arises out of a failure to repair and maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">As in the highway cases, a building may be dangerous or defective because of improper design, faulty construction or the absence of safety devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Plaintiff has alleged that the improper design of the classroom and absence of safety devices ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>dered it unsafe as a science classroom, and the classroom was therefore dangerous and defective and a cause of Foxworth\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Two judges of the Court of Appeals said that \"as to particular uses or activities for which a public building, or a part thereof, is specifically assigned, failure to provide the usual building components and safety devices appropriate to such contemplated use would be actionable under the statute\u201d,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but affirmed the summary judgment because \"the complaint alleges a course of classroom conduct which would be dangerous even in a properly equipped laboratory\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The third judge agreed with affirmance because Foxworth\u2019s \"injury did not result from a defective condition of the building but from the use to which the classroom was put\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">We agree with the majority of the Court of Appeals that the question whether a part of a building, in this case a classroom, is dangerous or defective is to be determined in light of the \"uses or activities\u201d for which it is \"specifically assigned\u201d, in this case a physical science class. As stated in <em>Pichette v Manistique Public Schools, </em>403 Mich 268, 285; 269 NW2d 143 (1978) (Fitzgerald, J.), \"in providing for the three exceptions to the general grant of immunity contained in MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107), the Legislature intended to protect the general public from injury by imposing upon governmental agencies the duty to maintain <em>safe public places, </em>whether such places are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>public highways or public buildings.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">To be sure, the lack of certain safety devices did not render the classroom defective per se; it is ordinarily unnecessary to install laboratory safety equipment in classrooms. In determining whether a place is safe, one must consider the use or purpose it serves. A building may be safe for one use or purpose, but not for another. A school is not a school because it is called one, but because it is used and functions as one. If a hospital is converted into a prison, the building must be maintained as a safe prison, not as a safe hospital. The room in which Foxworth was injured had by use become a physical science room, and therefore had to meet the standards of a physical science room although it had once been a mathematics room.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The trier of fact must determine whether the room was defective when used as a physical science classroom and, if so, whether the defect was a cause of Foxworth\u2019s injuries. Conceding that the alleged \"course of classroom conduct * * * would be dangerous even in a properly equipped laboratory\u201d, it is yet possible that if the room were properly equipped the accident would not have occurred or the injuries would have been less severe. The question of the significance of the defect in relation to the alleged injuries is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The school district claimed that increased enrollment necessitated conducting physical science classes in non-laboratory rooms. We recognize that circumstances change and temporary accommodation must be made so that business may continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>while adjustments are being made. In such situations it might be reasonable to change temporarily the use of a building or room or in the case of a highway, reroute traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">A governmental agency is not subject to liability for a dangerous or defective condition unless it \"had actual or constructive knowledge of the defect and, for a reasonable time after acquiring knowledge, failed to remedy the condition or to take action reasonably necessary to protect the public against the condition\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It was thus a question of fact whether the school district, with knowledge of the defect, failed \"to take action reasonably necessary to protect\u201d the students. Temporary use of the unconverted room may have been reasonable provided the school district took appropriate action to protect the students until permanent protective measures could be provided.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The complaint against the individual defendants was dismissed on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, GCR 1963, 117.2(1). The complaint did state claims against the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">We reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b797-10\">Kavanagh and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\"> The motion was brought under GCR 1963, 117.2(1), failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The parties stipulated that the judge could consider depositions in deciding the motion. The depositions are a part of the record on appeal and are the basis of the facts related in Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">We do not wish to be understood as indicating that even upon stipulation of the parties a judge may decide disputed factual questions in resolving whether a complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted. We view the stipulation as permitting consideration of undisputed testimony as an expansion and particularization of allegations of plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-12\"><em> Bush v Oscoda Area Schools, </em>72 Mich App 670, 676; 250 NW2d 759 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b789-13\"> See fn 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\"><em> </em>MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b791-11\"> MCL 691.1406; MSA 3.996(106).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b791-12\"> I would hold on equal protection grounds that a school district is subject to the same liability as a private school.

In so construing the building provision, the majority holds that a public building, or more specifically a school classroom, must be made safe for its then assigned use. Accordingly, the determination of whether a public building or classroom is free from dangerous or defective conditions must be made in light of the particular features, safety devices or equipment germane to the activity which the building or classroom houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Although I find the majority approach appealing as a substantive rule of law, I am compelled to dissent because such a construction of the \"building\u201d exception does not at all square with the manifest intent of the Legislature<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as expressed in the governmental immunity statute, MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">In MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107), the Legislature undertook to balance the interests of the people of the State of Michigan against the interests of persons injured by the tortious acts of state agencies or their employees, in the light of its sweeping policy judgment that state agencies must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>be free to engage in various endeavors for the common good of all of the people of the State of Michigan, unhampered by the constraint of potential tort liability. In service to the balancing process the Legislature carved out a few exceptions to its grant of governmental immunity, one of which is at issue today.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">When construing an exception to a general rule, care must be taken not to derogate from the general rule to the extent that its intent and purpose is undermined. See <em>Grand Rapids Motor Coach Co v Public Service Commission, 323 </em>Mich 624, 634; 36 NW2d 299 (1949). Today\u2019s majority construes and applies the \"building\u201d exception in a way which significantly undermines the intent of the general immunity provision by characterizing as a building defect what is actually the behavior of the school district\u2019s employees in utilizing a portion of the school building for a unique and highly specialized and always dangerous purpose, one for which it was not designed, constructed or intended to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Simple logic compels the conclusion that a building or classroom is to be used in accordance with the purpose for which it was designed and constructed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that while the failure to do that may amount to negligence on the part of the user, it surely does not constitute the building defective. In this case all of the parties agree that the classroom in question was designed and constructed for use as a mathematics classroom. The \"defect\u201d, which the majority finds, is in the absence in a mathematics classroom of features or equipment peculiar to a laboratory or science classroom such as a safety shower, ventilation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>exhaust hoods, sinks, enclosed storage areas, stationary laboratory desks and water and gas utilities. Common sense suggests that before one can conclude that a building is defective, it must first be ascertained whether the use to which it was put was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">It is eminently clear from an examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that the essence of plaintiffs\u2019 claim relates to the allegedly improper <em>use </em>of the classroom as a physical science laboratory despite the fact that it was neither designed nor equipped for laboratory experiments. As such, the alleged tortious conduct does not relate to a dangerous or defective condition in the building but, rather, to the conduct of the school authorities in utilizing as a science laboratory a room which was properly designed, constructed and equipped for teaching mathematics.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In concluding today that the test for determining whether a public building is \"defective\u201d and the agency operating it liable for failure to \"maintain and repair\u201d it, is whether it is safe in view of the <em>use </em>to which it is put, the Court does substantial violence to the will of the Legislature as the price of its not so thinly disguised disagreement with the doctrine of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">I would affirm the order of the trial court granting the motion for summary judgment for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<judges id=\"b804-8\">Coleman, C.J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-10\"> \"Except as in this act otherwise provided, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>governmental function.
