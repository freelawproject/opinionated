Polymero and Another (decided herewith), 90 N. Y. Supp. 920, and it is unnecessary to repeat them. From these facts it appears that, by reason of the inadvertence of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, New York county was named in the complaint, instead of Orange county, but that both parties recognized it was a mistake, and was not intended to change the place of trial, because all of the proceedings were subsequently taken in Orange county, or in the Second Judicial District, and therefore the place of trial was not changed. This being so, we think there was no necessity for amending the complaint, and a sufficient reason was not shown for a reargument of the preceding motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">The appeal from the order denying the motion to reargue is dismissed, and the order, so far as it denied the motion to correct the complaint, is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
