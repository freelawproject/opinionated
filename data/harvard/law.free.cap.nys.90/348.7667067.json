The bruises were not shown to be due to the accident, and the veterinary surgeon called for plaintiff testified that the injuries would not have probably endured in such a way as to cause the condition testified to by the purchaser of the animal. <em>Held </em>error not to strike out the purchaser\u2019s testimony.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Eleventh District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">Action by Charles E.

Over the defendant\u2019s objection that the testimony was not connected with the accident in suit, this witness gave evidence as to the condition of the horse at the time of the purchase by him, and testified to certain bruises which lessened the animal\u2019s value, in his opinion, and which, as a matter of fact, had not been shown at the time when the evidence was offered to have been due to the accident, which happened some three months before. The plaintiff, at the time when this evidence was offered, promised to connect it, and it may be that it was properly within the court\u2019s discretion to receive the proof at that time, subject to a motion to strike out; but thereafter the injuries were not shown to have been due to the accident, and the veterinary surgeon called for the plaintiff testified, in effect, that the injuries then occasioned would not have probably endured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>in such a way as to cause the condition testified to by the purchaser of the animal. With the record in this condition, defendant moved to strike out the evidence as to the condition of the horse in August, and the exception taken to the court\u2019s denial of that motion clearly presents-prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the* event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
