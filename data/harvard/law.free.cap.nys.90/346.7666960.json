The amended answer sets up, first, a general denial; second, justification, as a complete defense; third, mitigation, as a partial defense. Plaintiff demurred to the separate defense set forth by way of justification. The demurrer was overruled by the court below upon the theory that the matters alleged in justification and mitigation, taken together, constituted but one defense, and that as the said matters were sufficient, in law, in mitigation of damages, the demurrer was untenable. This would have been correct, under the decision of Doyle v. Fritz, 86 App. Div. 515, 83 N. Y. Supp. 762, if the new matter had been pleaded in a single count, both by way of justification and in mitigation. But such is not the case here. The statement in the case at bar, following the general denial, is as follows: \u201cAnd for a first, separate, and distinct defense to the complaint herein, and by way of justification thereto.\u201d Then follows the new matter, in which- nothing is said about mitigation of damages. Finally, in a separate paragraph, viz., paragraph 5, the following is set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-17\">\u201cThat, In mitigation of any damage's to which plaintiff might otherwise appear to be entitled by reason of the alleged slanderous words set forth in the complaint, this defendant repeats and renews, all and singular, the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>stated under the separate defense hereinbefore set forth, and will give evidence thereof as a partial -defense in mitigation, as well as in justification, upon the trial of this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">It thus appears that, however faulty the pleading of the defendant may be in substance, it followed the Code in alleging separately, first, justification, as a complete defense, and then mitigation, as a partial defense. That being so, the plaintiff had a right to test on demurrer the sufficiency of the plea of justification as a complete defense, apart from the partial defense in mitigation. Upon the application of the proper test for that purpose, namely, whether the justification pleaded is as broad as the charge, there being no question of privilege, its utter insufficien'cy in law is at once so apparent that no discussion of it here is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs, and judgment ordered for plaintiff upon the demurrer, with costs, with leave to defendant to amend upon payment of said cost's.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
