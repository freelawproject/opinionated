In this controversy he was, whatever its cause, in no way concerned. No duty of interference devolved upon him, and no one called on him to interfere. Nevertheless he voluntarily assumed to take sides. The persons who had the original trouble with the porter were not infants. Neither were they acquaintances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>or friends of the plaintiff. They appear to have been abundantly able to take care of themselves. The action was brought upon defendant\u2019s contract to transport in safety plaintiff to his destination. To render a common carrier liable for the act of a servant, according to the weight of authority, it must be shown that the act complained of was done in the discharge of the servant\u2019s duty to his employer, which related to the passenger. Burns v. Glen Falls R. R., 4 App. Div, 426, 38 N. Y. Supp. 856. The plaintiff\u2019s own story is far from satisfying these requirements, and the facts and circumstances as shown by the entire evidence closely resemble the situation reviewed by the Court of Appeals in Mulligan v. N. Y. &amp; R. B. R. Co., 129 N. Y. 506, 29 N. E. 952, 14 L. R. A. 791, 26 Am. St. Rep. 539. As was stated in Scoll v. Central Park R. R., 53 Hun, 415, 6 N. Y. Supp. 383:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">. \u201cIt has not as yet been \"held that where a passenger, by his own misbehavior while being transported, has provoked a personal encounter between himself and one of the employ\u00e9s of the carrier, the carrier is liable for the results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
