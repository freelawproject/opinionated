The driver was engaged in the business of carting ice for the plaintiff and his customers and others, and it did not appear that plaintiff did or was authorized to exercise any control over the wagon. <em>Held, </em>that the driver was not a servant of plaintiff, and hence the negligence of the driver could not be imputed to plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">Appeal from City Court of New York, Trial Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-11\">Action by Lorenzo Scarangello, by Francisco Scarang.ello, his guardian ad litem, against the Interurban Street Railway Company.

This was tacitly conceded by the defendant\u2019s counsel when the case was suffered to' go to the jury without objection at the close of the whole case. McGrath v. Home Ins. Co., 88 App. Div. 153, 156, 84 N. Y. Supp. 374, and other cases cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel, do not hold that such a concession does not arise from the failure to move for a nonsuit. The cases are to the effect only that the Appellate Division is not precluded from a review of the evidence by the absence of an exception to the trial court\u2019s refusal to direct a nonsuit, as is the rule in cases of appeals to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">The plaintiff was riding gratuitously upon the wagon at the time of the collision, by the invitation of the driver, who was also its owner. The driver was engaged in the business of carting ice for the plaintiff and his customers and others. But it does not appear that the plaintiff did or was authorized to exercise any con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>trol whatsoever over the wagon. In no sense, therefore, can the driver be said to have been the servant of the plaintiff, whose negligence would have been imputable to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We find no error in the trial court\u2019s rulings, and the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"11\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b456-17\"> 2. gee Negligence, vol. 37, Gent. Dig. \u00a7 147.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
