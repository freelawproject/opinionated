The charge of the justice did not bring out the rule that contributory negligence, however slight, would defeat the recovery, and counsel for the defendant, therefore, requested the instruction that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-15\">\u201cIf the jury find that the plaintiff was guilty of the least bit of negligence contributing to the accident, their verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-16\">The justice refused so to charge, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-17\">\u201cNot the least bit of negligence. I think I have covered that in my charge. * s * If you find both the plaintiff and defendant\u2019s motorman were negligent, the defendant is then entitled to your verdict. On the question of degree of negligence I will let the jury say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-18\">This withdrew the legal proposition that any contributory negligence whatever, however slight, would preclude a recovery, assuming that the proposition was generally involved in the charge that the negligence of both parties would call for a verdict for the defendant, and the jury may well have understood that the plaintiff, although slightly negligent, could still have the verdict which they rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-19\">Upon the close question presented, the submission of the case with this form of instruction was clearly prejudicial, and the exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>taken call for a new trial. There is no question that the defendant was entitled to an instruction such as was requested (Reynolds v. R. R. Co., 8 Mise. Rep. 313, 28 N. Y. Supp. 734), and, for the error noted, the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
