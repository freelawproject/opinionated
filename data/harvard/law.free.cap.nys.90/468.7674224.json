Its authority rests upon section 2284, Code Civ. Proc., by which two \u25a0methods are provided for compensating an aggrieved party: First, if an actual loss or injury has been produced, by a fine sufficient to indemnify t'he aggrieved party, \u201cto be collected and paid over to such aggrieved party\u201d; and second, \u201cwhere it is not shown that such an actual loss or injury has been produced, a fine must be imposed, not exceeding the amount of the complainant\u2019s costs and expenses, and two hundred and fifty dollars in addition thereto, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and must be collected and paid in like manner.\u201d Socialistic Co-operative Publishing Association v. Kuhn, 164 N. Y. 473, 58 N. E. 649, is directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The order sufficiently describes the conduct constituting the contempt; its language being, \"for.willfully disobeying the order requiring him to appear on June 14, 1904, for examination.\u201d It is urged that these words are merely descriptive of the order, and do not sufficiently set forth the act or omission of which appellant was adjudged guilty, but this criticism is highly technical. The words \u201crequiring him to appear for examination\u201d are amply sufficient to apprise him that his disobedience consisted in not appearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
