' .</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">Upon the conclusion of the court\u2019s charge to the jury the plaintiff made the following request, which was charged, the defendant duly excepting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-18\">\u201cIf the motorman of defendant\u2019s car started the same with a sudden jerk before the plaintiff was safely on board, and while he was attempting to board the same, and plaintiff was injured thereby, the verdict will be for the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">The error in this charge consists in taking from the jury the questions of negligence and contributory negligence. Where testimony is given, it is the province of the jury to draw dhe inferences; and, unless it can be held, on the testimony adduced, that the negligence of the defendant and the absence of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff are established as matter of law, it is error for the court to intrench upon the right of the jury to determine these questions. It is not contended that the evidence here established, as matter of law, the negligence of the defendant; that being clearly a question of fact for the jury. Nor, as a matter of law, did it appear that the plaintiff was free from contributory negligence. The court, in the charge objected to, however, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>structed the jury that if the motorman started the car with a sudden, jerk while plaintiff was boarding it, and the plaintiff was thereby injured, \u201cthe verdict will be for the plaintiff.\u201d This virtually was concluding that evidence to that effect established, as matter of law, negligence on the part of the defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence. The law is firmly settled that contributory negligence prevents recovery, and that, upon conflicting inferences, it is a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Upon the other branch of the case the court, in effect, characterized the conduct of the motorman as testified to by the witnesses as negligent. In the recent decision \u00f3f this court in Fiori v. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co. (October term), 90 N. Y. Supp. 521, such a charge was held to be ground for reversal, and therein the authorities are cited and discussed. Although the objectionable charge in that case went further, and referred to the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses as having testified to the acts which were characterized as negligent, it was the characterization that constituted the vice in the charge, since it removed from the jury the right to say whether the acts testified to were or were not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">We think, therefore, that the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, \u2019\"&gt;th costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<footnote label=\"V\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b923-20\"> 1.
