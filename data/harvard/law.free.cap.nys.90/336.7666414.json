The charge simply directed them, if they believed the version of the occurrence given by the plaintiff, to find in his favor, but, if they disbelieved this, and believed the evidence of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, that then their verdict should be for the defendant. Nothing was said as to the essential facts to be established conceding the truth of the testimony, before the defendant could be held liable. For these and the further reason that the court charged that defendant\u2019s conductor was not corroborated, this recovery cannot be permitted to stand. There was evidence tending to corroborate some of the details of the conductor\u2019s story, and whether there was corroboration or not was a subject which should have been submitted to the jury</p>\n<p id=\"b362-18\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
