The verdict was $2,000. There was ample testimony in behalf of the defendant, especialfy as to admissio\u00f1s made by the plaintiff immediately after the accident, which, if believed by the jury, would have required them to find the other way; but the alleged admissions were denied by the plaintiff, and were not heard by several of the defendant\u2019s witnesses who were present when they are said to have been made. The jury manifestly disbelieved the testimony as to these admissions, or else thought they were made under such conditions of suffering and excitement on the part of the plaintiff as not to be the best evidence of the actual circumstances under which the accident occurred. On the whole, I do not think that their verdict can fairly be condemned as being against the evidence or weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-18\">There is nothing in the point that the award of damages is excessive. The neck of the femur was fractured. The leg is permanently shortened a quarter of an inch. The plaintiff has never walked naturally since the injury. He was in the hospital seven weeks, six of which were spent in bed; and he suffered much pain then, and has suffered much since. It can hardly be held that-'$2,000, which includes $205 of actual expenditures, is extravagant compensation for such an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The only exception relating to evidence is to the exclusion of a question as to whether the car slowed up before a regular stopping place \u201cbecause there was a factory there at the corner.\u201d The inquiry called for a. conclusion, and the fact was wholly immaterial. Therefore the objection was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">I find nothing to criticise in the result reached below, except the award of $100 as an extra allowance. This cannot be upheld, under the decision of the Court of Appeals in the case of Standard Trust Co. v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 178 N. Y. 407, 70 N. E. 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The judgment should be modified by striking out this amount, and, as thus modified, the judgment, as well as the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"f\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b600-19\"> 1. See Damages, vol. 15, Cent. Dig. \u00a7\u00a7 372, 373, 377, 378.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
