Day, 135 N. Y. 469, 32 N. E. 238, constrains us to reverse the order appealed from in so far as it refuses a retaxation of the $500 allowed to the referee in this case. According to the brief for the respondent the referee spent 19 days in the business of the reference.' He thus became entitled to receive $190 under the provisions of section 3296 of the Code of Civil Procedure, unless a higher rate of compensation was provided for by a stipulation made pursuant to that section. The stipulation relied upon as authorizing the allowance of $500 is the following entry, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>was made upon the stenographer\u2019s minutes upon the opening of the trial of the action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\u201cIt is stipulated that the referee shall not be confined to the statutory compensation, but may charge and be paid a reasonable compensation for the services performed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The stipulation in the case of Griggs v. Day,, supra, was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201cThat the referee shall not be limited to the statutory fee of six dollars per day for his services in this case, but may charge such fees therefor as he deems proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The Court of Appeals held that the language quoted omitted to fix the rate of compensation as required by section 3296 of the present Code, and was, therefore, ineffectual to change the statutory rate, which was then $6 a day, but has since been raised to $10. The objection on this ground to the enforcement of the stipulation was declared to be purely technical, Judge Gray saying that the promptings of a moral and an honorable sense should have impelled the defendants to abide by their agreement. Nevertheless the court unanimously refused to give effect to the stipulation, on the ground that to do so would be to run counter to the previous decision in the case of the First National Bank v. Tamajo, 77 N. Y. 476, inasmuch as stability of decision, as a rule in the administration of justice, should not be abandoned on account of an occasional instance of hardship in the application of an established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">In view of this determination upon a precisely similar question to that involved here by the court of last resort, we have no option except to reverse the order and direct a new taxation of the referee\u2019s fees at the rate prescribed in section 3296 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and new taxation of referee\u2019s fees directed before the clerk. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"H1\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b736-20\">. See Reference, vol. 42, Cent. Dig. \u00a7 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
