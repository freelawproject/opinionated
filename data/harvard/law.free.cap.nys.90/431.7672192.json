Upon this testimony he was permitted to read the items of his bill of particulars as proof of the delivery of the bread sued for. Objection was taken to the admission of the evidence, on the ground that the proper foundation had not been laid. Since the deliveries were not made by the plaintiff personally to their entire extent, the items taken from this book, which book was in turn based upon reports made by his workman, were simply hearsay evidence to some indeterminable extent, and it was obviously improper to submit this evidence to the jury. At the time when the objection was taken, it appeared from the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that the deliveries were not made wholly by himself, but were made in part by his workman, and the latter was not then called as a witness, nor at any time during the trial; hence there was no support for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>reading of these items in evidence, and we cannot assume that no prejudice resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The judgment must therefore be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
