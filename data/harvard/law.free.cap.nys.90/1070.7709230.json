J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_Qp\">In an action to recover damages for personal injuries to plaintiff under the allegations of his complaint that he \u201cwas and is still prevented from attending to his vocation, and will for a long time be unable to attend to his vocation properly, as he is informed and verily believes, and was confined to his home for upwards of three weeks,\u201d he was permitted to testify to loss of profits from his business. This testimony was duly objected and excepted to. Evidence of this kind is admissible only where the earnings proceed entirely from the plaintiff\u2019s labor. But in the present case it appeared from plaintiff\u2019s own testimony that the profits of his business did not entirely depend upon his\u2019 own personal services, but involved the use of his store,, an expensive truck, and a daily capital of $135 to $150, in addition to the labor of two hired men, one of whom he called his \u201cassociate in business.\u201d The admission of this evidence constituted reversible error under the authorities. Johnson v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 52 Hun, 111, 4 N. Y. Supp. 848; Blate v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 29 App. Div. 388, 51 N. Y. Supp. 590; Masterson v. Village of Mt..

Supp. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
