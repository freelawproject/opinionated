Force is given to this claim by the fact that, although the return herein, signed by the clerk of the lower court, contains this statement, \u201cAnnexed hereto is the notice of appeal served upon me; also undertalcing on appeal, notice of settlement, and consent settling stenographer\u2019s minutes,\u201d no notice of settlement or consent settling stenographer\u2019s minutes is attached thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The record is therefore returned to the files of this court to allow the appellant to make a motion, if so desired, that the record be returned to the lower court for settlement of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
