The fallacy of this argument lies in the assumption that the plaintiff, when he placed his right hand upon the door jamb, was facing the interior of the car, for the evidence does not show this to be the fact. True, the plaintiff testified that he boarded the rear platform and started to enter the car, but he does not say that when he placed his right hand upon the door jamb he was facing forward, and the inference which is to be drawn from the testimony of the witness Abraham Stein is that the plaintiff, after talking to the conductor, was pushed-backward by the latter, and steadied himself with his wrist upon the left-hand jamb of the car, his right hand being placed against the jamb, palm outward, the injury having been occasioned to the palm of the hand. Under .these circumstances, the happening of the accident as the plaintiff claims is not in the slightest degree inconsistent with the fact of the structural condition of the car, and a finding \"that the injury was occasioned by the defendant\u2019s negligence, without contributory negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part, is obviously supported by the evidence that, while the plaintiff was thus steadying himself with .his hand upon the door jamb, the conductor violently slammed the door upon him or against his hand, when the risk of causing an injury to the passenger by such a course was plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
