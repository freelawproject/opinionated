See, too, Dumar v. Witherbee, Sherman &amp; Co., 88 App. Div. 181, 183, 84 N. Y. Supp. 669; Tilton v. Beecher, 59 N. Y. 176, 183, 17 Am. Rep. 337. The criticism of the learned counsel for the respondent is that the pleader may intend to charge either forgery or fraud or undue influence. The order, in effect, directs an election between them. But I think that the forgery may be regarded as a species of fraud. In People v. Marion, 29 Mich. 31, Campbell, J., says: \u201cThe principal criminal element in forgery consists in the fraudulent purpose, and the proof of fraud must be substantially the same in criminal and civil cases.\u201d See, too, Commonwealth v. Starr, 4 Allen, 301, 304. Undue influence is also recognized as a species of fraud. Green v. Roworth, 113 N. Y. 462, 470, 21 N. E. 165; Matter of Will of Smith, 95 N. Y. 516. I think that the precise meaning or application of the allegations is definite and certain, namely, that the defendant, by fraud, procured conveyances of realty from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
