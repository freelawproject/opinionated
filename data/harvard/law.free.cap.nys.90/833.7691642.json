The learned counsel for the relator does not discuss the evidence, beyond characterizing it as very weak and indefinite, but relies upon the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>proposition that the commissioner was without power to impose such punishment. We think that he clearly had the power, under section 288 of the Greater New York charter (Laws 1901, p. 122, c. 466), which, in part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">\u201cRoundsmen shall be selected from' among patrolmen of the first grade, but roundsmen may be reduced to the grade of patrolmen at any time by the police commissioner after due trial upon charges, the determination of which may be reviewed by writ of certiorari.\u201d <em>\u2022,</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">We also think that the evidence was sufficient to.sustain the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The determination should be confirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
