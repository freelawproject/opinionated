In the absence of such a certificate or statement, this court will not inquire whether the verdict is contrary to the evidence or against the weight of evidence. See Empire Trust Co. v.

Moreover, the case was submitted to the jury under a charge to which no exception was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-20\">The judgment and order should 'be affirmed, with costs.
