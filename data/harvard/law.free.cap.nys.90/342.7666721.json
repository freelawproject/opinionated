The cause was submitted to a jury upon the evidence produced by the plaintiff, no evidence having been offered for the defendant, and the justice set aside the verdict. The action brought by Charles Surkin is for consequential damages arising from the injury to his wife, Rebecca, through the same accident. The latter action was tried, by stipulation, upon the same evidence, and submitted to the justice for his decision without a jury; the submission having resulted in the justice\u2019s conclusion in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The evidence given by the plaintiff consisted of her testimony and the testimony of her witness Miss Mandel, who was with her at the time she attempted to board the car. According to the plaintiff, the accident appears to have happened on th\u00e9 uptown side of Thirtieth street and Eighth avenue, while Miss Mandel places the occurrence at the downtown side, and there is no proof that any signal was given by either of these persons to the defendant\u2019s servants upon the car, or that the car came to a standstill under any circumstances such as would necessarily suggest to the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s that the plaintiff intended to take passage. The credibility of the plaintiff was also affected by the inconsistency between her statement that she was in bed for two weeks after the accident and her assertion that she had signed the complaint\u25a0 nine days after the accident at her lawyer\u2019s office; and while the unsatisfactory character of her testimony might, in part, have been explained by her imperfect understanding of English, her demeanor upon the stand afforded a valuable criterion as to whether or not this was a sufficient explanation. With the record in this condition, we cannot hold that there was an abuse of discretion in the justice\u2019s ruling that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and his peculiar advantages in observing the witnesses upon the stand should be given great weight upon a review of his ^xercise of discretion, in ordering a new trial. Silverman v. R. R. Co., 69 App. Div. 22, 74 N. Y. Supp. 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In the action brought by Charles Surkin, which resulted in a judgment for the defendant upon this evidence, it cannot be held that the justice\u2019s conclusion was against the weight of the evidence, since, in a view of the proof which the justice was quite authorized to adopt, there was no satisfactory exposition of the fact that the defendant was. negligent in causing the car to start while the plaintiff was boarding it; notice of her intention to become a passenger at this point not being brought home to the defendant either directly or as matter of necessary inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The order and judgment appealed from should, therefore, be respectively affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
