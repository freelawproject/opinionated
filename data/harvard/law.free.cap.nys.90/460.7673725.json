This was error prejudicial to the defendant, for which the judgment must be reversed. The testimony alluded to involved no more than an explanation or narrative of a past occurrence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The rule governing the admission of this class of testimony is stated in Butler v. M. Ry. Co., 143 N. Y. 417, 423, 38 N. E. 454, 456, 26 L. R. A. 46, 42 Am. St. Rep. 738, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cWhile proximity in point of time with the act causing the injury is in every case of this kind essential to make what was said by a third person competent evidence against another as part of the res gestae, that alone is insufficient, unless what was said may be considered part of the principal fact, and so a part of the act itself. But as' in this case the act was complete before the remark of the brakeman was made, although closely connected with it in point of time, and was not one naturally accompanying the act, or calculated to unfold its character or quality, it was not admissible as res gestee. It was independent of the principal fact, and as incompetent as evidence as though the act and the remark had been much further separated in point of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">See, also, Luby v. H. R. R. Co., 17 N. Y. 131; Whitaker v. Eighth Ave. R. Co., 51 N. Y. 295; Waldele v. N. Y. Cent. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 95 N. Y. 274, 47 Am.
