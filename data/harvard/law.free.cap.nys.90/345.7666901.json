At the close of the whole case, the trial court, stating that \u201cthere is absolutely no corroboration of the plaintiff\u2019s statement; he gave his story and it is contradicted by several witnesses,\u201d directed the jury to find a verdict in favor of the defendant. This was error. There was testimony in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>from which the jury might have found in favor of the plaintiff, if believed by them, and in such,a case it should have been submitted to them for decision.
