Rep. 59, 86 N. Y. Supp. 464. The plaintiff upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the first trial complained for \u201cwrongful detention, money had and received.\u201d Upon the present trial the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, upon being asked upon what cause of action he desired to go to the jury, said, \u201cWrongful detention of property in consequence of fraud, whereby \u2019plaintiff rescinds her contract; * * * fraud and wrongful detention of property.\u201d It appears by this, and also from the testimony given, that the plaintiff has substantially changed her cause of action from that upon the former trial. Upon that trial no pretense was made but that the defendant had been employed by the plaintiff to begin an action for slander against one Smith; that plaintiff paid defendant the sum of $100 for services'to be rendered in such action; that she desired to have Smith arrested, and that defendant prepared papers with that' object in view, and told plaintiff to procure two sureties to go upon the undertaking to be given; that subsequently plaintiff changed her mind, and decided to abandon the case. Upon this trial the plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that the defendant stated that he would \u201ctake the man back to the same court\u2014the police court.\u201d The plaintiff gave substantially the same testimony in this as upon the former trial, and her husband\u2019s statement, above quoted, is wholly uncorroborated. Upon the examination of the defendant it was shown that the defendant was retained by the plaintiff in writing, and the following appears from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201cA. The body is written by me, and the name directly thereunder is that o\u00ed the plaintiff, Mrs. Biaggie Riehl. Q. Did you see her sign that paper? A. I saw her sign that paper. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I now offer it in evidence. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Objected to for this reason: It is the gist of our action that we did hire\u2014employ\u2014the defendant to proceed with an action for the plaintiff. We admit that\u2014 The Court: With the action in the police court, isn\u2019t that it? Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I must object, and have it put upon the record that your honor is interjecting a new issue, and that remark tended to interject a new issue. (Objection overruled. Exception.) The Court: Your contention is that you employed this defendant for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in the police court? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Exactly. The Court: And not for the purpose of commencing an action for damages. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Exactly, and that this retainer does not show anything tending to vary this contention, and therefore it is entirely immaterial. The Court: I will receive it for what it is worth. The jury will say, after looking at the paper, whether it is a retainer\u2019 to commence an action in the police court or to commence an action for damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Upon this theory, practically suggested by the court, the case was'allowed to go to the jury, the judge charging as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201cGentlemen of the jury, Mr. Levy was retained by the plaintiff in this action, and the question for you to decide is, was he retained to commence criminal proceedings, or was he retained for the purpose of commencing a civil action against this man whom the plaintiff believed she had a grievance against? Her contention is that after she had left the police court she went into Levy\u2019s office; that she was angry and humiliated by reason of the fact that the defendant in the police court had been discharged; that she wanted something done to him, and therefore went into Levy\u2019s office, and told him about the situation; .and that he then said to her, \u2018All right, I will have this man on his knees to you, and \u2019it will only cost you $100.\u2019 Mr. Levy has presented in evidence a written retainer, which recites that he was retained to begin proceedings for malicious slander against Ernest Smith. That retainer might be a retainer to \u25a0 begin proceedings criminally for malicious slander, and it is for you to say from the evidence that has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>presented to you to-day whether or not the defendant was employed to commence proceedings in a police court for the purpose of making this man go on his knees, as Levy expressed it, or whether he was retained to commence proceedings in a civil court to obtain money compensation for the use of the words that Smith was alleged to have uttered against Mrs. Riehl. If you believe that Levy was retained to commence an action for damages, and that the story that he told you on the stand is true, in reference to the statement he made to the plaintiff about the bond she' was required to furnish, and the other incidents of the conversation, then, of course, the defendant is entitled to a verdict, because then there would be no question but that he was employed to-commence civil proceedings, and stated to her that she would be required to furnish a bond of $500, and it would cost her one hundred dollars to commence such proceedings. If, however, you believe that he was employed to commence proceedings in a police court and that the one hundred dollars which he received from this plaintiff was paid to him for such purpose only, your verdict must be in favor of the plaintiff, because the defendant does not even pretend that he attempted to commence proceedings in a police court. On the contrary, he admits that he did not. His sole contention is that he was not employed to go to the police court, but that he was employed to sue this man. If you find for the plaintiff, your verdict must be less than the amount sued for. She sues for one hundred dollars, but has admitted that Levy had earned compensation to the extent of ten dollars; that she was willing to pay him ten dollars for his trouble. In case you find for the plaintiff, your verdict will be for the sum of ninety dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">This charge was excepted to by defendant\u2019s counsel, as was also this expression of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201cThe Court: The plaintiff has testified that she employed Levy to commence the proceedings in the police court against this man, and she said distinctly that she did not employ him to sue the man Smith. Defendant s' Counsel: I except to that part of your honor\u2019s charge. Does your hono' overrule it? The Court: Yes, note an exception to the charge. I cannooverrule the exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">A careful examination of the record does not disclose that the plaintiff testified as is stated by the court. Moreover, there is not the slightest evidence that the plaintiff suffered through or by reason of any fraudulent representations or practices on the part of the defendant. The written retainer which upon this trial is conceded to have been signed by the plaintiff, although strenuously denied by her upon the former trial, admits of but one reasonable construction, and such construction, together with the explicit and positive denial of the defendant that he was employed to begin proceedings in a police court, but was so employed to begin an action in the city court for slander, clearly outweighs the indefinite and uncertain statement of plaintiff\u2019s husband, before referred to. Neither is it made to appear, even if we assume that the defendant promised to proceed against Smith in the police court, that the defendant ever refused to do so, or that plaintiff ever called upon defendant to do so. The following portion of the opinion, given for this court by Mr. Justice Gildersleeve, aptly applies to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s contention with the defendant was that the former was to pay the latter $100, in return for which the latter was to prosecute an action against Smith. The plaintiff has paid the $100, and the defendant has already rendered'all the services he could in said action, and stood ready and willing to carry out his part of the agreement to the end, but the. plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>tiff would not let him do so. The plaintiff should not be allowed to profit by such action on her part to the detriment ot the defendant, especially as no sufficient reason for her abandonment of the Smith case appears to have been given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The testimony given on the part of the plaintiff wholly fails to make out any cause of action against the defendant, and the complaint should have been dismissed upon defendant\u2019s motion made therefor, both at the close, of the plaintiff\u2019s case and again at the close of the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
