Upon sufficient evidence the court below sustained the defendant\u2019s plea of infancy, and gave judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">No actual tortious appropriation of the1 watch and chain by the defendant was attempted to be shown upon the trial. The cause of action was therefore concededly ex contractu, and it is elementary that an infant cannot be held upon a mere contractual promise. The form of the action \u201ccannot alter the nature of the transaction,\u201d and, \u201cthough the nonperformance of that which is originally contract may be made the subject of an action in tort, the foundation of that action must still be in contract\u201d (Sir James Mansfield in Weall v. King, 12 Earl, 452). \u201cWe think that the fair \u00bfresult of the American rule as well as the English cases is that an infant is liable in an action ex delicto, for an actual and willful fraud, only in cases in which the form of the action does not suppose that a contract has existed; but, where the gravamen of the fraud consists in a transaction which really originated in contract, the plea of infancy is a good defense\u201d (Gilson v. Spear, 38 Vt. 311, 315. See, also, Tyler on Infancy of Coverture [2d Ed.] 180, and cases there collated; Bishop on Noncontract law, \u00a7\u00a7 560, 569; Cooley on Torts [2d Ed.] 123; Fiero, Torts, 47), and it is well settled \u201cthat, where the substantial ground of action rests on promises, the plaintiff cannot, by changing the form of action, make a person liable on the promise\u201d (Campbell v. Perkins, 8 N. Y. 430, 440). Obviously, since we must assume that the defendant prevailed in his plea of infancy, it is needless to review the evidence as to its preponderance on the question as to whether the watch and chain were delivered to the defendant or Gold.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
