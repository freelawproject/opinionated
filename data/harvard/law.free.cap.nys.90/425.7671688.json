The issue litigated upon the trial was: Did the defendant, by oral contract, agree to pay the plaintiff commissions upon defendant\u2019s sales to a customer named Oscherin? And the paper in question (plaintiff\u2019s exhibit A) is a prior written contract between the same parties, by the terms of which plaintiff was to receive commissions upon defendant\u2019s sales to Adolf Heurad.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The evidence of the plaintiff was wholly uncorroborated and positively contradicted, and it would be difficult to hold that the admission of this irrelevant paper did not prejudice defendant. That such evidence, though more or less morally convincing, is not legally competent, has been held in many cases. Molt v. Baumann, 65 App. Div. 445, 72 N. Y. Supp. 832; Baldinger v. Levine, 83 App. Div. 130, 82 N. Y. Supp. 483; McLoghlin v. Mohawk Valley Bank, 139 N. Y. 514, 34 N. E. 1095; People v. Koerner, 154 N. Y. 355, 48 N. E. 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
