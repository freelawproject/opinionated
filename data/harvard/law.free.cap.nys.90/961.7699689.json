The question has never been directly passed upon in this department, but it has been a frequent subject of discussion and adjudication in the other departments, and therefore, aside from what would be the opinion of any of the members of this court, were the question a new one, we regard the contention of the respondent as too strongly fortified by precedent and authority to warrant our adopting a contrary view. People v. Ransom, 2 N. Y. 490; People v. Mitchell (Sup.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 305; People ex rel. Ackerman v. Dumb, 6 App. Div. 26, 39 N. Y. Supp. 514; People ex rel. Ranton v. City of Syracuse, 88 Hun, 203, 34 N. Y. Supp. 661; Matter of Kreischer, 30 App. Div. 313, 51 N. Y. Supp. 802 ; Matter of Goodwin, 30 App. Div. 418, 51 N. Y. Supp. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">In People ex rel. Ackerman v. Lumb, 6 App. Div. 26, 39 N. Y. Supp. 514, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-18\">\u201cThe order is not appealable. * * * An alternative mandamus is in the nature of an order to show cause. * * * It does not affect a substantial right because it determines nothing against the respondents or in favor of the relator. It cannot be quashed or set aside for any matter involving the merits. * * * An appeal from an order made in a special proceeding, like an appeal from an order made in an action, lies only when it affects a substantial right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>And in People v. Mitchell, supra, a decision of the fourth department, it was held (headnote) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-4\">\u201cAn appeal will not lie from an order granting an alternative writ of mandamus. The granting of such a writ is a matter of discretion, and the remedy of a person aggrieved thereby is by appeal from the final order made in the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The appeal, accordingly, should be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
