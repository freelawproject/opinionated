The bridge was constructed of stone walls on either side, which supported stringers, upon which planks were laid. Dirt and cinders entirely covered these planks to the depth of 15 or 20 inches. The planks were about 3 feet above the bottom of the ditch. The plaintiff\u2019s proof tended to show that there was a hole through this bridge, which had existed for some time, and in which the horse stepped, breaking down the planks and causing the catastrophe. The planks, immediately after the accident, were found to be badly decayed. The conduct of the plaintiff at the time and the alleged negligence of the highway commissioners were for the jury, and we would not interfere with the verdict, except for an error which we deem too material to be overlooked. John King was the commissioner of highways in office at the time of the accident. His predecessor, Jurden, had held 1 the office for two years prior to March, 1901. He testified that he inspected this bridge in the summer of 1900, and described the manner of doing it. The jury might have found from the evidence that the bridge was defective and unsafe during the term of this commissioner, and that he ought to have known of its unsafe condition, and that the inspection which he testified to was insufficient. The court charged the jury that they were only to take into consideration the negligence of the commissioner in office at the time of the accident, \u201cand that they could not consider the question of any negligence of the prior commissioner, Jurden\u201d; to which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted, and also requested a specific charge to the contrary which was denied. The town is liable for damages \u201csustained by reason of any defect in its highways or bridges existing because of the neglect of any commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>sioner of highways of such town.\u201d General Highway Law (Laws 1890, p. 1181, c. 568) \u00a7 16. To establish the negligence of the town, the plaintiff may prove within reasonable limits the delinquency of any commissioner of highways. Allen v. Town of Allen, 33 App. Div. 463, 53 N. Y. Supp. 800; Spencer v. Town of Sardinia, <em>42 </em>App. Div. 472, 59 N. Y. Supp. 412; Shaw v. Town of Potsdam, 11 App. Div. 508, 42 N. Y. Supp. 779. In Allen v. The Town of Allen (33 App. Div., 53 N. Y. Supp., supra) the trial court, at the request of the plaintiff, had refused to charge that, if the defect complained of existed during the term of the commissioner preceding the accident, that would be adequate notice to the defendant. This court granted a new trial to the plaintiff for this error; saying at page 464, 33 App. Div., page 800, 53 N. Y. Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">\u201cNotice to a commissioner of highways is notice to the town in cases of injury resulting from defective highways and bridges; and it is not necessary that the notice should have been received by the commissioner in office at the time of the injury complained of. It is sufficient if the defect had existed during the term of office of a prior commissioner. It is the commissioner who receives the notice, and not the individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">These case are controlling upon us, and require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
