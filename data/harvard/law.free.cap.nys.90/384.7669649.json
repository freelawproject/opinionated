On May 29, 1904, the plaintiff served the defendant with an order to show cause issued by the said justice and returnable May 23, 1904, requiring the defendant to show cause why the judgment rendered herein should not be amended and corrected to read, \u201cComplaint dismissed for failure of \"proof,\u201d and it was annexed in the moving affidavit annexed to said order to show cause that the \u201cjudgment for defendant\u201d had been entered through inadvertence, and that it was the intention of the trial justice \u201cnot to give a judgment for the defendant on the merits, but that he did not believe she had shown facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that his intention was to dismiss the complaint, not on the merits, but because a cause of action had not been proven.\u201d It does not appear that there was any opposition to this motion. An order was therefore entered, which recites \u201cthat it is ordered that the said motion be, and the same hereby is, in all respects granted, and the judgment corrected so as to read, instead of \u2018Judgment for the defendant/ \u2018Complaint dismissed/ upon the ground and for the reason that the decision made was inadvertent, in that it was not intended to conclude the plaintiff.\u201d The notice of appeal herein states that the plaintiff \u201cappeals from the judgment entered in the office of the clerk of the above entitled court on May 16, 1904, in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, and from the judgment as amended and. corrected by order of Justice Murray, signed on June 2, 1904, which reads \u2018Complaint dismissed/ etc.\u201d This appeal must be regarded as an appeal from the judgment as amended and corrected by the order aforesaid, as such judgment supersedes and takes the place of the first judgment entered. The judgment thus appealed from is one amended and corrected and entered upon plaintiff\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>motion, is for her own benefit, and it enables her to begin another action for the same cause, and in such a case the plaintiff has no right of appeal.
