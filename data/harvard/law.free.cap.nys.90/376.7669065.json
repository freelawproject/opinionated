The defendant\u2019s testimony, supplemented by that of his son, clearly shows that this was an accommodation check, and the defense that no consideration passed to the drawer is not open to him in an action by a bona fide holder of such a check. Harbeck v. Craft, 4 Duer, 122; Laws 1897, p. 728, c. 612, \u00a7 55. Any question as to the plaintiff\u2019s performance of its- agreement with the son is concluded by the justice\u2019s finding of the facts favorable to the plaintiff upon credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
