This check was received for the defendant by its agent, Habernicht, who gave Marx his personal check for the difference of $150; and the defendant, with full knowledge that the payment by Marx was excessive of the amount due, obtained the $900 upon the JIudson Company\u2019s check, and credited Habernicht with the difference, upon his statement that he had settled with Marx. Habernicht\u2019s check was not honored, and the plaintiff has recovered judgment upon Marx\u2019s claim for $150 against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-19\">There is no question of the status of the parties as to the $900 check. It was drawn to the defendant\u2019s order for the plaintiff\u2019s assignor\u2019s accommodation, and so accepted by the defendant. The drawer had no interest in the defendant\u2019s application of the proceeds, and, in legal effect, the situation is the same as though Marx paid the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>$900 in cash. Marx accepted the agent\u2019s check, btit the means of payment of the defendant\u2019s debt failed when payment of the check was refused, and the demand against the defendant still subsisted. Porter v. Talcott, 1 Cow. 359. The facts do not support the inference that Marx intended to transfer his claim against the defendant to Habernicht, and to accept the latter\u2019s responsibility. There was no implied release of the defendant, and its reliance upon Habernicht\u2019s assertion that he had settled the claim for the overpayment of $150 was, of course, an attitude assumed at its own risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The plaintiff was entitled to a recovery, and the judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
