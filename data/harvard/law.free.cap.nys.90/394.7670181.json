Witnesses were called upon the trial on behalf of defendant, who testified to the attempted delivery of a box to Hay-man at 118 East Eleventh street, New York, but that, in consequence of failure to find consignee at that address, the box was stored in defendant\u2019s warehouse, the claim of the defense being that, notwithstanding the fact that the bill of lading read \u201c108 E. 11th Street,\u201d the actual marking on the box was \u201c118 E. 11th Street.\u201d The date when these witnesses claimed to have seen the box was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>March 23d, or four days later than its shipment, during all of which time it was in defendant\u2019s custody. This evidence might tend to establish that the address on box and that recited in the receipt were different at the time of shipment, but it was far from conclusive upon that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In Magnin v. Dinsmore, 51 N. Y. 168, the learned court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\u201cIt is no longer open to question in this state that, in the absence of fraud or imposition, the rights of carrier and shipper are controlled by a contract in writing delivered to the shipper by the carrier at the time of the receipt of the property for transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">It was error to permit.proof against objection of defendant\u2019s custom. Custom or usage, general or local, may in some instances be material, but evidence ,of the custom or usage of a party to an action is certainly incompetent to contradict the express or implied terms of a contract. Hopper v. Sage, 112 N. Y. 530, 20 N. E. 350, 8 Am. St. Rep. 771. No proper foundation for the admission of the \u201cCabinet Card\u201d testified to by defendant\u2019s \u201cOn Hand Clerk\u201d was laid, and the exception taken to the overruling of plaintiff\u2019s objection thereto of itself establishes reversible error. Linden v. Thieriot, 96 App. Div. 256, 89 N. Y. Supp. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
