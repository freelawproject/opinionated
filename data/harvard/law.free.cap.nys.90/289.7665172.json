It would be unreasonable to hold that an acknowledgment of the good condition of the merchandise was to be presumed from the mere delivery of a bill of lading containing such expressions. Miller v. Hannibal &amp; St. Jo R. R., 90 N. Y. 430, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>43 Am. Rep. 179; Roth v. Hamburg-American Packet Co., 59 N. Y. Super. Ct. 51, 12 N. Y. Supp. 460. The burden was upon the plaintiff to prove negligence, and as a first step in that direction it was essential to have shown the condition of the goods at the place of shipment. The fact of delivery of goods by a carrier to the consignee at the destination in an injured condition is not enough. \u201cIt must be shown in what condition the carrier received them, in order to prove an injury in his hands.\u201d Smith v. N. Y. Central R. R., 43 Barb. 225. As there was no evidence offered upon this subject, we are of opinion plaintiff failed to make out a case, and, having arrived at that conclusion, it is unnecessary to discuss the other points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
