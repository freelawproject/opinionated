Instead of waiting until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>the momentary obstruction of the door through which. he had entered the boiler room had been removed, he went into a place that was unlighted, and of which he had no knowledge, intending to enter the room from which he had come through another passage, and while on his way fell into the pit and received his injuries. \u201cWhen a person having a choice of two ways, one of which is perfectly safe and the other of which is subject to risk and dangerous, voluntarily chooses the latter and is injured, he is guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover.\u201d Bailey on Personal Injuries Relating to Master and Servant, vol. 1, \u00a7 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"IT\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b1095-16\"> 1.
