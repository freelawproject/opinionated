Mathot against Frederick E. Triebel to have an attorney\u2019s lien declared on papers in his hands, including a contract between defendant and the state of Iowa, and on the money coming to defendant from the state of Iowa under such contract.

The objection that the state of Iowa is a necessary party defendant does not seem to me to be well taken. Adams v. Fox, 40 N. Y. 577. The objections that the plaintiff\u2019s lien is a \u201cretaining lien,\u201d and .therefore \u201cpassive\u201d; that the plaintiff has no right to enforce it, or have the amount thereof determined ; and that the action is not justified\u2014if sound (and I have grave doubt whether, admitting the validity of the lien, the attorney is barred from foreclosing it), are not grounds for demurrer. The fact that the plaintiff asked more in his complaint than he is entitled to would not make his complaint bad. No action or special proceeding had been commenced by the plaintiff, as attorney for the defendant, at the time of his discharge by defendant, and the defendant contends that until commencement of the action or \u25a0 special proceeding no lien attaches; citing Code, \u00a7 66. But the Court of Appeals, in Matter of Knapp, 85 N. Y. 284 (at page 295), intimates that the lien exists under the Code before the actual commencement of the action. The plaintiff here is not confined to the statutory lien given by section 66 of the Code. \u201cThe remedy provided by the Code by means of petition is not exclusive, but cumulative, for a court of equity has always had power to ascertain and enforce liens.\u201d Fischer-Hansen v. B. H. R. R. Co., 173 N. Y. 492, 66 N. E. 395. The lien of an attorney upon the papers of his client attaches not only for the costs and charges in the particular suit, but for any general balance in other professional business. Bowling Green Bank v. Todd, 52 N. Y. 489; Maxwell v. Cottle, 72 Hun, 529, 25 N. Y. Supp. 635. This is not a rule peculiar to attorneys, but applies to an ordinary factor. He has a lien upon goods consigned to and received by him for unpaid balances before accrued. Knapp v. Alvord, 10 Paige, 205, 40 Am. Dec. 241; Bryce v. Brooks, 26 Wend. 367. In the Matter of Knapp, supra, the court discusses the origin of the lien: \u201cThe general proposition that an attorney has a lien for his costs and charges upon deeds or papers or upon moneys received by him in his client\u2019s behalf in the course of his employment is not doubted, nor does it stand upon questionable foundations. It comes to us super antiquas vias. As early as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>year 1734 it was. held by Lord Chancellor Talbott to arise upon a contract implied by law, and as effectual as' if it resulted from an express agreement. * * * In our own state * * * Kent in his Commentaries (vol. 2, p. 641) puts it down as an established principle that an attorney has two liens for his costs\u2014one on the papers in his hands, and the other on the funds collected.\u201d And Judge Danforth says, at page 294: \u201cIt is plain, then, that right of lien exists. Its origin should not be lost sight of. The declaration in Ex parte Bush [7 Viner, Abr. 74] was restated by Chancellor Eldon in Cowell v. Simpson, 16 Ves. 279, where he described it as \u2018prima facie\u2019 a right accruing through an implied contract; and, as it exists in favor of those who have bestowed labor and service upon property in its repair, improvement, or preservation, the agreement implied must be that the person rendering it shall retain the property until compensation is made. The lien of an attorney stands on no higher ground. In Ex Parte Yalden, L. R. 4 Ch. Div. 129, James, L. J., says: \u2018The things upon which they claim a lien are things upon which they have expended their own labor or their money,\u2019 and asks: \u2018Why are they not to have that lien in same way as any other workman who is entitled to retain the thing upon which he has worked until he is paid for it?\u2019 \u201d I think, therefore, that under these decisions and the practice approved in the Fischer-IIansen Case, supra, the plaintiff has a right to maintain this action and that the complaint is good. The demurrer should be overruled, with costs, with leave to defendant to answer on payment of costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b930-6\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.
