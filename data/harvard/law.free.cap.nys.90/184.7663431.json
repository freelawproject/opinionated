Charges were preferred against the relator by the justice of the Municipal Court presiding in the Fifth District. The relator appeared upon the day set for a hearing of the charges, and demanded that the same be made more definite, and also informed the justice that he was a veteran of the Spanish-American War, and was entitled to a trial and hearing before he could be removed. The demand for a hearing and trial was denied, the justice holding that he was only entitled to an opportunity to make an explanation, and beyond that relator had no rights. After hearing relator\u2019s explanation,- the justice found that it was not satisfactory, and adjudged him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>guilty of the charges, and removed him from his position as attendant. The justice assumed to act pursuant to the provisions of section 1373 of the Greater New York Charter, Laws 1901, p. 586, c. 466, as amended by Laws 1902, p. 1173, c. 497. By the provisions of this section, the justice was authorized to remove an attendant and other persons employed about the court upon preferring charges and giving an opportunity for an explanation. No other hearing or trial is provided in the section. This provision of the charter, however, is to be construed in connection with the laws which secure the rights of veterans. By chapter 370, p. 809, Laws 1899 (section 21), as amended by chapter 270, p. 805, of the Laws of 1902, it is provided that no honorably discharged soldier who served in the Volunteer Army during the Spanish War shall be removed from the position or employment held by him, except for incompetence or misconduct shown \u201cafter a hearing upon due notice, upon stated charges, and with the right to such employe or appointee to a review by a writ of certiorari.\u201d This court has held that this provision of law operates as a restriction upon the power of removal in the case of veterans, even though the authority under the local law to remove is at the discretion of the officer exercising the authority. People ex rel. Thain v. Constable, 65 App. Div. 176, 72 N. Y. Supp. 535; People ex rel. O\u2019Connor v. Brady, 49 App. Div. 238, 63 N. Y. Supp. 145. The fact that the term of the appointment of the relator had expired does not militate against this view. He was not removed for such cause, and he was recognized as properly holding the position by the proceedings which were taken to effectuate his removal. It follows that such removal was without authority of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The writ of certiorari should be sustained, the proceedings removing the relator annulled, and the relator reinstated in his position, with $50 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
