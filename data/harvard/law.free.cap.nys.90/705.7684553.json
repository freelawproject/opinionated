The plaintiff, a yyoman 64 years of age, is one of his tenants, and had been such for 3 or 4 years at the time of the accident complained of here. On the 4th day of January, 1902, the plaintiff went into the back yard of the premises, which were retained in the possession of the defendant for the common use of his tenants, for the purpose of emptying her ash pail. In crossing the yard she stepped upon the cover of a drainage pipe, and, while her evidence upon this point is somewhat confusing, there was enough to support the conclusion that the cover turned up at an angle by reason of the fact that the earth had gradually washed or sunk away from the top of the drainage tile, and had left the same without proper support; and she was thrown down, sustaining an injury to her ankle, which appears to be of a permanent character. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and from the judgment entered upon such verdict the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">From the photographs in evidence, and from the testimony of witnesses, it is evident that this back yard, originally fitted up in a proper manner, had been permitted to deteriorate during a long series of years, dating back at least as long as the defendant's ownership; and there was nothing in the appearance of the drain cover to indicate that it was out of order, or that it was more dangerous than other portions of the back yard. After the plaintiff's injury, it was discovered that the earth had receded from the drainage pipe, and that the cover\u2014about eight inches square, and perforated to permit the water to flow down into the drain\u2014was lacking in support, so that one stepping upon one side of the same would be liable to be injured; and the question was submitted to the jury whether the defendant had exercised a proper degree of care in not discovering this defect. We think this question was properly for the jury, and the evidence supports the verdict. The jury has likewise found absence of negligence contributing to the accident, and we think the inference was properly deducible from the evidence. An examination of the exceptions discloses none which should operate to overturn the judgment in this case. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
