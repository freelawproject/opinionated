The court refused to submit the question of defendant\u2019s negligence to the jury, but submitted the question of the defendant\u2019s wrongful act\u2014the maintenance of a nuisance\u2014to the jury, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff. We think there was no basis in the evidence for the submission of this question, or the finding by the jury that the accident was the result of the maintenance of a nuisance by the defendant at the time and place of the accident. The case of McKinney against this same defendant, reported in this court (66 App. Div. 207, 73 N. Y. Supp. 48), and affirmed without opinion (174 N. Y. 516, 66 N. E. 1112), involved an accident occurring at this same crossing. That action, like the present one, was brought for negligence and wrong in maintaining a nuisance. The condition of the crossing itself was the same in both cases, and there was no substantial difference in the surroundings. In that case the horse took fright at the escape of steam from an engine near the crossing. In this case the fright of the horse was caused by a freight car standing just at the margin of the highway. In that case the plaintiff was riding in a cutter after dark. In this case the plaintiff was riding in a wagon in the daylight. We held in that case that the crossing was reasonably safe; that the defendant was guilty of no neglect of duty in keeping it in such reasonably safe condition. We are unable to see how it kan be held, as it was by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>the trial court, that while there was no negligence as to the crossing\u2014 while it was kept in reasonably safe condition for public travel\u2014the jury might nevertheless find it to be a nuisance. If the defendant had performed its full duty as to this crossing, its condition clearly was not a nuisance; and, if the crossing itself was not a nuisance, the presence of the freight car just at the margin of the street did not make it a nuisance. The McKinney Case, having been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, should have been followed by the trial court in this case, and must be followed by this court on appeal. The judgment and order should therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide event, upon questions of law only; the facts having been examined, and no error found therein. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
