This is apparent from the allegations that the moneys were received by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ant in a fiduciary capacity, and that he has embezzled and fraudulently misapplied the same to his own use. The purport of these allegations is obvious. It is to enable the plaintiffs to cause the defendant\u2019s arrest pending the action and to enforce a judgment in their favor by execution against the defendant\u2019s person. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 549, subd. 2, and section 1487, subd. 2. Nor should these allegations be treated as surplusage, as the defendant contends they may be (Fyfe v. Jackson, 55 App. Div. 74, 66 N. Y. Supp. 972), since their substantiation by proof upon the trial is material to the plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 549, subd. 2). True, the prayer of the complaint in terms demands judgment for a liquidated amount, with interest from a specified date, and not for damages, as is ordinarily the case in actions sounding in tort; but the prayer for judgment forms no part of the statement of the cause of action. It may, where the complaint is ambiguous, be resorted to for the purposes of ascertaining the pleader\u2019s intention ; but it cannot control the nature of the action as against a clearly expressed intention to the contrary. The counterclaim did not embody a cause of action \u201carising out of the contract or transaction, set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim,\u201d nor was it \u201cconnected with the subject of the action\u201d (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 501, subd. 1), and the demurrer thereto was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondents.
