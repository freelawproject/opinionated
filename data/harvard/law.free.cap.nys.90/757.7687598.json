Doney, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. At the trial the complaint was dismissed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>the ground that the policies had lapsed by reason of nonpayment of premiums within the time stipulated by the policies. In the first policy it is provided \u201cthat the weekly premium stated in said schedule shall be paid to an authorized agent of the company on or before every Monday during the continuance of this contract * * * if for any reason the premium is not collected by the agent when' due, it shall be the duty of the policy holder before said premium shall be in arrears four weeks to bring or send said premium to the home office or the company\u2019s agent.\u201d In the second policy is found the same provision. It.is conceded that upon the 15th day of October the premiums due upon both policies upon Monday, the 1st day of October, 1900, were paid. Upon the 5th day of November the husband of Jennie E. Doney offered to the company the sum of $3.75, which was sufficient to pay the premiums due up to that time upon these policies, together with other policies which he held upon lives of other members of his family. It was then insisted that these policies had lapsed for nonpayment of the premiums. This claim was sustained by the trial court, who dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The trial court was in error in holding that the policies had lapsed upon the 5th day of- November. The premiums due upon'the 1st day of October were fully paid. No premium was then due until the 8th day of October. That premium could be paid at any time upon that day. Permission to pay that premium at any time before the same was four weeks in arrears is clearly given by the contract. The moneys due upon the 8th day of October had not been four weeks in arrears until the close of the 5th day of November, and the plaintiff, the husband of the deceased, had the right, therefore, to pay the premiums upon that day, thereby continuing the policies in force. The claimed forfeiture excuses the payment or tender of further premiums which may be deducted from the amount found due from the face of the policy. Meyer v. Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co., 73 N.
