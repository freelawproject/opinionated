In case of the widow\u2019s death before the time specified, the property held for distribution was to include the property which had been held to produce the annuities, but in either case distribution was postponed until the youngest child attained, or, if deceased, would have attained if living, the age of 21 years; and in either case the shares of the two youngest children were not to be paid to them until they respectively attained the age of 28. <em>Held, </em>that the trust, being measured by years instead of lives, was void, as offending against the statute of perpetuities.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-11\">2.

Judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-14\">This controversy arises out of a contract for the sale of certain real estate situated on the south side of East Eleventh street, in the borough of Manhattan, city of New York. Plaintiffs, as surviving executors of the will of George Hagemeyer, deceased, entered into a contract with the defendant to sell and convey the said premises in fee simple absolute. At the time set for closing the contract both parties made tenders\u2014the defendant of the purchase price, and the plaintiffs of a deed. The defendant refused to accept title tendered by the deed upon the ground that under the provisions of the will of George Hagemeyer, deceased, a valid power of sale did not exist investing the plaintiffs with power to execute a deed which would vest title to the premises in defendant in fee simple absolute. The particular grounds of the objection were that the power of sale contained in the will was an incident to the trust for the purpose of carrying the same into effect and making distribution of the estate; that the trust provisions of the will were void, as offending against the statute of perpetuities. The questions thus raised, therefore, require a construction of the will. George Hagemeyer died on June 14, 1892, leaving, him surviving, Mary Hagemeyer, his widow, and the following named children, George and Gaspar Hagemeyer, Lizzie Walter (married), Martha J. Hagemeyer, who subsequently married on the 8th day of November, 1899. These children were all of full age at the time of the testator\u2019s death. His infant children were Mary, Emma, and Eva Hagemeyer, respectively of the ages of 20, 16, and 13 years. Eva became 21 years of age on the 20th day of November, 1900. All of these children and the widow are now living. Emma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Hagemeyer was married on January 29, 1902. The total value of the estate at the time of testator\u2019s death was $357,299.50, \u00a7278,000 of which was real estate. After providing for the payment of his debts, and making a specific devise of a house and lot in the city of Brooklyn to his wife, and bequeathing to her certain household furniture, horses and carriages, and making a specific bequest of \u00a7500 to a niece, the will, in the fourth paragraph, provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-5\">\u201cFourth: All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, both real and personal, I give, devise and bequeath unto my executors hereinafter appointed and the survivors of them, In Trust Nevertheless, for the following uses and purposes, that is to say: They shall allow the share of the capital stock of the firm of George Hagemeyer and Sons, which shall belong to me at the time of my decease, to remain in the business until my youngest daughter Eva shall attain the age of twenty-one years, upon the following terms and conditions: my two sons George and Caspar, shall continue to conduct the business on behalf of themselves and of my estate, devoting their entire time thereto, and shall, each receive out of the business a yearly salary of fifteen hundred dollars therefor, in addition to their share of the profits, which shall be proportionate to their shares of the capital stock. The business shall be continued to be carried on at the same place as at present upon ground belonging to me and shall pay t\u00f3 my estate the same rent which the business now pays, in addition to the taxes, water rents and assessments coming upon the property, as now paid by the said firm of George Hagemeyer and Sons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-6\">\u201cMy executors (exclusive of my said two sons) shall not be compelled to devote any. more time to the said business than shall be necessary to enable them to understand at all times its condition and the methods of its management, which they shall have the same right to do as if they were co-partners in such business.

The will was duly admitted to probate as a will of real and personal property by the surrogate of Kings county on July 12, 1892, and letters testamentary issued to Mary, George, and Caspar Hagemeyer and William Kilian. Kilian died December 5, 1899, and John A. Hagemeyer, named in the will, never qualified as executor after the death of William Kilian.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The will then provides that the business conducted by the testator and his sons in his lifetime should be carried on and the capital remain in the business until the youngest daughter,- Eva, should attain the age of 21 years, upon certain terms and conditions prescribed therein. Aside from the property and capital invested in the business, the remainder of the personal estate was required to be invested by the executors, and certain securities for investments were recommended. The real estate was directed to be rented. Out of the income of the trust estate, both real and personal, the direction is first to pay to the testator\u2019s wife, Mary Hagemeyer, the sum of $7,000 annually in every year during her natural life, commencing from the date of the decease of the testator. Provision is then made for the support, maintenance, and education of the three minor daughters, for certain advancements in the event of marriage, and then for a division of the estate upon the youngest daughter, Eva, attaining the age of 21 years, at which time the whole estate was to be distributed, save such portion of either real or personal property, or both, as should be amply sufficient to produce an annual income of $7,000, to be paid to the wife during her life. There was not, therefore, a creation of new and independent estates. It was also provided that the share of the two younger children, Emma and Eva, should be retained by the executors and kept securely invested until the two younger daughters respectively attained the age of 28 years, during which period each was to receive an income of $900 per annum, which was to be increased to $1,500 per annum in the event of the death of the wife prior to the expiration of the trust period. Upon their attaining the age of 28 years the sum invested was to be paid over to such children absolutely. Upon the decease of the wife that portion of the estate set apart for the purpose of producing the annuity of $7,000 per annum was to be paid over and distributed to the two sons and five daughters equally, share and share alike, unless the wife died before the youngest child attained the age of 28 years. The will in this respect provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201cThat if my said wife shall die before my youngest child attains the age of twenty-eight years the provisions hereinbefore contained as to the time of the payment of the respective shares of my children shall control the time of the payment of their shares upon this final distribution. The time when my youngest daughter Eva attains the age of twenty-one years or becomes twenty-one years of age, shall be construed in this will (in case of her decease during her minority) to mean the time when if living she would have attained that age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>By the scheme of this will two divisions of the estate by the trustees was contemplated\u2014one when the youngest child, Eva, became 21 years of age, in which event the distribution was to be absolute of all the property, save such as was necessary to produce the annuity to be paid to the widow and the shares of the two youngest children. The second division was to occur upon the death of the widow, and that distribution embraced the trust property which had been held by the executors for the purpose of producing the annual income payable to the widow. But both distributions were made dependent upon the arriving of age of the youngest child, Eva, and by the express provision of the will such time.was fixed and absolute as of a given date, namely, the 20th day of November, 1900. If Eva died during her minority, the period of distribution was postponed to this date, as the will provided that the date of distribution in such event should be construed \u201cto mean the time when, if living,\u201d she would have attained that age. It seems clear that the testator contemplated that his wife would survive the youngest daughter\u2019s coming of age, as tie made provision for the'distribution of his estate when the daughter should arrive at 21, and also of the property in the trust provision for the wife\u2019s benefit upon her death; but each distribution was made to depend upon a particular period of time, not measured by any lives, for there could be, under the scheme of this will, no .division of this trust estate prior to the 20th day of November, 1900, whether the widow was living or not. This is clearly made to appear in the exception which we have already quoted, following the direction to distribute the estate upon the death of the widow, and in express terms such distribution is controlled by the previous direction to distribute, which was dependent upon Eva\u2019s having attained her majority, or the arrival of the period when she would have attained it if she had deceased. And as to the two younger children, if they had not then attained the age of 28 years, no distribution could be made of their shares prior to such period. By the first direction to distribute, which contemplated the continued existence of the widow, the shares of the two younger children were to go into a trust fund, the title to which remained in the trustee, there to stay until they should respectively reach the age of 28 years. So that the direction for distribution was in each event dependent upon years\u2014first, as to the elder children, upon the lapse of time necessary to arrive at a period when Eva would become 21, and upon the period when the two younger children would become 28 years of age, respectively. Then follows the construction which the testator required should be given to the will in this respect, which shows it to have been made to depend upon a fixed date, and not upon the lives of particular individuals or of any. And during that period of time the trust estate was to remain in the trustees. It seems plain, therefore, that the duration of these trust estates under either scheme of distribution, whether upon the arrival of Eva at her majority prior to the death of the widow, or upon the death of the widow prior to such period, or upon the death of Eva before attaining her majority, the vesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>of the estates in the beneficiaries is made to depend upon a term of years. Such trust provisions are therefore void as offending against the statute of perpetuities. Upon this subject the authorities are so plain as to admit of no controversy. Haynes v. Sherman, 117 N. Y. 433, 22 N. E. 938; Jennings v. Jennings, 7 N. Y. 547; Staples v. Hawes, 39 App. Div. 548, 57 N. Y. Supp. 452; Brown v. Quintard, 177 N. Y. 75, 69 N. E. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Nor does the power of sale which was vested in the trustees of the trust estate cure the invalid provisions of the will. The power thus given is for purposes of distribution, and the proceeds of any sale were subject in all respects to the execution of the trusts. The will is therefore condemned whether the trustees execute the power of sale or not, or whether the property used to carry out the terms of the trust provisions be real or personal. Brewer v. Brewer, 11 Hun, 147, affirmed sub nom. Bremer v. Penniman, 72 N. Y. 603. In no view, therefore, can the provisions of this will be sustained; and, reaching this conclusion, it necessarily follows that the plaintiffs are unable to convey a good title to the premises. The defendant is, therefore, entitled to judgment for the sum of $2,500, paid on the execution and delivery of the contract, with interest thereon from the 10th day of March, 1904, together with the further sum of $400, fees and expenses incurred in examining the title, together with the costs of this submission. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"f\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b254-15\"> 2. See Perpetuities, vol. 39, Cent. Dig. \u00a7 37.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
