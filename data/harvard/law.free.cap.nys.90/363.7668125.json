In such a case the husband\u2019s liability depends upon the question of cause for the separation. Constable v. Rosener, 82 App. Div. 155, 81 N. Y. Supp. 376, affirmed on opinion below 178 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>587, 70 N. E. 1097. The authority cited favors the proposition that the burden of showing the husband\u2019s fault is on the plaintiff. If so, there was a failure of proof; if not, the exclusion of defendant\u2019s evidence denied him the benefit of a valid defense, the proof being relevant to the denial of the wife\u2019s agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
