The total amount claimed by the plaintiff herein was $150.50, and, there being no proof showing that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in any greater sum, the judgment should have been for that amount only, instead of $159.30, as rendered. An examination of the record discloses that still further deductions must be made. The check for $19 charged by plaintiff against the defendant, and conceded to have been forged by defendant\u2019s son, is not legally chargeable against the defendant. The plaintiff also admits that he had the use of defendant\u2019s truck, for a portion of one day, the value of the use of which is proven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>to have been $2. The judgment must therefore be modified by being reduced to the sum of $129.50, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"AzsY\">Judgment modified by reducing amount of recovery <em>to </em>$129.50 and costs in the court below, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
