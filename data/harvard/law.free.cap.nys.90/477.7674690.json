Whether the \u201cjudgment for tenant,\u201d rendered by the justice, proceeded upon the failure of the landlord\u2019s proof, or upon a finding that the unauthorized lease had been ratified by conduct, is, however, an open question, and until a final order is made in the proceedings the landlord is embarrassed by the uncertainty which exists as to the nature of the adjudication. With the record, this court cannot determine whether the result intended to be reached was correct or not, as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>suming the disposal of the case to have been upon the merits, since the justice has not concluded the proceedings, agreeably to the statute which defined his jurisdiction, by the making of a final order.
