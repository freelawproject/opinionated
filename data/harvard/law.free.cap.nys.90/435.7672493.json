Costs of an earlier appeal, taken successfully by this plaintiff, depended upon the result.of the trial, and a correct disposal of the case, if resulting in judgment for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tiff, would also have saved her from the costs awarded to the defendant. The error in the direction of a verdict, therefore, cannot be viewed as affecting a barren right; and the plaintiff is entitled to a reversal of this judgment for the purpose of protecting her substantial interest, notwithstanding that she may ultimately Recover no more than nominal damages.
