The particular error is urged to be the trial court\u2019s omission to require the plaintiff to furnish the preliminary proof of the genuineness of the record. The objection to its admission, however, which was to its competency generally, did not call the trial court\u2019s attention to the objection sought to be availed of upon this appeal. Had it been specifically made, the preliminary proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>might have been adduced, and the objection thus overcome. It cannot, therefore, avail for reversal. Tooley v. Bacon, 70 N. Y. 34; Mead v. Shea, 92 N. Y. 122; Wallace v. Vacuum Oil Co., 128 N. Y. 579, 27 N.
