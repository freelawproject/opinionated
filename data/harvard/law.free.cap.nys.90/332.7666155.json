The minutes were excluded under exception, and thereafter, both sides having moved for a direction of a verdict, the Justice directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">In general, the scope of an adjudication in the Municipal Court may be determined by resort to the minutes of the trial in view of the informality of the pleadings and proceedings in that court (Seed v. Johnston, 63 App. Div. 340, 71 N. Y. Supp. 579), and, it being conceded in this case that the minutes offered afforded competent proof of the fact of what took place at the trial, the exclusion of the evidence must find its justification, if at all, in the provisions of section 1209 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that \u201ca final judgment, dismissing the complaint, either before or after a trial rendered in an action hereafter commenced, does not prevent a new action for the same cause of action, unless it expressly declares, or it appears by the judgment roll that it is rendered upon the merits.\u201d If this section applied to a judgment of the Municipal Court, no proof, apart from the judgment roll itself, would be admissible for the purpose of adding the words \u201cupon the merits,\u201d ot words of similar purport to what the judgment roll expresses, since the statute makes the judgment roll conclusive; but this section, which is a part of article 1 of title 1 of chapter 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is expressly limited in its application to judgments rendered by the Supreme Court, the City Court of New York, or one of the County Courts. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3347, subd. 8. The question, therefore, as to whether the judgment of the Municipal Court was or was not upon the merits was a matter for proof in the ordinary course, and the judgment roll was not necessarily conclusive. Our conclusion is that error was committed in the exclusion of the minutes of the trial had before the Justice of 'the Municipal Court, and that there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
