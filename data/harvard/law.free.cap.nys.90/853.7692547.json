Subsequently an amended answer was served, in which the defense of the extension was reiterated, and several other defenses interposed. Upon the trial of the action, for some unexplained reason, the plaintiff offered in evidence both the original and the amended answer. No other evidence was given with reference to the alleged agreement extending the time of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">The amended answer superseded the original, and so far as the trial of the action was concerned, except for its introduction by the plaintiff as a piece of evidence, the original answer had nothing whatever to do with the case. It is not necessary to introduce a pleading in evidence, as it is always before the court, and its admissions bind the party without a formal introduction as evidence; but in the case of the original answer, which has been superseded, and is out of the case, no reason is suggested for its introduction as evidence, except to give effect to the statements therein contained. The plaintiff was probably at liberty to question the admissions and to give proof denying them, but, not having done so, it must be assumed that he intended the statements of the answer to stand as evidence, and, standing uncontradicted, it establishes the fact that the agreement of extension was made. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>though hearsay, yet, being unobjected to by the other side, the party offering it cannot be heard to question its admissibility now. We think that the condition in which the plaintiff left his case by the introduction of this evidence without explanation or qualification defeated his action, and that the judgment for this reason must be reversed. People v. Norton, 9 N. Y. 176; Dodge v. Crandall, 30 N. Y. 294; Mott v. Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543. The orders brought up for review should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide event. Orders affirmed, without costs. All concur, except WILLIAMS, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
