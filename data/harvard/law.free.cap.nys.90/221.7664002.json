The defense was that'defendants were induced to enter into the contract of exchange by fraudulent representations as to the rentals of plaintiffs\u2019 property. The judgment entered for plaintiffs not only provided for the specific performance of the contract, but also provided that \u201cthe plaintiffs account to the defendants for all rents collected by them or their lawful agents since January 4, 1899, the time fixed in said contract for the apportionment of the same, after deducting therefrom the interest on the mortgages thereon, taxes, water ratps, insurance, and such other or further proper, legal, or necessary charges or expenses or disbursements made or incurred by them (said plaintiffs) in collecting said rents, and keeping said premises in repair, and protecting and preserving the same, the net amount of which shall be fixed and determined by the referee hereinafter named. And it Is further ordered and adjudged that said plaintiffs are entitled to the damages from said defendants sustained by them' by reason of the neglect, failure, or refusal on the part of said defendants to perform and carry out the provisions of said agreement on their part to be performed; and it is referred to Edwin A. Watson, Esq., who is hereby appointed as referee to hear the allegations and proofs of the parties as to the amount of such damages, and to ascertain the amount of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"pATK\">Modified.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b247-15\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Indeed, when the defendants first desired to retire from the bargain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>they did not assign any such reason, although they subsequently did. There was no foundation for the provisions in respect to damages sustained by the refusal of the defendants to carry out their contract. The court by its judgment has required the specific performance of the contract, and has provided for the equalization of the rents, interest, taxes, etc., on each piece of property, and when that is done there is no further ground for recovery in the shape of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The judgment should be modified by striking out the clause providing for a reference to assess damages, and also the provision as to the payment of damages, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
