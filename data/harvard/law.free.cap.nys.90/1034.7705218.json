So, too, the exclusion of evidence of a breach of warranty was not erroneous, the defense pleaded being insufficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>Without disaffirmance by the defendant, and an offer to return the chattel, the breach of warranty was no answer to an action for the price. After acceptance, the breach of warranty would support rescission or a claim for damages, but here the defense pleaded^ involved neither. Thus there was nothing for the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery being established by the contract and the conceded delivery, and the direction of a verdict was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
