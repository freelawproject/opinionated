As the record stands, there is no ground for reversal in the instructions given to the jury; and the court properly excluded the receipt offered in evidence for the defendant, the exception taken to which ruling is pressed as affording reason for a new trial. The paper referred to was res inter alios acta\u2014 a statement by one third party that he had received money from another for a certain purpose\u2014and to have admitted this incompetent matter in evidence, upon the close question of fact presented, would have been obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-18\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"j[\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b382-19\"> 2. See Evidence, vol. 20, Cent. Dig. \u00a7 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
