It was commenced by the service of a copy of the summons and complaint, and at the same time an order was served on Winans, enjoining his disposing of the stock pending the return of an order to show cause why such order should not be continued during the pendency of the action. Winans appeared in the action, and subsequently his attorneys obtained a stipulation extending the time to answer, and also the time for the argument of the motion to continue the injunction. Before the time to answer had expired, as extended by the- stipulation, or the motion had been argued, the plaintiff moved to vacate the stipulation, substantially upon the ground that the same was obtained by misrepresentation. The defendant then moved, by an order to show cause, for an order requiring the plaintiff to exhibit the contract sued on to the defendant\u2019s counsel, and permit him to make a copy of the same. Both motions were argued together, and resulted in an order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion; and granting the defendant\u2019s, and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-16\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion was properly denied. There is nothing in the papers upon which that motion was heard which showed that the stipulations were procured by misrepresentation as to the defendant\u2019s condition, or that his condition was not as represented by his attorneys. Nor was there anything to show that the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys were misled by the stipulation, or that their client\u2019s interest was prejudiced by it in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">The defendant\u2019s motion was improperly granted. The order to show cause why an inspection of the contract should -not be had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>was based upon an affidavit, and not upon a petition, as required by section 805 of the Code of Civil Procedure. An inspection of a paper cannot be obtained in this way. It must be by petition. Boeck v. Smith, 85 App. Div. 576, 83 N. Y. Supp. 428; Bloodgood v. Slayback, 62 App. Div. 315, 71 N. Y. Supp. 809; Dick v. Phillips, 41 Hun, 603; Francis v. Porter, 88 Hun, 326, 34 N. Y. Supp. 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">It follows, that the order appealed from, in so far as it denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion, should be affirmed, without costs to either party, and, in so far as it granted the defendant\u2019s motion, should be reversed, without costs to either party, and the motion for an inspection denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
