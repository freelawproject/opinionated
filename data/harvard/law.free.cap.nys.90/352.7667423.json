The chief issue of fact upon the testimony was whether the defendant was in charge of the bricklayers or not. It seems that an independent contractor also had been doing the brickwork, but it was claimed that the latter had finished or abandoned his job, and that at the time of the accident whatever bricklayers were engaged in the building were there under the supervision and control of the owner, this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-20\">The charge of negligence, as specifically set forth in the complaint, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-21\">\u201cWhile plaintiff was lawfully on said premises of defendant, through the negligence, carelessness, and recklessness of his agents, servants, and em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ploy\u00e9s, certain bricks were caused to fall from the upper stories of said building, striking the person of this plaintiff,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This was the only assignment of negligence, but evidence was admitted, over defendant\u2019s objection (to which ruling exceptions were duly taken), tending to establish the negligence of the defendant, for failure to provide proper coverings to safeguard persons in the air shaft from being injured by materials falling from the upper stories, and the case was submitted to the jury upon two theories: First, were they satisfied that the bricks were negligently caused to fall, and that defendant was in control of the bricklayers, as pleaded; and, second (as not pleaded), if not satisfied upon the first point, then that they might find that the defendant, as owner, was negligent in not providing proper coverings. This was, in effect, saying that they might find that defendant was not liable upon the cause of action pleaded, but might be so upon a cause of action not pleaded, and was erroneous. Zboynski v. Brooklyn City R. R. Co., 10 Misc. Rep. 7, 30 N. Y. Supp. 540; Dexter v. Ivins, 133 N. Y. 551, 30 N. E. 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Moreover, we are of the opinion that the exception taken to the statement in the charge of the learned court that the loss of employment, according to his calculation, amounted to $864, and his failure to modify such statement at the suggestion of defendant\u2019s counsel, constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide'the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
