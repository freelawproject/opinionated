Therefore the- court properly denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the resulting judgment for the defendant proceeded from the plaintiff\u2019s failure to prove performance of the contract in the matter of an inspection of the electric installation and the presentation of a certificate. The defendant\u2019s evidence did not supply the omission, tested by the terms of the contract, and no error is apparent from the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>of the appellant\u2019s motion to strike out testimony which was wholly responsive to a question asked; the ruling not being obviously prejudicial. No point is made that the judgment fails to declare that the complaint was dismissed without prejudice to a new action (Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 248; Laws 1902, p. 1561, c. 580); and, in any event, the matter was one for amendment upon application to the Justice, if the plaintiff deemed itself aggrieved (Id. \u00a7 254; Laws 1902, p. 1563, c. 580).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
