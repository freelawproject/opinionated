Before delivery of the note to Rabinowich, the payee, the same was indorsed by Kuper &amp; Lapin and Lapin St Goldman; Lapin apparently being a partner with both Kuper and Goldman. Thereafter Rabinowich, the payee, indorsed the note and transferred it to one Isidor Berg. Berg placed the note in the Van Norden Trust Company for collection, and, when it matured, not having been paid, it was protested. Rabinowich, the payee, then paid the note, received it from the trust company, and placed it in the hands of his attorney for collection. Subsequently Lapin, one of the firm of Kuper &amp; Lapin, and one of the indorsers, borrowed from one Gelman the amount due on the note, paid this sum to the payee\u2019s attornej'', and immediately turned the note over to Gelman, who thereafter assigned it to this plaintiff, who brought this action. It does not appear that any of the several defendants, except Rabinowich, were served with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the summons or appeared in the action; and upon the foregoing testimony the court gave a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against Rabinowich, the payee named in the note. A mere statement of the foregoing testimony is sufficient to show that the plaintiff had no cause of action against this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The firms of Lapin &amp; Goldman and Kuper &amp; Lapin, as well as Alexander Goldman, the maker, were liable to the payee upon the note, and one of said indorsers paid it. That he obtained the money w\u00bff,h which to do so from Gelman, and, after payment, delivered <em>v\u00fce </em>note to him, did not render the payee liable to either him or his assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Judgment reversed. New trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
