Jefferson Bank v. Gossett, 86 N. Y. Supp. 752. Upon the trial now under review, the plaintiff still refrained from calling witnesses to prove the deliveries and the value of the goods, but sought to establish an admission sufficient to cover the questions at issue by proof that, when the defendants\u2019 attorney made the admission appearing in the record of the first trial, he had gone over the items of the bill of particulars with plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the courtroom, and stated to the latter that he \u201cadmitted the sales and deliveries of goods from January 21st to January 27th,\u201d pointing the items out to plaintiff\u2019s counsel (the witness), \u201cand meanwhile looking at the defendant Louis Gossett, who nodded his head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-15\">It is apparent that this was simply a preliminary to an admission of record which the defendants\u2019 counsel was about to make, and what was then understood is indicated by the actual admission made. Assuming, however, that the defendants\u2019 counsel had made the very statements claimed, intending just such an admission, still the client was not bound by an admission of counsel, not of record, without an express authorization. Fay v. Hebbard, 42 Hun, 490; O\u2019Brien v. Weiler, 68 Hun, 64, 22 N. Y. Supp. 627. To bind the defendants by reason of the act of one of them in nodding his head while counsel was making the statement may be quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>possible, but certainly there is nothing here to show that the client admitted the value of the goods as stated in the bill of particulars. He nodded while his counsel admitted the sales and deliveries within certain dates, but to say that he also intended to admit the values claimed by' the plaintiff assumes that, when assenting to something which his counsel said, he also agreed to something not spoken of, but which the opposing counsel had in mind. Without proof of value or of an agreement as to price, this judgment cannot be supported. This proof would seem to be readily available in the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, should the plaintiff elect to call him, rather than to persist in presenting the case upon insufficient admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
