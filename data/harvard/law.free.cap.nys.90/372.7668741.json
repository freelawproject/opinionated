It appears from the contract, which is annexed to the complaint, that the defendant had a period of six months within which to accept the goods called for by the contract; hence that his default of performance would not arise until the \u2022expiration of that period for the purpose of relieving the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>from the restrictive provision, and the damages indicated as arising from the restriction would therefore depend upon such proof as the plaintiff could produce showing the general value of the business which he was thus made to lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">The order appealed from _ requires the plaintiff to specify the names and addresses of the different dealers in the three cities mentioned whose trade in these particular goods he thus lost, but, in our opinion, the requirement should not be made. This is not a case where the business lost could be particularized, for the reason that the restrictive covenant operated to prevent the solicitation of orders, and it would be impossible for the plaintiff to say that he had actually lost an order from every one of the candy manufacturers in these three cities, while to limit him to such instances of loss as he could accurately point out would not fairly serve to measure his actual loss. If he may recover \"at all upon his claim of damage, the recovery cannot be based upon specific instances from the very nature of the case, and, without passing upon the question whether any particulars should have been ordered of these general damages i\u00f1 the first instance, we conclude that the order before us should not have been granted in the exercise of the court\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
