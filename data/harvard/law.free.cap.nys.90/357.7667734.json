When plaintiff was employed, the fund applicable was sufficient to pay for his services; but the printing plant was subject to liens, to the satisfaction of which the money on hand was devoted by defendant\u2019s agents, with the result that the plant was finally turned over to the association at a materially enhanced value; the increase representing, in part, the indebtedness incurred for plaintiff\u2019s services. <em>Held, </em>that defendant was liable for the amount due plaintiff under such circumstances, to the extent of the fund so diverted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Fourth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-10\">Action by Dow Hosman against John J.

Upon an earlier appeal this court applied the rule referred to, and reversed a judgment for the plaintiff. Hosman v. Kinneally, 43 Misc. Rep. 76, 86 N. Y. Supp. 263. And the same result has lately been reached by the Appellate Division of the Second Department (Lightbourn v. Walsh, 97 App. Div. 187, 89 N. Y. Supp. 856); the decision having proceeded upon the absence of proof of agency to employ the plaintiff upon credit, in view of the express provisions of the constitution, and the nature of the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">This newspaper, according to the scheme adopted, was published at an expense met by stated contributions from the members; and, without more, the agents appointed to conduct the publication had no implied authority to incur liabilities beyond the amount of the fund thus provided. This is the rule which was applied by the decision above noted, but the facts in the present case none the less support a recovery upon the principle of ratification. It appears that when the plaintiff was employed the fund applicable was sufficient, but the printing plant was subject to liens, to the satisfac-. tian of which the moneys in hand were devoted by the agents in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>charge of the newspaper, with the result that the plant was finally turned over to the association at a materially enhanced value; the increase representing, in part, the .amount of the indebtedness incurred for the plaintiff\u2019s services, where the fund applicable for the debt had been added to the property which the association thus received. When the association, by resolution, accepted the plant from its agents, styled the \u201cBoard of Trustees,\u201d it also accepted the burdens incident to the benefit conferred by the agent\u2019s acts; it being apparent from the resolutions that the association had knowledge of the fact that the increased value of the property was in part represented by liabilities incurred.
