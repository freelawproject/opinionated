Statutory Construction Law, \u00a7 27 (Laws 1892, p. 1491, c. 677), provides that a number of days specified as a period from a certain day, within which an act must be done, means such number of calendar days, exclusive of the calendar day from which the reckoning is made. <em>Held </em>that, where the hearing in proceedings to widen a highway was fixed for April 21st, a determination of the matter on May 11th was in time.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b872-11\">7.

The denials and allegations of the return must be held true, so far as they join issue with the material allegations of the petition. People ex rel. Lester v. Eno, 176 N. Y. 513, 68 N. E. 868; People ex rel. Miller v. Wurster, 149 N. Y. 549, 44 N. E. 298. And in the latter case it is held that we cannot look behind the return to consider allegations of fact in the petition and the papers, unless the return admits them, or contains an equivalent of an' admission. The writ recites that the relators inform the court of several objections, which I consider seriatim:</p>\n<p id=\"b872-18\">1. It is said that the lands of the relator Burnett sought to be taken have been inclosed for 10 years and are not a part of the highway, and that a certain other strip, also his property, has never been dedicated, and is not a part of the highway. But it appears that the land named and described in the petition is that named and described in the order as land owned by Burnett, which 'must be acquired. If the relator\u2019s hedge is on a strip of land which is no part of the street, then that strip is within or with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>out the part designed for a taking. If it be within, it must be assumed that he will be compensated. If it be without the highway limits, and yet by the order he is to receive compensation therefor, why should he complain? The defendants return \u201cthat, even if no testimony had been given on the hearing on behalf of the petitioners, it was clearly manifest to us from the mere inspection of the premises that the application of the petitioners should be granted.\u201d The court will not review facts stated in the return \u201cwhere they are founded on personal inspection and individual knowledge of the locality.\u201d People ex rel. Beardslee v. Dolge, 45 Hun, 310, 312, affirmed 110 N. Y. 680, 18 N. E. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">2. It is said that Edward Anthon, Emily H. Harrington, Henry A. Lewis, Harri M. Howell, Mary A. Herrick, Ellen N. Herrick, Anita Herrick, and John Herrick were necessary parties, and did not receive due notice. But the return shows that the said Anthon, Harrington, and Lewis appeared, consented to the widening, and waived all damages. The objections filed during the proceeding and returned state that neither Sophia M. Johnson nor Augusta Stager is named in the petition. But the return shows that both Johnson and Stager appeared and waived all claims. Section 147 of the village law (Laws 1897, p. 416, c. 414), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-6\">\u201cA person affected by the proposed Improvement, and upon whom notice has not been served, may appear upon the hearing. A voluntary general appearance of such a person is equivalent to personal service of the notice upon him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Such appearances must be deemed general. Ency. of Pleading &amp; Practice, vol. 2, p. 632. As to the others, Howell and the Her-ricks; who are stated in the petition to be owners of the fee in the highway as recorded, the return denies such ownership. I doubt whether the language of denial is open to criticism as containing a negative pregnant, but, in any event, such denial is sufficient on appeal. Stuber v. McEntee, 142 N. Y. 200, 206, 36 N. E. 878. I cannot find anything in the record that in any way weakens, or affects or nullifies this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">3. It is insisted that the board was without jurisdiction to make its order of May 11, 1903, granting the petition. It is first contended that, inasmuch as the board \u201cmust determine the matter within twenty days from the date fixed for such hearing\u201d (section 147, New York Village Law), a determination on May 11th, when the hearing was fixed for April 21st, is too late. The statutory construction law (Laws 1892, p. 1491, c. 677, \u00a7 27) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-9\">\u201cA number of days specified as a period from a certain day within which, or after, or before, an act is authorized or required to be done means' such number of calendar days exclusive of the calendar day from which the reckoning is made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Therefore the order was made within 20 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">The next contention is that the meeting of May 8th was adjourned sine die. This is denied by the-return.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">And finally it is said that there is a misnomer of the highway, in that its true name is \u201cToylsome Lane,\u201d and not \"Toylsome Road.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The return is that it is sometimes called one, and sometimes the other, and that, other than said road, there is no highway in said town known as \u201cToylsome Lane.\u201d This return is adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The order should be affirmed as to all parties, with costs against the relators. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"K\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b871-17\"> 1. See Certiorari, vol. 9, Cent. Dig. \u00a7\u00a7 143, 144.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
