Proc. \u00a7 3268, providing that defendant may require security for costs where the plaintiff is an infant, whose guardian ad litem has not given such security, where the motion was decided before the taking effect of Laws 1904, p. 1294, c. 524, repealing such section of the Code.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b765-12\">2.

The counter motion in behalf of the infant for leave to sue as a poor person, which was noticed subsequently to the defendant\u2019s motion, but came on for hearing at the same time, was properly denied. There were two fatal defects in the moving papers. It was essential to show that the infant had a good cause of action. Weinstein v. Frank, 56 App. Div. 275, 67 N. Y. Supp. 746; Wemyss v. Allan, 88 App. Div. 475, 85 N. Y. Supp. 91. This was not made to appear otherwise than by a mere certificate of the opinion of an attorney to that effect, and such a certificate was pronounced insufficient in the first, of the cases above cited. A verified complaint, in which sufficient facts to make out a good cause of action were stated positively, and not upon information and belief, might take the place of an affidavit as evidence in an application of this kind that a sufficient cause of action existed in favor of the plaintiff, but the complaint in this case is unverified. The other defect in the motion papers is the absence of any agreement on the part of the proposed attorney to conduct the action without compensation. This has been held to be essential. Helmprecht v. Bowen, 87 Hun, 362, 34 N. Y. Supp. 1141. It follows that both the orders under review should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Orders affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.
