Subsequent to the trial the defendant made a motion for leave to serve an amended answer setting up justification. The court granted the motion, but imposed no terms as a condition. The plaintiff appeals from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">We think that the learned court at Special Term did not abuse its discretion in permitting the defendant to present the new issue, but terms should have been imposed. It is the uniform practice that such an amendment will be granted only upon payment of the costs of the.action antecedent to the granting of the application, Thilemann v.
