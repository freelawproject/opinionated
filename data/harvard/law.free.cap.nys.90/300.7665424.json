It distinctly provides that the instrument which defendant contracts to execute and which plaintiff contracts to accept is to convey by its terms to the lessee a lesser interest than is given to the lessor by the covenants of the original lease. In other words, it provides for a reversion, whereas an assignment would constitute an absolute transfer to the assignee of the lessor\u2019s entire interest in the demised premises. Ganson v. Tifft, 71 N. Y. 48; Constantine v. Wake, 1 Sweeny, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-17\">This agreement was an enforceable one; it was not a mere agreement to enter into a lease, but all of the terms and conditions of the proposed lease are definitely set forth, and it is in these respects distinguishable from Geer v. Clark, 83 App. Div. 292, 82 N. Y. Supp. 87. There was no prohibition from subleasing in the original lease, and the consent of the original lessor was unnecessary, as no requirement to procure it is provided for in the agreement under consideration. The plaintiff must be held to the written contract he entered into, and the judgment appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"H\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b326-19\"> 2. See Landlord and Tenant, vol. 32, Cent Dig. \u00a7 222.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
