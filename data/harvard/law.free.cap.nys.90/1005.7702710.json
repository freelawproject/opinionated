The action was brought to recover the balance due and owing to the plaintiff under this contract down to and including the 17th day of April, 1902. The defendant denied the rendition of the services, or that any amount was due or owing under this contract, and for a first separate defense alleged that the plaintiff was hired on the express condition that he should not engage in any other business than that of selling goods for the defendant, which condition he violated by selling goods for others during said time. As a second separate defense, the ' defendant alleges that the plaintiff agreed to sell for the defendant, during the period specified, goods aggregating $7,000 in value, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>he voluntarily left the defendant\u2019s employ, on the 4th day of April, 1902, without having sold goods of the value of more than $4,093.06, and demanded judgment for the dismissal of the complaint. The contract of employment was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-4\">\u201cNew York, October 3rd, 1901.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-5\">\u201cAgreement made this 7th day of October, between Michael Zachmann, party of the first part, and Perry Seaburn, party of the second part, as follows: Party of the first part agrees to employ party of the second part as traveling salesman, at a salary of Twenty-five dollars per week, for a term of six months, furthermore agree to pay expenses while upon the road, and party of the first part further agrees to pay party of the second part commission that it costs, less 7% per cent to sell during the term of this agreement. Party of the first part to pay salary weekly. Party of the second part agrees and guarantees to sell Seven thousand dollars. This contract to take effect November fourth, 1901. Michael Zachmann.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">On the cross-examination of the plaintiff the court excluded evidence that he had sold goods for others during the period of his employment by the defendant, and defendant duly excepted. The defendant was asked by his counsel if anything was said at the time of making the agreement with reference to his selling goods for others during the time of his employment by the defendant, and if anything on that subject was afterwards said between them, and for the conversation between them at their last interview in April, when plaintiff claims that he was discharged, and the defendant that he left voluntarily. This was objected to and excluded, and counsel for defendant took an exception. The plaintiff had testified that he demanded his salary, and payment was refused, and he was discharged. By the terms of the agreement the weekly salary was payable weekly, and, although the plaintiff could maintain an.action for any installment, it was incumbent upon him to show performance of the contract down to the time that such installment became payable. \u2022 If the plaintiff left the defendant\u2019s employ without cause, it is manifest that he could not recover the weekly salary for any future time, nor for the week during which his breach of the confract occurred, and the defendant would be at liberty to counterclaim the damages arising out of the plaintiff\u2019s breach of the contract against the plaintiff for any prior installment. The defendant\u2019s denial of the rendition of the services perihitted him to show, by cross-examination of the plaintiff or otherwise, that the plaintiff violated the contract by engaging in other employment during the time that defendant was entitled to his services. ' This was the object of some of the evidence offered and excluded. It cannot be successfully maintained on this record that the court did not intend to exclude evidence of other employment by the plaintiff during the period \"for which he seeks to recover the weekly salary. The evidence manifestly was not directed to the period after the plaintiff left the defendant\u2019s employ, because it might be assumed that he then engaged in other employment. The purpose of the evidence was to prevent a recovery of some or all of the weekly installments of salary. The court evidently deemed the decision-in Walsh v. New York &amp; Kentucky Co., 88 App. Div. 477, 85 N. Y. Supp. 83, controlling that the defendant could not defeat the plaintiff\u2019s recovery without counterclaiming his damages, but that case is not an authority on the proposition under consideration here. It holds, in effect, that the recovery of an install<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>ment of salary which has become due and payable can only be defeated by a counterclaim; .but the purpose of the evidence in the case at bar was to show that the installments of salary never became due, on account of the plaintiff\u2019s breach of the contract during the period for which he seeks to recover them. No question of estoppel by defendant, or of waiver of any such breach of the contract on the part of the plaintiff, is presented by the record. There can be no doubt that under the contract, without proof of a concurrent or collateral agreement, the defendant was entitled to the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive services. Stoney v.
