The answer admits the acceptance, but alleges that it was for the accomodation of the drawers, and ultra vires, and that respondent purchased the bill with knowledge of the facts. The action falls, within subdivision 8 of section 791 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which gives preference to an action, among others, \u201cagainst a corporation, founded upon a note or other evidence \u00f3f debt for the absolute payment of money.\u201d We are of opinion that no discrimination was intended by the Legislature in the trial of causes between actions against domestic and foreign corporations, and this, we think, has been its accepted construction. See Polhemus v. Railroad Co., 113 N. Y. 617, 20 N. E. 601; Miller v. Quincy (Court of Appeals, Oct. 28, 1904) 72 N. E. 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-17\">The learned counsel for the respondent concedes that the order is erroneous in so far .as it places the cause upon the short-cause calendar. The motion was to have a cause preferred and set down for a day certain, under section 793 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by chapter 173, p. 312, of the Laws of 1904, and this is the relief to which the respondent claims that it is entitled. The order cannot be so modified, however, for this court has decided that said amendment to section 793 of the Code made in 1904 is unconstitutional and void. The plaintiff\u2019s right to a preference, therefore, rests upon the provisions of section 793 of the Code as the same stood before the amendment, and when construed by this court in Morse v. Press Pub. Co., 71 App. Div. 352, 75 N. Y. Supp. 976. It was there held that, in the absence of spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>dol facts or circumstances calling for the exercise of the judicial discretion, the preference should only be allowed over nonpreferred cases noticed for the same term.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The order should therefore be modified by allowing preference only over nonpreferred causes noticed for the same term, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
