He had one son by his first wife, but although after the birth of this son he was divorced from his wife, he continued to maintain them during his life. About sixteen years ago he again married. In August, 1907, while in failing health and contemplation of going to a sanitarium, he made a will in which he substantially gave his whole estate to his then wife, stating at the time, however, that this was merely a \u201cpeacemaker,\u201d and that he intended to have another drawn in which he would take care of his son.' The will so executed seems to have passed into Mrs. Butler\u2019s hands and remained there until offered for probate. In the latter part of October following, Mr. Butler returned from the sanitarium in much worse health, and was confined to his room until he died, November 9. In the meantime he was often delirious and confused, but had lucid intervals. In one of these lucid intervals he gave instructions for the drawing of a will. The first draft proving unsatisfactory a second was prepared, embodying his suggestion that his wife should have sixty, and his son forty per cent of the income during her life, and the principal go to his son at her death. Before this latter was presented the attending physician on being asked if Mr. Butler was capable of making a will replied that if caught in a lucid interval he \u201c could talk business.\u201d Accordingly about 4:30 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of November 6, Mr. Wisner, an intimate personal and business friend, took the will which had been drawn to Mr. Butler\u2019s room and finding him conscious, read it carefully to him in presence of Mrs. Butler and others, and at the conclusion of the reading, when asked, if that was what he wanted, answered, \u201cYes, this is as I want it to be.\u201d In the meantime when Mrs. Butler understood the proposed disposition she became hysterical, begged Mr. Butler on her knees not to make this ' will, cried, threw herself on the bed and moaned, ran out and in the room. To this appeal Mr. Butler replied among other things: \u201cYou have been nagging me for the last fifteen years, ever since my marriage, to put all my property in your hands; I told you I would not, and I don\u2019t intend to.\u201d This ordeal lasted until after six o\u2019clock \u2014 more than an hour and a half\u2014 and when Mr. Wisner asked Mr. Butler to sign the will the reply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>was \u201c No,\u201d he was too \u201ctired and exhausted; let it go until tomorrow.\u201d Mr. Butler\u2019s mind was clear during the whole of this ordeal; but he was in an unusually weak and nervous condition in consequence of it. His hand was trembling so that it was thought he could not have made a legible signature. He had been delirious in the forenoon when the doctor made his call, and was again delirious at eight o\u2019clock, and so far as appears had no lucid intervals afterward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">The court finds from the evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">1. That Mr. Butler was mentally competent when the writing propounded here as his will was submitted to him;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">2. That this writing expresses his final testamentary intent; but</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\">3. That he was prevented from signing it by reason of his exhausted condition brought on by his wife\u2019s hysterical conduct; but was capable of asking another to sign for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">Prior to the passage of the act of April 8, 1833, wills in writing proved by two or more witnesses, although unsigned by testators, were sufficient to pass real and personal estate: 2 Rhone, 491. The act of 1833 changed this so far as to make signature necessary unless testator was prevented by the extremity of last sickness from signing. The writing propounded here can be sustained, if at all, only by bringing it within this qualification of the statutory prescription. The question then is whether or not Mr. Butler was prevented by the extremity of his last illness from signing? The statutory methods of signing may be personally or by the hand of another; and under the authorities the extremity must be such as to prevent the exercise of either of these methods. \u201cIf,\u201d said the court in Strieker v. Groves, 5 Whart. 386, \u201cbeing personally unable to sign and having time and opportunity to ask another to do so, testator fails to do it, the will fails.\u201d So in Ruoff\u2019s App., 26 Pa. 219, the excuse was that the alleged testator was prevented from signing by the extremity of his last sickness and so were the proofs; but the court found that he had his senses and conversed about the will more than would have been necessary to ask someone to sign for him. So in Plate\u2019s Est., 148 Pa. 55, where the testator started to write his signature but stopped, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>saying, \u201cI can\u2019t sign it now,\u201d the court held this did not excuse him from asking another to do so. No doubt as was said in Aurand v. Wilt, 9 Pa. 54, testator is entitled to a reasonable time within which to sign and if prevented before the end of that time the case falls within the saving clause, as did the case of Showers v. Showers, 27 Pa. 485; but Mr. Butler\u2019s condition made it essential that he should have called on another to act for him. Even the interference of his wife might not have prevented this. The postponement was unreasonable. It was known that delirium or death were imminent. Even if he should have another lucid interval he might change his mind as to the manner of disposition of his estate. The evidence shows that while he was unable to sign personally, he was not in such an extremity as to prevent him from calling on another to sign for him. It follows under the authorities that the writing propounded must fail as a will. He could not sign, but could request and did not: Ruoff\u2019s App., 26 Pa. 219.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">The court entered a decree dismissing the appeal from the register of wills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing appeal from register of wills.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-7\"><em>A.
