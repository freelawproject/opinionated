There were in fact two such children, a son and daughter of Mrs. Mears. These children are to receive each an annuity to be ascertained by dividing the whole income of one-half of the residuary estate into as many shares as there may be such children, not in any event to exceed $4,000 to each child, and to hold the surplus income as part of the residuary estate. In case of the death of the children before their mother, then after her death the trustees are directed to pay income, not to exceed $9,000 in any one year, to the other daughter if she should be then living; \u201cand one-third of any surplus income shall be paid to the said the American (New England) Antivivisection Society, and two-thirds thereof to the said \u2018The Presbyterian Hospital in the City of Philadelphia.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\">\u201cAnd upon this further trust after the deaths of my said two daughters and their hereinbefore specified children and after the death of my sister-in-law Matilda W.

This is a question of intention, purely, to be determined from the language of the will in its entirety, unaffected by the meritorious character of the claimants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-8\">The residuary estate, real and personal, is given in trust during the lives of the two daughters of the testator \u2014 his only children \u2014 and the charities claiming surplus income are not mentioned by him at all, in the will or codicils, until he makes provision for the disposition of the estate at the death of one of the daughters without issue, should that event occur, viz.: \u201cand in case either of my said daughters shall die either before me or after, leaving no issue surviving her, then .... to pay to my surviving daughter the sum of $9,000 in each one of those years during her lifetime, in which the whole of the said remaining income shall amount to more than $9,000 .... and if after paying back to my residuary estate all of the above items there should still be part of such surplus income left in any of the aforesaid years, then to pay the whole of the said surplus income .... one-third to the .... Antivivisection Society .... and .... two-thirds to The Presbyterian Hospital.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-9\">This is followed by a provision for the children of a daughter, if any, and for the disposition of the surplus income in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>event: \u201cAnd if ... . there should be any such, I direct my executors .... to hold such surplus income as part of the principal of the whole residuary estate. And in case all of such children of either of my daughters should die before their mother, then after her death my executor .... shall pay the whole income from my then residuary estate, not, however, to exceed the sum of $9,000 in any one year, to my other daughter should she then be living .... and one-third of any surplus income to the .... Antivivisection Society .... and two-thirds thereof to The Presbyterian Hospital,\u201d the remaining \u201cprincipal and income\u201d being given to them in the same proportions after the death of the daughters and their children, subject, however, to a testamentary power, given by a codicil to one of the daughters, \u201cto dispose of .... that portion of the princi-. pal of the residuary estate of which she is to receive the income for life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">The will contains no direction for accumulation during the lives of the daughters, and both of them are still living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">It thus appears that the gifts to the charities are only by way of remainder, taking effect at the death of one of the present cestui que trusts for life, and subject, moreover, to be divested, in part, by the exercise of the power of appointment. Future gifts \u2014 and especially those so subject \u2014 are not accelerated even by an express illegal direction to accumulate, no matter what may be the meritorious character of the intended beneficiary. See Mitcheson\u2019s Estate, 11W. N. C. 547; Weather-all v. Thornburgh, L. R. 8 Ch. Div. 261; Talbot v. Jevers, L. R. 20 Eq. 255; Theobald on Wills, 447, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-7\">To doubt as to a claim of this character is to deny it altogether. As was said in Brendlinger v. Brendlinger, 2 Casey, 131, \u201cHe who does not claim by descent must show a written, title in himself. No intention in his favor not expressed in the written will can avail him. If the expressed intention is inadequate for his purpose, the law of the land and the title of the heirs must prevail, and all doubts about its adequacy must operate to his prejudice.\u201d The auditing judge was clearly right in refusing any part of the surplus income to the charitable institutions now claiming.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Whether the daughters take the' surplus income under the intestate laws or by reason of a gift to them of the beneficial ownership of the residuary estate for life is not a question of practical importance; but much can be said in support of their right in the latter capacity. A will is to be so construed, if possible, as to avoid an intestacy, and, in case of doubt, as nearly as may be in conformity with the provisions of the intestate laws. The will certainly affords indications of the testator\u2019s supposition that the daughters, so long as they should live, were the beneficial owners of the residuary estate; he provides for partition if either of them should so desire, in which event he says the real and personal estate shall be divided \u201cinto two equal shares, in such manner that the share held in trust for each daughter shall be designated and identified in writing in such manner as to distinguish it from the other portion,\u201d so that each daughter, by herself, may consent to the sale of \u201cany portion of the share so held for her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-5\">Then again he directs that all premiums upon policies of insurance upon the life of her husband shall be paid \u201cout of the income of that one-half of\u201d the estate of which his married daughter \u201creceived the income during her life:\u201d and he provides, finally, that if the annual income to each daughter shall at any time be less than $9,000, the executors, if they \u201cshall deem it necessary or advisable so to do,\u201d may make up the deficiency from principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-6\">Hence it would seem, upon the whole, that underestimating the income of his estate and supposing that it would not at any time largely exceed $18,000 yearly in addition to the annuities, etc., given to third persons, he wished to protect the daughters from their own improvidence by limiting the amount to be paid in each year to each of them to $9,000, and suffering anything beyond this to be held as a contingent fund, or \u201cin the interest of judicious management,\u201d to meet future deficiences, as in Eberly\u2019s Appeal, 14 Outerb. 95 (decided fifteen years before the execution of the will); Schwartz's Appeal, 4 Crumr. 337; Hibbs\u2019s Estate, 28 Crumr. 217, etc. Accumulation which arises in this manner is not contrary to the Act of April 18, 1853, P. L. 503, so long as it is not intended to be permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>withheld from the original beneficiary \u2014 such beneficiary being presently entitled to anything in excess. Surplus income of which a testator makes no disposition follows the fund or estate from which it issues (accessorium sequitur suum principale) and goes, therefore, to the person presently entitled to the beneficial ownership of such fund or estate, just as in the case of income directed to be illegally accumulated under the act of 1853: Washington\u2019s Estate, 25 P. F. Smith, 102; Stille\u2019s Appeal, 4 W. N. C. 42; Farnum\u2019s Estate, 191 Pa. 75.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">As already stated, however, this is not now important, as in any aspect of the case the daughters are entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">The exceptions on behalf of the charities are dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-7\"><em>Henry P.

Mathews, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnA\">\u2014 There is the strongest presumption against intestacy if it can be prevented by a fair construction of the will: Wahl\u2019s Estate, 26 W. N. C. 249; Stille\u2019s Appeal, 4 W. N. C. 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-8\">If under a forced construction of the will it should be held that it directs an accumulation, or if an accumulation necessarily results from its provisions (Act of April 18, 1853, P. L. 503, sec. 9), the charities would not be adversely affected by the statute. It does not apply to charities: Curran\u2019s App., 4 Penny. 331; Lennig\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 209.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-9\">The authorities show that surplus or accumulated income belongs to the owners of the vested estate from which the income was derived: White\u2019s Est., 8 Pa.

Coventry, 2 Drew &amp; Sm. 470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-10\">There being a present vested interest in the charities, the surplus income cannot pass under the intestate laws. It would belong to the charities, even if the statute against accumulation applied: Howell\u2019s Est., 5 W. N. C. 430; Edwards\u2019 Est., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>190 Pa. 177; Myer\u2019s Est., 17 Phila. 425; Mitcheson\u2019s Est., 11 W. N.

C. 42; Rogers\u2019 Est., 179 Pa. 602.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-4\">The latest English decisions rule this case favorably to the claim of the charities: Wharton v. Masterman, L. R. (1895) App. Cases, 186; Harbin v. Masterman, L. R. 2 Ch. (1894) 184; Cook\u2019s Est., 10 Pa. C. C. Rep. 465; Biddle\u2019s App., 99 Pa. 525; Talbot v. Jevers, L.
