Swearingen, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-13\">In this case, after an affidavit of defense was filed, a rule for judgment was taken, which, upon argument, without objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, was discharged. Thereupon \u2019 the plaintiff, by leave of court, filed an amended statement of demand. In this amended statement, the plaintiff declared upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>a promissory note, of which a copy was attached, marked <em>\u201cA.\u201d </em>The following is a copy of the note:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">\u201cPittsburg, Pa., May 1st, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">\u201c$6,000.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">\u201cFour months after date I promise to pay to the order of James E.

Burns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-16\">The plaintiff averred that, prior to May 1, 1907, he became the holder in due course of a certain promissory note, of which one James E. Glass was maker, and the defendant, among others, indorser; that, being such holder, he had said note discounted at the Lincoln National Bank of Pittsburg; that, upon maturity thereof, the aforesaid note, now marked \u201cA,\u201d was made and indorsed as aforesaid and delivered to the Lincoln National Bank in payment of said note previously discounted by it; that, upon maturity of said note, now marked \u201cA,\u201d payment thereof was refused, and it was protested, notice of which was given to the defendant and to the other indorsers and to the maker; that plaintiff has been obliged to pay and lift said note, which he now holds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-17\">To this amended statement of demand the defendant filed what he called a protest, in which he denied the right of the plaintiff to require him to file an affidavit of defense to said amended statement; and then the defendant filed an affidavit of defense to said amended statement of demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-18\">In the latter affidavit, the defendant \u201con information received\u201d denies that the Lincoln National Bank discounted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the note executed prior to May 1, 1907; but the defendant does not allege that he believes such information, and.that he expects to prove it. He denies that the note in suit was delivered to said bank in payment of the prior note. He, \"on information received,\u201d denies that exhibit <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>is a true and correct copy of the note, upon which suit is brought; but he does not state wherein said copy is incorrect, nor that he believes the information, and expects to prove it. He, \u201con information received,\u201d denies that the plaintiff had the note in suit protested; and he denies that the plaintiff, as junior indorser, gave notice of protest or dishonor to defendant. But the defendant does not deny that notice of protest was sent to him and to the other indorsers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">Thereupon the plaintiff entered a second rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The defendant now takes the position, that the court has no power to entertain the second rule. But we cannot agree with him. The purpose of the practice is to avoid delay, by having the court, upon a rule, determine, what it must determine upon trial, whether or not, assuming all that is alleged in the defense as true, the plaintiff is entitled to binding instructions. The reason for the practice applies to a case where an amended statement is filed and an affidavit of defense thereto is filed, equally as strong as it does in the first instance. It will be observed that the defendant voluntarily filed his affidavit of defense to the amended statement. There is no question here as to the right of the plaintiff to compel the defendant to file such an affidavit of defense. He has filed it. But we think the point is decided in the case of Cook v. Forker, 193 Pa. 461.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">The defendant has not denied the making and indorsing of the note in suit, and he has not sufficiently denied the copy attached; he has not demanded inspection of the original. The defendant has not denied that the plaintiff is the holder of the note in suit. He has not denied that said note, at maturity, was presented at the place named in the note for payment, and that payment was refused. He has not denied that said note was protested. He does say that the plaintiff gave him no notice of dishonor. But this is immaterial. It was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>duty of the Lincoln National Bank to protest the note, upon nonpayment, and to give the notice. There is no averment that said bank did not do so; and there is no averment that notice of dishonor was not sent to the defendant: Odd Fellows\u2019 Savings Bank v. Miller, 179 Pa. 412.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\">The defendant indorsed this note, gave the credit of his name to all subsequent indorsers, and he cannot avoid liability by proving the allegations in this affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">The rule for judgment is made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were the orders of the court making absolute rules for judgments for want of sufficient affidavits of defense.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-7\"><em>T.
