On April 9, 1886, Michael McCullough, Jr., party to the agreement set forth in the fourth finding of fact, executed and delivered an assignment of it to said McCullough, Dalzell &amp; Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">6. In pursuance of the foregoing contracts and assignment, the plaintiff company at a considerable expense equipped and fitted out its plant for the use of natural gas, and the defendant company continued to furnish gas to the plaintiff in accordance with said contracts and assignment, from May 1, 1885, until March 15, 1907, when it served the following notice upon the plaintiff company:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-10\">\u201cWhereas, by an agreement dated March 13th, 1886, between M. McCullough, Jr., Michael McCullough, John H. Dalzell, C. C. Arensberg, H. E. Dubarry and the Philadelphia Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>pany, there was granted to the said Philadelphia Company, a right of way over which to maintain and operate a pipe line for the conveyance of natural gas, extending from the Allegheny river southward in the bed of 36th street to Spruce alley, and through Spruce alley, and in consideration therefor the Philadelphia Company agreed to furnish to the said McCullough, Dalzell <em>&amp; </em>Company, or their successors, gas for fuel at their crucible works, without cost, for one year from the first day of May, 1885, and thereafter at a rate which shall equal one-half the cost to said McCullough, Dalzell <em>&amp; </em>Company of the coal, coke and other fuel by them used prior to the introduction of natural gas (during the two years previous to the introduction of gas); and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-4\">\u201cWhereas, it is the intention of the said Philadelphia Company to abandon said right of way and to reclaim therefrom as much pipe as it is practicable for it to reclaim, and to be thereupon released from its obligation to furnish gas at the above mentioned rate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">\u201cTherefore, Notice is hereby given, that the Philadelphia Company will, on April 30th, 1907, terminate said contract; will permanently abandon and remove said pipe line, and will not thereafter furnish gas to the said McCullough, Dalzell &amp; Company or McCullough-Dalzell Crucible Company, its successors, except at the present market price and under a new contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">7. The defendant has a sufficient supply of gas to meet plaintiff\u2019s needs, which supply, however, comes from fields and wells and under circumstances almost wholly different from those in operation and used at the time the contract was made, and which will be fully set forth in another finding of fact. The defendant can supply the plaintiff\u2019s needs from its mains located in the public streets, without using any of the lands or easements formerly belonging to Michael McCullough, Jr., or to the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">8. When said contract was executed, defendant\u2019s supply of gas was obtained from wells in and near the vicinity of Pitts-burg, the gas being driven by natural pressure. At present about 80,000 cubit feet of gas per day comes from the wells <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>or territory in use when the contract was executed. The defendant\u2019s main supply is now obtained from wells at a great distance from the city of Pittsburg, driven to far greater depth, and the greater portion of the gas must be pumped from the supply wells through its mains to the points of distribution. The cost of production is now a fraction over nine cents per thousand cubit feet. The price received from the plaintiff company under the contract is a fraction over one cent and five mills per thousand cubit feet. The defendant\u2019s regular charge to like consumers at present is twenty-five cents per thousand for the first 150,000 cubit feet, fifteen cents per thousand for the next 150,000 feet and eleven cents per thousand for all in excess of that. The plaintiff company from the time of the contract to 1893 paid the defendant $114 or $117 per month, and since that time it has paid $50.00 per month. From a meter installed by the defendant, it appears that between May 4, 1907, and December 31, 1906, a period of about eight months, the plaintiff company consumed 24,072,400 cubit feet of gas, or an average of over 3,000,000 cubit feet per month, which at the ordinary charge to like consumers would average over $350 per month. Its daily consumption is over 100,000 feet and exceeds the daily production of all the wells and territory when the contract was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-3\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">1.. The written contract, exhibit \u201cA,\u201d exclusive of the form of printed contract attached thereto, being unlimited as to time, is revocable by either of the parties upon reasonable notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">2. The printed form of contract made part of exhibit \u201cA,\u201d containing the terms and conditions not expressed in the written portion of the contract, provides for the termination of the contract by either party on reasonable notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">3. The conditions relative to the cost and supply of gas now existing, were not within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made. If at the time the contract was made the parties had not in contemplation the addition of new territory and additional wells to supply the demand, the contract is terminable by reason of the failure of the then supply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>4. If at the time the contract was made the parties had in contemplation the exhaustion of the then gas supply and the necessity of increased expenditures to obtain a new supply, then the contract was a discrimination as against other consumers of a like character, and is void on the grounds of public policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\">5. The defendant, having tendered a reconveyance of the easement granted to it and given notice of its intention to terminate the contract, under the facts and foregoing conclusions, should not be held in equity to a continued further performance of said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\">6. The bill should be dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-6\">OPINION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\">It is clear from the opinion of the late President Judge Ewing of this court in Crescent Steel Company v. Equitable Gas Company, 40 P. L. J. 316, that whatever else may not have been in the contract of April 2, 1889, the supply of gas for an indefinite period was therein, and in its continuation by the contract of November 1, 1889. Having this in mind, he states that either party might terminate the arrangement on giving a reasonable notice of its intention so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-8\">The general principle that contracts without time limit are terminable on reasonable notice by either of the parties, is sustained in Coffin v. Landis, 46 Pa. 426, where the question at issue was, whether such revocation constituted a breach. The conceded right of a principal to revoke an agent\u2019s authority was only incidential to the main question. There certainly is no question of agency in the case of Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company v. River Front Railroad Company, 168 Pa. 357, where it is specifically held that the contract was not irrevocable by either party upon suitable notice, after a date named. So in Cumberland Valley Railroad Company v. Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company, 177 Pa. 519; and in Kenderdine Hydro-Carbon Fuel Company v. Plumb, 182 Pa. 463, the court, after stating the facts, concludes \u201c if either party desired to terminate it, if this could not be done by agreement, it was his duty to deal fairly by the other party and to give a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>able notice of Ms intention to withdraw from it at a fixed date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-3\">The foregoing principle finds universal application in the decisions of many of the other states, among which are: Marble v. Standard Oil Company, 169 Mass. 553 (48 N. E. Repr. 783); Irish v. Dean, 39 Wis. 662; Savage v. Medical &amp; Surgical Association, 59 Mich. 400. In Echols v. Railroad Company, 52 Miss. 610, a contract to supply cordwood to a railroad company, without fixing a time for its termination, the court said: <em>\u201c </em>Perpetual contracts of this character will not be tolerated by the law, or rather will not be enforced, as imposing an eternal and never-ending burden. An agreement to furnish a particular commodity at a specified price .... without specification as to time, will be construed either as terminable at pleasure, or implying that the thing to be done shall be performed within a reasonable time .... any other theory is a moral and a practical impossibility and if indulged in by the courts could not be enforced in the ordinary concerns of life,\u201d citing a number of authorities, among which are Chitty on Contracts (11th Am. ed.), p. 1062; Story on Contracts, sec. 21.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\">In Marshall v. Railway Company, 136 U. S. 393 (10 Sup. Ct, Repr. 846), where the city of Marshall gave to the company $300,000 in county bonds and sixty-six acres of land within the city limits in consideration that the company would permanently establish its eastern terminus and maintain therein its main machine shops and car works; it was held that the contract was performed when the company had complied with the provisions thereof for a period of eight years until its interests \u2022and the public demand required removal of the subjects of the contract to some other place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">The case of Franklin Tel. Co. v. Harrison, 145 U. S. 459 (12 Sup. Ct. Repr. 900), relied on by the plaintiff, was decided on its own peculiar facts, among which it appears that the defendants had released a prior valuable contract; that they had expended $10,000 to erect a new wire under the new contract; and that plaintiff failed to substantiate its averment that it was excluded from any use of the wire on its lines by the continuous use thereof through the defendants; these facts seeming to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>establish an equity in favor of the defendants, are not comparable with those in the case at bar, and therefore have no controlling weight in its determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-4\">The contract, exhibit \u201cA,\u201d as a whole, is revocable on notice by its terms. The printed form contains the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d referred to in the written contract; in consideration of the grant of an easement in the beds of Thirty-sixth street and Spruce alley, the defendant company agreed to furnish gas to the works for nothing during the first year, and thereafter at half the cost of coal and coke, \u201caccording to the terms and conditions of the contract in ordinary use by the said Philadelphia Company with its customers.\u201d The printed contract contains important and material terms and conditions, without which the written contract was not enforceable. For instance, the plaintiffs were required to make all connections and appliances from the defendant's lines; to exercise due care in preventing waste, agreeing that, if it violated any of the foregoing provisions, or any of the other provisions in said printed form, the supply of gas might be cut off; it contains the important provision that in case the supply of gas failed the contract was at an end, and the final clause that the contract might be terminated upon certain notice; these are there with a purpose, else they would have been stricken out. If the printed contract is not to be considered with the written, why is it part thereof?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\">It is urged that it is inconceivable that the parties by the written terms of the contract should have provided for a never-ending agreement and at the same time provide for the termination thereof. That does not follow \u2014 when the contract was made, much of the consideration had passed \u2014 the defendant was on the right way of \u2014 the plaintiff receiving free gas \u2014 under the conditions then existing, its continuation for a reasonable time controlled. By their act they provided for its termination under changed conditions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\">It is contended that defendants having accepted this right of way by deed, cannot be permitted to retain the same and escape the liability to deliver gas at the stipulated price, citing a number of railroad condemnation proceedings as analagous cases: these are all actions of law, where the injury, if any, was ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>tamable in damages. If the use of this right of way has damaged the freehold to an extent exceeding the difference between the price they paid and the price charged to other consumers, then it is within plaintiff\u2019s right to bring suit for the recovery of such additional loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-4\">Not only is it said in Crescent Steel Company v. Equitable Gas Company, 40 P. L. J. 316, that the parties might terminate their contract, but the principle is further announced that the contract was in violation of the act of assembly chartering natural gas companies, and void as contrary to public policy, because it was an attempt to prefer certain consumers as against others of a similar class. Conceding that the preferred consumers there, were stockholders and directors of the gas company, why in principle should there be any distinction between them and any other class of preferred consumers, peculiarly benefiting by a contract with a public service corporation, necessarily at the expense of other consumers? This contract must be construed with reference to the conditions existing at the time it was made. If, as contended for by the plaintiff, at the time of its execution all the parties knew or ought to have known that new fields and greatly increased expenses would be incurred for the purpose of the supply of gas, then the contract was discriminatory and is void because the defendant, to remain in business, must charge other consumers more than the cost price of its gas; this advantage to the plaintiffs, against the general public, is wholly unwarranted in law. The day of rebates, preferential discriminations and unequal and unfair charges, to like classes of customers, by public service corporations, is, and should be, drawing to a close.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\">Again, if the parties had in contemplation only the conditions as they then existed, it is clear that the contract should fail for want of a supply of gas, the evidence being that not enough gas is obtained from all the wells in existence when the contract was made to now supply the plaintiffs\u2019 works, if no other consumer was served in the city of Pittsburg or its vicinity. The subject-matter, the supply of gas, being thus exhausted, the contract is terminable by virtue of the terms and conditions relating thereto: Ward v. Vance, 93 Pa. 499.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Finally, the equities of this case are wholly with the defendant company. It is clear that when this contract was made a condition existed vastly different from that now found. The supply of gas seemed overabundant; it came from the immediate vicinity, propelled by its own power. For twenty-two years and more the plaintiffs have had a great profit at the expense of the general consumer, and loss of the company, paying for this fuel now a little over ten per cent of its actual cost. Since 1893, a period of fourteen years, this advantage amounts to more than $65,000; from 1885 to 1893, a period of eight years, it had the same relative advantage. Apparently the consideration of this right of way has been an expensive one. Certainly, in view of the abandonment thereof with the tender of surrender, the plaintiffs have no ground for complaint, especially in view of the fact that the offer is made them to continue their supply on such new contract as may be agreed upon, assuming, of course, that this contract will be fair and on the same terms and conditions of like contracts with a class of consumers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-5\"><em>Thomas Patterson, </em>of <em>Patterson, St\u00e9rrett &amp; Acheson, </em>with him <em>Charles F.
