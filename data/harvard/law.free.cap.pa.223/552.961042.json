The testator directed that each one of his three executors should receive $6,000 \u201cin lieu of all commissions.\u201d All three qualified; four months subsequently Mr. Caven died, the settlement of the estate was only well under way and the executors of course had not completed their work. We think, nevertheless, that Mr. Caven\u2019s estate is entitled to his $6,000 in full. The testator himself determined the sum that he should receive and took the risk of his executor\u2019s illness or death; the executor by accepting the post took with it the chance that the labor entailed might be greater than he could reasonably anticipate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">Did the amount named prove to be too small, we would be powerless to increase it: Hill\u2019s Estate, 16 Pa. Dist. Rep. 984; Hays\u2019s Estate, 183 Pa. 296.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">And when the executor once qualified as executor he became entitled to some compensation \u2014 whether little or much is immaterial; his death did not deprive his estate of his right to what had been earned, and it was in lieu of that compensation that he was given his legacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-10\">It must be presumed as was said in Harper\u2019s Appeal, 111 Pa. 243, that the testator had in mind the possibility that death might reduce the.number of his executors and that he considered such a contingency when he fixed the compensation to be paid to each of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-11\">The exceptions are dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-12\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Lester B.
