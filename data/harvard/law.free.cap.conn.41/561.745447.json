The defendant replied:\u2014 \u201c I cannot <em>now, </em>I haven\u2019t any money; I am hard up; it should have been paid before, but I was hard up.\u201d The conversation then proceeded as <em>follows:\u2014Plaintiff. </em>\u201c Can\u2019t you pay me something on the bill, if it isn\u2019t more than five dollars ? \u2019\u2019 <em>Deft. \u201c </em>I can\u2019t, I hav\u2019nt any money.\u201d <em>Plaintiff. \u201c </em>Can\u2019t you give me an order on the company you are working for ? \u201d <em>Deft. </em>I can\u2019t; I have use for all that is coming to me.\u201d <em>Plaintiff. \u201c </em>When can you pay me something on this claim ? \u201d <em>Deft. \u201c </em>I don\u2019t know exactly when I can, but I will before long.\u201d <em>Plaintiff. </em>\u201c Can\u2019t you pay me something when you get paid up ? \u201d <em>Deft. </em>\u201c I will if I can.\u201d <em>Plaintiff. \u201c </em>If I come over on pay day will you let me have something ? \u201d <em>Deft. </em>\u201c I will try to.\u201d <em>Plaintiff. </em>\u201c When is your pay day ? \u201d <em>Deft. </em>\u201c It is the 10th, but sometimes runs over to the 15th.\u201d <em>Plaintiff. \u201c </em>State a time when you will pay something on this bill that I may know when to call on you ? \u201d <em>Deft. </em>\u201c If you will call in two weeks I will pay you something on it; I cannot tell how much.\u201d No other conversation than the foregoing occurred between the plaintiff and defendant in reference to this debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-5\">The Connecticut Oil Extracting Company was factorized in the suit.

That the words spoken, under the circumstances, did not constitute such an acknowledgment of an existing indebtedness, and such a new promise, as would be sufficient in law to remove the bar of the statute of limitations.\u20142. That if they did constitute a new promise, such new promise was a conditional one, and that the plaintiff could not recover without proof that the conditions of the promise had been complied with, and without proof of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>debt.\u20143. That if they constituted an unconditional new promise, such new promise went only to a part of the debt claimed to be due by the plaintiff, and would not in law be sufficient to revive the whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">The court overruled these claims of the defendant, and found the issue for the plaintiff, and rendered judgment for the whole amount of the debt.

The admissions and words of the defendant, spoken under the circumstances, are not sufficient in law to constitute even a qualified new promise. There must have been an unqualified and direct admission that the debt was still due, and an express promise to pay it. 2 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7\u00a7 440, 441; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 Peters, 364; <em>Ventris </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>14 N. Hamp., 426; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Bank of Columbia, </em>6 Peters, 93; <em>A'Court </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>3 Bing., 332; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>14 Mees. <em>&amp; </em>Wels., 741. No new promise can be inferred, unless the language used, and the circumstances under which the words relied on were spoken, show that the defendant knowingly and intentionally relinquished the protection of the statute. 3 Parsons on Cont., (5th ed.) 67; 2 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 442 ; <em>Hart's Appeal from Probate, </em>32 Conn., 539; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>4 Greenl., 41; <em>Fries </em>v. <em>Boisdelet, </em>9 Serg. &amp; R., 133; <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>4 Gill &amp; Johns., 509; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Aubin, </em>2 Bailey, 283; <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>4 N. Hamp., 318; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>13 id., 486; <em>Ventris </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>14 id., 422.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-8\">2. If the words were sufficient to constitute a new promise of any kind, it was not such a promise as in this case will remove the bar of the statute.\u20141st.' If any promise was made by the defendant, it was only a conditional one ; and the onus still rests on the plaintiff of showing that the condition has been fulfilled, and without such proof the plaintiff cannot recover. 2 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 440; <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>6 Barn. &amp; Cress., 603, 609; <em>Ayton </em>v. <em>Bolt, </em>4 Bing., 105; <em>Haydon </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>7 id., 167; <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Denio, 249; <em>Allcock </em>v. <em>Ewen, </em>2 Hill (S. C.), 326; <em>Cocks </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>7 Hill, 45; <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>1 Wis., 131; <em>Wakeman </em>v.. Sherman, 9 N. York, 90; <em>Hart </em>v. Prendergast, 14 Mees. &amp; Wels., 744; <em>Kensington Bank </em>v. Patton, 14 Penn., 483; <em>Mullett </em>v. Shrumph, 27 Ill., 107.\u20142d. The promise, if made, did not go to the whole debt, nor to any <em>definite </em>part of it. The statute is one of repose and completely discharges and extinguishes the whole debt as effectually as insolvency, bankruptcy, or the release of the creditor. <em>Belote </em>v. <em>Wynn, </em>7 Yerg., 543; <em>Wakeman </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>9 N. York, 90; <em>Tippetts </em>v. <em>Heane, </em>4 Tyrw., 775; <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Gelston, </em>15 Johns., 519. The promise must therefore comprise that indebtedness from which the bar is sought to be removed. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 Peters, 365; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>3 Cush., 355. The promise, to be binding for the whole debt, must cover the whole debt. <em>Morgan\u2019s Admrs. </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>4 Penn. S. R., 321; <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Burrus, </em>9 Leigh, 385; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Tudor, </em>8 Pick., 206; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>2 Moore <em>&amp; </em>Payne, 584; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Lawridge, 2 </em>Bibb, 284; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>14 Mees. &amp; Wels., 740; <em>Wakeman </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>9 N. York, 91.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-5\">3. The object and purpose of the statute are to bar old and stale claims, whether paid or not. The lapse of time may have destroyed all rebutting testimony; and the laches of the plaintiff to prosecute his claim may have caused the defendant to be alike careless of preserving any evidence of the amount due. The statute should be construed as any other wholesome and beneficial law, and is entitled to the same respect. 3 Parsons on Cont. (5th ed.), 62, 63; Angell on Limitations, \u00a7 23; <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>5 Mason, 523; <em>A Court </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>3 Bing., 329; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>14 Mees. <em>&amp; </em>Wels., 741; <em>Kensington Bank </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>14 Penn., 479, 483; <em>Green, Exr., </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 Gill <em>&amp; </em>J., 394.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-6\"><em>Wooster, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ApH\">was stopped by the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b564-7\">Carpenter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al2\">The argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel assumes that an express promise to pay a debt is essential to remove the bar of the statute of limitations. But this is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>so. If there is an unequivocal acknowledgment of an existing indebtedness, it is sufficient, as the law implies a promise to pay it. <em>Buckingham </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>23 Conn., 453. The language of the defendant as stated in the record evinces an unmistakable intention to waive the benefit of the statute. There is not only an acknowledgment of the existence of the debt, but there is an express promise to pay some part of it at a time named. His language is, \u201c If you will call in two weeks I will pay you something on it, I cannot tell how much.\u201d The only qualification of this promise relates to the amount he would pay. But it was a distinct and unqualified recognition of his liability to pay the whole debt. At least the court below was justified in finding from all the evidence an acknowledgment that the debt was still subsisting, and we cannot disturb the judgment. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Wyse, </em>35 Conn., 384; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>29 Conn., 63; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Keach, </em>24 Conn., 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
