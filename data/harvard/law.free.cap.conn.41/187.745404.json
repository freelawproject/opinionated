Statutes, tit. 1, see. 207,) which provides that \"the authority signing a writ of error shall take good and sufficient hond with surety that the plaintiff shall prosecute, &amp;c.,\u201d hond must be given with surety at the time of the signing of the writ, and such a hond filed with the clerk at the opening of the court is not sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-9\">Whether a recognizance of a third person would not he sufficiently a hond with <em>surety:\u2014Qucere. </em>There is a practice that goes to sustain the sufficiency of such a bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-10\">But clearly a hond given by the plaintiff himself, without surety, is not sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-11\">Where the memorandum of the hond in the writ over the signature of the clerk was as follows:\u2014\u201c Bonds of prosecution given, and the plaintiff is recognized in the sufficient sum of one hundred dollars to prosecute, &amp;c.,\u201d it was held that this could not be taken to mean that sufficient bonds were given, the statement with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s having given hond restricting the operation of the general words.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>If the memorandum had been simply \u201cBonds for prosecution given,\u201d\u2014it would have been inferred that full and legal bond was given, and it would have been a sufficient memorandum 6f the giving of such a bond, if such a bond had been given.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b188-5\">The Supreme Court will try an issue of fact on a plea in abatement of original process brought before that court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">Writ op error from a judgment of the Superior Court in New London County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">The only entry upon the record of bond given on the writ was in the following memorandum at the close of the writ, and above the signature of the clerk of the court:\u2014\u201c Bonds for prosecution given, and George C. Ripley recognized in the sufficient sum of one hundred dollars to prosecute, &amp;c.\u201d The provision of the statute with regard to the bonds to be given on the issuing of writs of error, is as follows :\u2014\u201c And the authority signing such writ shall take good and sufficient bond, with surety, that the plaintiff in error shall prosecute his suit to effect and answer all damages if he fail to make his plea good-.\u201d Gen. Statutes, tit. 1, sec. 207.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-8\">The defendants in error pleaded in abatement \u201c that the plaintiff in error, at the time he prayed out said writ, did not give a good and sufficient bond with surety that the plaintiff in error should prosecute his suit to effect and answer all damages in case he fail to make his plea good; nor did the authority signing said writ of error take good and sufficient bond with surety that the plaintiff in error should prosecute his suit to effect and answer all damages if he fail to make his plea good; nor did the authority signing said writ take any other bond than the recognizance of George C. Ripley, the plaintiff in said writ, in the sum of one hundred dollars, to prosecute, &amp;c.; and this the defendants are ready to verify. Wherefore they pray judgment, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\">The plaintiff in error replied as follows:\u2014\u201c The said plaintiff in error, for replication to the plea of the defendants by them above pleaded, replies and says that his writ ought not to abate or be dismissed, because he says that the allegations in said plea pleaded are untrue, and if true are insufficient. Wherefore he prays judgment, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-10\">It appeared that a bond with surety had been filed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>clerk at the opening of the court by the plaintiff in error. The plaintiff in error was an assignee in bankruptcy, duly appointed by a court of the United States, and sued as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\">The case was argued only upon the demurrer to the plea in abatement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-6\"><em>S. F. Baldwin </em>and <em>Lucas, </em>in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-7\">1. The provisions of sections 1, 207, and 210, title 1, General Statutes, being all on the same subject, are to be construed alike. The provision that on a motion in error the party shall give sufficient surety by recognizance to the adverse party defines the word \u201c surety \u201d as meaning in this connection \u201c a recognizance to the adverse party.\u201d And such is the practice. <em>Yeomans </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>2 Day, 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-8\">2. The section as to writs of error, unlike the others, requires nothing of the party as a prerequisite to the allowance of the writ. It is simply directory.to the authority signing the writ and limits no time in which he is to require bonds. In this case bonds were given on the opening of the court, if they were not before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-9\">3. The plaintiff and Mr. Lucas, before the writ was signed, offered and gave all the bonds required by the clerk. He certifies that \u201cbonds for prosecution were given,\u201d and this certificate imports conclusively that proper bonds were given. <em>Eno </em>v. <em>Frisbie, </em>5 Day, 122; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>9 Conn., 144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-10\">4. The plaintiff sues in an official character, as the representative of another court of a higher sovereignty. As such representative he is exempt from giving bonds under any state law, for it tends to impede his official action. lie has however given his individual bond as surety for his official acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ark\">5. The defendants\u2019 remedy, if more bonds are needed, is to move for them. Bonds are not required to bo given when the writ is prayed out or at any particular time. As the defendants confine their objection to the omission to take bonds at the exact moment when the writ was prayed out, their plea is insufficient. Sufficient bonds may have been taken before or since that time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Halsey </em>and <em>Pratt, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq-\">cited <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>22 Conn., 101.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b190-5\">At the opening of the court the next morning the opinion of the judges was given orally by the Chief Justice as follows:</p>\n<author id=\"b190-6\">Park, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY63\">The court hold the plea in abatement sufficient. We regard the statute as clearly requiring bond to be given, with surety, on the issuing of the writ of error. The \u2022record states that \u201c bonds for prosecution were given, and George C. Ripley was recognized, &amp;c.\u201d This a majority of the judges take to mean that George C. Ripley alone gave bond. If the record had been simply \u201c bonds for prosecution given,\u201d and no more, it would have been inferred that full and legal bond was given, and it would have been a sufficient memorandum of this, provided bond with surety had in fact been given. The question of fact is of course open. The case coming to this court by original process, of course the question of fact can be made here, whether bond was duly given, or whether service was in fact made, or any other issue of fact that could properly be made by a plea in abatement. The replication is both a demurrer and a traverse. Our present decision is on the demurrer. The plaintiff can of course go on with his traverse and show that the allegation of the plea that no bond with surety was given is not true; but we suppose, from what was said by both parties, that there was in fact no such bond given. Jt was stated that a bond had just been filed by the plaintiff with surety, but we are of opinion that such a bond would be of no avail. The bond must bo given at the time of the signing of the writ of error by the clerk, and if not given then the omission cannot be made good by giving a bond after the case gets into court. The person giving bond here was Mr. Ripley, the plaintiff. If some other person had given bond it might perhaps have been enough. We do not decide that point. There is a practice that would go to sustain the sufficiency of a bond so given.</p>\n<author id=\"b190-7\">Foster, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">remarked that he did not concur in the decision, but did not state his views.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
