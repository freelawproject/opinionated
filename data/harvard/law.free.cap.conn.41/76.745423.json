The performance of his duties was not enforced by a penalty, and he acted only upon application of parties interested and at their expense. In the discharge of his duty and while acting in good faith, he. ordered' a vessel lying at a wharf to be hauled astern to make more room for another at an adjoining wharf, and was sued by the owner of the wharf for damages. Held that the city could not legally indemnify him for the expenses incurred by him in defending against the suit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b76-13\">And it seems, where the charter gave the common council power to \u201cordain by-laws relating to wharves and the anchoring, moving and mooring of vessels,\u201d and \u201c to appoint all necessary officers to carry the by-laws into effect,\u201d and the council passed a by-law creating the office of superintendent of wharves, and giving the officer \u201c full power to order and regulate, whenever requested by the owner or lessee of any wharf, the mooring of vessels at such wharf,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that the by-law was not void as delegating to the superintendent of wharves the making of regulations which the charter gave the common council alone the power to make.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">Petition for an injunction against a payment by the defendants; brought to the Superior Court in Fairfield County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The petition alleged that the petitioner was an inhabitant of the city of Bridgeport, a taxpayer thereof, and an owner of real and personal estate liable to taxation and actually taxed therein ; that on the 29th day of September, 1866, he brought his action on the case against John Brooks, of said city, to the City Court of said city, to recover damages sustained by him from the wrongful and malicious conduct of said Brooks, as set forth in his declaration in said action; that said cause was tried before said court and a jury, and upon the trial the jury rendered their verdict that the petitioner recover of said Brooks the sum of ten dollars damages, which verdict was accepted by the court, and thereupon judgment was duly rendered against said Boooks, in his favor for the sum of ten dollars damages, and his cost taxed at 126.15, which judgment remained in full force; that said Brooks afterwards filed his motion in error from said judgment to the Superior Court, which motion was allowed, and said cause was entered on the docket, and was now pending in said Superior Court; that said Brooks employed as his counsel in said cause and upon said trial, Beardsley and Sumner, attorneys at law in said city ; that said attorneys on the 4tli day of March, 1867, made out and presented to said Brooks their bill for their services in said cause to that time, and amounting to the sum of 1104.09; that said Brooks on said day was and still remained an alderman and a member of the common council of said city, and as such on said day presented said bill to said council and requested payment of the same, and thereupon, on motion of said Brooks, said bill was by said council passed and ordered to be paid; that said action was personal between the parties thereto, and it was the sole duty of said Brooks to defend the same and pay all the expenses incurred in such defence, and all the damage recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>therein; that said Brooks employed said attorneys in his own behalf and their services were rendered under his direction and for his sole and exclusive benefit; that said city had no interest in the subject matter of said action, and was in no wise liable for any of the causes of action therein, never employed said attorneys, and had no legal power or right to employ them or to defend in said action; that lie was informed and believed, and therefore averred, that George F. Tracy, clerk of said city, intended to draw, and unless restrained would draw, his order upon Hervey Higby, treasurer of said city, in favor of said Brooks for the amount of said bill, and that said treasurer intended to pay and unless restrained would pay said sum to said Brooks upon said order, out of the funds of said city in his hands, or to be collected of the taxpayers of said city; that he was also informed and believed that the common council intended to assume the further prosecution of said motion in error and of the defense of the suit; praying for an injunction against said officers and against the city, forbidding such payment, and any further payments in the defense of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">The respondents filed an answer alleging that, pursuant to the authority conferred upon the respondents by their charter, a by-law was enacted in due form by the city of Bridgeport, approved in a city meeting December 15th, 1863, a copy of which was appended ; that pursuant to the provisions of the charter and by-law, said Brooks, named in said petition, was afterwards, and before the acts complained of, duly appointed superintendent of wharves, and held such office at the time of the alleged acts; that as such superintendent, the said Brooks was empowered, and it became his duty, to order that a certain vessel lying at the wharf of the petitioner in the city of Bridgeport, and within the limits of the district assigned to said Brooks as such superintendent by the common council, should be hauled astern far enough to permit a certain other vessel to obtain a berth at the adjoining dock, and that the suit referred to in the petition was brought by the petitioner to recover damages claimed by him therefor; that the said Brooks, as such superintendent and as the agent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>city by virtue of said appointment, bad full power and authority to make said order,- and the same was made by him honestly, in good faith and without malice, and was a just and reasonable order.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">Upon these pleadings the court made the following finding of facts:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">The court finds the facts to be as alleged in the petition, in relation to the petitioner being a taxpayer of the city, in relation to his bringing his action against Capt. Brooks and the proceedings had thereon, in relation to the employment of Messrs. Beardsley and. Sumner and the vote of the common council to pay their bill, and in relation to the contemplated payment by the city of the expense of the further prosecution of the defense to the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">The parties were at issue, whether Capt. Brooks was acting as the servant of the city; and within the scope of his powers' as superintendent of wharves, in doing the acts for which the action was brought, and whether the city council had power to pass the vote complained of. The petitioner also claimed that Capt. Brooks acted in-bad faith and maliciously, and the respondents claimed the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">It was. conceded that Capt. Brooks was appointed by the city superintendent of wharves, and that he held the appointment at the time of the acts complained of, and that the brig was lying within the limits of his jurisdiction as such superintendent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">The acts done by Brooks for which the petitioner\u2019s action was brought, appear at large in a report of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as detailed in 37 Conn. R., 365, to which it was agreed reference -might be had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">In addition to the evidence there reported, the respondents now examined Capt. Brooks as a witness, upon whose testimony the court finds that he acted in the premises at the request of Miller <em>&amp; </em>Co., and that he believed the brig could be safely hauled astern according to his order, and that she could safely discharge her cargo at the railroad dock,- at which, if hauled astern according to the effect of the order, the cargo would have been discharged; and that the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>complained of were done in the discharge of what he believed to be his duty, unless bad faiih may be inferred from the facts themselves as proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">The ninth section of the city charter provides as follows:\u2014 \u201c Said common council shall have power, by a major vote of those present, to make and ordain by-laws or ordinances relating to wharves, and the anchoring, moving and mooring of vessels within said city.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">The 32d section of the charter is as follows :\u2014\u201c The common council of said city shall have power and authority.to constitute and appoint all necessary and proper officers, under such names and appellations as they may deem appropriate, and may invest them with the power and authority necessary and proper, not inconsistent with the laws of this state and of the United States, to carry into effect all the by-laws, ordinances and lawful orders of the common council.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">The following by-law was passed by the common council and approved by the freemen of the city in a city meeting:\u2014'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">\u201c Seo. 1.

To support a vote of indemnity by a city the following requisites are indispensable, viz:\u20141. The party indemnified must have been in fact and in law an officer or agent of the city, invested with some legal authority with relation to the act for which he is sued. 2. The act must have been one performed in behalf of the city, as a municipal corporation, or the suit one in which the city in its corporate capacity had an interest. Dillon on Municp. Corp., \u00a7 98; <em>Halstead </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of N. York, </em>5 Barb., 218, 222; <em>S. C., </em>3 Comst., 430. So strictly is the rule held in this state, that in the well-known case of <em>Brainerd </em>v. <em>City of New London, </em>22 Conn., 556, it was held that the city \u25a0 could not vote money for an appropriate and laudable public purpose which was not a municipal object. And in <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>City of New Haven, </em>38 Conn., 368, the same distinction is drawn between public and municipal purposes with respect to the city\u2019s liability for damages; also in the later case of <em>Mead </em>v. <em>City of New Haven, </em>40 Conn., 72. The cases in which the municipality was held to. be authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>to indemnify its official agents, will all be found to come within this rule. <em>Nelson </em>v. Milford, 7 Pick., 18; <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Lynnfield, </em>18 id., 566; <em>Babbitt </em>v. Savoy, 3 Cush., 530 ; <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Nantucket, </em>12 id., 105; <em>Hadsell </em>v. Hancock, 3 Gray, 526 ; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>11 id., 340 ; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>12 N. Hamp., 278; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Plainfield, </em>45 id., 126; <em>Sherman </em>v. Carr, 8 R. Isl., 431.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-5\">2. Capt. Brooks was not invested with any legal authority whatever with respect to the act for which he was sued. It was not a case of exceeding his powers, but one of acting entirely without power. The charter of the city (sec. 9) authorizes the common council \u201c to make and ordain by-laws or ordinances relating to wharves and the anchoring, moving and mooring of vessels within said city.\u201d And this is the only authority that they have with relation to the subject, except such as is implied in _ section 32, where they arc empowered \u201c to constitute and appoint necessary and proper officers, &amp;c., and invest them with the authority necessary and proper, not inconsistent with the laws of this state and of the United States, to carry into effect all the by-laws, ordinances and lawful orders of the common council.\u201d Now what authority does section 9 confer upon the common council ? Simply to be the sole legislators of all necessary regulations concerning the use of wharves by vessels. They are not empowered to appoint officers to make such regulations, but are required to make such regulations themselves in the form of \u201c by-laws\u201d or \u201c ordinances,\u201d and are then authorized (sec. 32) to appoint all proper officers \u201c to carry such by-laws into effect.\u201d \u201c Bylaws\u201d and \u201cordinances\u201d are equivalent terms, and mean solemn public acts of a general application, made by the legislative authority. Dillon on Municp. Corp.. \u00a7\u00a7 244, 246. A by-law as to a particular individual is void. Id., \u00a7 256, .note 2. These powers of legislation cannot be delegated. Id., \u00a7\u00a7 60, 618 and note 2 ; <em>Barto </em>v. <em>Himrod, </em>8 N. York, 483. Subsequent acts of affirmance cannot validate an invalid \u25a0 ordinance. <em>Hydes </em>v. <em>Joyes, </em>4 Bush, 464. Now what have \u2022the common council by virtue of this authority done ? Have ;they passed a public \u201c by-law \u201d or \u201c ordinance\u201d relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>moving and mooring of vessels at wharves, by which all navigators and wharf-owners might know their rights and duties in the premises? Not at all. They have delegated that legislative power to Capt. John Brooks, giving him power to make, at his sovereign will and pl;asure, such orders and regulations as he shall see fit, and to enforce on the instant whatever \u201c orders\u201d he may at that instant choose to promulgate, with a penalty of \u201c thirty dollars per hour\u201d for questioning his authority in the premises. We say that this can in no sense be construed as a \u201c by-law relating to wharves,\u201d &amp;c. It is only by a very loose construction of the charter that such a sense can be claimed, and corporations arc held to a strict construction of these instruments. In case of doubt the construction is against the power. Dillon on Municp. Corp., \u00a7 55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-5\">3. The suit which the city proposes to adopt is not one in which it has any interest. The issue in it was strictly held to the question of personal malice on the part of Capt. Brooks \u2014a question the decision of which could in no way affect the interests of the city; and even had the question of malice not been involved, still the suit in its very nature was one of private controversy only. The case is the precise counterpart in this respect of <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Nantucket, </em>and <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Plainfield, </em>before cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-6\"><em>M. W. Seymour </em>and <em>DeForest, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-7\">1. It is one of the powers inherent in every municipal corporation to indemnify its officers and agents against liability which they may incur in the <em>lona fide </em>discharge of their duties, even though the result may show that they exceed their authority. Dillon on Municp. Corp., \u00a7 98; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>13 Maine, 74; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>12 N. Hamp., 278; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>6 Verm., 95 ; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>7 Pick., 18 ; <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Lynnfield, </em>18 id., 566 ; <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Savoy, </em>3 Cush., 530; <em>Hadsell </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>3 Gray, 526; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Groton, </em>11 id., 340 ; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>8 R. Isl., 431. This rule of law is decisive of the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-8\">2. Capt. Brooks was an officer or agent of the city of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Bridgeport within the meaning of the rule. He was regularly elected by the common council in strict compliance with the provisions of the charter. Even if his election had been informal and technically defective, so that lie could not strictly be called an officer of the city, yet he was an agent of the city, performing, at the request of the common council, duties which it was competent for them to entrust to him. So long as the very acts performed by him were not beyond the authority conferred by law upon the common council, the council having directed the acts to be done by him, or even having ratified and approved them, have made him their agent in the transactions, and have power to indemnify him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-5\">3. Ho was, as a municipal officer, acting for the interest of the city in a matter in which the city had a private and peculiar concern, and was not performing any public or governmental functions. <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>City of New Haven, </em>38 Conn., 368; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>City of New </em>Haven, 34 id., 1. But oven if he be regarded as a public or governmental officer, still the city has power to indemnify. <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Lynnfield, </em>18 Pick., 566 ; <em>Fuller </em>v. Groton, 11 Gray, 340 ; <em>Babbitt </em>v. <em>Savoy, </em>3 Cush., 530.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-6\">4. He did not exceed his authority. See charter and ordinance. But if it bo admitted that ho did exceed his authority, yet he certainly acted in good faith, as appears from the finding, and this is enough. In all the cited cases except three the officers exceeded their authority.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b84-7\">Phelps, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASb\">The record in this cause presents for decision the question whether the respondent is legally authorized to make an appropriation from its treasury to indemnify an officer appointed under a by-law enacted by its common council, and approved by itself, in pursuance of authority conferred by its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The officer or agent of a municipal corporation may he legally indemnified, provided he lias acted in good foith in the discharge of his official duty in a matter in which the corporation had an interest. and with respect to a duty imposed or. authorized by law. The general powers of such cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>porations are clearly prescribed, and those which are incidental, and implied .in aid of those expressed, are generally not difficult of designation. The authority to appropriate money for objects within the scope of the powers either conferred or implied, is indispensable to the pi\u2019oper and efficient exercise of municipal functions, but it is axx authority especially unsafe and liable to abuse, uxxless regulated by the application of sound legal pxdixciples, the interpretation of which is neither doubtful or discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The charter of the respondent gives its common \u2019 council power to ordain by-laws relating to whaxwes, and the anchoring, movixxg and mooring of vessels within its limits, and the care axxd management of all wharves axxd landing places, and authority to make axxd cause to be executed all proper orders ixx relation to the protection, use and improvexnent thereof, axid to appoixit all xxecessary and proper officers, and iixvest them with power and authority ixecessaxy axxd proper to carry into effect the by-laws, ordinances, and proper orders of its common council. Uxider the authority thus conferred the by-law ixx question, and the appoixxtxnexxt under it of Capt. Brooks as superintexxdent of wharves, were made. We are satisfied he was legally appoixxted, and that the by-law was regularly passed, axxd possessed all the validity of a lawful ordinance; axxd if the fact was decisive of the issue, we should have xxo difficulty ixx deciding that he believed himself at the tixne to be actixxg ixx the proper discharge of his official duty, axxd was xiot guilty of the bad faith axxd malicious coxxduct towards the petitioner which were imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">These coxxsideratioxxs, though ixnportaixt in themselves, and if fouxxd ixx favor of the petitioxxer controlliixg, are not so deeply ixnbedded ixx the real xnex\u2019its of the case, as the <em>question </em>whether the respondent had such an ixxterest ixx the subject xnatter of the controversy between the petitioxxer and Brooks as to entitle it to ixxdexnxiify the latter for the expenses incurred by him ixx defexidixxg in the litigatioxx which attexided that controversy. This question lies at the foundation of the case, and is vital as affecting the right of such corporatioxxs as the respondent to make pecuniary appropria<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tions for purposes not expressly, or by clear implication, within the grant of power on which all their corporate authority depends. The artificial legal body known as a municipal corporation is a creature of limited powers. It possesses only such as are specifically granted by the law which confers upon it the right to exist, and such others as are necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect those expressly given. These powers are derived from the general statutes, and from special acts of incorporation, and should not be unnecessarily extended by construction. The act sought to be done should be fairly within the scope of the corporate power, and the principle of implication from which authority not expressly given is claimed to be derived, should be always carefully guarded in the interest and for the protection of the citizen, whose property in the form of taxation is largely subject to the demands and under the control of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The by-law referred to is not compulsory in its terms, and does not assume to compel the officer appointed in pursuance of it to exer\u2019ciso official functions on peril o\u00ed a forfeiture for refusal. His prescribed duty is simply to hear applications and complaints, and issue orders for the adjustment of differences between those who make conflicting claims connected with the prosecution of their private business. If he consents to act it is at the request of the owners and masters of vessels and the owners and lessees of wharf property, and not at the request of the respondent, or of any of its officers or agents. His compensation, though determined by the by-law, is to be paid by the persons at whose request he acts. They may be non-residents and even aliens owing allegiance to a foreign government, and temporarily within the territorial limits of the corporation for purposes of commercial intercourse. He is not the agent or servant of the respondent, nor subject to its control, and it is not responsible for his official negligence, misconduct, or delinquency, nor benefited by his efficiency and fidelity. With respect to his official character and obligations, the respondent has \u201c no duty to perform, no rights to defend, and no interest to protect,\u201d and no pecuniary or corporate concern in the subject matter connected with the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>charge of his official duties. The want of interest involves the want of power, and is necessarily fatal to the claims of the respondent. <em>Merrill </em>v. Plainfield, 45 N.
