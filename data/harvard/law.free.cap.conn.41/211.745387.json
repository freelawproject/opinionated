H. </em>and <em>C.\u201d </em>Like bonds to double the amount of those guaranteed were to be left with the town as collateral security for its guarantee. Like votes were passed by all the towns on the line of the road. The second mortgage issued by the company had been previously made to the towns to secure bonds issued by them in aid of the railroad; all the towns however had voted to release this mortgage, but it had never been in fact released. The later mortgage given to secure the bonds to be guaranteed by the towns was therefore in fact a third mortgage, but the bonds were known as the \u201c second mortgage bonds,\u201d and were in fact the bonds intended by the town of Chatham in its vote. The company had complied with the conditions of the vote, and had delivered to <em>D </em>in payment of a debt of $5,700 due him for materials furnished for the completion of the road, bonds of three times that amount, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>an order upon the town for its guarantee of one-third of the bonds, the other two-thirds to be retained by the town as security.

In the year 1868 the several towns through which the road was to pass, and which were mentioned in the act of incorporation, were authorized by the legislature to loan their credit by the issue of their bonds for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the railroad to an amount not exceeding in the case of each town five per cent, of its grand levy, and to secure these bonds the railroad company was likewise authorized to execute a mortgage of all its property and franchises. Under the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>visions of its charter and these acts of the legislature, the corporation issued its bonds with coupons attached carrying interest at seven per cent, per annum, payable semi-annually; and secured the same by a mortgage of all its property, and franchises, dated May 31st, 1869. And the several towns of New Haven, Middlefield, Middletown, Portland Chatham and Hebron issued, and delivered to the railroad company their bonds with coupons attached bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent, per annum payable semi-annually, to the amount of one million one hundred thousand dollars, and in pursuance of the act the railroad company executed a second mortgage of all its franchises and property, dated June 5th, 1869, to secure the towns from all loss upon the bonds. Of these bonds the town of New Haven issued $500,000; the town of Middlefield $40,000; the town of Middletown $387,-000; the town of Portland $108,000; the town of Hebron $28,000; and the town of Chatham $37,000.

Buell, then the first selectman and one of the committee of the town of Chatham, as to the probability of the town guaranteeing the bonds and receiving the collaterals, and Buell informed him that he had no doubt that the town would guarantee the bonds whenever the road had been graded and the track permanently laid and cars had run to the village of East Hampton; and upon such assurance Douglas commenced to advance money for the purchase of ties, and notified the town and the selectmen of the town that he held the bonds and order of the company as before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-7\">The order so given to Douglas and the notice thereof to the town, were the sixth order and notice of the orders and notices so drawn and given to the town. It was the practice of the railroad company and of the contractors during the time of the execution of the contracts, to notify the town and its selectmen in writing from time to time as the orders were drawn. Buell, as the first selectman of the town and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>one of the committee, received notice of the orders and of the delivery of the bonds, and was depended on by the board of selectmen of the town to attend specially to the interests of the town in the road. Charles A. Buell, Cyrus Hurd, and William E. Barton were the selectmen, and from time to time Buell communicated the purport of the orders to the board of selectmen, and also informed the financial committee with regard to the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">The railroad bed was graded and the rails laid, and the cars carried freight to East Hampton, 'on or about February 13th, 1873, and freight was regularly carried from and after March 1st, 1873. On the 2d of March, 1873, the president and treasurer of the company met the board of selectmen, and the financial committee of the town, in the village of East Hampton, with one hundred and twenty thousand dollars of the mortgage bonds, and requested the guaranty of forty thousand dollars thereof, and proposed to leave the whole of the bonds with the selectmen or the financial committee, and requested them to signify whether they desired them to leave the bonds in their custody for that purpose; but both the selectmen and the financial committee refused to guarantee or receive the bonds, desiring time to take counsel thereon, and alleging as a reason for delay that they believed the road was not sufficiently ballasted to entitle the company to the guarantee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">This request and tender of the railroad company was made in the name of the company, but for the benefit of the several persons who had received the several orders before mentioned ; the bonds not having at that time been delivered to the persons holding the orders therefor, but being held by the company for their benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">Soon after the above interview the selectmen reported to the company that they had taken counsel, and that they should require the company to ballast the road more completely, and that when this was done the bonds would be guaranteed. At this time the road was in fact graded, the track was laid as tracks are usually laid on new railroads, and the cars had run thereon according to the conditions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>vote of the town ; and the company immediately completed the ballasting of the road according to the request of the selectmen and financial committee, and afterwards the company fully completed its road through the whole line thereof and regular trains for passengers and freight ran through from New Haven to East Hampton as early as May 20th, 1873 ; and regular trains have run through to Willimantic since on or about the 1st day of July, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">During the progress of the work in completing the railroad, neither the town of Chatham, nor any of its officers or agents, claimed any other construction of the vote to guarantee than that assumed to be the correct one by the company, and hy the relator and other contractors upon the road; nor were the company or the contractors notified or given to understand that any other construction of the vote to guarantee would be claimed by the town or its agents; but, on the contrary the latter recognized the construction put upon it by the company down to the time of the commencement of the present suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">In the completion of the road under the contracts, for the purpose of obtaining means to carry on the work and to equip the road, the towns of Middletown and Portland passed votes to relinquish their interest in the collaterals issued to them on their guaranty, amounting in the aggregate to $804,000 of the bonds; and the town of Chatham was requested to likewise release its interest in the collaterals, the second mortgage bonds, so called, which the town was to have for its guaranty, and a meeting of the electors of the town was called for that purpose, and held on the 5th of September, 1872, and adjourned to the 9th, at which the town voted to take no further action on the subject. Another meeting was also called and held for the same purpose on the 25th of September, 1872, at which the town voted \u201c to make no change in their affairs with the railroad company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">On the 10th of February, 1873, a meeting of the town was called, the warning of which stated the object of the meeting as follows :\u2014To act on a petition of Thomas H.

At this meeting the town voted to allow' gentlemen from Middletown to address the meeting. The relator offered evidence to show that thereupon the several parties so invited to speak informed the meeting that they represented parties holding the bonds to be guaranteed and the accompanying orders and stated the manner of their obtaining the same, and particularly in the case of the relator, and that they protested against any rescission of the vote, and that the action of the town in refusing to rescind the vote was taken after the protest of these parties. The court rejected the evidence, but it the same was admissible, found that the action of the town in neglecting to rescind the vote was had with full knowledge on the part of the meeting and of the selectmen of ail the facts herein-before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">On the 13th of October, 1873, at a meeting of the selectmen of the town, Allyn M. Colegrove, the treasurer of the company, with its secretary and the relator, appeared before the board, and exhibited to them the said bonds and order held by the relator, and requested of the selectmen that they would place the guaranty of the town upon $5,700 of the bonds, and receive double the amount of the same kind of bonds as collateral security; but the selectmen declined, so to do, giving as a reason therefor that the security was not sufficient, stating that if they would make it sufficient they would guarantee the bonds.

As to the constitutional question.\u2014The power of the legislature of this state to authorize municipal corporations to tax themselves in aid of railroads has been so often sustained by our courts that it cannot be questioned. If the legislative department, in its discretion, conceives that the public good is to be served by the grant, the judiciary cannot call it in' question. <em>City of Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Housatonic Railroad Co., </em>15 Conn., 475; <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>City of New London, </em>29 id., 174; <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Town of Woodbury, </em>32 id., 128. The granting and exercise of such power has been sustained in the courts of last resort in the states of Vermont, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Alabama, and by the following cases in the federal courts: <em>Gelpcke </em>v. <em>City of Dubuque, </em>1 Wall., 175 ; <em>Seybert </em>v. <em>City of Pittsburgh, </em>id., 273; <em>Van Hostrup </em>v. <em>Madison City, </em>id., 291; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>City of Muscatine, </em>id., 384; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>3 id., 654; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>County of Otoe, </em>16 id., 667. Redfield, in his treatise on the Law of Railways, (ed. 1869, p. 397,) says <em>:\u2014\u201c </em>These questions seem now to be placed completely at rest, \u00a30 far as the validity of the statutes of state legislatures authorizing towns, cities, counties, and other similar corporations to subscribe to the capital stock of railways is concerned. The question of expediency and even of legality is still discussed as a speculative inquiry, and occasionally we notice a feeble judicial remonstrance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-6\">2. As to the claim that the town\u2019s investment in the railroad did not amount to the sum of' $40,000.\u2014The respondents contend that the vote is void because the statute authorizing it limited the town to the amount the town then had <em>\u201c </em>invested in the railroad; \u201d and that the town investment is limited to the <em>cash </em>the town had actually paid out for stock. The second section of the statute authorized' the towns \u201c <em>severally </em>to guarantee the payment of bonds, * to an amount that shall not exceed the sum of 17.00,000 in the whole; and in no event to exceed the amount of 'investment \u2018 <em>the said towns </em>\u2019 may already have in said, railroad;'\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>But the statute is to be construed so as to effect its object. In terms it authorizes the towns to guarantee such sums as shall not exceed $700,000 in the aggregate. Now, if the term \u201cinvestment\u201d is to be limited to the stock, it follows that only $553,000 can be guaranteed in the whole, that being the whole amount of the stock taken by the towns. But such a construction cannot be justified. The statute does not limit the expression \u201c investment\u201d to money. Issuing bonds in aid of a corporation is a loan of money. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Alleghany </em>County, 37 Penn. S. R., 241; <em>Rogers </em>v. Burlington, 3 Wall., 654. But the discussion of this question is premature. The vote is to guarantee an amount \u201c <em>that shall not exceed </em>$40,000.\u201d If not good for that sum it is good for the $35,000 that the respondents admit that they have invested in stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-5\">3. The non-negotiability of the guarantee.\u2014The suggestion was made in the court below that a guarantee was not negotiable. It is not easily seen how that question can affect this case. The question here is not whether a guarantee is negotiable, nor as to the effect of the guarantee after being placed on the paper. The guarantee is not yet given, and our present suit is to compel the respondents to give it. The bonds when given will be payable to bearer. By the policy of our modern decisions, railroad bonds where payable t'o some particular person or officer, are construed as payable to bearer. The title to them passes by delivery. The holder is entitled to sue in his own name. <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>City of New </em>London, 29 Conn., 196 ; <em>White </em>v. <em>Vermont &amp; Massachusetts R. R. </em>Co., 21 Howard, 575; <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>same, </em>8 Gray, 575.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">4. As to the claim that \u201c the town voted to guarantee the second mortgage bonds of the railroad company, and that the bonds tendered were, in fact, secured by a third mortgage.\u2014The finding of the court is that the bonds contemplated by all parties, and intended by the vote, were those in question. This series of bonds was known by this name by the railroad company, by the town officers, and by the public generally. The court is to construe the vote so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>as to make it apply to something. The Superior Court finds that it applies to these bonds, and if not to these, then it can apply to nothing. The vote is inoperative without this construction, and the court will assume any possible construction rather than the one which renders the vote inoperative. The court properly admitted the evidence to show that these were the bonds to which the contract in fact referred. Whatever ambiguity there is, is in the application of the contract, and can be explained by parol. <em>Selwood </em>v. <em>Mildmay, </em>8 Ves. Jr., 306; <em>Goodtitle </em>v. Southern, 1 Maule &amp; Selw., 299; <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>2 Mees. <em>&amp; </em>Wels., <em>809; </em>1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-5\">5. As to the claim that the avails of the bonds were not to be used until after the road was completed to East Hampton. \u2014The claim is that the vote is a specific appropriation of the avails of the bonds to the completion of such part of the railroad as might remain unfinished after the cars had passed from Middletown to East Hampton village. Such a construction is entirely forced; is without any fact in the case to warrant it; and is against the obvious intention of the parties. The expression \u201c <em>on and after,\u201d </em>was intended to apply solely to the time when the guarantee should be given, not to the time when the work was to be done upon which the bonds were to apply. The vote should be construed as if it read thus <em>:\u2014\u201c </em>The town authorize and direct the selectmen to endorse and guarantee an amount of second mortgage bonds that shall not exceed in amount 140,000, (said bonds to be used in the completion of said railroad,) on and after, &amp;c.\u201d These town votes were passed to effect the completion of the road. The whole road was under contracts required by the towns, and known to be conditionally executed. The road was to be completed by means of them. These contracts appropriated all of these bonds, and the bonds were the funds relied upon. The votes were to afford the company the means to execute them- It cannot be said, in the face of these facts, that the company could not contract to deliver these bonds when they were entitled to receive them. The claim in the answer that the vote contemplated the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the <em>avails </em>of the bonds after the cars ran to East Hampton, &amp;c., is opposed by the fact that the road could not be completed under the existing contracts without them. The work was to be prosecuted on all points simultaneously; and the vote says nothing about \u201c <em>avails </em>\u201d of the bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-5\">6. The claim that Douglas had no assignable interest in the bonds or vote.\u2014The claim is that no one else but the railroad company could have any interest in the bonds at the time .of guaranteeing them. But the. vote was in effect an offer of guarantee to' the extent limited to whoever held the order. It was.like an offer of guarantee to \u201cwhomsoever it might concern.\u201d An agreement to guarantee not addressed \u2022 to any particular person, may be acted on by any one, and bind the guarantor. <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>22 Verm., 160; <em>Lawrason </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>3 Cranch, 492 ; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Wiggin, </em>2 Story, 213; 2 Am. Lead. Cas., 233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-6\">7. The contract is severable. Being passed to aid in the completion of contracts then outstanding, the vote contemplates divers parties who are to receive the guarantee bonds in the execution of the contracts. The vote speaks expressly of the performance of the conditions by the agents of the railroad company. The consideration of the guarantee was several, and moved from several parties; an important circumstance on the question of a joint or several contract. 1 Parsons Cont., 5th ed., 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-7\">8. A mandamus will lie to protect the relator\u2019s interest. The law gives him no other adequate legal remedy. The question is not whether the relator\u2019s interest in the subject matter is legal or equitable, immediate or remote, but has he a <em>specific </em>right of any character, not shared by the public, towards which the officer or corporation sustains a relation imposing a <em>legal </em>duty. If the duty is a legal duty, the remedy may be mandamus. When the authorities say that a mandamus will lie only to enforce \u201c a legal right,\u201d they mean a legal obligation or duty of the respondent. In <em>Ex parte Napier, </em>12 Eng. L. <em>&amp; </em>Eep, 452, the court say that \u201c a <em>legal obligation </em>is the proper substratum of mandamus.\u201d A contract relation is not required to sustain this writ. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>relator\u2019s right may be cognizable in a court of equity; it may be of a political, judicial, social, or religious character; but whatever its character, or origin, if a public or corporate officer withholds a legal duty, on his part, towards such right, the writ may be sustained. The applicant must have some particular right or privilege, independently of that which he holds in common with the public at large. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>30 Brewst. Penn.

The legislature had no power to authorize the town of Chatham to guarantee the bonds of the railroad company. Wo arc aware that the Supreme Court of this state, as well as the courts of other states, in former years have held that the legislature could rightfully authorize municipalities to aid in the construction of railroads, but of late the best judicial .minds of the country have hesitated. The reasons for denying this right are strongly set forth in the opinions of Dillon, C. J., in <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>27 Iowa, 28; of Dixon, C. J., in <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Sheboygan, &amp;c., R. R. Co., </em>25 Wis., 167 ; of Cooley, C. J., in <em>People </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>20 Mich., 452; and of Appleton, C. J., in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Jay, </em>12 Am. Law Reg., N. S., 481; to which last case is added an elaborate note by Judge Redfield in approval of the positions taken. The case of <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>City of Boston, </em>recently decided in Massachusetts, and not yet reported, is to the same effect. The cases which have sustained the right have done so because,\u20141st. Under the principle of eminent domain, courts have held it competent for railroad companies to acquire the right of way <em>in invitum. </em>2d.. On the ground that the construction of railroads is for the public good. These are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>only grounds, so far as we are aware, upon which municipal aid to railroads has been sustained. We answer that it cannot be sustained on the principle of eminent domain, because,\u20141st. The company can'take the property only upon paying a just compensation in <em>*money; </em>the general good to the community in which the owner lives is not permitted to be taken into consideration. 2d. It is a proceeding <em>in rem </em>against the property desired to be taken. 3d. It only appropriates the <em>use </em>of the property and does not absolutely divest the owner of it. 4th. Jurists who have upheld these aids make public good identical with public use. It is conceded that the property of a person cannot be taken from him and appropriated to 'a private use. This principle is clearly settled in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>4 Hill, 140, Judge Bronson giving the opinion of the court, and this 'cloctrine is endorsed in Sedgwick on Constitutional Law, 155 and note. 5th. If these terms are identical, then there is no limitation on the appropriation of private property by municipal legislative action. Manufactories, mills, stores, shops and dwelling houses for cheap rents are all for the public good, and if the terms are identical, appropriations can be made for them as well as for railroads, for they are in no greater sense for _the public good. By reason of the confused blending of these terms by the courts, the legislatures of some states have passed laws authorizing municipalities to loan their credit or make gratuities to manufactories and mills established within their limits. This was recently done in Maine. The town of Jay voted to loan its credit to a manufacturing concern if it would remove to that town. Upon an injunction brought to restrain the town, the Supreme Judicial Court denied the power of the legislature to authorize any such appropriation. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of </em>Jay, 12 Am. Law Reg., N. S. 481. There must be a <em>public use </em>separate and apart from a public good. What is the legal significance of <em>&amp; public use? </em>We think it is a use by the general public unobstructed by the intervention of any private right. This is the sense in which we use the term when applied to court houses, school houses, or highways. Every person has the <em>free </em>right to <em>use </em>them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>for the purposes for which they were created without being obstructed by the intervention of the private rights of any person. Another element must enter into this right; there must be not only a public use but also a public exigency existing. This doctrine is laid down by Judge Woodbury in <em>West River Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Dix, </em>6 How., 545. He says:\u2014\u25a0 \u201cNor do I agree that in all cases of public use, property which is suitable or appropriate can be condemned. The doctrine that this right of eminent domain exists for every kind of public use, or for such use when merely convenient, though not necessary, does not seem to me by any means clearly maintainable. It is too broad, too open to abuse.\u201d There was no great public necessity for a railroad through the town of Chatham. 6th. A railroad is a private corporation. It is as essentially private as any corporation created by the legislature. It is true the legislature may have some supervision over railroads, but we apprehend that this will be found to exist under the police power. The legislature cannot compel the companies to build their road, nor change, vary or destroy the rights created by the charter, as they can those of towns, cities and boroughs.\u2014These acts are also sought to be justified under the taxing power. Taxation in the modern sense is of' but recent origin. Government was formerly maintained in times of peace by voluntary contributions, and in war by the vassals furnishing men and means. After the decay of feudal customs, the sovereigns resorted to forced contributions, and the people rebelled and extorted from their unwilling rulers the great principle that the property as well as the person of the subject should be free from unwarranted seizure. Webster, in his dictionary, defines a tax as follows :\u2014\u201c A rate or sum of money assessed on the person or property of a citizen by government for the use of the nation or state.\u201d Cooley (Const. Lim., 479,) says:\u2014 \u201cTaxes are burdens or charges imposed by the legislature upon persons or property to raise money for <em>public </em>purposes.\u201d And on page 487:\u2014\u201c Taxation has for its only legitimate object the raising of money for public purposes and the proper needs of government; the exaction of money from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the citizens for other purposes is not a proper exercise of the power, and must therefore be unauthorized.\u201d See also <em>San son </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>27 Iowa, 28. The idea of taxation does not contemplate that money should be raised and paid out to a private corporation for the building of a railroad. 7th. The act of the legislature of 1871, under which the town of Chatham voted, introduces a new and dangerous principle. It authorizes towns to engage in an entirely new business, namely, that of endorsing and guaranteeing commercial paper. This is extra-municipal and ought not to be upheld. It will most certainly lead to very dangerous consequences.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\">2. The act of the legislature giving authority to the towns to guarantee the bonds of the railroad company, conferred unusual and extraordinary powers upon the towns. The towns had no authority to guarantee except what was derived from said act. 1 Dillon Munic. Corp., \u00a7 398. It Was no part of the duties for which towns were created. The action of the towns therefore to be binding must strictly follow the act. The act authorized the towns to guarantee bonds which the road might issue under the act of the legislature passed at the session in 1871. The towns could not vote to guarantee any other bonds. If they did their action was void. The town of Chatham voted to guarantee <em>second </em>mortgage bonds. The bonds issued by the railroad company under the authority of ,'tlie act of 1871 were not second mortgage bonds. There were two mortgages upon the road at the time; hence the mortgage made to secure the bonds was a <em>third </em>mortgage, and the bonds were <em>third </em>mortgage bonds, as they were secured by a third mortgage. The language of the vote of the town is clear and distinct in reference to the ldnd of bonds they voted to guarantee. There is no ambiguity. No parol testimony therefore can be introduced to explain or vary \u25a0the meaning of the words used. Fell on Guarantees, (Am. ed.,) 83; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>4 Cranch, 224.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">3. The vote is so uncertain in its character that it is invalid and not obligatory upon the selectmen. It leaves it to their discretion to fix the amount. They may limit the amount to be guaranteed, and after they have guaranteed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>one hundred dollar bond, they can stop, and no power can compel them to guarantee more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-4\">4. The vote of the town contemplated that the bonds guaranteed by the town should be used in the completion of the road <em>after </em>cars had been run to East Hampton. The town had a right to prescribe such a condition in their vote. They had a right to say <em>when </em>they would guarantee, and <em>where </em>upon the road the avails of the bonds which the town might guarantee should be used. The language of the vote would clearly imply that no part of the avails of the bonds to be guaranteed should be used west of East Hampton. Douglas bought the ties and they were delivered on the road in December, 1872, and January, 1873; and from anything that appears were used in the road before th.e cars reached East Hampton. The bonds were delivered to Douglas, December 21, 1872, together with the request to guarantee them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\">5. The authority given to the town was, that they might guarantee bonds ol the company to an amount not to exceed the amount then invested in the road. If the town had any investment at all authorized by law in the road, at the time of passing the vote, it .had only invested $35,000; therefore the vote to guarantee $40,000 is void. The thirty-seven thousand dollars of bonds loaned the company, and for which the town held a mortgage, was not an\u2018investment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-6\">6. The undertaking to guarantee is personal with the railroad company, and is not assignable. 2 Parsons on Notes <em>&amp; </em>Bills, 133; <em>Tyler </em>v. Binney, 7 Mass., 479; <em>True </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>21 Pick., 140; <em>Belcher </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>7 Cush., 482; <em>How </em>v. <em>Kemball, </em>2 McLean, 103; <em>Springer </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>19 Maine, 359; <em>Irish </em>v. <em>Cutter, </em>31 id., 536 ; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>19 Ohio, 130. Douglas cannot maintain this action because it was an entire contract to guarantee $40,000 of the bonds. It was made with the railroad company, and cannot be divided up and parceled out to several individuals, giving each a right of action against the town. By the vote, the bonds, after they were guaranteed, were to be handed over to a finance committee of the town, and by them <em>delivered to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>the railroad company </em>on certain conditions to be performed by tbe company.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-5\">Carpenter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXE\">The principal question in this case, whether the legislature has the constitutional power to authorize towns to aid in the construction of railroads, is hardly an open question in this state. Successive legislatures have assumed the existence of the power, and granted authority to towns and cities to issue bonds, and in other ways to aid in building railroads, and the action 'of towns and cities pursuant to such authority has been held by this court to be valid and binding. <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Housatonic Railroad Co., </em>15 Conn., 475; <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>City of New London, </em>29 Conn. 174. The same principle is recognized in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Town of Woodbury, </em>32 Conn., 118. The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are to the same effect. <em>Gelpcke </em>v. <em>City of Dubuque, </em>1 Wall., 175; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>3 Wall., 654; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>County of </em>Otoe, 16 Wall., 667. Whatever therefore we may think of the expediency of its exercise, we are not at liberty to deny the existence of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">It is further contended that the town voted to guarantee bonds secured by a second mortgage of the railroad franchise and property, and that the bonds they are now asked to guar antee are secured only by a third mortgage. The record shows that the first mortgage was given to secure bonds issued by the railroad company, that the second mortgage was given to secure bonds issued by the towns in aid of the railroad; that the several towns, including the town of Chat-ham, acting through their respective committees or agents duly authorized, had agreed with each other and the railroad company to release the last named mortgage, so far as the towns were concerned, and that the towns, at meetings duly warned for that purpose, had voted, upon certain conditions, to release the mortgage accordingly, and that the conditions had been complied with. This -action of the towns was ratified and .confirmed by the legislature. It was the understanding that the release of the mortgage was to be executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>by all the towns simultaneously, but it was not executed by any of them. The railroad company, relying upon this action of the towns, and their votes to guarantee bonds, entered into contracts for the completion of the road, issued its bonds, and executed a mortgage in due form for their security. That mortgage described the two prior mortgages, and stated the fact that the towns had voted to release the mortgage given to secure the town bonds. Had the towns in fact released the mortgage, the bonds now in suit would have been practically second mortgage bonds. That is precisely what all the parties contemplated. Hence the bonds were known and-called by the parties concerned and by the public generally \u201c second mortgage bonds and it is expressly found that whatever may be the proper name of these bonds they \u201c are the bonds which the town of Chatham by its vote intended to guarantee.\u201d In order therefore to give effect to the obvious intention of the parties, we must regard them as \u201c second mortgage bonds \u201d within the meaning of the vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It is objected however, not very strongly to be sure, that the evidence upon which these facts were found was not admissible. We think the evidence was clearly admissible. It was not offered or received to explain a vote in itself free from ambiguity, but to show the circumstances connected with the transaction, for the purpose of applying the vote to the subject matter contemplated and intended by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The vote of the town is as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Will the town of Chatham authorize and direct the selectmen to endorse and guarantee an amount of second mortgage bonds of the New Haven, Middletown &amp; Willimantic Railroad Company, that shall not exceed in amount the sum of forty thousand dollars, said bonds to be used to aid in the completion of said railroad, on and after such time as said road shall have been graded, the track laid permanently, and cars shall have passed over said road from the city of New Haven to the village of East Hampton in said Chatham.\u201d The defendants claim that, under this vote, the avails of the bonds to be guaranteed can only be used in completing the road after the track was laid permanently, and the cars had passed over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>road to East Hampton; -while the plaintiff claims that the expression, \u201c on and after such time, &amp;c.,\u201d relates solely to the time of guaranteeing the bonds, and does not limit the use of the avails of the bonds. We think the latter construction is the correct one. The object of the town was to secure the completion of the. road to East Hampton. That being accomplished, they received the benefit of their investment, whether the money was used to pay for work done at one time or another. The limitation of the use to any particular time or place was not essential; the whole object was accomplished by fixing a period in the progress of the work before which the bonds should not be guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The claim of the defendants that the vote to guarantee bonds to the amount of $40,000 is void for the reason that the amount of stock owned by the town was only $35,000, cannot'be sustained. If it be true, as they assume, that the amount <em>invested </em>by the town was only $35,000, the vote is not void, but is valid for that amount. But we see no difficulty in regarding the bonds issued by the town, the avails of which were used in the construction of the railroad, as an \u201c investment.\u201d The defendants themselves so regarded them, and we think properly. Therefore the vote of the town does not exceed the authority conferred by the act of the legislature, which limits the amount to be guaranteed to the amount invested in the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Wo have no occasion to consider the question whether a guarantee, or an agreement to guarantee, is negotiable. This is not an action upon such a contract. It is simply a proceeding in the name and in behalf of the state to compel public officers to perform an official act. The only point of view in which this question can be important in the present case is in determining whether Mr. Douglas has sucli an interest in the subject matter as that he may be a relator. The view we have taken of other questions in the case renders this question unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">And this brings us to the question whether in this case a peremptory mandamus can properly issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The vote of the town was to do one act\u2014to guarantee bonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>not exceeding in amount the sum of 140,000. Not only the time but the manner of doing it was carefully provided for in the vote. The selectmen were to place the endorsement or guarantee upon the bonds; a financial committee was appointed, whose duty it was to receive such bonds from the selectmen, transfer them to the railroad company, and receive in exchange therefor from the company in its second mortgage bonds double\u201d the amount so guaranteed. This vote measures and defines the exact duty of the selectmen. They were under no obligation to guarantee bonds in any other way, and had no authority to do so. This proceeding is instituted to compel the selectmen to guarantee only those bonds in which the relator has a special interest. If this can be sustained each of the other parties interested may also resort to this writ. Thus the duty of the selectmen to do a single act, may be made the subject of as many suits as there happen to be parties interested in its performance. There is no necessity for issuing several writs of mandamus to compel the performance of a single duty and we are not aware of any authority that will justify it. As the mandatory clause in the alternative writ follows the application, and as the peremptory writ in this respect must follow strictly the alternative writ, it follows that the peremptory writ cannot legally issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The writ, if issued against the selectmen, should command them to perform their whole duty under the vote, and not a part of it merely. That cannot be done in the present case for another reason. Neither the application nor the writ contains an averment that the selectmen have been requested to perform this whole duty, dr have ever refused to perform it. It is true the court has found such a request and refusal, but in the absence of any averment to that effect the finding is of no avail. A refusal to do the required act is essential and must be averred. Eor this reason also this proceeding must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Again\u2014 this writ simply requires the respondents to guarantee the bonds in which the relator has an 'interest, without providing for their subsequent disposition, or that the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>shall receive the stipulated security. If the import of the writ is to require the town to place its guarantee upon bonds belonging to the relator and leave them with him without such security, it is clear that the writ should not issue. If, as may be suggested, a proviso to the effect that the relator should leave with the town the required security may be implied from the whole proceeding, we reply that in a prerogative writ a substantial and material matter like this should not be left to implication. The duty required should be clearly and distinctly stated and the rights of the respondents should be expressly and carefully guarded. In this respect too the writ is fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">For the reasons last stated we must advise the Superior Court to render judgment for the. respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
