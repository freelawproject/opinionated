In his petition for review, Tham first argues that he qualified for asylum. We note that the Board expressly affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Tham\u2019s asylum application was not timely filed and that no exceptions applied to excuse the untimeliness. As Tham does not challenge the Board\u2019s finding that Tham\u2019s asylum application was untimely, we conclude that he has waived this claim on appeal. <em>See Niang v.Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 510 n. 5 (4th Cir.2007) (noting that finding of untimeliness was waived on appeal, and if not court would lack jurisdiction to review it). We therefore may not review Tham\u2019s claim that he is eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Tham next challenges the Board\u2019s finding that he failed to qualify for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430,104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Tham did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
