Robert Neathery was insured under his employer\u2019s welfare benefit plan, which provided accidental death insurance coverage under two policies issued by Life Insurance Company of North America (\u201cLINA\u201d). Once her administrative remedies were \u201cdeemed exhausted,\u201d <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 <em>2560.503-1(l), </em>Neathery brought suit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. Section 1001, <em>et seq., </em>in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">The district court affirmed LINA\u2019s findings, relying in large part on a report by LINA\u2019s expert, Dr. Lewis (\u201cLewis Report\u201d). ER 50-67. Neathery argues that the administrative record closed on September 20, 2005 \u2014 the date LINA\u2019s appeal was due to be decided under the ERISA deadlines \u2014 and that the Lewis Report, which was presented several months after that date, was inadmissible as part of the administrative record subject to review. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(i)(l)(i), (l). The passing of ERISA deadlines does not, by itself, signal the close of the administrative record, because it does not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201calter the substantive relationship\u201d between the parties. <em>See Gatti v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>415 F.3d 978, 985 (9th Cir.2005). In this case, the district court correctly ruled that Neathery had exhausted her administrative remedies before filing suit, a ruling that LINA does not challenge. ER 78. Because Neathery exhausted her remedies and properly brought suit, the relationship of the parties had changed. <em>Gatti, </em>415 F.3d at 985. LINA submitted the Lewis Report nearly three months after the administrative record closed. The district court therefore erred in admitting the Lewis Report as part of the administrative record in its review of LINA\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and REMANDED in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b510-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
