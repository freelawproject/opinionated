McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">A jury convicted defendant-appellant Marvin L. Barber of one count of Possession with the Intent to Distribute Cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii); one count of Unlawful Possession of a Firearm by Convicted Felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2); and one count of Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). His counsel has submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and seeks leave to withdraw from representing Mr. Barber on appeal. Although he has briefed two issues for our consideration concerning Mr. Barber\u2019s conviction, counsel asserts in his motion to withdraw that neither of these issues has merit, and that \u201ccounsel does not believe that there are any issues that can be raised on appeal that are not frivolous.\u201d Mot. to Withdraw as Counsel of Record, at 1-2. In response, Mr. Barber has filed a pro se brief raising one additional issue for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The government contends that none of the three issues raised is meritorious. We agree. Accordingly, exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm Mr. Barber\u2019s conviction and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">On November 30, 2004, four Tulsa police officers executed a search warrant at a residence located at 3324 North Garrison Avenue in Tulsa, Oklahoma, seeking evidence of criminal activity involving illegal drugs. The warrant was a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d warrant; that is, the officers did not know who lived at the residence or who might have been dealing drugs there. At approximately 9:40 p.m., Officer Bruce Bonham knocked on the door and announced the presence of officers with a warrant. When no one inside responded after approximately twenty seconds, officers breached the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">In the dining room, officers found Roman Checotah and took him into custody. In that room they also found marijuana, suspected narcotics, and a digital scale. They also found baggies in the kitchen area. Officer Bill Yelton then saw Mr. Barber come out of the bathroom. He took him to the dining room and handcuffed him. He noticed that Mr. Barber\u2019s hands were wet, but he did not include this information in the incident report. Officers Bonham, Jeff Henderson, and Sergeant Luke Sherman also noticed that Mr. Barber had wet hands, and later testified to this fact at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">The officers finished searching the residence. Officer Yelton searched the bathroom that Mr. Barber had exited. Inside the toilet bowl, he found a handgun and baggies containing what appeared to be cocaine base. He also found a baggie containing suspected cocaine base on the bathroom floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Officer Yelton read Mr. Barber his rights. Mr. Barber told the officers that he did not live at the residence. He stated that Mr. Checotah was cooking the powder cocaine into crack cocaine for him; that he was there to pick it up; and that he intended to sell it. He indicated that the pistol was used for protection. The officers did not obtain either a handwritten statement or a signature on a waiver of rights form from Mr. Barber.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Mr. Barber\u2019s car was parked in the garage and the garage door was closed. In the living room, the officers found a purse containing identification in the name of Montenae Foreman. Ms. Foreman, the renter of the premises at 3324 North Garrison, arrived home after Mr. Barber and Mr. Checotah had been removed from the premises. Officer Yelton testified that he spoke with Ms. Foreman that evening after she returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Mr. Barber\u2019s theory at trial appears to have been that Mr. Checotah was the \u201creal\u201d drug dealer, who lived at Ms. Foreman\u2019s house and dealt drugs there with Ms. Foreman\u2019s knowledge. The defense seemed to suggest that Mr. Barber\u2019s presence on the night the search warrant was executed was coincidental, because he was there only to meet Ms. Foreman for a prearranged rendezvous.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Mr. Barber attempted to bolster this theory with Ms. Foreman\u2019s testimony. She testified that she had known Mr. Checotah for five years and considered him her uncle. He had been living with her aunt but moved out following an argument and had been living at Ms. Foreman\u2019s house for several months. She was aware that he had prior involvement with drugs, but she had given him a key to her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Ms. Foreman further stated that Mr. Barber did not have a key. She had known Mr. Barber for approximately four months. They saw each other about twice a month to have sexual relations. On the evening when the search warrant was executed, she called Mr. Barber at around 9:15 p.m. and asked him to meet her at her house. She gave him directions to the house, told him to park in the garage, and informed him that Mr. Checotah would be there to let him in. She stated she had never met Mr. Barber at her house before because she did not want her boyfriend to find out about their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">On rebuttal, the prosecution called Officer Yelton, who gave a very different version of events based on his recollection of what Ms. Foreman had told him the night of the arrests. At that time, according to Officer Yelton, Ms. Foreman told him that Mr. Barber had a key to her house. In the mind of the jury, this testimony could have connected Mr. Barber more than incidentally to the premises where drugs were being sold. She stated Mr. Barber was not supposed to be there that evening, undermining his explanation that she had invited him there for a sexual rendezvous. Finally, she denied knowing Mr. Checotah, undermining Mr. Barber\u2019s theory that Mr. Checotah was the \u201creal\u201d drug dealer at her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Finally, at trial, Mr. Barber stipulated that the substances recovered in the bathroom were cocaine base; that the pistol recovered from the toilet was a fully functional firearm; and that the pistol must have traveled in interstate commerce to reach the location where it was found. He also stipulated that he had previously been convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year (i.e., that he had prior felony convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\"><em>Anders </em>instructs that \u201cif counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after conscientious examination of it, he should so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>advise the court and request permission to withdraw. That request must, however, be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Mr. Barber\u2019s counsel has complied with his obligation under Anders and has identified issues for our review, although he has conceded that they are not legally viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">1. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We agree with counsel that a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence would be meritless. \u201cWe review de novo whether the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to support a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Avery, </em>295 F.3d 1158, 1177 (10th Cir.2002). \u201cIn conducting this review ... we ask whether, taking the evidence-both direct and circumstantial, together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom \u2014 in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Three major categories of evidence support the jury\u2019s verdict against Mr. Barber: (1) his confession to the officers; (2) the stipulated facts in the record; and (3) the facts of the offense as related in the officers\u2019 testimony at trial. These facts plainly provide a basis for the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Counsel argues that there were irregularities in connection with the confession, but he does not contend that it should have been suppressed. Officer Yelton testified that he read Mr. Barber his rights before he made his statement. There is no indication that he did not understand the advisement or that his confession was involuntary. The lack of a signed <em>Miranda </em>form and of a handwritten confession do not make the confession inadmissible. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501(e) (defining \u201cconfession\u201d admissible in federal criminal proceedings to include both oral and written confessions); <em>United States v. Lugo, </em>170 F.3d 996,1004-05 (10th Cir.1999) (stating <em>Miranda </em>waiver is not invalidated where it is oral rather than written).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In light of Mr. Barber\u2019s confession, Ms. Foreman\u2019s testimony did not prevent a reasonable jury from finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the jury would have been entitled to discount her trial testimony, which differed from what she allegedly told Officer Yelton at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">2. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Counsel argues that convicting Mr. Barber of both unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime violated double jeopardy, because both offenses involved the use of the same firearm at the same time. This objection was not raised at trial and therefore a plain error standard applies. Plain error \u201cis fundamental error, something so basic, so prejudicial, so lacking in its elements that justice cannot have been done.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>530 F.3d 1292, 1299-1300 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 583, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2008). But there is no error here, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Ordinarily, the test in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) applies to such a double jeopardy claim, requiring us to ask whether each of the offenses for which the defendant was convicted required proof of a different element. Here, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, for the government was required to prove two such differing elements: Mr. Barber\u2019s conviction of a felony, which applied only to the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon charge; and his commission of a drug traf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>ticking crime, which applied only to the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Mr. Barber argues, however, that <em>Block-burger </em>doesn\u2019t apply to his case because he was punished under two provisions of the same statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. He cites <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>130 F.3d 1420 (10th Cir.1997), in which this court found multiplicitous the defendant\u2019s conviction for both being a felon in possession of a firearm, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and being an unlawful user of controlled substances in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3). But <em>Johnson </em>is distinguished from this case. In <em>Johnson, </em>this court concluded that Congress did not intend to punish a defendant for multiple violations of \u00a7 922(g) that arose out of the same factual predicate: possession of a firearm. Here, although the definitions of both firearms offenses cite 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924, only the \u201cpossession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime\u201d count actually is a \u00a7 924 offense. Section 924 merely provides a punishment provision for the other crime, \u201cpossession of a firearm by a convicted felon,\u201d which is charged under a separate statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Therefore, Mr. Barber was not convicted of two firearms offenses under two different subsections of the same statute, as he claims. The <em>Blockburger </em>test applies and was satisfied. There was no double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">3. Limitation of Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In his pro se brief, Mr. Barber argues that his trial counsel should have been permitted to inquire further of Officer Yelton \u201cas to questions surrounding his sworn affidavit, and the execution of the search warrant.\u201d Aplt. Pro Se Br., at 6. The district court ruled these inquiries irrelevant. Mr. Barber fails to establish prejudice arising from the district court\u2019s failure to permit further cross-examination. He advances a conspiracy theory under which he was entirely innocent and framed by Officer Yelton and Mr. Checotah, who planted the drugs and the weapons to implicate him. <em>Id. </em>at 7. There was no evidence at trial that would have supported such a theory. It is only pure speculation on Mr. Barber\u2019s part that further cross-examination into the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the warrant would have revealed a conspiracy to frame him. This issue is therefore also frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">After conducting a thorough and independent review of the record, we see no meritorious appellate issues. We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and AFFIRM Mr. Barber\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
