GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Brian Gerhartz seeks a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) permitting him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We are constrained by the terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) and our precedent to deny Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s application. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Under the terms of a plea agreement with the government, Mr. Gerhartz pled guilty to conspiring or attempting to manufacture more than fifty grams of methamphetamine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), 841(b)(l)(A)(viii), 846. At sentencing, the district court concluded that Mr. Gerhartz was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 60 months\u2019 supervised release. D.Ct. Op. at 1, 2008 WL 594455. As part of his plea, Mr. Gerhartz expressly waived his right to appeal this sentence or to attack it collaterally. D.Ct. Op. at 1, 2008 WL 594455; <em>United States v. Gerhartz, </em>223 Fed.Appx. 817, 817 (10th Cir.2007). When Mr. Gerhartz nevertheless filed a notice of appeal, a panel of this court dismissed it as barred by the plea agreement. Applying our three-part test announced in <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325-27 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam), the panel enforced the waiver because (1) the challenge fell within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) the waiver appeared knowing and voluntary; and (3) no miscarriage of justice resulted from the waiver\u2019s enforcement. <em>Gerhartz, </em>223 Fed.Appx. at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">Several months later, Mr. Gerhartz moved the district court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s motion challenged the district court\u2019s sentencing decision, and in particular challenged the sentencing court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history under the Sentencing Guidelines, submitting that he should have been afforded the protection of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)\u2019s \u201csafety valve\u201d for less culpable offenders. R. at 5-6,12-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">The district court concluded that, like his earlier attempt to directly appeal his sentence, Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was barred by his plea agreement. D.Ct. Op. at 2-3, 2008 WL 594455. In reaching this conclusion, the district court specifically noted that Mr. Gerhartz might have argued that his plea agreement was involuntary by virtue of inadequate advice from his trial counsel. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Clingman, </em>288 F.3d 1183, 1186 (10th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1187 (10th Cir.2001)). But the court proceeded to observe that Mr. Gerhartz raised no such argument in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>motion, which instead focused exclusively on the sentencing court\u2019s purported error in calculating his sentence. In these circumstances, the district court held, Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s plea agreement controlled and barred his claim. D.Ct. Op. at 3, 2008 WL 594455.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Mr. Gerhartz now seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s decision. Mr. Gerhartz appears before us <em>pro se, </em>so we afford his submissions a solicitous construction. <em>Van Deelen v. Johnson, </em>497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007). Because he lacks a COA enabling him to appeal the district court\u2019s decision, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), we will construe his notice of appeal as an application for the needed certificate, <em>see </em>10th Cir. R. 22.2(c)(1). A COA cannot issue unless the applicant makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This test is satisfied only if the applicant shows that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotations omitted)). \u201cWhen the district court denies a [\u00a7 2255 motion] on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim,\u201d this test requires us to decide whether \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484,120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">It is beyond dispute that Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s direct challenges to the calculation of his sentence \u2014 the only bases for relief he asserted before the district court \u2014 are barred by waiver under the test we announced in <em>Hahn. </em>Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s plea agreement forbids him from challenging either his sentence or \u201cthe manner in which the sentence is determined\u201d on collateral attack, D.Ct. Op. at 2, 2008 WL 594455; because all the claims in his \u00a7 2255 motion fit this description, they are plainly within the scope of the waiver\u2019s terms. In addition, Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s submissions to the district court provided no basis to question the knowing and voluntary character of the plea agreement. <em>Cf. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1329. Mr. Gerhartz made no allegation that, for example, he accepted the plea agreement only because of his lawyer\u2019s bad advice. D.Ct. Op. at 3, 2008 WL 594455. Though such a claim would have survived the waiver had it been made, <em>Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d at 1187, even the most generous reading of Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s filings before the district court fails to disclose any argument along those lines. <em>Cf. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1329 (defendant must \u201cprovide support for the notion that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into his plea agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither did Mr. Gerhartz present any basis to believe that enforcement of his plea agreement would result in a miscarriage of justice, as we have defined the term, sufficient to permit the district court to entertain his petition. <em>See id. </em>at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">It is true that in his submissions to <em>this </em>court, Mr. Gerhartz <em>has </em>alleged that his trial lawyer was constitutionally ineffective. In addition to challenging counsel\u2019s performance at the actual sentencing hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ing, a claim that does not survive his waiver, <em>Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d at 1187, Mr. Gerhartz also alleges that \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s failure to properly prepare for sentencing, properly prepare the defendant, and [falsely] lead the defendant to believe that if he signed \u2018now1 he still had \u2018rights\u2019, to appeal, \u2018any issues during sentencing\u2019 ... violated ... the \u2018Constitution of the United States.\u2019\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. Given our obligation to read the papers of <em>pro se </em>litigants with solicitude, we think that sufficient to raise a claim that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness rendered the plea agreement itself involuntary \u2014 a claim that <em>would </em>survive Mr. Gerhartz\u2019s waiver, and that would provide a basis for withholding enforcement of the waiver under <em>Hahn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The difficulty is that, when considering whether to issue a COA, we are instructed to review only whether the district court\u2019s decision was arguably incorrect. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. And we fail to see how the district court could have been wrong not to consider arguments or evidence not presented to it. We and our sister circuits have repeatedly declined to address claims in these circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Coppage v. McKune, </em>534 F.3d 1279, 1282 (10th Cir.2008) (declining to address arguments not first presented to the district court); <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 940 (10th Cir.2004) (same); <em>Jones v. Gibson, </em>206 F.3d 946, 958 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cPetitioner did not make this argument in his revised habeas petition. Thus, this court need not consider it.\u201d); <em>Blanton v. Quarterman, </em>543 F.3d 230, 243 (5th Cir.2008) (court of appeals \u201ccannot\u201d consider habeas arguments not presented to the district court); <em>Barbe v. McBride, </em>521 F.3d 443, 454 n. 17 (4th Cir.2008) (declining to consider habeas claims for the first time on appeal); <em>Carrascosa v. McGuire, </em>520 F.3d 249, 263-64 (3d Cir. 2008) (issues not presented to district court were \u201cnot properly before\u201d court of appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Because the district court\u2019s analysis of the motion Mr. Gerhartz presented was correct, the application for a COA is denied. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-11\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. We note that the previous panel\u2019s determination that the plea appeared knowing and voluntary from the face of the trial record is not necessarily conclusive of this question on collateral review because extrinsic evidence could show that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness rendered the plea involuntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
