We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Petitioner\u2019s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) failed to present evidence of changed country conditions in Mexico that are material to petitioner and his circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Because petitioner has failed to meet his burden of establishing a prima facie CAT claim to support reopening, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary denial of the petition for review is granted because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.
