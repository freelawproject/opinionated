His 60-month sentence was above the advisory guidelines range of 30 to 37 months and was imposed outside the guidelines system.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We generally review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Sentences inside or outside the advisory guidelines range are typically reviewed under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">We first determine whether the sentence is procedurally unreasonable due to a procedural error \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is procedurally reasonable, we consider whether it is substantively reasonable under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a sentence is outside the Guidelines, we give deference to the sentencing court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the variance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">In the district court, Osorio requested a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines but did not raise any objection to the court\u2019s explanation of his sentence or to the procedural reasonableness of the sentence, which are the only issues he raises on appeal. Accordingly, review of Osorio\u2019s claims is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008); <em>see also United States v. Izaguim-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir. 2000) (applying plain error review to claim that district court gave inadequate reasons for sentence). To prevail on plain-error review, a defendant must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If he does so, this court has the discretion to correct the forfeited error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770. In any event, Osorio\u2019s claims fail under either plain error review or the typical review for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">Osorio contends that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court gave an inadequate explanation of the reasons for the variance. The record and context show that the district court considered the facts and the parties\u2019 arguments and imposed the upward variance because of Osorio\u2019s violent character and history and based on factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The law requires no more. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>L.Ed.2d 208 (2007). Osorio also contends that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not consider a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 of the Guidelines before imposing a non-guidelines variance. In <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2954, 171 L.Ed.2d 884 (2008), we rejected a similar contention that above-Guidelines sentences were unreasonable because the court did not follow guideline provisions for departures. We noted that \u201ca sentencing court may impose a non-Guidelines sentence, i.e., a \u2018variance\u2019, but not a \u2018departure,\u2019 if it calculates the proper sentencing range and references the broad array of factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721. There is no support for Osorio\u2019s contention that the district court was required to consider a departure under the Guidelines before imposing a non-guideline variance. <em>Mejia-Huerta </em>also rejected the proposition that a sentencing court\u2019s \u201cfailure to conduct the calculus of \u00a7 4A1.3 renders a non-Guidelines sentence <em>per se </em>unreasonable.\u201d Mejia-Huerta, 480 F.3d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Osorio fails to show that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable, and he does not contend that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Because Osorio shows no error or abuse of discretion, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b264-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
