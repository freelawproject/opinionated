Based on our agreement with the district court that Cougle\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 are barred by the application of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">In August 2006, Cougle filed a complaint for money damages against the County of DeSoto and Mark Blackson, a detective in the DeSoto County Sheriffs Office, alleging wrongful arrest, wrongful search and seizure, and malicious prosecution. The arrest, search and seizure, and prosecution occurred when Blackson received a complaint from Ralph Yount alleging that Cougle had possession of a motorcycle and lawn tractor that belonged to Yount and refused to return them. Cougle had agreed to store the items for Yount, but refused to return them unless Yount paid a storage fee for the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-24\">At Blackson\u2019s request, Cougle came to the sheriffs office to be interviewed. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>cording to Blackson, Cougle confirmed the information provided by Yount and also confirmed that he carried a firearm in conjunction with his repossession business. Because Cougle had previously been convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to three years probation, it was illegal for Cougle to possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Based on Cougle\u2019s alleged admission, Blackson obtained an arrest warrant for Cougle and a search warrant for his house. No firearm was found in the search. Blackson later learned the location of Yount\u2019s motorcycle and tractor, recovered them and returned them to Yount. A DeSoto County grand jury no billed the firearm and grand larceny charges against Cougle. However, in August 2005, Cougle\u2019s probation was revoked and Cougle was required to serve one year in jail. The probation violation form states that Cougle \u201chas been arrested and charge (sic) with theft \u2014 other, possession of a weapon by a convicted felon and taking away a spray rig ... [and] Harley-Davidson fat boy bike belonging to Ronald and Bridgette Yount.\u201d The Order Revoking Probation listed three violations of the terms of Cougle\u2019s probation: \u201cfailed to commit no offense\u201d, \u201cfailed to permit MDCC to visit at home or elsewhere\u201d, and \u201cfailed to remain in specified area.\u201d Blackson testified at the probation hearing about the events leading up to Cougle\u2019s arrest and the seizure of Yount\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Cougle\u2019s complaint in this case denies that he admitted to possessing a firearm and contends that there was no probable cause for his arrest. He also alleges that Blackson violated his fourth amendment rights by seizing the motorcycle and lawn tractor without warrants or probable cause. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing Cougle\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. Cougle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the basis that the instant action is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cin order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose lawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. <em>Heck </em>applies to proceedings that call into question the fact or duration of probation. <em>Cotton v. Tex. Dep\u2019t Criminal Justice, </em>35 F.3d 560, 560 (5th Cir.l994)(unpublished); <em>Jackson v. Vannoy, </em>49 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir. 1995) (applying <em>Heck </em>to \u00a7 1983 claim that would, if successful, imply the invalidity of the revocation of plaintiffs probation and parole).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The district court correctly recognized that the allegations of unlawful search and arrest in this case, if true, would necessarily imply the invalidity of the revocation of Cougle\u2019s probation, which was based, at least in part, on the same search and arrest. Cougle has not demonstrated that the revocation of his probation has been reversed, expunged, set aside or called into question as required by <em>Heck </em>as a prerequisite for this case to proceed. Summary judgment in favor of the defendants was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>merit in favor of the defendants dismissing Cougle\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
