These claims arose out of a trial where he was found liable for a motor vehicle accident. He has sued the current defendants \u2014 the presiding judge, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, etc. \u2014 alleging that they were part of a \u201cmock trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-18\">This appeal is without arguable merit and thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5TH CIR. R. 42.2. Given the Appellant\u2019s extensive and unsuccessful litigation record, Appellant is warned that future filings of repetitious or frivolous appeals may result in the imposition of sanctions. These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file papers in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-19\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
