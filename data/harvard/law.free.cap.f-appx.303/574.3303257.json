We affirm both.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">As an initial matter, we decline to consider several of Young\u2019s claims because the deficiencies in Young\u2019s briefs constitute abandonment of these claims. An appellant must state in his or her argument, \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d <em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). </em>If an appellant fails to provide supporting argument and authority, the claim is abandoned. <em>United States v. Belgarde, </em>300 F.3d 1177, 1181 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Kohler v. Inter-Tel Techs., </em>244 F.3d 1167, 1182 (9th Cir.2001). We find that Young abandoned his claims regarding his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence; rejection of his proposed jury instruction; and cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-20\">The remainder of Young\u2019s claims regarding the guilt phase of the trial are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">As to Young\u2019s appeal of his sentence, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Young\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916, 920-21 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>applies retroactively). The district court acted within its discretion in sentencing Young to a term within the Guidelines\u2019 recommended range, after proper consideration of the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-22\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
