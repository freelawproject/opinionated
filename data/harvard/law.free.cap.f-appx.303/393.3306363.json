The district court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s denial and this appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-21\"><em>Substantial evidence. </em>Although the ALJ did not explicitly state which of the three tests for substantial gainful activity (SGA) Cardy\u2019s activities met, he analyzed Cardy\u2019s work with Peace of Mind Vacations in a manner consistent with the rubrics of both Test One and Test Three. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1575(a)(2)(i)(iii). Drawing \u201cspecific and legitimate inferences\u201d from the ALJ\u2019s opinion, we conclude that the ALJ found that Cardy\u2019s activities met both Test One and Test Three. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 755 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">The ALJ found that Cardy\u2019s average monthly income throughout 1999 was greater than $500, which created a rebut-table presumption that she had been engaged in SGA. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1575(a)(2)(iii); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1574(b)(2) tbl.l. The ALJ appropriately relied on the record to find that Peace of Mind Vacations was profitable in 1999. The ALJ found that Cardy\u2019s monthly earnings were enough to trigger a presumption that she was engaged in SGA beginning in January 1999. Cardy asserts there is insufficient evidence to support the January 1999 finding, but the ALJ\u2019s monthly calculation for 1999, which was based on her annual revenue, is consistent with the regulation, which specifies relevant threshold average monthly earnings by calendar year. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1575(a)(2)(iii); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1574(b)(2) tbl.l. Because Cardy did not present any evidence rebutting the presumptions, we affirm the ALJ as to his conclusion that Cardy engaged in SGA as of January 1999. <em>See Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 516 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>earnings above or below statutory thresholds create a presumption that a claimant is or is not engaged in SGA that, if not countered, becomes determinative). Although the ALJ inappropriately referred to a 2005 application for disability benefits that was not in the record, use of the application was nonprejudicial and irrelevant to the ultimate conclusion as to Cardas disability, and thus was a harmless error. <em>See Stout v. Comm\u2019r, </em>454 F.3d 1050,1055 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><em>Development of the record. </em>By holding the record open following Cardy\u2019s hearing as well as identifying areas of ambiguity, the ALJ fulfilled his duty to fully and fairly develop the record. <em>See Tidwell v. Apfel, </em>161 F.3d 599, 602 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b417-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
