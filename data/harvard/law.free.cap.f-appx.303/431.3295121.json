This case turns on Shurkin\u2019s ability to plead falsity and scienter with respect to the December 23, 2003, proxy statement and the January 20, 2004, press release Golden State Vintners (GSV) issued to its shareholders. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Shurkin has failed to plead these necessary elements of a securities fraud claim with the requisite specificity under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of Shurkin\u2019s claims with prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The district court correctly found that none of GSV\u2019s statements in the December 23 proxy constitutes securities fraud. Shurkin, in claiming GSV manipulated the data that went into determining the fairness of a $3.25 per share buyout price, relies on confidential witness statements and an assumption that GSV was obligated to provide \u201creal time\u201d financial data. First, the statements he offers fail to provide the sufficient particularity we have required when allowing the use of confidential witnesses to provide supporting facts for plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See In re Daou Sys., Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir.2005). At most these statements demonstrate a disagreement the unnamed witnesses have with the business judgments the defendants have made. Second, Shurkin\u2019s allegation that the fairness opinion was fraudulent because it used first quarter financial figures is based on an incorrect reading of the securities laws, which require only periodic not continuous disclosure. Second quarter figures were not available at the time GSV issued the proxy statement. Therefore, Shurkin has not adequately demonstrated the fairness statement was either objectively or subjectively false.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">We also agree with the district court that none of the statements in the January 20 press release amount to anything resembling securities fraud. As the district court correctly noted, this case is on all fours with our decision in <em>Brody v. Transitional Hospitals Corp., </em>280 F.3d 997 (9th Cir.2002), where we found no evidence of securities fraud because the Transnational Hospitals Corp. (THC) had not affirmatively stated no merger would occur. Rather, THC made clear via press release that business conditions had improved and that the value of the shares might rise in the near future. <em>Id. </em>at 1006-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The same analysis applies to GSV\u2019s January 20 press release. The company never affirmatively stated no merger would occur and made clear to shareholders that, contrary to prior unfavorable business conditions necessitating the proposed reverse stock split, market and business conditions had improved. Shurkin was thus on notice that the value of his shares might increase. Shurkin, however, sold his shares upon receiving this good news press release. He now asks this Court to provide redress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>for his error in judgment. We cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">We agree also with the district court\u2019s dismissal of. Shurkin\u2019s additional claims, as they are wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Shurkin\u2019s claims WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\">. This Court reviews dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>See Livid Holdings, Ltd. v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., </em>416 F.3d 940, 946 (9th Cir.2005). On review, a court must \"accept the plaintiffs' allegations as true and construe them in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\" <em>Gompper v.
