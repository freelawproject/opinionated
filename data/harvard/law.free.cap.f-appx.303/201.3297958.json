Plaintiff-Appellant Nautilus Insurance Company (\u201cNautilus\u201d) seeks reimbursement from a co-primary insurer, Defendant-Appellee Pacific Employers Insurance Company (\u201cPacific\u201d), for a portion of the funds Nautilus paid to settle the insured\u2019s claims. In so doing, Nautilus pursues an argument under Texas law that the Texas Supreme Court ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>plicitly rejected just last year. <em>See Mid-Continent Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>236 S.W.3d 765 (Tex.2007). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In 2000, the insured in the underlying case, EOG Resources, Inc. (\u201cEOG\u201d), entered into several contracts as part of its oilfield operations. Of relevance to this appeal, EOG contracted with J.R. Nichols, L.L.C. (\u201cNichols\u201d) to determine the owners of the surface and mineral estates of properties within a sixty-five square mile area near Galveston, Texas, and to survey the land. Nautilus insured Nichols and listed EOG as an additional insured under the policy. EOG also contracted with Veritas DGC Land, Inc. (\u201cVeritas\u201d) to perform seismic dynamite blasting. Pacific insured Veritas and also listed EOG as an additional insured under Veritas\u2019s policy. Both the Nautilus policy and the Pacific policy were primary insurance policies, and both contained identical pro rata (or \u201cother insurance\u201d) provisions. The pro rata clauses required the insurers to pay a pro rata portion of any judgment or settlement if the coverages overlapped with other primary insurance policies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">As a result of the seismic surveying and blasting, several homeowners sued EOG and some of its contractors, alleging that the seismic activity caused foundation defects in their homes. EOG filed a claim against its own insurance company, as well as against Nautilus and Pacific. As the cases proceeded toward trial, Nautilus and the other insurance companies involved (besides Pacific) decided to settle some of the lawsuits for $3.5 million. Nautilus voluntarily paid $1.5 million of this settlement, which it asserts was a sum that included the portion Pacific should have paid to satisfy its obligations to EOG. Pacific refused to agree to the settlement and proceeded to trial. A jury ruled against thirty of the homeowners\u2019 claims, and the court granted summary judgment on the remaining homeowners\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Pacific did not contribute to the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and did not pay anything in the underlying state court cases, while Nautilus claims that it paid more than its proportionate share of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Nautilus, along with EOG, brought suit against Pacific in state court. Nautilus sought to enforce the subrogation clause in its insurance policy against Pacific. That clause granted Nautilus the right of subrogation against third parties upon Nautilus\u2019s payment of claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is, Nautilus contends that it became contractually and equitably subrogated to the rights of EOG to seek compensation for the amounts Nautilus paid on behalf of EOG that Pacific should have paid instead. Pacific removed the case to the district court based on diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The district court stayed the action until the Texas Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Mid-Continent. </em>Thereafter, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Pacific. The court then granted the parties\u2019 Joint Motion to Dismiss Without Prejudice EOG\u2019s claims against Pacific, so that the summary judgment order would be a final judgment. Nautilus appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, as the district court entered a final judgment granting summary judgment to Pacific. The district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s summary judgment order. <em>Richardson v. Monitronics Int'l, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 327, 332 (5th Cir.2005). We will affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c); <em>see also Richardson, </em>434 F.3d at 332. In resolving a question of state law in a diversity case, a federal court must follow the substantive decisions of the state\u2019s highest court, here the Texas Supreme Court. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>Tex. Indus, v. Factory Mut. Ins. Co., </em>486 F.3d 844, 846 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">The sole question in this appeal is whether the district court properly applied <em>Mid-Continent Insurance Co. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>236 S.W.3d 765 (Tex.2007). We therefore recount in detail the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\"><em>Mid-Continent </em>involved claims stemming from a car accident. <em>Id. </em>at 768. James Boutin (\u201cBoutin\u201d) and his family hit an oncoming car in a Texas highway project construction zone. <em>Id. </em>Kinsel Industries (\u201cKinsel\u201d) was the general contractor on the highway project, and it was the named insured under a policy from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 769. Crabtree Barricades (\u201cCrabtree\u201d) was a subcontractor of Kinsel and was responsible for the signs and dividers. <em>Id. </em>Mid-Continent Insurance Company (\u201cMid-Continent\u201d) insured Crabtree and identified Kinsel as an additional insured for liability arising from Crabtree\u2019s work. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Kinsel had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>primary insurance from both Liberty Mutual and Mid-Continent. <em>Id. </em>The Boutin family sued, among others, Kinsel and Crabtree for damages resulting from the accident. <em>Id. </em>Both insurance policies provided Kinsel with $1 million in indemnity coverage for the Boutin\u2019s suit. <em>Id. </em>Liberty Mutual also provided Kinsel with excess insurance coverage of $10 million. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The Liberty Mutual and Mid-Continent policies both contained \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses that are identical to the clauses at issue in this case. <em>See id. </em>Because both policies were primary policies, they each assumed responsibility for a pro rata share of Kinsel\u2019s liability. <em>Id. </em>Initially, both insurance companies assessed Kinsel\u2019s percentage of fault at between ten and fifteen percent. <em>Id. </em>at 770. However, Liberty Mutual eventually increased its estimate of Kinsel\u2019s fault to sixty percent. <em>Id. </em>Liberty Mutual and the Boutins then entered into settlement negotiations. <em>Id. </em>Liberty Mutual agreed to settle the case for $1.5 million \u2014 or sixty percent of a $2.5 million anticipated verdict \u2014 and demanded that Mid-Continent contribute its one-half share, or $750,000. <em>Id. </em>Mid-Continent, however, had calculated the settlement value of the case against Kinsel at only $800,000 and agreed to contribute only one-half of that amount, or $150,000. Liberty Mutual thus paid the remaining $1.35 million, which was $350,000 over its primary insurance policy limit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Liberty Mutual sued Mid-Continent in Texas state court seeking to recover Mid-Continent\u2019s pro rata share of the settlement with Kinsel. <em>Id. </em>Mid-Continent removed the case to the district court, which held in favor of Liberty Mutual. <em>Id. </em>The district court ruled that Liberty Mutual was entitled to recover from Mid-Continent on behalf of Kinsel based on the subrogation clause in Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that Liberty Mutual had acted reasonably in assessing the percentage of fault attributable to Kinsel, that Mid-Continent had acted unreasonably, and that Liberty Mutual could enforce, on behalf of Kinsel, Mid-Continent\u2019s duty to act reasonably in settling the case. <em>Id. </em>Mid-Continent appealed to this court, and we certified the questions at issue to the Texas Supreme Court. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mid-Continent Ins. Co., </em>405 F.3d 296, 297 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The Texas Supreme Court accepted the certified questions and answered them by concluding that Liberty Mutual did not have a right of subrogation, because Kinsel did not have any remaining rights against Mid-Continent. <em>Mid-Continent, </em>236 S.W.3d at 771, 772. The court first recounted two precedents to guide its analysis. In <em>Employers Casualty Co. v. Transport Insurance Co., </em>444 S.W.2d 606, 610 (Tex.1969), the court noted that a contractual or equitable right of subrogation is the proper remedy for a co-insurer to seek reimbursement from an insurer who does not contribute to a settlement. In <em>Traders &amp; General Insurance Co. v. Hicks Rubber Co., </em>140 Tex. 586, 169 S.W.2d 142, 148 (1943), the court stated that a co-insurer does not have a right to contribution from other insurers, \u201cnor will the payment of the whole loss by any of them discharge the liability of the others.\u201d The court in <em>Mid-Continent </em>noted that this language implies that when one co-insurer pays a loss, the insured still has a right to enforce a contractual obligation against the insurer who does not pay, and that the co-insurer seeking reimbursement can be subrogated to this right. 236 S.W.3d at 774. As the court explained, \u201cin [either contractual or equitable subrogation], the insurer stands in the shoes of the insured, obtaining only those rights held by the insured against a third party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The court next turned to Kinsel\u2019s potential rights against Mid-Continent. <em>Id. </em>Although Liberty Mutual asserted that it was subrogated to Kinsel\u2019s rights to enforce Mid-Continent\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify Kinsel and to pay a pro rata share of the settlement, the court concluded that \u201cKinsel has no right, after being fully indemnified, to enforce Mid-Continent\u2019s duty to pay its pro rata share of a loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775. The court noted that an insured\u2019s right to indemnity is limited to the actual amount of the loss and that a pro rata clause eliminates the potential for double recovery. <em>Id. </em>Once the insured becomes fully indemnified, however, it no longer has any rights against its insurer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The court therefore held that \u201ca fully indemnified insured has no right to recover an additional pro rata portion of settlement from an insurer regardless of that insurer\u2019s contribution to the settlement. Having fully recovered its loss, an insured has no contractual rights that a co-insurer may assert against another co-insurer in subrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775-76. Thus, although an insurer might have a right of subrogation under its policy, that is \u201cdistinct from the ability to recover under that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 774.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Having received an answer to its certified question, this court ruled that Liberty Mutual was not entitled to any recovery from Mid-Continent. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mid-Continent Ins. Co., </em>508 F.3d 261, 263 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Here, the settlement of the cases fully indemnified EOG for those claims. Under a plain reading of <em>Mid-Continent, </em>therefore, EOG has no rights to enforce against Pacific, meaning that Nautilus cannot stand in EOG\u2019s shoes and recover from Pacific. Nautilus\u2019s main argument in attempting to distinguish <em>Mid-Continent, </em>is that the decision was narrow and applies only when an insurer settles a case to \u201cprotect its own coffers,\u201d which Nautilus asserts is missing here. Nautilus points out that in <em>Mid-Continent, </em>Liberty Mutual covered Kinsel for $1 million under its primary policy and also provided an excess policy of $10 million. <em>See Mid-Continent, </em>236 S.W.3d at 769. Under those circumstances, according to Nautilus, Liberty Mutual had a self-serving motive to settle the entire case because it did not want to risk liability for a large judgment under its excess policy. Thus, Nautilus claims that the import of <em>Mid-Continent </em>is that an insurer cannot recover from a co-insurer based upon a right of subrogation when the insurer pays a claim to protect its own financial interests. By contrast, Nautilus asserts that it paid EOG\u2019s entire claim solely based on its duty to indemnify its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The language in <em>Mid-Continent, </em>however, belies Nautilus\u2019s argument. Toward the beginning of the opinion, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>noted that Liberty Mutual\u2019s excess coverage did not impact its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">At trial the parties disputed how many policies should be considered in apportioning the cost of the settlement, as Liberty Mutual also held a business auto policy and excess policy in favor of Kinsel. Because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s certified questions presume the loss triggered only Mid-Continent\u2019s and Liberty Mutual\u2019s [primary] policies, our answers consider only these two policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 770 n. 4 (citation omitted). Nautilus points to language toward the end of the opinion where the court suggested that Liberty Mutual\u2019s motive in paying the entire settlement was to prevent additional liability under its excess insurance policy. <em>See id. </em>at 776 (\u201cLiberty Mutual played a dual role as primary insurer and excess insurer and was in a position to negotiate a good faith settlement in Kinsel\u2019s behalf. ... A reasonable primary insurer, which did not improperly handle the claim, would not pay more than its primary policy limits. In paying $350,000 more than its $1 million policy limits, Liberty Mutual seems to have been motivated by a concern for its excess insurance policy.\u201d). As Pacific notes, however, Nautilus also may have been concerned about additional liability under its coverage; its policy limit was $2 million and it settled the claim against EOG by contributing $1.5 million to the $3.5 million settlement, potentially saving itself at least $500,000. Moreover, the language about Liberty Mutual also having an excess insurance policy merely served the purpose of distinguishing <em>American Centennial Insurance Co. v. Canal Insurance Co., </em>843 S.W.2d 480, 483 (Tex.1992), where the court recognized equitable subrogation for an excess insurer, \u201cacting solely as such, when a potential judgment approaches the primary insurer\u2019s policy limits.\u201d <em>Midr-Continent, </em>236 S.W.3d at 776. However, Nautilus is not an excess insurer, and the fact that Liberty Mutual was both a primary and an excess insurer had no bearing on the court\u2019s ultimate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Nautilus also points to several policy implications stemming from a ruling that it has no right of subrogation. It asserts that an insurer will be less likely to settle a suit if it cannot recover the money it pays to settle a case. Nautilus further claims that a broad reading of <em>Mid-Continent </em>will lead to the elimination of the right of subrogation, which Nautilus contends the Texas Supreme Court could not have meant without more explicit language. Finally, Nautilus suggests that eliminating the right of subrogation will lead to an unfair distribution of losses among insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The Texas Supreme Court, however, is the final arbiter of Texas law. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Thomas, </em>973 F.2d 449, 456 n. 6 (5th Cir.1992). Even if the court\u2019s decision in <em>Mid-Continent </em>will have these policy effects, that is within the province of the Texas Supreme Court to decide. Additionally, <em>Midr-Continent </em>is unlikely to have the drastic consequences that Nautilus predicts. For example, as discussed above, the court in <em>Midr-Continent </em>explicitly recognized when subrogation is appropriate, i.e., when an excess insurer (acting solely as such) pays a claim near the primary insurance policy limits and then seeks to recover from a primary insurer for the primary insurer\u2019s failure to pay. <em>Id. </em>Further, other policy factors are present in this situation: Pacific went to trial and won, so it would seem inequitable to force Pacific to contribute to the settlement when it chose not to settle and prevailed. That is, Pacific bore the risk that it could be liable for more than it would pay in a settlement. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 778 (Willett, J., concurring) (\u201cI would not recognize that one [insurer] owed a duty to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>business interests of the other. I would treat their negotiations inter se in this case as a matter best left to the business world.\u201d). The point is that these policy decisions are within the discretion of the Texas Supreme Court, and in <em>Mid-Continent </em>it ruled against the insurer that voluntarily paid more than its pro rata share of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In sum, the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Mid-Continent, </em>which involved the exact same issue, was perfectly clear: \u201cKinsel has no right, after being fully indemnified, to enforce Mid-Continent\u2019s duty to pay its pro rata share of a loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 775 (majority opinion). Nautilus\u2019s manner of distinguishing the case, relying on the fact that Liberty Mutual also provided excess insurance, is unavailing, particularly because the court itself discounted this fact. <em>See id. </em>at 770 n. 4. Accordingly, the district court did not err in ruling that the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mid-Continent </em>precluded Nautilus from asserting any rights against Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The Texas Supreme Court was not ambiguous in <em>Midr-Continent, </em>and the holding in that case applies with equal force here. Given that EOG was fully indemnified, it has no rights to enforce against Pacific, and thus Nautilus has no right of subrogation against Pacific. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The Texas Courts of Appeals upheld these judgments. <em>See Adair v. Veritas DGC Land, Inc., </em>No. 14-06-00254-CV, 2007 WL 2790362 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] Sept. 27, 2007, pet. denied); <em>Barnett v.

Nautilus argues that these cases did not \"exonerate\u201d EOG, and it is true that Veritas, one of EOG\u2019s subcontractors, was the only defendant in these trials, meaning that the judgments did not explicitly impact EOG\u2019s liability. This distinction is irrelevant to the present dispute, however, because the fact remains that Pacific did not have to pay the homeowners anything for their claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-10\">.
