Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam). First, administrative closure is not available after entry of a final order of removal. <em>See Matter of Lopez-Barrios, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 203 (BIA 1990). Second, to the extent that petitioner\u2019s motion could be construed as a motion to reopen removal proceedings, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen was untimely and number-barred. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that BIA denials of motions to reopen or reconsider are reviewed for abuse of discretion), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">Additionally, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159-60 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-23\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b562-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
