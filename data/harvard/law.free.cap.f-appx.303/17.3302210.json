Hawkins, whose conviction after a bench trial (Robert M. Levy, U.S.M.J.) for disorderly conduct, <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.218(b)(ll), and simple assault, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(5), was affirmed on appeal to the district court, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 58(g)(2), now renews her sufficiency challenge to her assault conviction in this court. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-27\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hassan, </em>542 F.3d 968, 980 (2d Cir.2008). \u201cTo succeed on such a chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>lenge,\u201d Hawkins \u201cmust satisfy a heavy burden, as we consider only whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[W]e must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Tran, </em>519 F.3d 98, 105 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cReversal is warranted only if no rational factfinder could have found the crimes charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Neither party contends that a different standard should be applied here because Hawkins\u2019s conviction resulted from a bench trial. <em>See United States v. Pierce, </em>224 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cWhen reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, the standard of review is exactly the same regardless whether the verdict was rendered by a jury or by a judge after a bench trial.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Hawkins first contends that her simple assault conviction cannot stand because \u201c[tjhere was, in fact, no physical injury\u201d as a result of her actions, and \u201cno evidence of any intent on the part of the defendant to cause physical injury.\u201d This contention fails. Actual physical injury is not a required element of simple assault. <em>See United States v. Temple, </em>447 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir.2006) (discussing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1)). As to the intent to cause physical injury, even assuming that simple assault requires such intent, the evidence of (1) Hawkins\u2019s verbal threats, including testimony that Hawkins threatened to wait for Nurse Philips in the parking lot outside the hospital when Philips went home; and (2) Hawkins\u2019s aggressive physical acts, including giving Philips a hard push in the back, were clearly sufficient to support the conclusion that Hawkins possessed that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Hawkins\u2019s second contention is that the testimony from Philips that she was subjectively \u201cfrightened\u201d as a result of Hawkins\u2019s actions cannot support a finding of a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm. This contention fails because significant additional evidence of verbal assaults from Hawkins as well as aggressive physical acts well supported a finding that Philips\u2019s subjective fear was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">To the extent Hawkins challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting any of the other elements of the offense, our review of the record confirms the district court\u2019s conclusion that such arguments must be rejected as without merit. <em>See United States v. Hawkins, </em>No. 07 Cr. 355, order at 6-7, 2008 WL 207842 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">We have considered all of Hawkins\u2019s contentions on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
