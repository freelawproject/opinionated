Mascoe was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 72 months, three years of supervised release and a special assessment of $100. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">Mascoe argues that the sentence imposed was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider his arguments in support of a downward departure. In addition, Mascoe argues that his sentence of 72 months imprisonment is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for substantive and procedural reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>529 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir.2008). The standard for reasonableness review \u201cis akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006). Such review \u201cdoes not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining \u201cwhether a sentence is reasonable, [the Court] ought to consider whether the sentencing judge \u2018exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion[,] ... committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>(quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005)). We have previously recognized that \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27. In addition, \u201c[although a refusal to downwardly depart is generally not appealable, review is available when a sentencing court misapprehended the scope of its authority to depart or the sentence was otherwise illegal.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>426 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir.2005). We hold that Mascoe\u2019s sentence was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">I. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The presentenee report prepared by the Probation Office calculated that Mascoe\u2019s total offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines was 21, and that his criminal history category was five, yielding a range of imprisonment of 70 to 87 months. Mascoe did not contest the Guidelines calculation at sentencing. Mascoe moved for a downward departure on three grounds: (1) his \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d in the United States; (2) the alleged disparity created by \u201cfast-track\u201d programs in other jurisdictions; and (3) the \u201clack of availability of institutional remedial and rehabilitative programs to persons who have immigration detainers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Here, contrary to Mascoe\u2019s assertion, the district court adequately considered each of the arguments raised by Mascoe in support of a downward departure. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d). As to Mascoe\u2019s \u201cfast track\u201d argument, the district court received sentencing submissions on the issue from both defense counsel and the government. After hearing arguments from the parties, the district court rejected Mascoe\u2019s claim of a sentencing disparity resulting from fast-track programs in other district courts. The district court further explained that Mascoe has \u201ca very troubling criminal history,\u201d that he was \u201ca violent offender, violence outside [prison], violence inside,\u201d and, thus, Mascoe \u201cneeds to be incapacitated.\u201d Moreover, we are satisfied that the district court sufficiently considered Mascoe\u2019s other claims in support of a downward departure, including his \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d argument and his assertion concerning the \u201clack of remedial and rehabilitative programs\u201d for illegal re-entrants. Accordingly, the district court did not commit procedural error in its consideration of Mascoe\u2019s downward departure arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">Mascoe also argues that his sentence of 72 months was substantively unreasonable. He asserts that the district court\u2019s failure to adjust his sentence in accordance with \u201cfast track\u201d programs available elsewhere, and the court\u2019s focus on his criminal history and the need for incapacitation rendered his sentence unreasonable. We disagree. In <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2006), we specifically held that \u201ca district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program does not make a sentence unreasonable.\u201d Thus, Mascoe\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable based on illegal reentry sentencing programs in other jurisdictions must be rejected. Nor does the district court\u2019s consideration of Mascoe\u2019s criminal history and its conclusion that incapacitation was necessary render the sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In sum, Mascoe\u2019s sentence of 72 months imprisonment, which was at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range, was both proeedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
