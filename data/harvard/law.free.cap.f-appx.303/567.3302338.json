Breyer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b592-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-25\">John Abrew (\u201cAbrew\u201d) appeals the Commissioner\u2019s determination that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>not disabled. The district court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determination. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Abrew is incorrect that his depression and anxiety are necessarily severe impairments simply because the Commissioner found him disabled before a change in the law made drug and alcohol addiction a legally insufficient basis for disability benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(C); <em>see also </em>Pub.L. No. 104-121 \u00a7 105 (requiring Commissioner to allow individuals disabled because of drug and alcohol addiction to reapply for benefits on a different basis). The ALJ properly found these impairments not severe because medical evidence showed that Abrew was well-oriented and could complete simple tasks. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that ALJ must evaluate symptom testimony by considering the factors in SSR 88-13, including observations of examining physicians).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In calculating Abrew\u2019s residual functioning capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), the ALJ gave specific, clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Abrew\u2019s subjective symptom testimony of depression and fatigue. <em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1281. The ALJ pointed to medical observations that Abrew was not hallucinating, was well-oriented, was cooperative and that his hepatitis was asymptomatic. <em>See Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 857 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The ALJ gave specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the contradicted medical opinions of Drs. McManus, Burns and Green. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 831 (9th Cir.1996). Drs. Mc-Manus and Burns examined Abrew at a time when he was still using drugs and alcohol and found him seriously impaired notwithstanding them observations that Abrew\u2019s impairments were caused in part by ongoing substance abuse. <em>See Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1216-17 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that ALJ may reject a medical opinion when the conclusion\u2019s breadth is unsupported by the clinical findings). Dr. Green\u2019s findings were properly discounted for being based entirely on Abrew\u2019s not credible complaints about his asymptomatic hepatitis. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir. 2001). The ALJ properly \u201cresolv[ed] conflicts in the medical testimony\u201d by relying on Dr. Ferber\u2019s examination, which was conducted when Abrew was not using drugs. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The ALJ gave germane reasons for rejecting the lay testimony Abrew provided, stating that the severe impairments the lay witnesses described were inconsistent with medical evidence that Abrew was coherent and attentive. <em>See Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 512 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The ALJ did not err by failing to develop the record further because the ALJ evaluated Abrew\u2019s testimony, lay testimony and at least four physician\u2019s reports. \u201cThe ALJ did not indicate that he found the record insufficient to properly evaluate the evidence,\u201d obviating any need to develop the record. <em>Id. </em>at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Finally, there was no conflict between the ALJ\u2019s step five determination that Abrew could complete only simple tasks and the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that Abrew could do jobs that the U.S. Department of Labor categorizes at \u201cReasoning Level 2.\u201d <em>See 2 Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>1011 (4th ed.1991) (defining jobs that require the employee to \u201ccarry out detailed <em>but uninvolved </em>written or oral instructions\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>was supported by substantial evidence and the VE testified that her answers would be consistent with the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles, </em>\u201c[t]he ALJ\u2019s reliance on testimony the VE gave in response to the hypothetical therefore was proper.\u201d <em>BayMss, </em>427 F.3d at 1217-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
