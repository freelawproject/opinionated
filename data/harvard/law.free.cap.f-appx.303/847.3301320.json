Levin, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s orders (1) denying Levin\u2019s claim that the City of Palm Beach Gardens\u2019s (the \u201cCity\u201d) vendor classifications for the \u201c \u2018Taste of the Gardens\u2019 GreenMarket\u201d (the \u201cMarket\u201d) were facially discriminatory, and (2) granting the City\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, as to Levin\u2019s claim that the City applied the classifications for purposes of discriminating against him. Levin filed a <em>pro se </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against the City alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Levin claimed that the City unconstitutionally limited the access of certain businesses to the Market, which was held every Sunday from mid-October through mid-April. The mission statement for the 2006-07 Market, as set forth in the operations manual, provided that:</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">The \u201cTaste of the Gardens\u201d is a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHK\">Farmer\u2019s Market, Art, Entertainment &amp; Food public event. This is accomplished by providing fresh, locally-grown produce to the community and encouraging the promotion of the agricultural industry along with providing to the public an informal, social gathering place in an open-air setting which promotes a sense of community and stimulates interaction among neighbors in the northern palm beach county [sic] area. The market is intended to be a combination of a \u201cgreen\u201d shopping opportunity and a cultural event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">An independent contractor, Tonianne Wyner, produced the Market and was responsible for independently securing vendors. According to the operations manual, vendors were classified as either \u201cAgriculture\u201d or \u201cNon-Agriculture.\u201d The \u201cAgriculture\u201d classification was divided into the categories of \u201cGrower\u201d and \u201cGeneral Agricultural Vendor,\u201d and the \u201cNon-Agriculture\u201d classification was divided into the categories of \u201cPrepared Food Vendor,\u201d \u201cHand made Crafter,\u201d \u201cBusiness/Exporter/Importer,\u201d and \u201cNon-Profit Organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">\u201cBusiness/Exporter/Importer\u201d vendors were defined as \u201cthose who provide a good or service to the public that are not hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>made crafts, agricultural products, or prepared foods.\u201d Such vendors were deemed \u201cnot essential to the mission of the Market and ... only allowed to enhance the experience of the patrons who attend the market and to promote local businesses on a limited bases [sic].\u201d They were also required to \u201c[h]old a City of Palm Beach Gardens occupational license or be a current business member of the Northern Palm Beach County Chamber of Commerce.\u201d Booth space for \u201cBusiness/Exporter/Importer\u201d vendors was available only on the first Sunday of the month and on certain \u201cSpecial Event Days.\u201d Levin\u2019s business consisted of purchasing trinket boxes wholesale and selling them retail, and he was classified as a \u201cBusiness/Exporter/Importer\u201d vendor. He acknowledged that he was properly classified and never applied for a different vendor category.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">At summary judgment, the district court found as a matter of law that the vendor classifications were facially valid because they were rationally related to the goals of the Market, as set forth in the mission statement. A trial was held on Levin\u2019s remaining claim that the City applied the facially neutral classifications in a discriminatory manner. At trial, a vendor named Daniel Storey testified that he bought garden-related items commercially and resold them at the Market. Wyner testified that Storey was classified as a \u201cGeneral Agricultural Vendor\u201d based on the nature of his products, although she acknowledged that he did not fit neatly into any of the categories. At the conclusion of Levin\u2019s case, the district court granted the City\u2019s judgment for a matter of law as to Levin\u2019s unequal application claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">I. FACIAL CHALLENGE</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">On appeal, Levin argues that the City\u2019s sub-classifications of vendors are not rationally related to the purpose of the Market, because none of the \u201cNon-Agriculture\u201d vendors promote locally grown produce or the agriculture industry. Moreover, he contends that the City has irrationally discriminated against the \u201cBusiness/Exporter/Importer\u201d vendors by limiting their access to the Market. Further, he asserts that the City defended the classifications in the district court by arguing that the promotion of homegrown business was a legitimate government objective, but that such goal was not articulated in the mission statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">We review a district court order granting summary judgment <em>de ?iovo, </em>viewing all of the facts in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cSummai'y judgment is appropriate when \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E/ Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). Moreover, \u201cpro <em>se </em>pleadings are held to a less strict standard than pleadings filed by lawyers and thus are construed liberally.\u201d <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 632, 172 L.Ed.2d 619 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">The Fourteenth Amendment proclaims that \u201cNo State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. \u201cThe Equal Protection Clause requires that the government treat similarly situated persons in a similar manner.\u201d <em>Gary v. City of Warner Robins, Ga., </em>311 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe Equal Protection Clause does not forbid classifications.\u201d <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 10, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 120 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992). \u201c[U]nless a elassifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>tion warrants some form of heightened review because it jeopardizes exercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic, the Equal Protection Clause requires only that the classification rationally further a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Levin does not argue that his claim warrants heightened review, thus, we review this claim under the \u201crational basis\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">\u201cThe first step in determining whether legislation survives rational-basis scrutiny is identifying a legitimate government purpose \u2014 a goal \u2014 which the enacting government body <em>could </em>have been pursuing.\u201d <em>Haves v. City of Miami, </em>52 F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir.1995) (emphasis in original). \u201cThe second step of rational-basis scrutiny asks whether a rational basis exists for the enacting governmental body to believe that the legislation would further the hypothesized purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922. \u201cOn rational-basis review, a classification in a statute ... comes to us bearing a strong presumption of validity, and those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u201d <em>F.C.C. v. Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 307, 314-15, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 2101-02, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the City\u2019s vendor classifications were rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Appellant\u2019s argument is based on his claim that the only valid governmental interest in running the Market is the promotion of local growers and agriculture. However, the Market\u2019s mission statement for 2006-2007, the first Market season which used the vendor sub-categories that Appellant challenges, sets forth a legitimate municipal objective of providing a \u201c \u2018green\u2019 shopping opportunity and a cultural event\u201d for the northern Palm Beach County area. The City could rationally have concluded that \u201cBusiness/Exporter/Importer\u201d vendors were not \u201cessential to the mission of the Market,\u201d and that limiting their presence to certain special market days would help create the type of shopping opportunity and cultural event the City desired to provide to the area. As a result, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the vendor classifications passed rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">II. AS APPLIED CHALLENGE</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Next, Levin argues that the court erred in granting the City\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. He contends that the court erred in finding no evidence that the City applied the vendor classifications for purposes of discriminating against him, because he showed that Storey was placed in a less restrictive classification but operated a similar business. Moreover, Levin argues that the court provided no support for either its finding that the classification of Storey was at most a mere error or mistake in judgment or its conclusion that there was a rational basis for classifying Storey as a \u201cGeneral Agricultural Vendor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">We review the grant of a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Abel v. Dubberly, </em>210 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2000). Judgment as a matter of law is warranted \u201c[i]f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue....\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1). \u201cAlthough we look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the non-movant must put forth more than a mere scintilla of evidence suggesting that reasonable minds could reach differing verdicts.\u201d <em>Abel, </em>210 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>\u201cIt is well settled that unequal application of a facially neutral statute may violate the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Alderman, </em>74 F.3d 260, 264 (11th Cir.1996). To prevail on such a claim, the plaintiff must establish that: \u201c(1) the plaintiff was treated differently than similarly situated persons; and (2) the defendant unequally applied the facially neutral statute for the purpose of discriminating against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMere error or mistake in judgment when applying a facially neutral statute does not violate the equal protection clause. There must be intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>E &amp; T Realty v. Strickland, </em>830 F.2d 1107, 1114 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The Supreme Court has also recognized a \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim, \u201cwhere the plaintiff alleges that [he] has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u201d <em>Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 1074, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000). We have subsequently indicated that under a \u201cclass of one\u201d analysis, a plaintiff must nevertheless show that the defendant treated the plaintiff differently than a similarly situated individual for the purpose of discriminating against the plaintiff. <em>See Young Apartments, Inc. v. Toum of Jupiter, Fla., </em>529 F.3d 1027, 1045 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Campbell v. Rainbow City, </em>434 F.3d 1306, 1314 (11th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the court did not err in granting the City\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. The evidence demonstrated that Storey was similar to Levin in that they both resold products that they bought elsewhere, and that Storey was classified differently as a \u201cGeneral Agricultural Vendor.\u201d However, the reason that Storey was classified as such was because he sold goods that were related to gardening, and he did not fall neatly into any of the categories. Accordingly, the district court correctly found that Levin demonstrated at most, if at all, a mistaken application of the vendor classifications, which \u201cdoes not violate the equal protection clause.\u201d <em>E &amp; T Realty, </em>830 F.2d at 1114. Stated differently, the City articulated a rational basis for its actions. Wyner considered Storey to be a \u201cGeneral Agricultural Vendor\u201d because he sold products that promoted gardening and agriculture. Levin, on the other hand, sold trinket boxes, and he nowhere claims that his goods had anything to do with gardening or agriculture. As a result, we also affirm the grant of the City\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-10\">. Levin also filed equal protection claims against Charlotte Presensky, the City's Recreation Director, and Christine Tatum, an attorney for the City. However, the district court granted the individual defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint, and Levin raises no issue on appeal with regard to his claims against them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">.
