It is</p>\n<p id=\"b923-24\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>The Board adopted a reasonable interpretation of section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), which we defer to under the second step of <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), <em>see NLRB v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 23, </em>484 U.S. 112, 123-24, 108 S.Ct. 413, 98 L.Ed.2d 429 (1987); in doing so it offered an acceptable rationale for overruling its precedent to the contrary; and it provided an alternative rationale for its order denying make-whole relief based on its \u201cbroad discretionary power ... to fashion remedies,\u201d <em>Petrochem Insulation, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>240 F.3d 26, 34 (D.C.Cir.2001). Thus, on remand from this court, the Board did exactly as we instructed, <em>see Brewers &amp; Maltsters, Local Union No. 6 v. NLRB, </em>414 F.3d 36, 48 (D.C.Cir.2005), and petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(B); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
