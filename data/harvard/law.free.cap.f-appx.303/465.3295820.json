We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Lin was initially ordered deported on August 9, 1993, after failing to appear at his exclusion hearing. A petitioner may succeed in a motion to reopen requesting rescission of an <em>in absentia </em>exclusion order if he demonstrates reasonable cause for failing to appear. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); <em>Matter of Nafi, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 430, 432 (BIA 1987). Here, the BIA did not err in finding that Lin had proper notice of his August 9, 1993 hearing date and time. The Immigration Judge gave Petitioner both oral and written notice of his hearing date, and specifically warned him of the consequences of failing to appear. Furthermore, it is undisputed that Lin\u2019s attorney had notice of the August 9, 1993 hearing date. <em>See Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in determining that Lin failed to show reasonable cause justifying a rescission of his <em>in absentia </em>exclusion order.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Lin\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel (\u201cIAC\u201d) against the attorney who represented him at the time of his August 1993 hearing are without merit. The BIA properly found that Lin failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Under <em>hozada, </em>an alien alleging ineffective assistance must (1) submit an affidavit describing the attorney\u2019s deficiencies; (2) submit evidence that counsel has been notified of the allegations and provided an opportunity to respond; and (3) file a disciplinary complaint against the attorney or explain why such a complaint has not been filed. <em>Id. </em>at 639. Petitioner did not inform his attorney of the allegations made against him, did not provide details of the agreement he had with the attorney, and did not explain why he failed to file a disciplinary complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">A failure to comply with the <em>hozada </em>requirements is not necessarily the end of an IAC claim, <em>see, e.g., Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir.2000), yet a petitioner is excused from the formal requirements of <em>hozada </em>only if he can establish \u201ca clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Petitioner has not argued convincingly that his attorney committed any error, let alone one that was clear and obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Lin also failed to meet the procedural requirements for filing a proper motion to reopen. In general, a motion to reopen must be filed \u201cwithin 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen at issue here was filed around thirteen years after entry of Lin\u2019s deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">The time limit governing motions to reopen may be equitably tolled if an alien demonstrates that he was the victim of deception, fraud, or error. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1090, 1095-96 (9th Cir. 2007). We will not consider Lin\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ment that the BIA should have equitably tolled the ninety-day time limit based on new evidence allegedly corroborating Lin\u2019s claim that he will suffer persecution if returned to China. Lin failed to make this argument before the BIA and therefore did not exhaust his administrative remedies. This court lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the BIA. <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 867 n. 3 (9th Cir.2001). Moreover, Lin has failed to establish that he was the victim of any deception, fraud, or error. Accordingly, Lin\u2019s claim for equitable tolling is without merit and the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reopen as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The BIA did not err in concluding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), permitting an alien to file a successive asylum application when there are changed personal circumstances, does not provide an independent exception to the time limitation on motions to reopen. Petitioner\u2019s argument to the contrary is foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Chen v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1028 (9th Cir.2008). In <em>Chen, </em>this court squarely upheld as reasonable the BIA\u2019s determination that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) does not create an independent exception to the procedural limitations on motions to reopen set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7). <em>Id. </em>at 1031-32. Accordingly, Lin\u2019s argument on this issue is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Finally, we reject Lin\u2019s contention that we should remand the matter to the BIA for the taking of additional evidence concerning whether Petitioner would be subject to persecution if returned to China. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, this court lacks the statutory authority to remand a case to the BIA to review additional evidence. Pub.L. No. 104-208, Div. C, Title III \u00a7 309(c)(4)(B), 110 Stat. 3009 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1)); <em>see also Altawil v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 791, 792-93 (9th Cir.1999). Lin asks this court to embrace dicta from the Second Circuit suggesting that a court may still have \u201cthe inherent equitable power to remand cases to administrative agencies for further proceedings in sufficiently compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>473 F.3d 48, 52 (2d Cir.2007). <em>Lin </em>was largely constrained by a subsequent opinion of the Second Circuit. <em>See Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 267-72 (2d Cir.2007). In <em>Ni, </em>the court concluded that if it did have any inherent authority to remand, its exercise is not warranted where \u201cthe basis for the remand is an instruction to consider documentary evidence that was not in the record before the BIA,\u201d and \u201cthe agency regulations set forth procedures to reopen a case before the BIA for the taking of additional evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269. Both of those prongs are satisfied here, making this matter inappropriate for remand. Even if this court did have any inherent authority to remand, Lin has failed to show \u201csufficiently compelling circumstances\u201d that would justify this court\u2019s exercise of an inherent equitable power to remand. <em>See Lin, </em>473 F.3d at 52; <em>Ni, </em>494 F.3d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

This is but one of a multitude of similar sad cases by which our government\u2019s deportation of undocumented parents results in the deportation of their American-born citizen children, and effectively denies those children their birthrights. <em>See Cerrillo v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1419, 1426-27 (9th Cir.1987) (Requiring the government to conduct individualized analyses of hardships to U.S. citizen children). Our government\u2019s conduct forces U.S. citizen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>children to accept de facto expulsion from their native land or give up their constitutionally protected right to remain with their parents. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503-05, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion) (\u201cOur decisions establish that the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">I hope and pray that soon the good men and women in our Congress will ameliorate the plight of families like Lin\u2019s and give us humane laws that will not cause the disintegration of families.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
