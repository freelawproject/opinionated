Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen because it was filed on May 9, 2008, more than 90 days after the February 6, 2004 final order of removal. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we deny this petition for review in part because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">The motion for a stay of removal pending review is denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b555-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
