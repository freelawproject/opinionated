Vargas was sentenced at the bottom of his advisory sentencing range to 37 months of imprisonment. He contends in light of his personal history and the circumstances surrounding his offense that his sentence is unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We consider whether the sentence imposed is, first, procedurally sound and, second, substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 597. If, as in Vargas\u2019s case, a defendant fails to challenge the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, this court reviews the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for plain error only. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462, Vargas argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), the guideline used to increase his sentencing range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d He portrays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as suggesting that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that did not take account of this data and experience</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\"><em>Kimbrough </em>makes no such suggestion. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. The Court said nothing about the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The appellate presumption of reasonableness applies in this case. Vargas has failed to show why the presumption should not apply. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
