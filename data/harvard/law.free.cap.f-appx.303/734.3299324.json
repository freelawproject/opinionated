On appeal, Wu challenges the I J\u2019s finding that he was not eligible for asylum. He also offers several additional arguments, discussed below, over which we lack jurisdiction or which have been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">A. Claims over which we lack jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir. 2003). The exhaustion requirement applicable to immigration cases is found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), which provides that \u201c[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). We have \u201cinterpreted that requirement to be jurisdictional, so we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320,1323 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Wu did not raise the following his claims on appeal to the BIA: (1) the IJ should not have considered the fact that Wu\u2019s family still resided in the same home, and nothing had happened to them; (2) Wu was persecuted because he was a member of a social group, as he contended before the IJ and the BIA only that he was persecuted because of his political opinions; (3) he was entitled to CAT relief; and (4) the country reports were \u201cbiased and outdated.\u201d Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">B. Abandoned claims</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, or includes only a passing reference to an issue, that will be insufficient to raise a claim for appeal, and such an issue will be deemed abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (no argument); <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (passing reference).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-17\">First, by not offering any support for his argument that the BIA\u2019s summary affir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>manee violated his due process rights, Wu abandoned this issue. Second, although Wu contends that the birth certificate that he submitted should have been deemed sufficient to establish his identity, and the IJ erred by finding otherwise, he does not offer any legal or factual support for his argument, and therefore, this issue has been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">C. Asylum Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, and therefore we will review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions are based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the [IJ]\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cFindings of fact made by the [IJ] may be reversed by [us] only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2006) (alterations and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">An alien may receive asylum if he can carry the burden of proving that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d which is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail ... [himself] of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-11\"><em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230 (citing INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). \u201cThe asylum applicant must establish eligibility for asylum by offering \u2018credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir .2005); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii) (as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(a)(3)) (effective May 11, 2005, for asylum and withholding applications made on or after that effective date) (\u201cThe testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant\u2019s testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u201d). \u201cUncorroborated but credible testimony from the applicant may be sufficient alone to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818-19 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247,1255 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">Accordingly, to be eligible for asylum, \u201cthe alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of [his] political opinion or any other protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ed ground, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u2019 that [his] political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1280-31 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b)). Demonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he would be \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. This Court has recognized that an alien\u2019s imputed political opinion satisfies the requirement that persecution be based on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Although the INA does not define persecution, we have recognized that \u201cpersecution\u201d is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations and bracket omitted). We have held that a five-day detention during which an alien is not harmed does not compel a finding of past persecution. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u2019 subject to rebuttal by the [government].\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Withholding of removal may be granted if the alien establishes that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). If an alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden of showing that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution on the basis of a protected ground, and he would not be able to avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his country, if, under all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Wu was not eligible for asylum because Wu did not establish that he held a political opinion or otherwise fell into one of the five statutorily protected categories. Although he testified that he opposed the village elections, his opposition was based on fears of corruption, not political views. Additionally, he failed to provide any details of his political involvement. Second, Wu\u2019s testimony regarding his detentions convinces us that he did not suffer persecution. Accordingly, we dismiss Wu\u2019s petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
