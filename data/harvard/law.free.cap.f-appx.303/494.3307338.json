Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). Petitioner has not met his burden of establishing that he is eligible for relief from removal because he has not demonstrated that he conviction under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11360(a) was not related to a controlled substance, nor has he demonstrated he qualifies for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d) (alien bears the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-21\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b518-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
