Meyers\u2019s confinement in Shasta County Jail\u2019s Administrative Segregation (Ad-Seg) unit for approximately nine months between February 2002 and December 2002. Meyers was in custody there as a civil detainee pursuant to California\u2019s Welfare and Institution Code \u00a7 6600 \u2014 the Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Meyers filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking injunctive and monetary relief for violations of his constitutional rights during his confinement. The District Court ruled for defendants in two orders that Meyers now appeals: (1) the September 2006 order granting summary judgment and entering judgment for defendants on Meyers\u2019s Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the September 2004 order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Meyers\u2019s Equal Protection claims. For the reasons that follow, we VACATE the district court\u2019s decisions, REMAND this matter for further proceedings, and INSTRUCT that counsel be appointed for Meyers on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">The District Court erred by holding that Meyers waived his due process rights. Under California Penal Code \u00a7 4002(b), a person held under the sexually violent predator laws during the specified semiannual hearings \u201cshall be held in administrative segregation\u201d which means \u201cseparate and secure housing that does not involve any deprivation of privileges other than what is necessary to protect the inmates and staff.\u201d The person may waive his right to administrative segregation, but if he does so and the waiver is granted, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u201cshall be placed with inmates charged with similar offenses or similar criminal histories.\u201d The medical unit to which Meyers was originally assigned had reasonable amenities, but the administrative unit to which he was transferred was very harsh with few of the normal privileges. Meyers was offered an opportunity to be moved from this administrative unit and to be housed with the regular penal inmates. He refused. He was never offered housing that met the statutory definition of administrative segregation. Meyers\u2019s refusal to waive his statutory right to be held in administrative segregation cannot be construed as a waiver of his due process right to be held in non-punitive conditions of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The district court\u2019s qualified immunity analysis was equally flawed. Qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for civil damages \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or Constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 </em>U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Here, Meyers\u2019s substantive due process rights were clearly established in 2002. <em>See Hydrick v. Hunter, </em>500 F.3d 978, 989 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that the law was clearly established, even in 1997, that civil detainees, including SVPs, should be detained in non-punitive conditions). The district court did not address Meyers\u2019s procedural due process claim. We thus vacate its grant of summary judgment for Meyers\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process claims \u2014 both substantive and procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The district court also erred in entering judgment for defendants on Meyers\u2019s claim that the defendants violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying him access to the courts. \u201cThe right of access to courts has been found to encompass the right to talk in person and on the telephone with counsel in confidential settings____\u201d <em>Hydrick, </em>500 F.3d at 999. Here, Meyers adduced evidence that defendants monitored all of his telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The district court further erred in entering judgment for defendants on Meyers\u2019s claim that the defendants violated his Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. A search violates the Fourth Amendment if it is \u201carbitrary, retaliatory, or clearly exceeds the legitimate purpose of detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 993. Here, Meyers adduced evidence that, on a weekly basis, defendants forced him to strip naked and stand covered only with a blanket while his cell was searched. Moreover, on one occasion defendants ordered him from his cell and forced him to undergo a strip search, which involved a visual cavity search.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The district court erred in entering judgment for defendants on Meyers\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy claim. The Fourteenth Amendment protects a \u201csphere of privacy\u201d that includes the \u201cnaked body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1000. It is the state\u2019s burden to show compelling justifications to support a policy that results in an invasion of a detainee\u2019s privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 1000 n. 17. Here, Meyers adduced evidence that defendants told him that females would watch him shower as soon as he began Ad-Seg detention and that it actually happened every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">The district court erred in dismissing Meyers\u2019s equal protection claim. To survive a motion to dismiss, Meyers\u2019s complaint must have set forth an argument upon which a set of facts might have existed to show that during his confinement the discrimination against him was irrational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>or arbitrary. <em>Id. </em>at 999. His complaint adequately presented this legal theory and there is a set of facts upon which he could sustain his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Finally, because of the complexity of this case, we instruct the district court to appoint counsel to represent Meyers. <em>See Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d, 918, 937 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">We VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b539-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

The district court purported to enter judgment on Meyers's access to the courts First Amendment Claim, but that claim was actually a Fourteenth Amendment claim. <em>See Hydride v. Hunter, </em>500 F.3d 978, 1000 (9th Cir. 2007). Meyers appeals only his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims from that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
