McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">Wayne C. Brunsilius, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) that would allow him to appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). Because we conclude that Mr. Brunsilius has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d we deny his request for a COA, and dismiss the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-19\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">On March 13, 1991, Mr. Brunsilius pled guilty to six counts of sexual assault, for which he was sentenced to six consecutive four-year terms. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction in 1992. In 1993, Mr. Brunsilius filed a motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to Colo. R.Crim. P. 35(b), which was denied. He subsequently filed a post-conviction motion pursuant to Colo. R.Crim. P. 35(c), which was also denied as untimely. That decision was affirmed by the Colorado Court of Appeals. Mr. Brunsilius filed another post-conviction motion in 2007, which was similarly denied on procedural grounds; the denial was also affirmed. On February 28, 2008, Mr. Brunsilius filed his first federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court dismissed it for untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">The denial of a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 may be appealed only if the district court or this Court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When a habeas petition is denied on procedural grounds, the petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. </em>McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595,146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">It is not reasonably debatable that the petition was untimely. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), a prisoner must file a habeas petition in federal court no later than one year from the date his direct appeal from his conviction became final. Mr. Brunsilius\u2019s limitation period began to run on April 24, 1996, pursuant to the provision that prisoners whose convictions became final prior to the enactment of \u00a7 2244(d) will have one year from the enactment date of the statute to file them motions. <em>Hoggro v. Boone, </em>150 F.3d 1223, 1225-26 (10th Cir.1998). This limitation is tolled only for the time Mr. Brunsilius had a properly filed application pending for state post-conviction relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1226 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2)). Neither Mr. Brunsilius\u2019s 2001 nor his 2007 post-conviction motion tolled the limitation period because both were filed four years after the limitation period had ended. Additionally, both of Mr. Brunsilius\u2019s 2001 and 2007 state post-conviction motions were denied on the basis of procedural default, disqualifying them from the tolling exception because neither qualified as a \u201cproperly filed application.\u201d <em>See Hoggro, </em>150 F.3d at 1226 n. 4. Furthermore, we find no reason to grant any equitable tolling in this case, as we find that Mr. Brunsilius has not met his burden to demonstrate its propriety. <em>See Miller v. Mart) </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Finally, because Petitioner has failed to show a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal, his motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>is similarly denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Brunsilius\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal. All other motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Petitioner\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-15\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
