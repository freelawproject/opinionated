Gagnon, which denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Webert Boucicaut, </em>No. A78 598 003 (B.I.A. Sept. 12, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A78 598 003 (Immig.Ct.Hartford, Conn. Apr. 12, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The record supports the agency\u2019s finding that Boucicaut\u2019s testimony regarding an April 2000 incident was inconsistent with the written statement submitted with his asylum application. Boucieaut testified that in April 2000, Lavalas Party members beat him \u201cvery severely,\u201d such that he became unconscious. In his written statement, Boucieaut described the same incident but stated only that members \u201cthreatened to hit me.\u201d Boucieaut argues that the agency erred in basing its adverse credibility determination on this \u201cminor\u201d inconsistency. However, we have emphasized that where an applicant alleges an \u201cevent of major importance,\u201d a fact-finder \u201cmight reasonably expect him to have had a clear recollection\u201d of it. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 77 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Cir.2007) (en banc). Here, Boucicaut testified that the incident prompted him to flee his home. In his testimony, he also emphasized that he \u201calmost lost [his] life that day\u201d and that the incident was so \u201cterrible\u201d that it was one he would \u201cnever forget.\u201d In contrast, Boucicaut\u2019s written statement describes the same incident but states only that he was \u201cembarrassed and frightened.\u201d Especially in the absence of any explanation for the significant inconsistency in his accounts of the 2000 incident, we can find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that such discrepancy undermined Boucicaut\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Because the noted inconsistency was a sufficient basis for the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we need not reach the IJ\u2019s other findings. Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was proper. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308. Moreover, because the only evidence of a threat to Boucicaut\u2019s life or freedom or a risk of torture depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case precluded success on his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-5\">. Boucicaut characterizes the inconsistency as a minor omission from his asylum application. While we have cautioned against the reliance on omissions from asylum applications, <em>see Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir.2006), Boucicaut\u2019s argument is unavailing where the inconsistency at issue arose not from a written statement attached to his asylum application, but from a second written statement prepared at the IJ\u2019s request with the assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">. Boucicaut argues that the BIA denied his right to due process in affirming the IJ's adverse credibility determination on the basis of minor inconsistencies and in failing to analyze his documentary evidence. Where the record reveals an inconsistency regarding an event which Boucicaut himself characterized as significant, the BIA's decision, while brief, does not suggest that it failed to consider the entire record. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u2018\u2018[W]e presume that an IJ has taken into account all of the evidence before him, unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise.\u201d). Accordingly, Boucicaut\u2019s due process challenge is unavailing. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Capric v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1075, 1087 (7th Cir.2004) (\"Due process requires that an applicant receive a full and fair hearing which provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
