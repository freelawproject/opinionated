He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence, as well as two aspects of his sentencing. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">On the night of July 18, 2007, Officer T.L. Eddleman\u2014a Fort Worth Police Department Gang Enforcement officer\u2014was patrolling a Fort Worth neighborhood notorious for gang violence. He was accompanied by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) agent who was searching for individuals wanted by ICE. According to Eddleman\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing, the two officers were driving an unmarked vehicle with deeply tinted windows preventing anyone outside the vehicle from seeing its occupants. They observed a group of Hispanic males standing in the public roadway in front of a residence that Eddleman knew was occupied by members of the Varrio North Side (\u201cVNS\u201d) gang. Eddleman also knew that this house was a focal point of violence because it was located in an area controlled by VNS\u2019s rival gang, Varrio Diamond Hill (\u201cVDH\u201d). Eddleman recognized one of the Hispanic males as a documented VNS member. Perez, who was also standing in front of the residence, is a documented VNS member as well, but Eddleman did not recognize him as such before arresting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">As the unmarked vehicle passed by, Perez flashed a VNS gang hand sign, broke from the group, and took steps toward the car in a very aggressive manner. Eddleman testified that such behavior is typical of how gang members \u201cclaim their turf and instigate altercations.\u201d After coordinating an approach of the residence with other officers, Eddleman arrested Perez for disorderly conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officers requested proof of identification from Perez. According to Eddleman\u2019s testimony, Perez indicated that he had left his ID in his bedroom and offered to lead officers into the residence to retrieve it. Eddleman retrieved Perez\u2019s driver\u2019s license from the pocket of a pair of pants on the floor of the bedroom, as directed by Perez. The pocket also contained $1,200 in cash. While in the bedroom, Eddleman observed a clear plastic bag containing a white powdery residue resembling cocaine in plain view on the floor. After obtaining a search warrant for the residence, officers found large quantities of marijuana, cocaine, and cutting agent, as well as significant amounts of cash and firearms. Perez later waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and admitted that the currency, cocaine, and firearms seized from the house belonged to him. He was charged with various narcotics and firearms offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Perez filed a motion to suppress seeking exclusion of the evidence, arguing, among other things, that his disorderly conduct arrest violated his First Amendment rights. At the suppression hearing, Perez testified that, when the unidentified vehicle drove by, he was able to see that its occupants were police officers. He denied having made the VNS gang hand sign observed by Eddleman. He also testified that he did not consent to the officers\u2019 entry into his residence after his arrest. The district court did not find Perez\u2019s testimony to be credible. It denied his motion to suppress, finding that Perez was not aware that the vehicle was a police car, that he made the gang hand sign to provoke a violent altercation, and that he voluntarily led the officers into the residence. The district court also held that even if Perez did not violate Texas\u2019s disorderly conduct statute, a reasonable officer would have believed that such violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Perez entered a conditional plea of guilty the next day, reserving the right to appeal two issues: whether his arrest was illegal because his conduct was protected speech under the First Amendment, and whether police entry into the residence was illegal and not voluntary. The district court sentenced Perez to a total of 228 months of imprisonment under the Sentencing Guidelines; it applied an obstruction of justice enhancement for committing perjury during the suppression hearing and refused to reduce Perez\u2019s sentence for acceptance of responsibility. Perez appeals the denial of his motion to suppress\u2014stating First Amendment grounds only\u2014and the district court\u2019s application of the two sentencing adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOm\">A. Suppression of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Perez contends that his arrest for disorderly conduct under \u00a7 42.01(a)(2) of the Texas Penal Code was illegal because his gang hand sign was protected speech under the First Amendment. Importantly, Perez does not challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 42.01(a)(2). As he correctly notes, the Supreme Court has recognized that the language of the statute was \u201cdesigned to track the \u2018fighting words\u2019 exception\u201d to the First Amendment set forth in <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942). <em>City of Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 462 n. 10,107 S.Ct. 2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987) (discussing \u00a7 42.01(a)(1), which covers verbal disorderly conduct and uses the same language as \u00a7 42.01(a)(2), the disorderly conduct gesture subsection); <em>see also Coggin v. State, </em>123 S.W.3d 82, 87 (Tex.App. 2003) (holding that \u201cthe conduct proscribed under section 42.01(a)(2) falls within the \u2018fighting words\u2019 exception\u201d to the First Amendment). Instead, the core of Perez\u2019s argument is that he did not violate \u00a7 42.01(a)(2) because his hand gesture did not amount to \u201cfighting words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Perez\u2019s appeal thus focuses exclusively on the alleged violation of \u00a7 42.01(a)(2). It ignores the district court\u2019s alternative holding that \u201cwhether or not the conduct that Officer Eddleman described violated Section 42.01 of the Texas Penal Code\u201d\u2014 <em>ie., </em>whether or not the gang hand sign constituted \u201cfighting words\u201d\u2014\u201ca reasonable officer would believe that such a violation did occur.\u201d This holding applies the so-called \u201cgood faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule, under which \u201cevidence is not to be suppressed where it is discovered by officers in the course of actions that are taken in good faith and in the reasonable, though mistaken, belief that they are authorized.\u201d <em>United States v. De Leon-Reyna, </em>930 F.2d 396, 400 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc) (internal quotation and alteration omitted). Perez failed to discuss this ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>plication of the good faith exception in his initial brief to this court;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he therefore waived any challenge to it. <em>See, e.g., R.R. Mgmt. Co. v. CFS La. Midstream Co., </em>428 F.3d 214, 220 n. 3 (5th Cir.2005) (noting that where an appellant challenges only one of the district court\u2019s alternative holdings, his argument that the alternative holding was in error is waived). Because Perez waived his challenge to the district court\u2019s alternative holding, his appeal on the suppression issue necessarily fails. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Perez\u2019s motion to suppress based on the good faith exception, and need not address the merits of his First Amendment argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">B. Application of Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">(1) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">This court \u201creview[s] the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d 353, 356 (5th Cir.2007). A finding of obstruction of justice under Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines is a factual finding reviewed for clear error, and therefore will be affirmed if it is \u201cplausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarie, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2008). Further, in reviewing a finding of obstruction of justice, this court \u201cgive[s] deference to the credibility determinations of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With respect to a district court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility under Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, the standard of review is even \u201cmore deferential than the clearly erroneous standard;\u201d reversal is warranted only when the district court\u2019s denial of the reduction is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">(2) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\n<em>(a) Obst'ruction of Justice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Perez challenges the two-level enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice. Under Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, the enhancement is applicable \u201c[i]f (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct....\u201d The commentary to Section 3C1.1 provides examples of conduct that justifies the enhancement\u2014including \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4(b). To impose the enhancement on the basis of perjury, \u201cthe court must find that the defendant gave \u2018false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>26 F.3d 523, 531 (5th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111,122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The district court found that Perez committed perjury when he testified at the suppression hearing that he did not \u201cflash any gang signs\u201d during the evening he was arrested\u2014a statement that directly contra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>diets Eddleman\u2019s testimony and the factual findings of the district court. The district court noted that Perez was under oath when he gave the testimony, and that his false statement was not a mistake or accident, but was made intentionally. Further, the district court found that Perez\u2019s false testimony was material and relevant to the case, because it was intended to influence the court to rule in his favor. <em>See United States v. Como, </em>53 F.3d 87, 89 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201c \u2018Material,\u2019 as defined in the commentary to the sentencing guidelines, \u2018means evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination\u2019\u201d (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 5)). It is well-established that, under these circumstances, a defendant\u2019s commission of perjury at a suppression hearing supports the application of a Section 3C1.1 enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 91; <em>Reed, </em>26 F.3d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Perez does not dispute the falsity or materiality of his testimony at the suppression hearing, nor does he argue that his false statements were unintentionally made. Rather, Perez contends that the enhancement was improper because it resulted from his exercise of his constitutional right to challenge the evidence against him on First Amendment grounds. In support of his position, Perez quotes the following commentary to Section 3C1.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag1\"><em>Limitations on Applicability of Adjustment. </em>\u2014 This provision is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right. A defendant\u2019s denial of guilt (other than a denial of guilt under oath that constitutes perjury), refusal to admit guilt or provide information to a probation officer, or refusal to enter a plea of guilty is not a basis for application of this provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 2. Clearly, this language does not preclude defendants committing perjury from being subject to the obstruction of justice enhancement \u2014 in fact, the commentary expressly excludes \u201cdenial of guilt under oath that constitutes perjury\u201d from its protection. Further, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \u201ca defendant\u2019s right to testify does not include a right to commit perjury.\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 96, 113 S.Ct. 1111. The district court\u2019s application of Section 3C1.1 was not punishing Perez\u2019s attempt to suppress allegedly unconstitutional evidence or to assert his First Amendment rights. It was the consequence of Perez\u2019s perjury at the suppression hearing \u2014 a well-recognized justification for imposing the enhancement. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s imposition of the obstruction of justice enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\n<em>(b) Acceptance of Responsibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Perez argues that, by pleading guilty to the drug charges against him, he demonstrated acceptance of responsibility for his offense and thus should have been granted a reduction in his sentence under Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Ordinarily, conduct resulting in an enhancement for obstruction of justice \u201cindicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 4; <em>see also Juarez-Dumie, </em>513 F.3d at 211. Only in \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d will both adjustments apply. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Perez cites commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1, which provides that a defendant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct\u201d does not preclude a defendant from consideration for a Section 3E1.1 adjustment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 2. This commentary is intended to protect defendants who accept responsibility but never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>theless go to trial in order \u201cto assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt,\u201d <em>id., </em>not defendants who commit perjury. Perez has not shown that this case \u201crise[s] to the level of being an \u2018extraordinary case\u2019 \u201d that would warrant reducing his sentence despite his obstruction of justice. <em>See Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 211 (quotation omitted). Therefore, there was adequate foundation for the district court to deny a \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
