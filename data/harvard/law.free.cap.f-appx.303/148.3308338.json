Hughes was sentenced to the statutorily required minimum term of seven years\u2019 imprisonment on the first count and received the statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>rily required consecutive minimum term of twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment on the second count. He now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Hughes\u2019 guilty plea. Hughes was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Because Hughes did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the transcript of the plea hearing leads us to conclude that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Hughes\u2019 guilty plea and that the court\u2019s omissions did not affect Hughes\u2019 substantial rights. Critically, the transcript reveals that the district court ensured the plea was supported by an independent factual basis and that Hughes entered the plea knowingly and voluntarily with an understanding of the consequences. <em>See United States v. De-Fusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir. 1991). Further, Hughes does not suggest that he would have declined to plead guilty had the district court\u2019s Rule 11 colloquy been more exacting. Accordingly, we discern no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and we find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
