We have jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and we affirm the denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1214 n. 1 (9th Cir.2005). The standard of review for the ALJ\u2019s decision is whether it was supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">Stone argues that the ALJ erred by accepting the opinions of a consulting psychologist, Dr. Patrick, instead of the opinions of Stone\u2019s treating doctor, Dr. Redfern. However, the record reflects that the ALJ in fact accepted nearly all of Dr. Redfern\u2019s opinions. For instance, despite some evidence to the contrary, the ALJ accepted Dr. Redfern\u2019s opinion regarding Stone\u2019s fibromyalgia. Moreover, partial reliance on Dr. Patrick\u2019s opinions was proper given the fact that many of the doctors who examined Stone, including Dr. Redfern himself, observed that Stone\u2019s symptoms were likely related to psychological issues. To the extent that the ALJ did disregard Dr. Redfern\u2019s opinions regarding the extent of Stone\u2019s disability, he did so based on specific and legitimate reasons, including the reports of various examining doctors, the lack of medical evidence supporting such opinions, and inconsistencies exhibited in Dr. Redfern\u2019s files. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">Stone also argues that the ALJ failed to address his claim that the fatigue caused by his severe disabilities would prevent him from maintaining employment. However, Stone has not directed this court to any medical evidence in the file supporting this argument. To the extent that the argument is based on Stone\u2019s own testimony, the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount that testimony was justified. Since Stone\u2019s testimony indicated further symptoms than those supported by objective evidence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ALJ considered whether that testimony was credible. <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 602 (9th Cir.1989). The ALJ properly noted that Stone\u2019s testimony was contradictory and therefore not credible. <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1148 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Finally, Stone argues that denial of benefits is unfair if Stone\u2019s treating physician committed malpractice by prescribing pain medications that undermined Stone\u2019s ability to work. However, Stone points to no specific legal basis for this claim, nor is there any finding in the record that Dr. Redfern committed malpractice. While a previous ALJ suggested at a hearing that he believed Dr. Redfern had indeed committed malpractice, that ALJ immediately recused himself, and the comment had no influence on later proceedings.'</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b419-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
