The BIA and the IJ denied Mont Gerard\u2019s applications based on a finding that he was not credible. After review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-22\">On appeal, Mont Gerard argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An asylum applicant has the burden to show, with specific and credible evidence, either past persecution or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on a protected ground. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005). If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>IJ finds an asylum applicant not credible, the IJ must make an explicit adverse credibility finding and offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the finding. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The IJ and the BIA gave specific, cogent reasons for finding Mont Gerard not credible. Specifically, the IJ found that Mont Gerard\u2019s testimony was vague and inconsistent regarding (1) his membership and leadership in, and the nature of, the PLB party (which he claimed caused Lavalas to target him), (2) an incident in which a group protested and threw rocks at his home, and (3) the injury he received running away from his Lavalas assailants. The IJ also found Mont Gerard failed to give a plausible reason for remaining in Port Au Prince after he felt threatened and moved his family away or for returning to Haiti after spending fifteen days in the United States. These reasons for discrediting Mont Gerard are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, Mont Gerard does not contend that the other evidence in the record, alone, compels a conclusion that he was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because Mont Gerard failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he likewise failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir. 2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-14\">. Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will overturn them only if the record compels it. <em>Forgue </em>v. <em>U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\u201d) to permit an adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies that do not go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d)(4)(C), 119 Stat. 231, 303, 304-05 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1229a(c)(4)(C)). Because Mont Gerard\u2019s application was filed before May 11, 2005, the REAL ID Act's changes do not apply to his claims. Nonetheless, we need not resolve whether adverse credibility determinations in pre-REAL ID Act cases must go to the heart of the claim because the inconsistencies identified by the IJ and the BIA in this case relate directly to Mont Gerard\u2019s claims of persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-22\">. Because we conclude that the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we do not address Mont Gerard's argument that his testimony, taken as true, established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b711-23\">. We lack jurisdiction to review Mont Gerard's CAT claim because he did not raise it with the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), INA \u00a7 242(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
