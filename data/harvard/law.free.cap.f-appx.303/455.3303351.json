Fed.

On de novo review, <em>Edlund v. Massanri, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">1. Substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) finding that Claimant\u2019s sleep apnea and depression with anxiety are not severe impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\">A sleep study in May 2003 resulted in a diagnosis by Drs. Lefor and Libby of \u201cmoderate\u201d apnea. Claimant failed to follow the treatment plan that they recommended. But the record shows that, if properly treated, Claimant\u2019s sleep apnea would be controlled effectively. <em>See Warre v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>439 F.3d 1001, 1006 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that an impairment that can be controlled effectively is not disabling for social security purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-21\">With respect to Claimant\u2019s mental health, the record supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that the medical records, specifically those of Drs. Cleary and Rethinger, do not indicate any severe problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">2. The ALJ permissibly found that Claimant was not credible. The medical evidence and Claimant\u2019s testimony regarding her daily activities provide substantial evidence for that finding. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>example, none of Claimant\u2019s physicians reported debilitating symptoms. With regard to activities, Claimant\u2019s out-of-state travels and regular swimming contradicted her subjective complaints of pain and lack of mobility. In addition, Claimant reported \u201cunbearable\u201d pain but stated elsewhere that her pain was at level two on a scale from one to ten. And she failed to follow a recommended treatment plan for sleep apnea. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that an unexplained failure to follow prescribed treatment can cast doubt on a claimant\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">3. The ALJ gave germane reasons, <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 510-12 (9th Cir.2001), for rejecting in part the statements of Claimant\u2019s husband, former co-worker, and friend. Claimant\u2019s husband worked full-time outside the home and could not observe her during much of the day. The co-worker\u2019s opinion that Claimant could not perform her past work did not necessitate a finding that she could not work at all. The friend\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with Claimant\u2019s own and, in fact, supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that Claimant is more able than she asserts. The ALJ also properly gave greater weight to the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">3. The ALJ properly evaluated Claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity. He discussed the relevant evidence and relied on the findings of treating, examining, and reviewing physicians and psychologists. The ALJ permissibly discounted Dr. Cleary\u2019s treatment note that Claimant is \u201cdisabled,\u201d because Dr. Cleary acknowledged that the limitations he reported rested on Claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, which the ALJ had properly discounted. <em>See Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1216-17 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that an ALJ may reject a physician\u2019s finding that is unsupported by the record or premised on a claimant\u2019s properly discredited subjective complaints).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">5. The ALJ did not err in concluding that Claimant could perform her past work as a medical laboratory assistant. Claimant argues that the assessment of her residual functional capacity was incorrect, but we hold to the contrary. A vocational expert testified (consistent with information contained in the <em>Dictionary </em>of Occupational Titles) that Claimant\u2019s past work is sedentary and semiskilled, and the medical records show that such work is within Claimant\u2019s capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b481-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
