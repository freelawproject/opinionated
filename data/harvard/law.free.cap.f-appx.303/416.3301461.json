(\u201cMVRA\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal (without leave to amend) of its 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 due process claim, and its equitable estoppel claim, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The district court properly dismissed MVRA\u2019s claims, because MVRA cannot prove a set of facts in support of its claims that would entitle its members to relief. <em>Miller v. Yokohama Tire Corp., </em>358 F.3d 616, 619 (9th Cir.2004) (describing standard of review). Dismissal without leave to amend was appropriate because amendment would be futile. <em>Flowers v. First Hawaiian Bank, </em>295 F.3d 966, 976 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\u201cA threshold requirement to a substantive or procedural due process claim is the plaintiff\u2019s showing of a liberty or property interest protected by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Wedges, Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz., </em>24 F.3d 56, 62 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). The Constitution does not create protected property interests; they instead spring from \u201can independent source such as state law-rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that <em>suppoR claims of entitlement </em>to those benefits.\u201d <em>Thornton v. City of St. Helens, </em>425 F.3d 1158, 1164 (9th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701) (emphasis added). Moreover, a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d is more than a \u201cunilateral expectation of a benefit or privilege,\u201d <em>Nunez v. City of L. A., </em>147 F.3d 867, 872 (9th Cir.1998) (internal quotations omitted), but is \u201cdetermined largely by the language of the statute and the extent to which the entitlement is couched in mandatory terms,\u201d <em>Wedges, Ledges of Cal., </em>24 F.3d at 62 (internal quotation omitted). In short, property interests arise only when the state law \u201ctruly ma[kes] [conferral of the benefit] <em>mandatory.\u201d Town of Castle Rock, Colo. v. Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. 748, 760, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Even if MVRA properly raised its \u201cofficial assurances\u201d argument, it cannot cite any Hawaii case or statutory law that supports a legitimate claim to its asserted entitlements \u2014 that its members have both (1) the right to operate transient vacation rentals (\u201cTVRs\u201d) without required permits while Maui County processes permit applications and (2) the right to have Maui County indefinitely maintain its enforcement by complaint policy. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed MVRA\u2019s due process claim and, because allowing an amendment to clarify this argument would be futile, the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied MVRA leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">The district court also correctly dismissed MVRA\u2019s estoppel claim. Equitable estoppel protects a developer\u2019s change of position resulting from a \u201csubstantial expenditure of money in connection with his project in reliance ... on <em>official assurance ... </em>that necessary approvals will be forthcoming in due course, and he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>safely proceed with the project.\u201d <em>Life of the Land, Inc. v. City Council of City &amp; County of Honolulu, </em>61 Haw. 390, 606 P.2d 866, 902 (1980) (emphasis added). MVRA members did not receive \u201cofficial\u201d assurances under Hawaii law. <em>See Kepo\u2018o v. Kane, </em>106 Hawai\u2019i 270, 103 P.3d 939, 964 (2005) (government agents \u201cmust act within the bounds of their authority,\u201d and \u201cone who deals with [government agents] assumes the risk that [the agents] are so acting\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, MVRA members operating TVRs without permits were on notice that their conduct was unlawful and that Maui County retained discretionary authority to enforce the permit requirement. <em>See Brescia v. N. Shore Ohana, </em>115 Hawai\u2019i 477, 168 P.3d 929, 952 (2007). Accordingly, MVRA cannot prevail on an equitable estoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
