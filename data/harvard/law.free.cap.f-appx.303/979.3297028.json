Kahn, of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1004-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">The plaintiffs appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to certify a proposed class of plaintiffs and its grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion for summary judgment in this action brought pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Pub.L. 93-406, Sept. 2, 1974, 88 Stat. 829 (\u201cERISA\u201d). The plaintiffs are current or former employees of JPMorgan Chase who participate in or otherwise stand to benefit from a JPMorgan Chase deferred employee compensation plan, a defined contribution plan intended to qualify for tax benefits pursuant to IRC \u00a7 401(k). At least some of the plaintiffs\u2019 individual plan accounts were invested in the JPMorgan Chase Stock Fund or a predecessor fund, which invested in the company\u2019s own common stock. That investment was allegedly improper because JPMorgan Chase failed to disclose certain banking, accounting, and investment malfeasance largely connected with Enron Corp. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants are liable under ERISA for the imprudent investment, negligent misrepresentations or omissions about the plan\u2019s management, and negligent supervision of the plan\u2019s fiduciaries. We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">This appeal initially presents the question whether the district court was correct to conclude the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this action pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2). In the district court\u2019s view, <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985), precluded \u00a7 502(a)(2) actions like this one where the plaintiffs seek damages for a proper subset of plan participants (here, only participants invested in the JPMorgan Chase Stock Fund).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">After the district court ruled and the plaintiffs appealed to this Court, however, the Supreme Court decided <em>LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1020, 169 L.Ed.2d 847 (2008). <em>LaRue </em>held that plaintiff participants in defined contribution pension plans may seek recovery for \u201cmisconduct [that] impaired the value of plan assets in the participant\u2019s individual accounts],\u201d and held further that <em>Russell\u2019s </em>requirement of plan-wide recovery was \u201cbeside the point in the defined contribution context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1022, 1025. The defendants now concede, based on <em>LaRue, </em>that the plaintiffs have standing to bring suit under \u00a7 502(a)(2), and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">The defendants nonetheless ask that we affirm the judgment on alternative legal grounds that they presented to the district court in them application for summary judgment, but which the district court did not address in the order which is the basis for this appeal. We have the ability to affirm on grounds different from those relied upon by the district court where we find it appropriate to do so. <em>See, e.g., Adirondack Transit Lines, Inc. v. United Transp. Union, Local 1582, </em>305 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">In this case, however, the district court explicitly rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments in this regard in an oral opinion denying them earlier motion to dismiss, ruling that most of the arguments were not amenable to judgment on the pleadings. There being no final judgment at that time, the defendants could not seek our review of that order. They invite us now, in effect, to do just that by deciding in the first instance whether the litigation should be terminated in their favor \u201con the pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">We decline to do so. First, because the district court likely did not anticipate appellate review of its decision declining to dismiss, the oral decision may not reflect the court\u2019s entire consideration of the issues. Second, the district court\u2019s ruling occurred before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), which may have altered the applicable standard for the sufficiency of the pleadings here. Third, even though a decision on this issue may ultimately be reviewable by us <em>de novo, </em>we will likely benefit from the district court\u2019s further attention to it, and, if it deems it necessary or advisable, further discovery. <em>See Beckford v. Portuondo, </em>234 F.3d 128 (2d Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (court of appeals benefits from a complete and comprehensive decision by a district court granting a motion for summary judgment even though our standard of review is <em>de </em>novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">We appreciate that benefits plan administrators, beneficiaries, and their counsel are eager for us to resolve these issues of ERISA law. We conclude nonetheless that this appeal does not present us with an appropriate vehicle for such a decision. We therefore restrict our ruling to the question of standing, which the parties agree has been decided by intervening Supreme Court authority in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. We reverse the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment because it erroneously concluded the plaintiffs lacked statutory standing under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2), and we otherwise vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby REVERSED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
