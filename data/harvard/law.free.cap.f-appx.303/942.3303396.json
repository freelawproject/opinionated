Grajales has admitted that she was convicted of larceny in violation of Michigan General Statute \u00a7 750.860, and of making a false statement on a passport application in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542. Grajales contested removability before the Immigration Judge (IJ) on the ground that making a false statement on a passport application is not a CIMT. The IJ rejected Grajales\u2019s argument and ordered her removed. The BIA, citing this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 60 (2d Cir.2006), affirmed. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\"><em>Rodriguez </em>holds that a \u00a7 1542 violation constitutes a CIMT because it \u201cinvolves deceit and an intent to impair the efficiency and lawful functioning of the government.\u201d 451 F.3d at 64. Grajales concedes that <em>Rodriguez </em>controls her case, but she asks that we revisit <em>Rodriguez </em>because, she argues, it was decided incorrectly. It is well-settled that one panel of this Court may not overrule the decision of a prior panel except where an intervening Supreme Court decision casts doubt on the prior ruling. <em>Finkel v. Stratton Corp., </em>962 F.2d 169,174-75 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Additionally, Grajales\u2019s arguments do not warrant reversal. This Court defers to the BIA\u2019s construction of undefined statutory terms such as \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d <em>Gill v. I.N.S., </em>420 F.3d 82, 89 (2d Cir.2005). Grajales suggests that the BIA has construed \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d to apply only to crimes that have an \u201cevil intent\u201d element, and that because we have found that a \u00a7 1542 violation does not require a finding of evil intent, <em>see United States v. George, </em>386 F.3d 383, 394 (2d Cir.2004), such a violation cannot constitute a CIMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Grajales is incorrect. \u201c[Wjhile crimes involving moral turpitude often involve an evil intent, such a specific intent is not a prerequisite to finding that a crime involves moral turpitude.\u201d <em>In re Jose Luis Lopez-Meza, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1188, 1192 (B.I.A.1999). Rather, in determining whether an offense constitutes a CIMT, it is necessary to evaluate whether \u201cthe statute defines a crime in which turpitude necessarily inheres.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193. As the <em>Rodriguez </em>panel recognized, moral turpitude necessarily inheres in a \u00a7 1542 violation. <em>Rodriguez, </em>451 F.3d at 65. <em>Rodriguez </em>was correctly decided, and controls this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Accordingly, we hereby DENY Grajales\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
