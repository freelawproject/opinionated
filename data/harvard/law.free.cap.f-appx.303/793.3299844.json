On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court was permitted to lower his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the mandatory statutory minimum term of imprisonment is no longer a bar now that he is eligible for a reduced sentence based on Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). Section 3582(c)(2) prohibits a court from modifying a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed except \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (Supp. May 1, 2008). Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels, became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2007, by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">A defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction, because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable Guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (Supp. May 1, 2008). This occurs where, as here, the defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (Supp. May 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>2008) (noting that defendant is not eligible for reduction, even if amendment is listed in subsection (c), if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., <em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment </em>).\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe statute controls in the event of a conflict between the guideline and the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In this case, the district court did not err by finding that it lacked authority to reduce Johnson\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. The court at the original sentencing varied downward to the mandatory statutory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the shortest term permitted by the penalty statute. Thus, a further reduction is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
