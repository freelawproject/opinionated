He argues that the district court did not provide sufficient facts and reasons to allow this court to conduct meaningful review. He argues that he was not seeking discovery; rather he was seeking to perpetuate and obtain \u201cknown testimony.\u201d Caraway argues that he has met all the requirements under Rule 27 for perpetuating testimony and that he cannot file his complaint at this time because he has not exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Caraway has not shown that perpetuation of the testimony of the identified witnesses in his case is necessary to prevent testimony from being lost or to prevent a failure or delay of justice. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CivP. 27(a)(3); <em>Hibernia Nat\u2019l Bank v. Robinson, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 241 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Ash v. Cort, </em>512 F.2d 909, 911 (3d Cir. 1975). He has not shown that exhaustion of his administrative remedies will take an unusually long time or that there is a reasonable likelihood that these witnesses may become unavailable before he exhausts his administrative remedies. After exhausting his administrative remedies, Caraway may file a complaint and seek discovery after the court completes its judicial screening of the case. Therefore, Caraway has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 27 motion to perpetuate testimony. <em>See Shore v. Acands, </em>644 F.2d 386, 388 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
