Cuthbert appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s (Commissioner) denial of his application for disability and disability insurance benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). On appeal, Cuthbert argues the district court erred by upholding the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) finding that his mental impairment was not severe.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cuthbert contends the ALJ\u2019s finding was not supported by substantial evidence as it was contrary to the opinions of three doctors who examined him. Cuthbert also argues the ALJ\u2019s severity determination resulted in an error later in the disability analysis when the ALJ applied the medical-vocational guidelines instead of calling a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles underlying the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). We review the Commissioner\u2019s ultimate decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence is \u201cless than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-17\">To receive Social Security disability benefits, Cuthbert must prove he is disabled. <em>Id. </em>In evaluating a disability claim, an ALJ uses the following five-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>1. Is the individual performing substantial gainful activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">2. Does she have a severe impairment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">3. Does she have a severe impairment that meets or equals an impairment specifically listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">4. Can she perform her past relevant work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">5. Based on her age, education, and work experience, can she perform other work of the sort found in the national economy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-9\"><em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">At step two, \u201c[a]n impairment or combination of impairments is not severe if it does not significantly limit [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(a). Basic work activities include, for example, (1) physical functions such as walking and standing; (2) capacities for seeing, hearing, and speaking; (3) understanding, following, and remembering simple instructions; (4) using judgment; (5) responding appropriately to supervision, co-workers, and normal work situations; and (6) dealing with changes in the work setting. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(b). At step two, only claims based on the most trivial impairments can be rejected, and \u201c[a]n impairment is not severe only if the abnormality is so slight and its effect so minimal that it would clearly not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education or work experience.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1031 (11th Cir.1986). If an individual is found not to have a severe impairment at step two of the analysis, then the individual is found not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Mental impairments are evaluated based on how the claimant\u2019s mental impairment impacts foui\u2019 functional areas: \u201cActivities of daily living; social functioning; concentration, persistence, or pace; and episodes of decompensation.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(c)(3). If the degree of limitation in the first three functional areas is rated as \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cmild,\u201d and \u201cnone\u201d in the fourth area, the Commissioner generally concludes the impairment is not severe. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(d)(l). The ALJ must incorporate the results of this analysis into his findings and conclusions. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">Opinions of treating physicians must be given substantial weight unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240. Good cause exists when the \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conelusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Cuthbert\u2019s mental impairment after June 2003 was not severe. First, the evidence showed Cuthbert could carry out many daily living activities, such as preparing food, shopping, and caring for himself. Moreover, the difficulties Cuthbert reported in these activities related to physical pain rather than a mental impairment. Second, Cuthbert\u2019s social functioning was not severely impacted by his depression as he was able to attend church, have visitors, and socialize with his family by telephone. Third, psychological examinations did not reveal major deficits in concentration, persistence, or pace as (1) Dr. Michael Amiel observed Cuthbert\u2019s thought processes were organized, and he was able to interpret opposites and similarities; (2) Dr. Paula Lovett found Cuthbert\u2019s attention and concentration skills were normal, his memory was intact, and his abstracting ability and insight were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>good; and (3) Dr. Lance Chodosh opined Cuthbert was able to comprehend and follow directions. Fourth, the record reveals no episodes of decompensation. Moreover, the state agency psychologist found Cuthbert had no episodes of decompensation, and had only mild restrictions in his activities of daily living, social functioning, and ability to maintain concentration, persistence, or pace. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(d)(l). Finally, Drs. Amiel and Lovett, along with the state agency psychologist, found Cuthbert\u2019s depression was mild in intensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The ALJ had \u201cgood cause\u201d to question the credibility of Dr. Lovett\u2019s Mental Residual Functional Capacity (MRFC) responses. First, Cuthbert concedes in his brief the MRFC covers only July 2002 to April 2003. Thus, it does not cover the time period, beginning June 17, 2003, during which the ALJ found Cuthbert was not disabled. Second, Dr. Lovett\u2019s responses are conclusory because they merely consist of items checked on a survey, with no explanations. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. Third, the extensive limitations detailed in the MRFC were inconsistent with Dr. Lovett\u2019s earlier assessment that Cuthbert\u2019s depression was mild in intensity. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the district court did not err in finding the ALJ\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">As substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion at step two, it is unnecessary to address Cuthbert\u2019s argument that the ALJ committed error at step five by using the medical-vocational guidelines instead of calling a vocational expert. Because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Cuthbert\u2019s mental impairment was not severe, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\">. As an initial matter, Cuthbert has abandoned any argument he was disabled based on his physical impairments after June 17, 2003, by failing to raise such an argument on appeal. <em>See Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding that claims not raised on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
