West claims that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b180-24\">At trial, Craig Coles testified that Letrista West, Barry West\u2019s sister, was charged with identity theft. Prior to Letrista\u2019s trial, Barry West told Coles that he should let Letrista handle the charge against her. Coles took the comment to mean that he should not discuss the identity theft matter with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-25\">On the day of Letrista\u2019s trial, Coles and Barry West ran into each other in a hallway of the federal courthouse. As West approached Coles, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-26\">COLES: Hey, what\u2019s up, Barry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-27\">WEST: My motherfucking sister is what\u2019s up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>COLES: I don\u2019t have nothing to do with your sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">WEST: You got something to do with her. She did this shit herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">COLES: I didn\u2019t have nothing to do with your sister. If she is a thief, she is a thief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">WEST: We\u2019re going to see who gets the last laugh. I\u2019ll fuck you up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Coles testified that during this conversation, West was so close to him that \u201cI could have puckered my lips and kissed him.\u201d Coles felt that there was a real possibility that West would hit him. Once the men separated, Coles testified that West shook his head \u201cand then he [gestured] as if he was going to cut my neck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Coles\u2019 mother, who witnessed the confrontation, testified that she feared that West would strike her son. She rushed to a nearby courtroom for assistance. A court security officer testified that the two men were toe-to-toe in the hallway. Another witness testified that West was leaning towards Coles, who appeared frightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">We must determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United, States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 250 (4th Cir.2001). If substantial evidence exists to support a verdict, we must sustain it. <em>Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80, 62 S.Ct. 457. We do not review the credibility of witnesses, and we assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the Government. <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">To establish a violation of witness tampering under \u00a7 1512(a)(2)(A), the United States had to prove that: (1) West used physical force or the threat of physical force; (2) with the intent of curtailing Coles\u2019 involvement in Letrista West\u2019s prosecution. <em>See United States v. England, </em>507 F.3d 581, 588 (7th Cir.2007). \u201c[T] he statute prohibits expressing an intent to inflict injury on another through physical force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589. The threat must objectively have a \u201creasonable tendency to intimidate,\u201d and only \u201ctrue threats\u201d are punished under the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the Government, a rational jury could have convicted West. Prior to the incident in the courthouse, West suggested to Coles that he should not cooperate with police in the investigation of Letrista. Coles was subpoenaed as a Government witness at Letrista\u2019s trial, and his name was on the Government\u2019s witness list. It is logical to infer that West knew that Coles was scheduled to testify against his sister. West was clearly the aggressor during the confrontation with Coles at the courthouse. Finally, his statements to West and his making a cutting motion across his neck clearly were threatening and reasonably could be viewed as intended to intimidate Coles so that he would not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
