The BIA affirmed the IJ on two grounds: (1) Calderon waived his right to contest removability; and (2) Calderon committed a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-23\">Calderon conceded before the IJ that his conviction qualified as an aggravated felony. Both times his case was before the BIA, he faded to provide any reason why he should be able to revoke his concession. His opening brief before us failed to even acknowledge the BIA\u2019s first reason for affirming the IJ. Even though the government highlighted this failure in its opposition brief, Calderon did not file a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-24\">We \u201cwill not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in [the] appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d <em>Shanks v. Dressel, </em>540 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1082, 1086 n. 3 (9th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cBy failing to articulate any argument challenging [the BIA\u2019s affirmance based on Calderon\u2019s concession], [Calderon] has waived that argument.\u201d <em>See Indep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal., Inc. v. Shewry, </em>543 F.3d 1050, 1065 n. 17 (9th Cir.2008). Although we have \u201cdiscretion to review an issue not raised [in the opening brief] ... when it is raised in the [opposition] brief,\u201d we decline to exercise that discretion in this case. <em>See Affordable Hous. Dev. Corp. v. City of Fresno, </em>433 F.3d 1182, 1193 (9th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike the IJ\u2019s decision in <em>Mandujano-Real v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 585, 588 (9th Cir.2008), the IJ\u2019s decision in this case was not contrary to well-established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b473-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
