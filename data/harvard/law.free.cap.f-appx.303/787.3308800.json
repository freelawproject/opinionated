On February 15, 2008, we ruled the district court correctly sentenced Holman as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. That determination was based, in part, on his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 790.01(2). <em>United States v. Holman, </em>265 Fed.Appx. 812 (11th Cir.2008). Holman then petitioned the Supreme Court for <em>certiorari. </em>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), concluding that the felony offense of driving under the influence was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Holman, </em>vacated our decision, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Begay. Holman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 86, 172 L.Ed.2d 6 (2008). On remand, the Government has confessed that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>court erred by considering Holman\u2019s prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>484 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). A district court generally may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence as a career offender \u201cif (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The Sentencing Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a crime punishable by a year or more of imprisonment, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is a burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In <em>Begay, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a conviction for felony driving under the influence constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>Begay, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1584. The Court, assuming that driving under the influence presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, concluded that such crimes were violent felonies only to the extent that they were \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,\u201d to the crimes enumerated in the ACCA \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. <em>Id. </em>at 1584-85. Applying this standard to felony driving under the influence, the Supreme Court held that the offense was not a violent felony because a conviction for driving under the influence did not require a showing of purposeful, violent, aggressive conduct, but was more comparable to strict liability crimes where no intent was required. <em>Id. </em>at 1586-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Applying the standard announced in <em>Be-gay, </em>we later held that the crime of carrying a concealed weapon no longer could be considered a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1, and concluded that our decision in <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998), which held otherwise, had been abrogated by <em>Begay. United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">In light of our decision in <em>Archer </em>and the Government\u2019s confession of error, we vacate Holman\u2019s sentence and remand his case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\">. Holman's motion for expedited appeal on remand is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
