After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Ferro filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C,' amends. 706, 713. The district court granted Ferro\u2019s motion in part and reduced Ferro\u2019s 151-month sentence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of Ferro\u2019s new guidelines range of 121 to 151 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">The district court denied Ferro\u2019s request to impose a sentence below the new guidelines range, concluding that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A), district courts are not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the low end of the amended guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Ferro argues that the district court erred when it concluded that it lacked authority to reduce Ferro\u2019s sentence below the low end of his amended guidelines range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-17\">We need not resolve whether <em>Booker </em>applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resentencings, however, because any alleged error was harmless. The district court expressly found that \u201ceven if <em>Booker </em>were applied, the Court would in all likelihood impose the same sentence\u201d and that Ferro\u2019s 121-month sentence was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with all of the factors considered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d (Quotation marks omitted). In light of these findings, we fairly can conclude that the district court would have imposed the same 121-month sentence even if it had believed it had the authority to impose a sentence below the amended guidelines range. As a result, any error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>the district court may have made had only a very slight, if any, effect on Ferro\u2019s sentence and was harmless. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that a statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless when it did not affect, or had only a very slight effect on, the sentence when viewing the proceedings as a whole).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-11\">. At his original sentencing, Ferro's guidelines range, after a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance reduction, was 168 to 210 months' imprisonment, and the district court imposed a 168-month sentence. Ferro later received a Rule 35(b) substantial assistance reduction, giving him a guidelines range of 151 to 188 months' imprisonment, and the district court imposed a 151-month sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-12\">. Section 3582(c)(2) requires a sentence reduction to be consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines' policy statements, which includes U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 1B1.10(b)(2) and its commentary preclude a district court from reducing a defendant's sentence below the amended guidelines range if the defendant's original sentence fell within the then-applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; cmt. n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-19\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
