Jan. 14, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Alt v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23,112 S.Ct. 719,116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen where it reasonably determined that Chen failed to establish his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum relief based on his political activities in the United States as an alleged member of the Chinese Democracy Party (\u201cCDP\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">As the BIA observed, Chen did not show that the Chinese authorities knew or would likely learn of his CDP activities. <em>See Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]o establish a well-founded fear of persecution in the absence of any evidence of past persecution, an alien must make some showing that authorities in his country of nationality are either [1] aware of his activities or [2] likely to become aware of his activities.\u201d). Moreover, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Chen submitted insufficient evidence that China engaged in a pattern or practice of persecuting those engaged in CDP activities in the United States. Nearly all of Chen\u2019s evidence related to the Chinese authorities\u2019 treatment of political dissidents who acted <em>within </em>China. In addition, the BIA properly concluded that the single article Chen submitted describing the brief detention of a CDP member from the United States was insufficient to establish a pattern or practice of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2); <em>cf. Jian Hui Shao v. Mu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>kasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 150 n. 6 (2d Cir.2008) (discussing BIA\u2019s analysis of pattern-or-practice claims); <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88, 91 (2d Cir.2007) (same). As a result, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-12\">. Chen's May 24, 2007 motion to reopen was timely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be Hied no later than 90 days after date on which final administrative decision was rendered). Accordingly, Chen was <em>able </em>to move to reopen based on changed personal circumstances, as opposed to changes in country conditions only. <em>Cf. id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
