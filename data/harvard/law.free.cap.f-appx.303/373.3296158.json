For the reasons discussed below we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">At a June 2007 evidentiary hearing, the district court noted that the \u201cdispositive issue\u201d was whether or not Lockett\u2019s trial counsel had timely communicated the government\u2019s August 2005 plea offer to Lockett, and that Lockett and his trial counsel had each testified \u201cwith some conviction and credibility\u201d in providing directly contradictory versions of the relevant events. The court did not make a factual determination as to whether counsel timely informed Lockett of the August 2005 plea offer, but denied Lockett\u2019s section 2255 motion, reasoning that \u2014 because the evidence was \u201cequally divided\u201d \u2014 Lockett had failed to meet his burden of proof. In July 2007, the court granted Lockett a certificate of appealability on his ineffective-assistance-of-eounsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-24\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact, and we review the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo and its underlying findings of fact for clear error. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>301 F.3d 923, 925 (8th Cir.2002). Because Lockett\u2019s testimony and counsel\u2019s testimony were directly contradictory, and the district court merely ruled against the party with the burden of proof without making an essential factual determination, we conclude that the court committed a procedural error. <em>See Collier v. Turpin, </em>177 F.3d 1184, 1193-94 &amp; n. 14 (11th Cir.1999) (where district court was presented with direct, not circumstantial, evidence, and fact finding required choosing between two contradictory versions of events, court\u2019s conclusion that both versions were credible and evidence was in equipoise amounted to no factual determination at all and was entitled to no deference on appeal; noting that ordinarily appellate court would remand to district court to make credibility choice and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>solve dispute, but foregoing remand because only one credibility choice was reasonable given record presented).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We further conclude that Lockett\u2019s remaining claims on appeal are without merit. Accordingly, we vacate the court\u2019s order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
