Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition asserts that the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has the discretion to place him in home confinement or a CCC under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b) and that this discretion should be exercised because he has served \u201ca reasonable amount of time\u201d and his elderly mother is caring for his two children. The petition contains several cites to <em>Woodall v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>432 F.3d 235 (3d Cir.2005), in support of Brown\u2019s arguments. In <em>Woodall, </em>the Third Circuit invalidated a set of 2005 BOP regulations that prohibit the BOP from considering an inmate for transfer to a CCC before the last 10 percent or 6 months of his sentence. 432 F.3d at 244-45. It concluded that the regulations were incompatible with the requirement in \u00a7 3621 that the BOP consider five factors in making an individualized determination of whether a prisoner is eligible for placement in a CCC, without temporal constraints. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 247-51. In his petition, Brown complains that the warden of his prison has a \u201cpractice of not complying with <em>[Woodall </em>].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-20\">Giving liberal construction to Brown\u2019s pleadings, <em>see Johnson v. Quarterman, </em>479 F.3d 358, 359 (5th Cir.2007), the district court should address in the first instance his challenge to the BOP\u2019s application of the 2005 regulations. The court should consider whether Brown\u2019s claim is affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>by Congress\u2019s recent amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624 in the Second Chance Act of 2007, Pub.L. No. 110-199, \u00a7 251(a), 122 Stat. 657, 692-93 (April 9, 2008), and any regulations issued pursuant to the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Brown also raises for the first time a challenge to the application of the 2005 regulations under the Ex Post Facto Clause. We defer consideration of this issue until the statutory questions have been resolved. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>313 F.3d 231, 233 n. 2 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cWe will \u2018not grasp a constitutional question for decision even though properly presented, if there is also present some other legitimate ground upon which the case can be decided.\u2019 \u2019\u2019Xquoting <em>State of Texas v. Grundstrom, </em>404 F.2d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 1968)). We will not consider Brown\u2019s further assertion that the BOP denies \u201cPSPs\u201d to prisoners and commits extortion in the collection of fees and fines. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993) (\u201cAlthough we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d)(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
