Sichel, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d); and (2) denying his motion to remand. <em>In re Yangli Zheng, </em>No. A98 322 883 (B.I.A. Mar. 17, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A98 322 883 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 18, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Wangehuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, See., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122,126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">As a preliminary matter, we find it unnecessary to address in detail Zheng\u2019s arguments regarding alleged errors in translation at his hearing because, even assuming those errors existed, we can confidently predict that the agency\u2019s decision would not change on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338-39 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Zheng failed to establish that his right to due process of law had been violated when he did not demonstrate that the outcome of his proceedings had been prejudiced. <em>See Augustin, v. Sava, </em>735 F.2d 32, 34 (2d Cir.1984); <em>see also Zacarias-Velasquez v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 429, 434-35 (8th Cir.2007) (holding that, although \u201c[d]ue process includes the right to competent translation,\u201d \u201can alien must prove prejudice that potentially affects the outcome\u201d (internal citations omitted)). It follows then that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to remand based on the alleged translation errors when remand would have served no useful purpose. <em>See Li Yang Gao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 157 (2d Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">We find no reason to disturb the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the IJ\u2019s remaining findings provided a sufficient basis on which to conclude that Zheng was not credible. We afford deference to the IJ\u2019s observations about Zheng\u2019s demeanor during his testimony, particularly where, as here, the record reflects specific examples in support of her conclusions. <em>See, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 380-81 (2d Cir.2007). Furthermore, Zheng\u2019s inconsistent testimony as to the date on which he was arrested and detained was material to his claim. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Given that Zheng provided multiple different answers in this regard, the IJ properly characterized this as a major discrepancy. Moreover, no reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to accept Zheng\u2019s explanation that he was nervous. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">Because the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, the agency properly found that Zheng failed to meet the burden of proof required for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT, where each claim was based upon the same factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>predicate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005). Contrary to Zheng\u2019s argument, the agency did not err in failing to consider whether he may face persecution based solely on the fact that he would be prevented from practicing his chosen beliefs where the IJ did not believe that he was a genuine Falun Gong adherent, or that he would practice Falun Gong if returned to China. Because the basis of Zheng\u2019s fear of future persecution was not independent of those claims that the agency found not credible, the adverse credibility determination was dispositive. <em>See Paul, </em>444 F.3d at 156. Finally, we note that the IJ reasonably discounted Zheng\u2019s documentary evidence, e.g., the hospital certificate, not only because it was unauthenticated, but because Zheng was not otherwise credible. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007) (providing that an \u201cIJ may, either expressly or impliedly, rely on [the doctrine <em>ofIfalsus in uno </em>[, <em>falsus in omnibus </em>] to discredit evidence that does not benefit from corroboration or authentication independent of the petitioner\u2019s <em>own </em>credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">. Because Zheng did not raise his CAT claim based on his alleged illegal departure from China in either his submission to the BIA or in his brief to this Court, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
