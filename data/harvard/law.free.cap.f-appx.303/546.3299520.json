Fleming argues on appeal that the ALJ erred by: (1) discrediting the opinions of a number of medical sources, (2) discrediting the testimony of a lay witness, and (3) failing to properly evaluate Fleming\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) and incorporate all of Fleming\u2019s limitations into the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). The facts and procedural history are known to the parties and we do not repeat them here. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">1. Medical Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In cases where medical reports are inconclusive, the ALJ is charged with resolving conflicting and ambiguous medical testimony. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751 (9th Cir.1989). As here, \u201c[w]hen a nontreating physician\u2019s opinion contradicts that of the treating physician \u2014 but is not based on independent clinical findings, or rests on clinical findings also considered by the treating physician \u2014 the opinion of the treating physician may be rejected only if the ALJ gives specific, legitimate reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 600 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ALJ discredited the reliability of Fleming\u2019s testimony, and Fleming does not appeal that decision. Fleming argues that the ALJ erred in rejecting the opinions of six medical sources: (a) Dr. Donna C. Wieher, (b) a counselor at Network Behavioral Health Care, (c) nurse practitioner Julie Hogan, (d) Dr. Chirag Patel, (e) Dr. David Wu, and (f) Dr. Matilda Mengis. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">a. Dr. Wieher</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The ALJ gave the following reasons for discrediting Wicher\u2019s opinion: Wieher\u2019s conclusions regarding employability were unclear; this was a one-time examination from a non-treating source; Wieher relied largely on the claimant\u2019s subjective comments; testing indicated that Fleming had exaggerated his symptoms <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and Wieher did not have access to Fleming\u2019s file and records. We find these reasons sufficient for discrediting Wicher\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">b. Network Behavioral Center Counselor</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">An ALJ may discount opinion sources that are not acceptable medical sources by providing reasons \u201cgermane\u201d to that source for doing so. <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir.1993). A counselor is not an acceptable medical source. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513. The ALJ discounted the counselor\u2019s conclusions here because they were based on the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, and this finding was supported by substantial evidence. We find that this reason is germane to the counselor\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">c. Nurse Hogan</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">A nurse practitioner is also not an acceptable medical source, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513, thus the ALJ needed to provide germane reasons for discrediting her opinion. Here, the ALJ discounted Nurse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Hogan\u2019s conclusions, <em>inter alia, </em>because her opinions were conclusory, contained no clinical evidence, relied on Fleming\u2019s subjective complaints, and exceeded the severity of limitations reported by other physicians. These are germane reasons to discredit her opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">d. Dr. Patel</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We find that the ALJ enumerated at least the following legitimate and specific reasons for discounting Patel\u2019s conclusions: (1) Patel merely checked boxes enumerating Fleming\u2019s limitations and failed to provide an explanation or clinical evidence supporting these conclusions, <em>Crane v. Shalala, </em>76 F.3d 251, 253 (9th Cir.1996); (2) Patel\u2019s records and findings, such as the extent of Fleming\u2019s back pain, are largely based on Fleming\u2019s subjective complaints, <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir.2001) (finding that the ALJ was \u201cfree to disregard [medical] opinion, which was premised on [the claimant\u2019s] subjective complaints\u201d); and (3) Patel\u2019s conclusions conflict with the evidence from his own records \u2014 in May 2003, Patel\u2019s records indicated that Fleming merely experienced \u201cbenign chronic low back pain\u201d that \u201c[w]ill restrict activities as far as lengthy bending or kneeling, but he is able to do all other activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">e. Dr. Wu</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The ALJ properly discredited Wu\u2019s brief, one-sentence conclusion that \u201cFleming is disabled.\u201d Even if this statement were intended to be a medical opinion, it was located in the \u201csocial/family history\u201d section of Wu\u2019s report, which supports the ALJ\u2019s legitimate conclusion that it was based entirely on Fleming\u2019s subjective complaints. The remainder of Wu\u2019s records do not indicate any other specific limitations that would have an effect on the ALJ\u2019s disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">f. Dr. Mengis</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The ALJ rejected Mengis\u2019s opinion because it was based in large part on Fleming\u2019s subjective complaints; indeed, neither the check-box form submitted by Mengis nor Mengis\u2019s letters specify any clinical testing or objective medical evidence supporting her conclusion. The fact that a medical opinion was based on a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony \u2014 where the claimant\u2019s credibility has been undermined \u2014 is a specific and legitimate reason for rejecting that medical opinion. <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Fleming argues that the ALJ should have re-contacted Mengis for additional information. To the contrary, \u201c[t]he ALJ, with support in the record, found the evidence adequate to make a determination regarding [the claimant\u2019s] disability. Accordingly, the ALJ did not have a duty to recontact the doctors.\u201d <em>Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">2. Lay Witness Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">An ALJ may discount lay witness opinions by providing reasons \u201cgermane\u201d to that source for doing so. <em>Dodiill, </em>12 F.3d at 919. The ALJ rejected Ronald Quinton\u2019s testimony because there was no medically determinable impairment that would cause swaying while walking, that would cause Fleming to drop things, or that would cause Fleming\u2019s hands to swell. Here, Quinton\u2019s testimony identified an impairment that was neither supported by the medical record nor included in Fleming\u2019s complaints: sudden, regular, and unexplained swelling of the hands. In addition, Fleming\u2019s own statements to Dr. Goldberg \u2014 that he went on thirty-minute walks in the morning, that he went on hour-long walks in the afternoon, and that he could walk up to his third floor apartment without chest pain or undue short<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ness of breath \u2014 contradicts the extent of the limitations identified by Quinton. Although this was not specifically enumerated as a reason for rejecting Quinton\u2019s testimony, \u201cthe ALJ at least noted arguably germane reasons for dismissing the [lay witness\u2019s] testimony, even if he did not clearly link his determination to those reasons.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 512 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">3. RFC Finding and Hypothetical to the VE</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Fleming argues that the ALJ erred in the RFC finding by failing to provide a function-by-function assessment, failing to consider whether Fleming was capable of working on a regular and continuing basis, failing to consider all of the medical evidence, and failing to include all of Fleming\u2019s impairments and limitations. Because the RFC finding purportedly failed to include all of Fleming\u2019s limitations, Fleming argues that the VE hypothetical also failed to include all necessary limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">As discussed above, the ALJ did not err in his treatment of the medical evidence. We find that he properly included Fleming\u2019s medical limitations in the RFC finding and the hypothetical to the VE that were supported by substantial evidence in the record after discounting Fleming\u2019s credibility. Although Fleming points to a number of detailed errors, as we have held previously, we will not reverse where, as here, \u201cthe ALJ took into account those limitations for which there was record support that did not depend on [the claimant\u2019s] subjective complaints.\u201d <em>Bayliss, </em>427 F.3d at 1217 (upholding ALJ decision despite failure to perform function-by-function assessment and failure to consider drowsiness or reactions to stress); <em>see also Stubbs-Danielson v. Astrue, </em>539 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.2008) (finding that the ALJ adequately captured limitations to \u201cconcentration, persistence, or pace\u201d with a restriction to \u201csimple tasks\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
