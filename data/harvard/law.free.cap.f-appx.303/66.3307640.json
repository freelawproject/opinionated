Nov. 5, 2007), <em>ajfg </em>No. 97 952 802 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Feb. 14, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-18\">We find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ properly based her adverse credibility determination on her finding that it was implausible that Zhang, as a factory machinist, would have access to his company\u2019s financial records. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007) (providing that an implausibility finding is supported by substantial evidence where \u201cthe reasons for [the agency\u2019s] incredulity are evident\u201d). The IJ also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>properly concluded that Zhang\u2019s testimony that his family\u2019s home was destroyed was undermined by his submission of a letter from his parents which made no mention of the destruction of the house and, in fact, indicated that his parents were still living at the same address more than a year after the house had allegedly been demolished. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Based on the implausibilities and inconsistencies identified by the IJ, we cannot find that the agency erred in concluding that, when the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d were considered, Zhang was not a credible witness. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the Id\u2019s adverse credibility determination was a proper basis for denying Zhang\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See id. </em>Because the only evidence of a threat to Zhang\u2019s life or freedom depended on his credibility, the adverse credibility finding is also fatal to his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
