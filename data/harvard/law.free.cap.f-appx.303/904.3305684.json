Patrickson (\u201cPatrick-son\u201d) charged his former employer, Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (\u201cEntergy\u201d), with violating 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by engag-</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>ing in adverse employment actions, including discharge, in retaliation for Patrick-son\u2019s protected whistleblowing activity. Patrickson now seeks review of the August 31, 2007 decision and order of the Department of Labor Administrative Review Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) rejecting his claim on the merits and reversing an Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) recommendation that Patrickson be reinstated at Entergy. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">We review the Board\u2019s adjudication of a \u00a7 5851 violation under the standards set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851(c)(1); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. Sec\u2019y of DOL, </em>85 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir.1996) (applying APA standard to review Secretary of Labor\u2019s adjudication of \u00a7 5851 violation), and we will set aside agency determinations only if they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), or otherwise \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(E). That standard applies where, as here, the agency reverses rulings made by an ALJ.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Mr. Sprout, Inc. v. United States, </em>8 F.3d 118, 123 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Patrickson raises two arguments in this court: (1) the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence; and (2) the Board improperly denied his motion to submit new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">1. Substantial-Evidence Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">The Board found that four legitimate business reasons supported Entergy\u2019s challenged actions: Patrickson (1) failed to meet due dates of action items specified in his performance-improvement plan, (2) was late for a scheduled training session, (3) had made no progress on resolving problems with the hot-water-boiler system, and (4) was three weeks behind schedule on a chlorine-injection project. Patrickson does not directly challenge these findings. Instead, he faults the Board\u2019s failure to consider or properly evaluate other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Specifically, Patrickson contends that the Board failed to consider the unreasonable nature of the performance-improvement requirements that Entergy had imposed on him, and the inference of retaliation that could be derived therefrom. We disagree. The Board determined that Entergy was on notice of Patrickson\u2019s protected activity as of May 8, 2003. Yet, as the record reflects, Patrickson\u2019s 2003 performance-improvement plan, which included his reassigned hot-water-boiler-modification project, was implemented before then. The Board\u2019s identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>that causal disconnect with respect to the boiler-modification project also severs the relevance of other purportedly \u201cunreasonable\u201d requirements included in Patrick-son\u2019s 2003 performance-improvement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Insofar as Patrickson also submits that the Board failed to consider evidence of disparate treatment, particularly as compared to Rodney Angus (\u201cAngus\u201d), an engineer, the Board identified at least two important distinctions between Patrickson and Angus showing why they were not similarly situated: Angus, unlike Patrick-son, had shown steady improvement while on his performance-improvement plan, and had met his deadlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">To the extent Patrickson further suggests that, unlike other employees, he was improperly held accountable for failure to file system health reports in a timely manner, the Board noted a number of facts \u2014 such as Patrickson\u2019s failure to meet other due dates and complete other projects, and, perhaps most important, his untruthful representation about a hazardous situation \u2014 that distinguished him from other employees. Because these determinations are supported by the record, we will not disturb them. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Finally, Patrickson argues that the Board\u2019s rejection of certain ALJ credibility assessments detracted from the weight of the evidence underpinning the Board\u2019s determination. We are not persuaded. Relying largely on Patrickson\u2019s testimony, the ALJ determined that the bi-weekly meetings that Entergy required Patrick-son to attend were sufficiently hostile to constitute adverse employment actions. In finding to the contrary, the Board specifically listened to recordings that Patrickson had made of those meetings, something apparently not done by the ALJ. From its assessment of the actual words and atmosphere of the meetings, the Board reasonably determined that Patrick-son had not proved hostility sufficient to demonstrate an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Similarly, notwithstanding any contrary credibility assessments made by the ALJ, the Board\u2019s determination that Patrickson failed to prove that Entergy\u2019s proffered business reasons for his termination were pretextual was supported by substantial evidence, notably, testimony from an Entergy manager regarding the numerous deficiencies in Patrickson\u2019s performance, and Entergy\u2019s institution of a performance-improvement plan for Patrickson pri- or to its notice of his protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">2. <em>Denial of Motion to Submit New Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Patrickson submits that the Board nevertheless erred when it denied his motion, made pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 18.54(c) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), to submit new evidence, namely, transcripts of interviews conducted as part of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (\u201cNRC\u201d) investigation of Patrickson\u2019s discrimination complaint. We review the Board\u2019s decision to determine whether it is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see also Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir.2008) (reviewing Rule 60(b) denial for abuse of discretion), and we identify no such error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">The \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of Patrick-son\u2019s motion, according to his own submission before the Board, was to establish Entergy\u2019s notice of his protected activities. Indeed, Patrickson represented that he would withdraw his motion \u201cif Entergy were to concede that it had notice of Patrickson\u2019s protected activities on September 22, 2003.\u201d Because the Board expressly resolved the issue of notice in Patrickson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>favor, fixing an earlier date \u2014 May 8, 2003 \u2014 as the date on which Entergy knew about Patrickson\u2019s protected activity, Patrickson can hardly complain of the Board\u2019s failure to consider notice evidence relating to the later September 22, 2003 date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Instead, Patrickson asserts that his proffered new evidence would have strengthened his pretext argument by showing that certain Entergy managers proffered false testimony. Patrickson, however, did not expressly present his evidence to the Board in terms of pretext, and we generally will not rely on an argument not presented to the agency as a ground for identifying error. <em>See Erie-Niagara Rail Steering Comm. v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>247 F.3d 437, 443-4 (2d Cir. 2001) (declining to address argument not raised before agency). In any event, because there are sufficient ambiguities in the NRC transcripts to permit them to be read consistently with the hearing transcripts, and because the admitted focus of Patrickson\u2019s motion related to notice, we cannot conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the Board not to have admitted them on these other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">For these reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-11\">. Although this provision of the Energy Reorganization Act has since been amended, those amendments only apply to whistleblower claims filed on or after August 8, 2005. <em>See </em>Procedures for the Handling of Retaliation Complaints Under the Employee Protection Provisions of Six Federal Environmental Statutes and Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as Amended, 72 Fed.Reg. 44,956, 44,956-57 (Aug. 10, 2007). Because Patrickson filed his complaint in 2003, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>reference to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851 is to the predecessor version of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">. The Board, relying upon 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.8, reviewed the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision <em>de novo, </em>explaining that it was not bound by ALJ fact-findings. In fact, on August 10, 2007, three weeks before the Board rendered its decision, the DOL amended several regulations governing the handling of certain retaliation complaints, including those filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851. <em>See </em>Procedures for the Handling of Retaliation Complaints Under the Employee Protection Provisions of Six Federal Environmental Statutes and Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as Amended, 72 Fed.Reg. 44,956, 44,957-62 (Aug. 10, 2007). As part of those amendments, the Board is now instructed to review \"the factual determinations of the administrative law judge under the substantial evidence standard.\" 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.110(b). Because Patrickson does not contest the Board\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review of the ALJ\u2019s findings, however, we deem any such challenge waived. <em>See Robinson v. Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l Pension Fund, Plan </em>A, 515 F.3d 93, 95 n. 1 (2d Cir.2008) (holding argument not raised on appeal waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b932-7\">. For similar reasons, Patrickson cannot complain that the Board fixed May, rather than March, as the period in which Entergy received notice. Although his opening papers before the Board suggested that an Entergy manager may have obtained notice of his protected activities in the spring of 2003, Patrick-son, perhaps cognizant of the extended chain of inferences upon which that earlier date depended, clarified on reply that he sought to affix September 22, 2003, as the notice date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
