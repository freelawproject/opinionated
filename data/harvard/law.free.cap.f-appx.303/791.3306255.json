On appeal, Melvin first argues that he was entitled to deduct $6,000 from his 2003 income tax returns because his 1985 divorce decree ordered that he pay alimony, through the seizure of property to be credited at the rate of $500 per month, to his ex-spouse. He asserts that, because he was required to pay all of the alimony in advance, he should thus be allowed to claim a deduction on his 2003 tax return. Second, Melvin argues that he was denied due process of law because his trial before the Tax Court was cut short before he was allowed to hear the position of, and cross-examine, the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">I. Tax Deficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">We review a Tax Court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Creel v. Comm\u2019r, </em>419 F.3d 1135, 1139 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s determination of a deficiency is presumed correct, and the taxpayer has the burden of proving it is incorrect.\u201d <em>Webb v. Comm\u2019r, </em>872 F.2d 380, 381 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">Section 215 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d) states, \u201c[i]n the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the alimony or separate maintenance payments paid during such individual\u2019s taxable year.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 215(a), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a). It further states that alimony means any alimony payment as defined in I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b) \u201cwhich is includible in the gross income of the recipient under section 71.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 215(b), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">Section 71(b) of the I.R.C. states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-17\">(1) In general. \u2014 The term \u201calimony or separate maintenance payment\u201d means any payment in cash if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-18\">(A) such payment is received by (or on behalf of) a spouse under a divorce or separation instrument,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-19\">(B) the divorce or separation instrument does not designate such pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>ment as a payment which is not includible in gross income under this section and not allowable as a deduction under section 215,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">(C) in the case of an individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance, the payee spouse and the payor spouse are not members of the same household at the time such payment is made, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">(D) there is no liability to make any such payment for any period after the death of the payee spouse and there is no liability to make any payment (in cash or property) as a substitute for such payments after the death of the payee spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">\u201cIf [a] statute\u2019s meaning is plain and unambiguous, there is no need for further inquiry. The plain language is presumed to express congressional intent and will control a court\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>289 F.3d 1329, 1338 (11th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Because in 2003 Melvin admittedly made no alimony payments, as defined in the I.R.C., we conclude that he was not allowed to claim an alimony deduction on his 2003 income tax returns. Melvin was thus unable to meet his burden to show that the Commissioner erred in Melvin\u2019s deficiency determination, and the Tax Court properly entered a decision in the Commissioner\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">II. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. Rudimentary due process includes reasonable notice and an opportunity to rebut the charges and be heard. <em>American Druggists Ins. Co., Inc. v. Bogart, </em>707 F.2d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">The IRS made its arguments known to Melvin in both its answer to his petition, and its pretrial memorandum. At Melvin\u2019s trial before the Tax Court, Melvin and the Commissioner had the opportunity to challenge each other\u2019s arguments. Furthermore, Melvin and the Commissioner prepared memoranda addressing their arguments raised during trial. We thus conclude from the record that Melvin was afforded the opportunity to be heard, both at his trial and in a memorandum of law. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, his due process argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
