HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Petitioner-Appellant William Dee Wood, Jr., a federal prisoner acting pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus. The district court determined that the petition was time-barred. Mr. Wood also seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). Reviewing Mr. Wood\u2019s filings liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we hold that no reasonable jurist could conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal on procedural grounds was incorrect. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Accordingly, we decline to issue a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), deny his request to proceed IFP, and dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Mr. Wood was convicted on state criminal charges, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed on March 6, 2006. Mr. Wood did not petition for a writ of certiorari but instead submitted two post-conviction applications for relief which were file-stamped by the court clerk on June 7, 2007 and July 26, 2007. The state court denied Mr. Wood post-conviction relief. Mr. Wood filed his habeas petition on November 13, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">Mr. Wood contends that the district court erred in time-barring his federal habeas corpus claims and that the district court applied federal law incorrectly. Mr. Wood references on appeal the arguments raised in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus: (1) that the trial court should have excluded his racially biased statement as irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial; (2) that his sentence was excessive; (3) that appellate counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel; (4) that evidence found on his person should have been suppressed; (5) that the trial court should have excused three jurors based upon his request; (6) that the trial court should have conducted further voir dire into racial prejudice after racially charged statements were allowed into evidence; (7) that the state violated due process by not bringing phone records into evidence; (8) that the trial court sentenced him more harshly because he chose a jury trial; and (9) that the state never proved the element of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">To obtain the jurisdictionally prerequisite COA, Mr. Wood must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Supreme Court has clarified that where, as here, the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a petitioner must show that reasonable jurists would find debatable both (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>constitutional right, and (2) whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. \u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petition should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Wood has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Clark v. Oklahoma, </em>468 F.3d 711, 714 (10th Cir.2006). The limitations period for habeas corpus relief consists of one year, beginning (as relevant here) when the judgment becomes final through \u201cdirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). This period ended on June 5, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">As noted above, the OCCA affirmed Mr. Wood\u2019s conviction on March 6, 2006. He then had ninety days to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c). The ninetieth day was June 4, 2006. Mr. Wood failed to file a petition for certiorari, and his conviction became \u201cfinal\u201d on June 5, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the absence of tolling, Mr. Wood would have had until June 5, 2007 to file a habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Mr. Wood argues on appeal that the federal mailbox rule applies, and the Court should consider his first application for post-conviction relief to be filed on the day that he had verified the pleading \u2014 May 29, 2007 \u2014 or, alternatively, the day he gave his application to the prison mail officials\u2014 May 30, 2007. However, Oklahoma state courts do not recognize the federal mailbox rule for criminal matters. <em>See Moore v. Gibson, </em>250 F.3d 1295, 1298-99 (10th Cir. 2001) (\u201cBecause Oklahoma does not recognize the prisoner mailbox rule, it is immaterial when [the prisoner] gave his petition to prison officials____\u201d). Thus, we may not consider the post-conviction application as filed before June 7, 2007 \u2014 the date the application was received and file-stamped by the court clerk. <em>See id. </em>By June 7, 2007, the applicable limitations period had already expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">Even in the absence of statutory tolling, the limitations period may be subject to equitable tolling \u201cin rare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>York v. Galetka, </em>314 F.3d 522, 527 (10th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000)). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and see no such circumstances here. Finally, because Mr. Wood has failed to present a \u201creasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997) (internal quotations omitted), we deny his motion to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Wood\u2019s request for a COA, DENY his request to proceed IFP, and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\"> This Order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata, </em>and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this matter. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-15\">. Because Mr. Wood is proceeding pro se, we review his pleadings and filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>487 F.3d 808, 815 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\"><em>. </em>Because June 4, 2006 fell on a Sunday, it is not included in the time computation pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a)(3) and, accordingly, Mr. Wood gained an additional day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
