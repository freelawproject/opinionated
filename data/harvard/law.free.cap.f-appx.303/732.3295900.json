The district court denied the motion because it found that Straughter was sentenced as a career offender, under U.S.S.G. 4B1.1, two of the underlying offenses called for a mandatory minimum life sentence, and, accordingly, Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines did not change his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Although Straughter concedes that he was sentenced as a career offender, he argues that he still was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and Booker*s progeny. \u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, after considering applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1q\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, a reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if \u201can amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that only retroactively applicable amendments \u201cthat have the effect of lowering the sentencing range upon which a sentence was based, may be considered for reduction of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d). Accordingly, a sentence reduction is not authorized where an amendment \u201cis applicable to the defendant but ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>eration of another guideline or statutory-provision <em>(e.g. </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Amendment 706, which is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), was made retroactive by Amendment 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (Supp. May 1, 2008); <em>see also, United States v, Stratton, </em>519 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2008). Amendment 706 reduced offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706 (2007). Nevertheless, Amendment 706 does not serve as a basis for a sentence reduction if, based on the operation of another guideline or statutory provision, it does not lower a defendant\u2019s guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), we recently held that defendants sentenced as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 typically are not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 because the Amendment would not affect their guideline ranges, even though it reduced the base offense levels. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Similarly, we have also held that defendants sentenced as armed career criminals under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 are not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 985-86 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that defendant was not entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction when, based on the amount of crack and powder cocaine he was responsible for and an intervening change in the Guidelines, his offense level was higher under Amendment 706 than when he was sentenced).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Straughter was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because, although Amendment 706 may have reduced his crack cocaine base offense level, it did not affect his final guideline range, which was based on the career offender enhancement. Likewise, in regards to counts one and five, Straughter was ineligible for a sentence reduction because the guideline range for those charges was based on the mandatory statutory life sentence, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">. <em>United.
