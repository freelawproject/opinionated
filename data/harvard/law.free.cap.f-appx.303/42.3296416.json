Koeltl, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b67-18\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">Wayne Davenport appeals from a judgement of conviction entered in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Kravitz, J.). Davenport was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and was sentenced to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. Davenport appeals several trial court rulings, including the denial of his motion to suppress evidence. He also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history of the case, and issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-20\">A firearm and ammunition were seized after Davenport\u2019s flight from the arresting officer and a bullet was seized from Davenport\u2019s pocket at the time of his arrest. Contrary to Davenport\u2019s contention, we conclude these items were not the fruit of unlawful searches. Reasonable suspicion supported the investigative stop in light of (1) Davenport\u2019s resemblance to the description of the armed suspect police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>were looking for; (2) Davenport\u2019s location in the vicinity of the recently committed crime; (3) the arresting officer\u2019s awareness that if Davenport were the suspect, he might possess a knife and therefore pose a substantial danger to the officers at the scene and to others; and (4) Davenport\u2019s flight after the officer approached him. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <em>see also Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124-25, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7-8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (in evaluating whether reasonable suspicion supports a seizure courts are to look to the totality of the circumstances); <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>369 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2004). In conducting the stop, the arresting officer used the least intrusive means by which he could \u201cverify or dispel\u201d his reasonable suspicions regarding Davenport\u2019s possible involvement in unlawful activity, <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983), and the officer\u2019s conduct was reasonable in light of his awareness that Davenport may have been armed and due to the officer\u2019s \u201cobligation to ensure the safety of innocent bystanders.\u201d <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>907 F.2d 269, 272 (2d Cir.1990). In any event, Davenport was no longer seized when he ran into the neighboring yard and dropped the gun. <em>See California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 625, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991) (noting that for Fourth Amendment purposes arrests and seizures are not continuous). At that point the gun was abandoned and subject to police recovery regardless of the lawfulness of the prior seizure. The bullet was also admissible, because it was recovered from Davenport\u2019s pocket during a search incident to his lawful arrest. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (a search incident to arrest is a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Although we affirm Davenport\u2019s conviction, we remand for resentencing in light of the district court\u2019s application of an upward-adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The district court based the upward-adjustment on Davenport\u2019s prior conviction under Conn. GemStat. \u00a7 21a-277(a). Subsequent to the sentencing in this case, however, we decided <em>United States v. Savage, </em>542 F.3d 959 (2d Cir. 2008), and held that a conviction under \u00a7 21a-277(b), which is substantively identical to \u00a7 21a-277(a) for the purposes of this issue, does not categorically qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 and 4B1.2(b). <em>Id. </em>at 964-67. Furthermore, Davenport\u2019s utterance of the word \u201cguilty\u201d during the initial portion of the state plea proceeding in response to the prosecutor\u2019s mischaracterization of the charge as \u201cpossession with intent to sell\u201d does not indicate that Davenport admitted to predicate conduct. To the contrary, the transcript of the state court plea colloquy, during which Davenport entered an <em>Alford </em>plea, shows that Davenport denied that the facts presented by the prosecutor were correct. Thus, as the government concedes, it has not established that Davenport\u2019s plea necessarily admitted elements of a controlled substance offense. <em>See id. </em>at 966 (holding that the government cannot rely on factual admissions during an <em>Alford </em>plea colloquy to establish the predicate nature of a prior conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We have considered Davenport\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED and the sentence is VACATED and REMANDED for a new sentence consistent with this Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
