GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b701-20\">Armando Barajas-Gareia pled guilty to unlawful re-entry into the United States and was sentenced to 57 months. Mr. Barajas-Garcia\u2019s sentence was upheld by this court in <em>United States v. Barajas-Garcia, </em>229 Fed.Appx. 737 (10th Cir.2007). Subsequently, Mr. Barajas-Gareia filed the instant collateral challenge to his confinement pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In an extensively reasoned opinion, the district court denied relief and Mr. BarajasGarcia\u2019s request for a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-21\">Mr. Barajas-Gareia now seeks a COA from us to enable him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. In order to secure a COA, a petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), such that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In assessing this question, we review Mr. Barajas-Garcia\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings with special solicitude. <em>See Van Deelen v. Johnson, </em>497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007). Even when viewed through this lens, however, to the extent that Mr. Barajas-Garcia seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s disposition of his \u00a7 2255 motion, we conclude based on our review of the record, and for substantially the same reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>given by the district court in its thoughtful opinion, that no reasonable jurist could debate the correctness of that court\u2019s rulings. To the extent Mr. Barajas-Garcia seeks to raise new issues on appeal that were not presented to the district court, we decline to consider them. <em>See Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 940 (10th Cir.2004) (court of appeals may decline to consider novel argument in application for COA not presented first to the district court). Mr. Barajas-Garcia\u2019s request for COA is therefore denied and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-22\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
