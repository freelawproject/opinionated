Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is construed as a motion for summary disposition in part and a motion to dismiss in part. So construed, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United, States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because petitioners\u2019 second motion to reopen was filed beyond the 90-day deadline, and petitioners have failed to demonstrate that an exception to this time limit applies, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the petition for review is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">In addition, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss in part is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b558-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
