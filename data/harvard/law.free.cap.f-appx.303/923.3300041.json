CABRANES, PETER W. HALL, Circuit Judges, JOHN GLEESON,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\"> The Honorable John Gleeson, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b948-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">Defendant-appellant, Hurgenes Pignard, appeals from an October 11, 2007 judgment of conviction of the District Court, sentencing defendant principally to a term of 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. After a nine day trial, a jury found defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit bank robbery and armed bank robbery as well as attempted bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 2113(a). On appeal, defendant argues that (1) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions, (2) several of opposing counsel\u2019s comments during the trial amounted to prosecutorial misconduct, and (3) his sentence was substantively unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">(D</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">In seeking to overturn a conviction on the grounds that evidence was insufficient, a defendant bears the \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>363 F.3d 187, 197 (2d Cir.2004), of demonstrating that, \u201cview[ing] the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the government, ... no rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>United States v. Desinor, </em>525 F.3d 193, 203 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, defendant advances two theories of insufficiency, each of which relies on the fatally flawed premise that the jury disregarded the testimony of defendant\u2019s accomplices and instead convicted him solely based on defendant\u2019s uncorroborated admissions to law enforcement. In order to accept defendant\u2019s premise, we would have to find that the Government\u2019s witnesses were simply not credible. However, we may not speculate as to the jury\u2019s determinations on that score. <em>See United States v. Riggi, </em>541 F.3d 94, 108 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cAll issues of credibility, including the credibility of a cooperating witness, must be resolved in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">Defendant\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim stems from his contention that, during closing argument and rebuttal, the Government (1) improperly bolstered the credibility of witnesses by vouching for them, (2) erroneously instructed the jury that defendant\u2019s prior statement to police was, by itself, sufficient evidence to establish his involvement in the charged conspiracy, and (3) asked the jury to draw an inference of guilt from defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at trial. Where, as here, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>defendant contends that a prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument warrant reversal, he must meet the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of demonstrating that \u201cthe misconduct alleged [was] so severe and significant as to result in the denial of [his] right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Feliciano, </em>223 F.3d 102, 123 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Because defendant objected only to the Government\u2019s allegedly improper comments regarding the credibility of its witnesses, we may review his other proffered allegations for misconduct only for plain error \u2014 that is, defendant must demonstrate \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 52(b) (\u201cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d). If defendant can make these required showings, we may correct an error that \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">We have previously explained that \u201cthe Government has broad latitude in the inferences it may reasonably suggest to the jury during summation.\u201d <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>427 F.3d 164, 170 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Particularly in light of this permissive standard, the statements to which defendant now objects were by no means improper. With respect to vouching, defendant has pointed to no instance, and we have found none, in which a prosecutor \u201cinterjected his beliefs\u201d or \u201cmade an issue of his own credibility.\u201d <em>See United, States v. Rivera, </em>971 F.2d 876, 884 (2d Cir.1992) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s claim of improper vouching). Rather, it appears that the Government simply engaged in permissible \u201cvigorous advocacy\u201d by challenging defendant\u2019s theory of the case. <em>Id. </em>Second, the Government\u2019s allegedly improper instruction to the jury in fact amounted to a correct statement of the law insofar as it suggested that defendant\u2019s statement to the police could be accepted as an admission to aiding and abetting a robbery and a conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Howell, </em>447 F.2d 1114 (2d Cir.1971). Finally, the Government did not ask the jury to infer guilt from defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Rather, in response to opposing counsel\u2019s contention in summation that defendant refused to cooperate with the Government because he was actually innocent, the Government observed that defendant had not offered any evidence, including his own testimony, to support his counsel\u2019s statement. We therefore decline to find trial misconduct on the part of the Government\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">The District Court did not err in sentencing defendant. Reviewing defendant\u2019s sentence, as we must, \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-diseretion standard,\u201d <em>United States v. Cavern, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189-90 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted), we find neither procedural nor substantive deficiencies, <em>see id,. </em>(\u201c[A]ppellate scrutiny [of sentences] encompasses two components: procedural review and substantive review.\u201d). Defendant points to no procedural error on the part of the District Court. Indeed, the Court, after properly calculating defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, granted a five-level downward departure. After applying each of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the Court offered a careful explanation of the sentence it imposed. In our view, the sentence imposed was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>\u201cwithin the range of permissible decisions\u201d available to the District Court in this case. <em>See id.; see also id., </em>at 193-94 (\u201c[0]nce we are sure that the sentence resulted from [a district court\u2019s] reasoned exercise of discretion, we must defer heavily to the expertise of district judges.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
