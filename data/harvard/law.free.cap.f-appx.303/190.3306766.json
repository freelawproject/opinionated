Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80, for failure to state a claim. Flint argues that the district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915A dismissal of his complaint was error. A district court shall dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint if the court determines that the complaint fails to state a claim. <em>See \u00a7 </em>1915A(b)(l). Claims that are clearly time barred are properly dismissed under \u00a7 1915. <em>Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016,1019-20 (5th Cir.1998). Review of a \u00a7 1915A dismissal is de novo. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">With regard to his <em>Bivens </em>claims, Flint invokes the Texas continuing tort doctrine and argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding that his cause of action accrued on October 1, 1999. Because there is no federal statute of limitations for <em>Bivens </em>claims, federal courts apply the general personal injury limitations period and tolling provisions of the forum state. <em>Brown v. Nationsbank Corp., </em>188 F.3d 579, 590 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 256 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also, Izen v. Catalina, </em>398 F.3d 363, 367 n. 3 (5th Cir.2005). In Texas, the relevant statute of limitations is two years. <em>See Cooper v. Brookshire, </em>70 F.3d 377, 380 n. 20 (5th Cir.1995); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a) (West 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Although the Texas limitations period applies, federal law governs to determine when a <em>Bivens </em>claim accrues. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 157 (5th Cir.1999) (\u00a7 1983 action). Flint\u2019s cause of action accrued on October 1, 1999, when BOP officials restricted his telephone privileges for 30 days for trading stock. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>Gartrell, </em>981 F.2d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Flint\u2019s reliance on the continuing tort doctrine is misplaced. The Texas Supreme Court has not endorsed the doctrine. <em>Creditwatch, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>157 S.W.3d 814, 816 n. 8 (Tex.2005); <em>see also General Universal Systems, Inc., v. HAL, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 444, 451-53 (5th Cir.2007). Even if the doctrine was an established tolling provision under Texas law, it does not apply to harm that Flint alleged. <em>See Wilson v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., </em>939 F.2d 260, 269 (5th Cir.1991). Given that Flint did not file the instant petition until March 26, 2003, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed his <em>Bivens </em>claims as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The applicable limitations period under the FTCA is two years from the time the claim accrued or six months from the time that the agency mails its final denial of the claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). Although phrased in the disjunctive, \u00a7 2401(b) \u201crequires a claimant to file an administrative claim within two years [of accrual] and file suit within six months of its denial.\u201d <em>Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 162 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation and citation omitted). A cause of action under federal law accrues within the meaning of \u00a7 2401(b) \u201cwhen the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Flint\u2019s claims accrued between October 1, 1999, and March 14, 2000, but he did not submit his FTCA claims to the BOP until June 10, 2002, the FTCA claims that Flint raised in his March 26, 2003, complaint are time barred. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2401(b); <em>Ramming, </em>281 F.3d at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Flint\u2019s equitable tolling argument is unavailing. Flint fails to point to anything the BOP did to prevent him from filing his claims. See <em>Teemac v. Henderson, </em>298 F.3d 452, 456 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
