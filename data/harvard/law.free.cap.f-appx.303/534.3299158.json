R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order finding petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal based on his controlled substance conviction and denying a further request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">Petitioner does not challenge the agency\u2019s finding that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal in light of his conviction for possession for sale of cocaine, in violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted in part. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29, an IJ \u201cmay grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d We review the denial of a motion for continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008). On May 6, 2004, and again on July 22, 2005, the IJ continued proceedings while petitioner sought to vacate his conviction. When proceedings reconvened on March 16, 2007, petitioner informed the IJ that he had not been successful in overturning his conviction. We conclude that the IJ did not abuse its discretion in denying a further continuance given that petitioner\u2019s efforts to vacate his conviction over several years had been unavailing. Accordingly, we deny this petition for review in part because the questions raised by this petition are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b559-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
