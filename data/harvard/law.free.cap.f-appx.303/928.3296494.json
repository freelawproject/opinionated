In a summary order of November 19, 2007, we affirmed the judgment of the District Court with respect to all defendants, except the City. <em>See McDay v. Travis, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2007 WL 4102718 (2d Cir.). Based on the record before us, we concluded that the District Court had erred in finding that the City was entitled to judgment as matter of law with respect to plaintiffs \u201cwrongful imprisonment\u201d claims. We directed the Clerk of the Court to solicit the assistance of <em>pro bono </em>counsel for plaintiff, who, to that point, had proceeded <em>pro se, </em>and we directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the issue \u201cwhether we can and should remand the matter to the district court for augmentation of the record or other further proceedings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at-, 2007 WL 4102718, at *2. Having reviewed these supplemental materials, we hold that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See A &amp; J Produce Corp. v. Bronx Overall Econ. Dev. Corp., </em>542 F.3d 54, 57 (2d Cir.2008). A party is entitled to summary judgment only if \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). Under this standard, we \u201cmust resolve all ambiguities, and credit all factual inferences that could rationally be drawn, in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Roe v. Waterbury, </em>542 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">The materials now before us demonstrate that the District Court incorrectly concluded that the parole warrant serving as the basis for plaintiffs detention \u201cwas still in effect\u201d as of July 21, 2002, the conclusion of plaintiffs maximum term of imprisonment. <em>McDay v. Travis, </em>2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43645, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2005). As we explained in our previous order, under New York law a parole warrant provides \u201csufficient authority to the superintendent or other person in charge of any jail, penitentiary, lockup, or detention pen to whom it is delivered to hold in <em>temporary detention </em>the person named therein.\u201d N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 259-i(3)(a)(i) (emphasis added). The law further requires that, among other things, the State Division of Parole conduct a probable cause hearing within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of a parole warrant, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 259-i(3)(c)(i), and, if probable cause exists, convene a revocation hearing within 90 days of the probable cause hearing, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 259-i(3)(f)(i). If these requirements are not timely met, the parole warrant is rendered void, and the prisoner is entitled to be released. <em>See, e.g., People ex rel. Levy v. Dalsheim, </em>66 A.D.2d 827, 411 N.Y.S.2d 343, 344 (2d Dept.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>48 N.Y.2d 1019, 425 N.Y.S.2d 802, 402 N.E.2d 141 (1980); <em>see also People ex rel Willis v. Travis, </em>178 Misc.2d 469, 680 N.Y.S.2d 422, 425 (Sup.Ct. Nassau Co.1998) (\u201cWithout question, the denial of a prompt preliminary parole revocation hearing entitles the parolee to release and restoration to parole.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">In this case, it is undisputed that (1) the City detained plaintiff from approximately December 13, 2001 until July 23, 2002\u2014 two days beyond his maximum release date; and (2) after July 9, 2002, when felony charges against plaintiff were dismissed,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the detention was justified solely by a parole warrant. It is also undisputed that plaintiff received neither a probable cause hearing nor a parole revocation hearing, meaning that, under New York law, the parole warrant was invalid fifteen days after the warrant\u2019s issuance \u2014 to wit, December 28, 2001 \u2014 and the City lacked legal authority to hold plaintiff on the basis of the warrant after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The record raises questions about plaintiffs detention. First, the Supreme Court has held that parollees facing revocation are, under the Due Process Clause, entitled to a preliminary hearing and a revocation hearing. <em>See Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 484-90, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). As noted above, plaintiff received neither of these during his eight months of incarceration. Second, it is well established that \u201can inmate has a liberty interest in being released upon the expiration of his maximum term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Calhoun v. New York State Div. of Parole Officers, </em>999 F.2d 647, 653 (2d Cir.1993). Here, the City held plaintiff beyond his maximum term of imprisonment \u2014 exclusively on the basis of a parole warrant that, under New York law, expired approximately eight months prior to his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The City asserts that it may not be liable for a violation of plaintiffs due process rights because, according to the City, the State was solely responsible for ensuring that plaintiff received a probable cause hearing in connection with the parole warrant and, if necessary, a revocation hearing. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the State in fact neglected to ensure that proper procedural safeguards were followed, the City has pointed to no State law or State policy that compelled plaintiffs detention after the dismissal of criminal charges against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the record raises the possibility that plaintiff was unconstitutionally detained pursuant to the \u201cexecution of a [City] policy or custom.\u201d <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (holding that local governments may be sued for constitutional violations that occur pursuant to a governmental custom, even if the custom has not received formal approval). In particular, an affidavit of a DOC employee, submitted by the City as part of this litigation, states that \u201ca person held in City correctional custody pursuant to a New York State parole warrant will not be released until the warrant is lifted by the State of New York Division of Parole.\u201d According to the affidavit, a \u201c[a] parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>warrant may only be lifted in one of three ways: (a) the state parole officer physically goes to Riker\u2019s Island correctional facility to lift the warrant; (b) a Supreme Court order vacates or dismisses the warrant; or (c) the State of New York Division of Parole vacates the warrant by sending the warrant lift to [DOC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Rather than serving as a basis for summary judgment in favor of the City, these uncontradicted assertions might prove to be grounds for the City\u2019s liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 if they reflect a City policy that resulted in a violation of plaintiff\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Myers v. County of Orange, </em>157 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.1998) (recognizing police officers\u2019 testimony as sufficient to establish a county \u201cpolicy\u201d causing a constitutional violation). To be sure, the record does not clearly demonstrate whether the aforementioned regulations may be attributed to the City or the State. However, we note that, at least in this case, the rules were in apparent tension with state law, which explicitly denied the City authority to hold plaintiff on that basis after the warrant expired. <em>See </em>N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 259 \u2014 i(3)(a)(i); <em>see also Wayland v. Springdale, </em>933 F.2d 668, 670 (8th Cir.1991) (holding that a district court erred in granting summary judgment to a municipality where police officers had no valid basis for continuing a suspect\u2019s detention and \u201cwere under no obligation to continue to hold him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The City\u2019s argument that it cannot be liable in this case because it held plaintiff pursuant to a \u201cfacially valid\u201d parole warrant, <em>see </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 13, is flawed. First, the parole warrant at issue is not in the record before us, and plaintiff has not conceded that it (1) existed and (2) was in fact facially valid. Drawing all reasonable inferences, as we must, in favor of plaintiff, we are not free to conclude that defendant was imprisoned pursuant to a parole warrant that was facially valid in all relevant respects. In any event, as noted above, it appears that any parole warrant in the City\u2019s possession ceased to be \u201cfacially valid\u201d on or about December 28, 2001, after plaintiff was not afforded a probable cause hearing within fifteen days of its issuance. <em>See </em>N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 259-i(3)(c)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">Second, we are aware of no legal authority \u2014 and the City has cited none \u2014 suggesting that a municipality may not be liable for detaining a parollee on the basis of a parole warrant that is \u201cfacially valid,\u201d but is in fact void as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The City\u2019s theory appears to contravene the general rule that \u201ca municipality is liable for even its good faith constitutional violations presuming that the municipality has a policy that causes those violations,\u201d <em>Vives v. City of New York, </em>524 F.3d 346, 350 (2d Cir.2008); qualified immunity is not available to municipalities, <em>id.-, see also Owen v. Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 638, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980) (\u201c[T]here is no tradition of immunity for municipal corporations, and neither history nor policy supports a construction of \u00a7 1983 that would justify ... qualified immunity.... We hold, therefore, that the municipality may not assert the good faith of its officers or agents as a defense to liability under \u00a7 1983.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>For reasons stated above, the District Court\u2019s order of January 26, 2005 is VACATED insofar as it granted summary judgment to the City, and the cause is REMANDED to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-5\">. Both parties agree that criminal charges against plaintiff were dismissed, pursuant to New York speedy trial provisions, because the State failed to prosecute him within six months of his arrest. <em>See </em>N.Y.Crim. Pro. Law \u00a7 30.30(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-6\">. The City\u2019s reliance on <em>Murray v. Goord, </em>1 N.Y.3d 29, 769 N.Y.S.2d 165, 801 N.E.2d 385 (2003), in which the New York Court of Appeals noted that \u201cprison officials are conclusively bound by the contents of commitment papers accompanying a prisoner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 32, 769 N.Y.S.2d 165, 801 N.E.2d 385 (internal quotation marks omitted), is unpersuasive. That case did not purport to establish that a municipality may be obligated to imprison an individual pursuant to an invalid parole warrant, and the court\u2019s brief analysis does not apply under these circumstances. The \"commitment papers\u201d discussed in <em>Murray </em>were (1) issued by a court, not a parole officer (2) <em>after </em>the adjudication of charges against a defendant, <em>see id. </em>at 31-32, 769 N.Y.S.2d 165, 801 N.E.2d 385, and (3) provided a basis for the prisoner to be held for an \u201cindeterminate or determinate sentence of imprisonment,\u201d <em>see </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 70.30(5). By contrast, as noted, a parole warrant serves as a basis solely for temporary detention, prior to the adjudication of an alleged parole violation, and is valid only so long as certain procedural safeguards are effectuated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b955-7\">. It may be that the good faith exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement is the source of the City's theory. The Supreme Court has recognized a good faith exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclu- \u25a0 sionary rule where police rely on a \"facially valid\u201d search or arrest warrant that has withstood the \"detached scrutiny of a neutral magistrate.\u201d <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 902, 913, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). We need not consider here the theory's possible application in this case, and we intimate no view on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
