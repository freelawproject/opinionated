Jan. 4, 2008), <em>affg </em>A41 583 414 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, CT June 7, 2007) . We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">The parties concede that the outcome of this case turns on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alsol v. Mukasey, </em>548 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2008) , as to whether second simple drug possession convictions under state law constitute felonies under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). <em>Alsol </em>holds that a second conviction for simple drug possession under state law is not a felony under the Controlled Substances Act simply because it could have been prosecuted as a recidivist offense pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). <em>Alsol, </em>548 F.3d 207, 210. Thus, such simple possession may not be considered an aggravated felony for purposes of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and, moreover, this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>319 F.3d 81 (2d Cir.2002) does not foreclose such a holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">Accordingly, we VACATE the decision of the BIA and REMAND for proceedings consistent with the <em>Alsol </em>opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
