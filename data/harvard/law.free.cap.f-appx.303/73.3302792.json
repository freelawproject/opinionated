Mulligan denying his motion to reopen. <em>In re Zhong Sheng Guo, </em>No. A73 187 923 (B.I.A. Feb. 29, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A73 187 923 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sep. 20, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">We ordinarily review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Here Guo has submitted a brief that waives any argument that we would be empowered to review. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">In his petition, Guo sought review of the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. Guo\u2019s brief, however, purports to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of an application for asylum. Equally troubling, he states, \u201cthe IJ found that Petitioner was not credible\u201d and goes on to point out errors in that finding. But the IJ did not make a credibility finding; indeed, he could not have because the IJ had ordered Guo removed <em>in absentia. </em>Insofar as these arguments bear little if any relation to the actual agency decision under review, Guo has waived all relevant arguments, and we deny the petition for review on that basis. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also McCarthy v. S.E.C., </em>406 F.3d 179,186-87 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">This is at least the fourth petition for review filed by Attorney Sobolevsky which we have denied or dismissed because he waived any relevant arguments. As we have done previously, we refer Attorney Sobolevsky to the Court\u2019s Grievance Panel based on the egregiously poor quality of his briefing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
