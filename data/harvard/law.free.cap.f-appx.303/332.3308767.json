Because we have previously held that a postrevocation sentence may extend for longer than the original term of supervised release, <em>United Staten v. Marlow, </em>278 F.3d 581 (6th Cir.2002), we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Roach was initially sentenced on June 21, 1991 to fifteen years imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release for, <em>inter alia, </em>possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. Roach served his time in prison and began the period of supervised release on March 24, 2005. The supervised release was revoked on March 6, 2006, when Roach \u201cstipulated that he [had] violated the terms of his supervised release by his possession of rock cocaine and marijuana on September 15, 2005, which he had planned to trade for sex.\u201d The district court considered the violation guideline range of eight to fourteen months imprisonment, sentencing him to eight months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">Roach served that term of imprisonment and began his second period of supervised release on June 12, 2006. On July 2, 2006, Lieutenant Dan Cliff of the Morristown Police Department observed an oncoming vehicle driving toward him in his lane. He let the vehicle pass, and then he turned his car around and switched on his lights. He saw Roach throw a bag with white powder in it and some white rocks out of the vehicle. Cliff radioed Officer Pete Shockley, who is a canine officer for the Morris-town Police Department, and told him that a suspect threw \u201cdope\u201d out of the vehicle and told him the location to retrieve the contraband. Shockley retrieved the bag and twenty-four rocks, and the substances field-tested positive for cocaine. The lab report on the substances was also positive for crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">The Dispositional Report (\u201cReport\u201d) filed by the United States Probation Office stated that the maximum statutory penalty faced by Roach under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) if his supervised release was revoked was sixty months incarceration, but because the defendant had previously served a total of eight months for a supervised release revocation, the maximum sentence that could be imposed would be fifty-two months incarceration. The Report stated that Roach had exhibited poor behavior and appeared to have \u201cno inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tion of following any conditions set by the Court.\u201d The Report recommended that \u201cMr. Roach\u2019s supervised release be revoked, and that he be sentenced within the prescribed revocation range.\u201d Roach objected to the Dispositional Report, arguing that the Sixth Circuit decision in <em>Marlow </em>conflicted with the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000), and that the court lacked authority to impose a post-revocation sentence longer than Roach\u2019s initial three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat the defendant committed the offenses of possession of a narcotic for resale and tampering with evidence.\u201d Therefore, the court found that he violated Standard Condition Seven of his supervised release, which states that he \u201cshall not purchase, possess, use, distribute or administer any controlled substance or any paraphernalia related to any controlled substance, except as prescribed by a physician.\u201d After noting Roach\u2019s lengthy criminal history, including three prior convictions for aggravated assault, and his criminal history category of VI, the court found that Roach showed \u201ca complete unwillingness to abide by the terms and conditions of supervised release\u201d as evidenced by his possession of illegal narcotics within three weeks of being released from prison. District Court Order of Feb. 7, 2007 at 6. The court stated that because of Roach\u2019s prior criminal record and the failure of numerous incarcerations to deter his criminal behavior, the public had an important need to be protected from his conduct. The district court found Roach\u2019s violation guideline range to be fifty-one to sixty-three months and sentenced him to a period of fifty-two months incarceration followed by no additional term of supervised release on February 7, 2007. Roach filed a timely notice of appeal on February 7, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the determination of a district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence following revocation of supervised release. <em>United States v. VanHoose, </em>437 F.3d 497, 501 (6th Cir.2006). Roach does not contest the procedural or substantive reasonableness of his fifty-two month sentence. Roach instead argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment that exceeds his original period of supervised release and that the term of imprisonment must also be reduced by the eight-month portion of the original term of supervised release that he already served because of a prior violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">When Roach was originally convicted and sentenced in 1991, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) authorized district courts to \u201crevoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release ... without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision.\u201d The text of \u00a7 3583(e)(3) did not address the issue of whether a district court could impose an additional term of supervised release after revoking the original term of supervised release and ordering re-imprisonment. <em>See Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 698, 120 S.Ct. 1795 (stating that the power to impose another term of supervised release following imprisonment was \u201cnot readily apparent from the text of \u00a7 3583(e)(3)\u201d). Congress amended \u00a7 3583 in 1994 to add subsection (h), which explicitly provides that courts may impose another term of supervised release after an initial period of supervised release has been revoked and a term of imprisonment imposed upon a defendant. <em>Id. </em>Subsection (h) also states that \u201c[t]he length of such a term of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>vised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 3583(h) does not apply retroactively to offenses committed before the effective date of the amendment, September 13, 1994. <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 702, 120 S.Ct. 1795. However, <em>Johnson </em>affirmed an additional period of supervised release imposed after the initial term of supervised release was revoked and the defendant reimprisoned based upon \u00a7 3583(e)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 713, 120 S.Ct. 1795. The Court found that \u00a7 3583(e)(3) retained linguistic continuity from the preguidelines practice and that Congressional intent favored allowing reimposition of supervised release following reimprisonment. <em>Id. </em>As Roach acknowledges, <em>Johnson </em>did not specifically rule about the duration of the new term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In <em>United States v. Marlow, </em>this court applied the principles from <em>Johnson </em>to a case where the defendant was initially sentenced to prison time and four years of supervised release. <em>Marlow, </em>278 F.3d at 582. After Marlow violated the conditions of his supervised release, the district court revoked his release and sentenced him to serve twenty months in prison followed by a new four-year term of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>Marlow appealed, and this court held that while \u00a7 3583(e)(3) did not authorize a new sentence longer than the initial term of supervised release, the district court\u2019s general sentencing authority under \u00a7 3583(a) gave the court authority to impose an additional term of supervised release after postrevocation incarceration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Roach argues that we should overrule <em>Marlow, </em>relying on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s rejection of the <em>Marlow </em>rule in <em>United States v. Russell, </em>340 F.3d 450 (7th Cir. 2003). In <em>Russell, </em>the Seventh Circuit acknowledged that \u201ca combined term of reincarceration and additional supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e)(3) could not exceed the length of the original term of supervised release\u201d and the district court could not impose a sentence longer than the original term of supervised release under \u00a7 3583(a). <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit opined that the <em>Marlow </em>court improperly relied upon a section of the <em>Johnson </em>opinion that explained the consequences of the dissent\u2019s interpretation of the statute at issue. In addition, it found that \u201cthe plain meaning of \u00a7 3583(a)\u2019s text strongly suggests that subsection applies only to the initial setting of a supervised release term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456. Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that <em>Marlow\u2019s </em>interpretation would allow district courts to bypass \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and would render the exchange between Justice Souter\u2019s majority opinion and Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent in <em>Johnson </em>moot because the <em>Johnson </em>court would not have had to determine whether \u00a7 3583(e)(3) allows the imposition of the sentence if the sentence could simply be imposed under \u00a7 3583(a). <em>Id. </em>at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">A panel of this court also questioned <em>Marlow </em>in <em>dicta </em>in <em>United States v. VanHoose, </em>437 F.3d at 505. VanHoose was originally sentenced to imprisonment and three years of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 499. Upon violating the terms of his supervised release, VanHoose\u2019s supervised release was revoked and he was sentenced to two years in prison and two years of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>The panel criticized the <em>Marlow </em>decision for misreading <em>Johnson, </em>for making <em>Johnson </em>a \u201cpointless exercise,\u201d and for ignoring the canon of statutory interpretation that the specific \u00a7 3583(e)(3) governs the general \u00a7 3583(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 505. Nonetheless, the panel upheld VanHoose\u2019s sentence, writing: \u201cEven though it appears that <em>Marlow </em>was wrongly decided, it will continue to bind this and future panels unless and until the en banc court reconsiders the question or the Supreme Court corrects the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><em>Marlow </em>constitutes the law of this Circuit and therefore controls the outcome of this case. <em>See id. </em>We are not sitting <em>en banc </em>and have no authority to disregard a Sixth Circuit precedent on point, nor does this issue seem worthy of <em>en banc </em>review. <em>See Dingle v. Bioport Corp., </em>388 F.3d 209, 215 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Salmi v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir.1985)). In addition, <em>Marlow\u2019s </em>reasoning has substantive merit. Section 3583(a) vests in the district court broad sentencing authority to impose supervised release after imprisonment, and it is a fair interpretation of that provision to assume that \u00a7 3583(a) provides valid authority to impose a postrevocation sentence greater than the original period of supervised release. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err in sentencing Roach to a term of imprisonment that exceeded his original period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Roach\u2019s second contention, that the district court did not reduce his sentence by that portion of the original term of supervised release which he served by reason of a previous supervised release violation, has no merit. Contrary to Roach\u2019s assertion, the district court did reduce his sentence by the eight months he previously served, as the Dispositional Report had recommended. Roach\u2019s previous incarceration of eight months for a previous supervised release violation has already been taken into account by his sentence of fifty-two months incarceration, eight months lower than the sixty-month statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
