Elstein denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In re Dina Supriadji, </em>No. A97 852 723 (B.I.A. Feb. 20, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A97 852 723 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 26, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness. <em>Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s fact-finding for substantial evidence, <em>Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008), and review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact, <em>Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Because Supriadji does not challenge the agency\u2019s determination that her asylum application was untimely, a determination that we generally lack jurisdiction to review, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Insofar as Supriadji challenges the denial of her withholding-of-removal claim, she must establish that the record compels the conclusion that she would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be persecuted on account of a protected ground. <em>Shoo v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 156 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Supriadji contends that the agency\u2019s determination that she had not suffered past persecution is not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 8. We disagree. In fact, as the BIA found, while Supriadji \u201creportedly suffered harassment and insults over the years because of her Chinese ethnicity and Christian religion,\u201d she \u201cdid not suffer any serious injury or harm before coming to the United States.\u201d <em>In re Dina Supriadji, </em>No. A97 852 723, at 1 (B.I.A. Feb. 20, 2008). <em>See Ivanishvili v. United States Deft of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341-42 (2d Cir.2006) (distinguishing \u201charassment\u201d from \u201cpersecution\u201d). Because the record does not compel a contrary conclusion regarding past persecution, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), we identify no error in that challenged determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">Supriadji also contends that the agency inadequately addressed her claim of future persecution, which was based on pattern-or-praetice evidence of a group similarly situated to her, <em>i.e., </em>Chinese Christians in Indonesia. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 21. We disagree. The IJ specifically stated that, based on the record, the IJ could not find \u201cthat the threat of harm to Chinese Christians by the government or forces it cannot control amounts to the necessary \u2018pattern and practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Dina Supriadji, </em>No. A97 852 723, at 11 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 26, 2006). Contrary to Supriadji\u2019s suggestion, this assessment of Supriadji\u2019s evidence found record support in a 2005 State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices noting that the Indonesian government \u201cofficially promotes racial and ethnic tolerance,\u201d and that \u201c[ijnstances of discrimination and harassment of ethnic Chinese declined compared with previous years.\u201d The BIA, in turn, explicitly agreed with the I J\u2019s conclusion that Supriadji \u201cfailed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of her Christian religion, Chinese ethnicity, or any other protected ground.\u201d <em>In re Dina Supriadji, </em>No. A97 852 723, at 1 (B.I.A. Feb. 20, 2008). The agency therefore considered Supriadji\u2019s argument, and that consideration, we conclude, is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d at 164-66 (holding that BIA\u2019s determination that a petitioner failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of persecution was supported by substantial evidence where, <em>inter alia, </em>the BIA reasonably relied upon statements contained in State Department reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-11\">.
