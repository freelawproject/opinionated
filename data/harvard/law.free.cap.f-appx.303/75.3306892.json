Wilson filed this pro se action in the Western District of Pennsylvania against Congressman John Patrick Murtha, Jr., several officials within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cthe VA\u201d) and Althea V. Jeffers, an official of the Johnstown Housing Authority, alleging violations of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1986. On March 18, 2008, the District Court denied Wilson\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) and dismissed his case without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-25\">Though far from clear, Wilson ostensibly makes two claims in his complaint, neither of which implicates the civil rights statutes through which he seeks relief. One claim concerns Murtha\u2019s and the VA\u2019s alleged failure to acquire for Wilson a certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>copy of his Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d) decision from August 3, 2004. The other claim accuses Jeffers of conspiring with the VA to have Wilson and his family evicted from their residence in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Along with his complaint, Wilson filed a motion for leave to proceed IFP in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In its order denying relief, the District Court apparently denied IFP status because Wilson \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim on which relief maybe be granted\u201d under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). This is problematic insofar as IFP determinations are to be made solely on the basis of indigence, without regard to the potential merit of a complaint. <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1084 n. 5 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 n. 1 (3d Cir.1990). Furthermore, the District Court could have easily granted IFP status on the same facts that lead this Court to do so for Wilson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Regardless, the District Court did not err in finding that Wilson\u2019s complaint lacked an arguable basis in law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, after careful review of the complaint, we are unable to decipher any legitimate violation of federal law or the Constitution. With respect to Wilson\u2019s first claim, that Murtha and the VA are somehow inhibiting his receipt of veterans\u2019 benefits by withholding a certified copy of his BVA decision, excerpts from his own complaint indicate otherwise. Wilson states that he needs the BVA decision to prove the \u201ceffective date\u201d for the grant of his armed service connection benefits. However, the letter from regional VA director Charles W. Woolford plainly states that the effective date is September 16, 1992. Furthermore, the excerpt from the BVA decision included in his complaint proves that Wilson already has a copy, or at least has access to a copy of the decision itself. Whether or not the copy is \u201ccertified\u201d hardly gives Wilson a right to sue in a federal district court. Second, on the issue of the alleged Jeffers-VA conspiracy to have Wilson and his family evicted from their residence, Wilson\u2019s own admission that he is subject to eviction because of his failure to pay rent weighs heavily against any alleged impropriety. It also suggests that this is not the proper forum for resolving Wilson\u2019s landlord-tenant issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">We further find that any attempt by the District Court to allow Wilson to amend his complaint would not have helped matters. In general, where an apparently meritless IFP complaint can be remedied by amendment, a district court must permit such an amendment upon request in the absence of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, unfair prejudice, or futility of amendment. <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002). Based on the above discussion of Wilson\u2019s claims, we are satisfied that it would have been an exercise in futility for the District Court to have permitted Wilson to amend his complaint. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim. In light of our disposition, Wilson\u2019s pending motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-18\">. The District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without prejudice does not hinder our exercise of jurisdiction. <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir. 1995) (dismissals without prejudice pursuant to \u00a7 1915 are appealable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. Our review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim is plenary. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
