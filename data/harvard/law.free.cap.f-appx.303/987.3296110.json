The issue presented by this appeal is whether the Tax Court correctly held that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Appeals Office did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the filing of a notice of federal tax lien to collect Reichle\u2019s unpaid federal income liability for 1998. Reichle disputes the Commissioner\u2019s assessment of her 1998 tax liability and argues that the Commissioner failed to provide her with due process. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">We review a grant of summary judgment by the Tax Court de novo. <em>Eisenberg v. Comm\u2019r, </em>155 F.3d 50, 53 (2d Cir. 1998). When the underlying tax liability is not in issue, courts of appeals review the Commissioner\u2019s determination for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kindred v. Comm\u2019r, </em>454 F.3d 688, 694 (7th Cir.2006). \u201cPut simply, if we conclude that the IRS appeals officer did not abuse his discretion in upholding the lien imposed on the petitioners, then summary judgment was properly granted and we will affirm the Tax Court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">Although Reichle disputes it, the underlying tax liability is not properly at issue on this appeal. Reichle concedes that she did not file a tax return for the year 1998, and that she did not respond to IRS\u2019 notice of deficiency for her 1998 taxes, sent to her by certified mail in 2001. Reichle was therefore precluded from challenging \u201cthe existence or amount\u201d of the 1998 liability at a subsequent collection-due-process (CDP) hearing to contest the federal tax lien filing, having failed to respond to the notice of deficiency for 1998. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">In affirming the notice of lien, the IRS Appeals Office did not abuse its discretion. The Tax Code requires that an IRS Appeals Officer, in determining whether to affirm a notice of federal tax lien after a CDP hearing, assess (1) whether the administrative requirements for a lien have been met, (2) the issues raised by the taxpayer at the hearing, and (3) whether the proposed lien \u201cbalances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3). Our review of the record demonstrates that the Appeals Officer reasonably determined that these requirements had been met. Thus, summary judgment was properly granted by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">Reichle was also not treated unfairly. The Tax Court advised Reichle to file her returns as soon as possible and meet with an IRS Taxpayer Advocate regarding an offer-in compromise to resolve her delinquent tax liability. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 -6330(c)(2)(A)(iii). The Tax Court made efforts to assist Reichle by directing the Commissioner to issue subpoenas for her brokerage records and offering to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>Reichle sixty days to hire a professional to assist in preparation of the delinquent returns. After Reichle refused to prepare the returns, the Tax Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Reichle contends, for the first time on this appeal, that the Commissioner is in violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(PRA), 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3501-8520, by failing to provide an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number and notice thereof on the 1998 Form 1040. This argument is not properly before this Court because Reichle did not raise it in the Tax Court. <em>See, e.g., Bogle-Assegai v. Connecticut, </em>470 F.3d 498, 504 (2d Cir. 2006). Moreover, the 1998 Form 1040 does have a valid OMB control number. <em>See United States v. Dawes, </em>951 F.2d 1189, 1193 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Reichle\u2019s contention that she was denied due process is without support in the record. We have considered all of Reichle\u2019s other arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
