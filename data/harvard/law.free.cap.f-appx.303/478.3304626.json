We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The defendant argues that the eighteen-month term of the grand jury which indicted him was improperly extended by the district court. Because this argument was one that the defendant was required to raise before trial, Fed. R. Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B), and because he has failed to make the requisite showing of cause and prejudice to overcome his procedural defaults, the argument is deemed waived. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e); <em>Davis v. United States, </em>411 U.S. 233, 243-44, 93 S. Ct. 1577, 36 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the defect he alleges does not come within the exception to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B) for claims based on the failure of the indictment \u201cto invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d \u201cAlthough Rule 12 does not say so, it seems clear that the \u2018court\u2019s jurisdiction\u2019 ... means subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d 1A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Andrew D. Leipold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 193 (4th ed.2008) (collecting cases). The defect alleged here is not of a kind that deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (\u201c[Sjubject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court\u2019s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.... In contrast, the grand jury right can be waived.\u201d). Indeed, the Advisory Committee notes to Fed. R. Crim.P. 12 expressly indicate that objections based on the \u201c[ijllegal selection or organization of the grand jury\u201d are deemed waived unless made prior to trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12 advisory committee\u2019s note; <em>see also Davis, </em>411 U.S. at 237, 93 S. Ct. 1577. The only case on which defendant relies, <em>United States v. Macklin, </em>523 F.2d 193 (2d Cir.1975), has been overruled for the proposition for which he cites it. <em>See United States v. Cordoba-Murgas, </em>422 F.3d 65, 71 n. 6 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The defendant argues, also for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred in finding that he had been convicted previously of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d namely, \u201cforcible rape,\u201d warranting a sixteen-level enhancement of his Guidelines\u2019 offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Specifically, he argues that his prior conviction of rape in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 261(a)(2) is not categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the Sentencing Guidelines because \u00a7 261(a)(2) encompasses within its definition of rape \u201cconduct accomplished through deception or by threat of nonphysical retribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Section 261(a)(2) defines as \u201crape\u201d any \u201cact of sexual intercourse accomplished ... against a person\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\u201d The critical word on which the defendant\u2019s argument hinges is \u201cduress.\u201d This term, he argues, has been construed to permit a conviction for rape even when it is not accomplished through the use of physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">We pass over this argument because, even if a \u201cstatute of conviction is overly inclusive, we may \u2018look a little further\u2019 and \u2018consider whether other documentation and judicially noticeable facts demonstrate that the offense was, indeed, within the Guidelines\u2019 definition.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Montanez, </em>421 F.3d 926, 931 (9th Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted). Among the judicially noticeable facts that we may consider under this \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d are \u201c \u2018the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which [Jimenez-Alvarado] assent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072, 1086 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16,125 S.Ct. 1254,161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)); <em>see also United States v. Snellenberger, </em>548 F.3d 699, 702-04 (9th Cir.2008) (allowing consideration of clerk minute orders in applying the modified categorical approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In this case, we look to the information to which the defendant pled guilty. The information did not charge that the defendant committed the rape by the use of \u201cduress\u201d \u2014 the element that he alleges would permit a conviction for rape without the use of force or violence in fear of immediate bodily injury. Instead, the information narrowed the charge to include only conduct that constituted \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d Specifically, the information charged that the defendant \u201caccomplishfed] an act of sexual intercourse with Aurora Valdez ... by means of force, violence, and fear of immediate bodily injury on said person and another, in violation of Penal Code 261(a)(2).\u201d This is sufficient to establish that the offense was within the Guidelines\u2019 definition of \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Harkey, </em>923 F.2d 138, 138 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir.1991) (notwithstanding the broad definition of burglary in a Washington statute, the informations narrowed the charge in a manner sufficient to support an enhancement for burglary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the district court \u201cnever considered factors in mitigation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\u201d This claim is contrary to the judge\u2019s' express statement that he had read the defendant\u2019s sentencing memorandum. Moreover, if the defense counsel actually thought otherwise, he had the opportunity to argue mitigating factors, of which there were not many, during the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b503-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
