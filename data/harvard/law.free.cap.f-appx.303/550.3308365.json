On de novo review, <em>Edlund v. Massanari, </em>258 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">1. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) properly rejected the argument that Claimant\u2019s mental impairments are severe, finding that they caused no restrictions in Claimant\u2019s daily activities and only mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning, concentration, persistence, and pace. Substantial evidence supporting that finding included medical records from Drs. Sjodin (noting no objective symptoms of depression and a \u201cgood\u201d mood) and Henninger (diagnosing only mild depressive disorder and generalized anxiety), along with consistent reports from two consulting psychologists. Additionally, Claimant failed to follow up with a recommended plan for treatment, viewing it as \u201ca waste of time.\u201d <em>See Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 681 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that lack of treatment is a legitimate consideration in determining the severity of an impairment).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">2. The ALJ permissibly found that Claimant was not entirely credible. Substantial evidence in support of that finding included Claimant\u2019s noncompliance with recommended treatments, such as attending only half of scheduled therapies and refusing psychological counseling and continued physical therapy. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144,1147-48 (9th Cir.2001) (approving that reason for disbelieving a claimant). Also, medical records of examining physicians, including Drs. Ogisu, Sibell, Jayaram, and Kallgren, were inconsistent with Claimant\u2019s allegedly debilitating pain. <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that as a permissible reason to find a claimant not credible).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">3. The ALJ properly rejected medical opinions that Claimant would have two or more absences from work per month if employed. Such opinions may be rejected for \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons\u201d supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1996). The opinions of Drs. Sibell and Ogisu that Claimant is capable of working contradict the prediction of absences. Additionally, as we have held, the ALJ properly discredited Claimant\u2019s testimony, and the ALJ rejected opinions that rested on her subjective complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">4. The ALJ gave germane reasons, <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 510-12 (9th Cir.2001), for rejecting the testimony of Claimant\u2019s fianc\u00e9. He is not a medical or vocational expert, and his testimony contradicted that of the medical experts on whom the ALJ relied. Additionally, his testimony \u201cparroted\u201d Claimant\u2019s, and the ALJ properly found her not fully credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">5. The ALJ did not err in assessing Claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity. Contrary to Claimant\u2019s argument, an ALJ is not required to discuss a claimant\u2019s limitations with respect to each of the 54 work functions, but may rely on medical and other evidence of record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545. Also, because the ALJ appropriately found Claimant not credible, he was not required to include limitations that she claimed in reliance solely on her subjective reports of pain. <em>Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ed by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
