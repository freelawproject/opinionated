Where, as here, it is unclear whether the BIA conducted de novo review of the IJ\u2019s oral decision, we may look to the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cas a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Keisler, </em>504 F.3d 1183, 1191 (9th Cir.2007). \u201cWe review for substantial evidence the decision that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Assuming the credibility of both Hovhannisyan and Vardanyan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we take as true the following instances of violence, torture, and harassment suffered by them as a result of their imputed nationality and religious beliefs: (1) in January of 1990, uniformed Fedayeen soldiers forcibly entered Petitioners\u2019 home, attacked Petitioners, and caused Hovhannisyan to suffer a bloodied nose; (2) in October of 1991, police arrested, tortured, and detained Hovhannisyan for nine hours after she complained to school officials that one of her daughters had been beaten at school, resulting in Hovhannisyan moving her family to Russia to escape the perceived dangers in Armenia; (3) in or around 1992 or 1993, and apparently after the family returned to Armenia, students knocked Vardanyan unconscious with a rock, after which the students poured water on Vardanyan\u2019s head and laughed at her; (4) in April of 1995, uniformed Fedayeen soldiers violently broke up a Charasmatic Christianity meeting attended by both Hovhannisyan and Vardanyan, during which the soldiers tore up books, broke Hovhanni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>syan\u2019s rib, caused a cut to Vardanyan\u2019s head, and arrested Hovhannisyan\u2019s husband and detained him for three days; (5) in May of 1996, students beat Hovhannisyan\u2019s daughter Armine at school for preaching about Charismatic Christianity, resulting in the family\u2019s second move to Russia to escape perceived dangers in Armenia;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (6) in the winter of 1996, unknown persons threw Hovhannisyan off a bus, and Hovhannisyan suffered a twisted ankle and a cut; and (7) in 1998, uniformed Fedayeen soldiers attempted to kidnap and murder one of Hovhannisyan\u2019s daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The BIA erred in considering Petitioners\u2019 experiences of violence, torture, and harassment separately \u2014 according to whether the instances resulted from Petitioners\u2019 imputed nationality or religion \u2014 as opposed to cumulatively, as required by law. <em>See Ahmed, </em>504 F.3d at 1192; <em>see also Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 1239, 1249 (9th Cir.2005) (noting that acts of violence against family members and close associates' can suffice to establish a well-founded fear of persecution); <em>Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe key question is whether, looking at the cumulative effect of all the incidents a petitioner has suffered, the treatment she received rises to the level of persecution.\u201d); <em>Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1077 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Furthermore, after cumulatively reviewing the record evidence of persecution, we conclude that \u201cthe cumulative effect of the harms is severe enough that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude that it did not rise to the level of persecution.\u201d <em>Ahmed, </em>504 F.3d at 1194; <em>see also Korablina, </em>158 F.3d at 1044-45 (rejecting IJ\u2019s characterization of Korablina\u2019s experiences as mere discrimination, where she was robbed, attacked, threatened with death, and tied to a chair with a noose around her neck); <em>Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207,1225 (9th Cir.2005) (noting that torture is generally sufficient to establish past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In light of our finding of past persecution, the petition for review is granted, and the case hereby remanded to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this memorandum disposition. Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Petition GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b525-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-12\">. The BIA assumed Petitioners\u2019 credibility because the IJ failed to make an explicit credibility determination. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 671-72 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that the Court must assume Petitioners\u2019 factual contentions are true in the absence of an explicit adverse credibility determination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">.
