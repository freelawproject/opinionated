R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b495-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-23\">Jodona Bottenberg (\u201cJodona\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Carson Tahoe Hospital (\u201cCTH\u201d) in her Title VII action alleging that CTH retaliated against her for complaining that co-worker Eric Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) sexually harassed her. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-24\">We assume, without deciding, that Jodona met her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>burden therefore shifted to CTH to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its adverse employment action of terminating Jodona\u2019s employment. <em>See Stegall v. Citadel Broad. Co., </em>350 F.3d 1061,1065-66 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"AXq\">Jodona concedes that the non-retaliatory reason articulated by CTH \u2014 violation of patient confidentiality \u2014 is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating her employment. Therefore, the burden shifted back to Jodona to demonstrate that CTH\u2019s stated reason for terminating her employment was merely a pretext for retaliation. <em>See id. </em>at 1066. Jodona failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">First, the evidence in the record demonstrates that CTH initiated its investigation into the unauthorized accessing of Amy Bottenberg\u2019s (\u201cAmy\u201d) medical records in response to Dr. B. Bottenberg\u2019s (\u201cDr.B\u201d) and Amy\u2019s complaints, and not in response to complaints made by Smith. Second, by Jodona\u2019s own admission, she accessed Amy\u2019s medical records from two to seven times, and shared information from Amy\u2019s medical records with others, without Amy\u2019s permission to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Finally, the evidence in the record does not demonstrate, nor does it raise an issue of fact on whether, Jodona was treated more harshly than other CTH staff who engaged in similar, or worse, conduct. The evidence demonstrates that Smith\u2019s statement to Dr. B regarding Amy\u2019s purported depression was not considered by Dr. B to be a violation of patient confidentiality, and there is no evidence that any complaint was made to CTH \u2014 by Amy, Dr. B, or anyone else \u2014 that Smith had violated patient confidentiality. Jodona has not provided citation to evidence or legal authority demonstrating that the use by Amy and Dr. B of Amy\u2019s password to access Amy\u2019s own medical records violated patient confidentiality. Nor has Jodona provided citation to evidence supporting her assertion that Drs. Vollger and McAninch were not investigated, counseled, or disciplined for allowing Jodona to use them password and/or assisting her in accessing and using the computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b495-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
