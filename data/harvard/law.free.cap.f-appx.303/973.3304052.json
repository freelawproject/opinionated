On March 7, 2007, this Court granted Petitioner a limited certificate of appealability, and instructed the parties to address whether: (1) Petitioner \u201cexhausted his available state remedies with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>spect to his claim that his plea was not voluntary because he was never informed of the intent element of the charge and, if not exhausted, whether this Court should review the claim on the merits,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe state court\u2019s determination, that the plea colloquy was sufficient to show that the plea was voluntary, was contrary to or an unreasonable interpretation of <em>Henderson v. Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976).\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The exhaustion of state remedies is required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c). On appeal, Respondents concede that Petitioner has, in fact, exhausted his available state remedies, leaving the only issue before us whether Petitioner\u2019s plea was voluntary because he was never expressly informed on the record of the intent element of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), a writ of habeas corpus \u201cshall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim ... resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d The U.S. Constitution requires that a guilty plea be voluntary. <em>See, e.g., Henderson, </em>426 U.S. at 644-45, 96 S.Ct. 2253. In <em>Henderson, </em>the Supreme Court declared that a plea is involuntary, and therefore violates due process, if the defendant does not receive \u201creal notice of the true nature of the charge against him,\u201d including notice of the elements of the crime charged. <em>Id. </em>at 645, 96 S.Ct. 2253 (quotation marks omitted). This does not mean that \u201cthe judge must himself explain the elements of each charge to the defendant on the record. Rather, the constitutional prerequisites of a valid plea may be satisfied where the record accurately reflects that the nature of the charge and the elements of the crime were explained to the defendant by his own, competent counsel.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Stumpf </em>545 U.S. 175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005). Defense counsel need not make \u201can express representation\u201d because \u201cit may be appropriate to presume that in most eases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>426 U.S. at 647, 96 S.Ct. 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Here, although Petitioner\u2019s plea colloquy lacks a specific reference to the crime\u2019s intent element, the record indicates that he understood the nature of the charged crime. Petitioner waived his right to an indictment and pled guilty to a Superior Court information. His counsel stated on the record that he had reviewed the indictment waiver and information with him and \u201cdiscussed the plea bargain offer with him prior to today ... [and] again ... utilizing the interpreter present.\u201d Moreover, Petitioner, through an interpreter, acknowledged that he understood \u201cthe charge ... in the Superior Court Information,\u201d \u201cdiscussed the facts and circumstances involved in this case\u201d with counsel, and had discussed with counsel \u201cany defense that [he] might have to this charge as well as [his] legal and constitutional rights.\u201d In his allocution, Petitioner admitted that he was \u201cguilty of welfare fraud in the fourth degree.\u201d Although it is certainly preferable that the trial judge explain each element of the charge, federal law does not mandate that state courts conduct a \u201cparticular interrogatory \u2018catechism\u2019 akin to that required of federal courts by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Phillips, </em>442 F.3d 789, 798 (2d Cir.2006). We are satisfied that Petitioner\u2019s plea colloquy was sufficient to demonstrate that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>was knowing and voluntary. The state court\u2019s review was not an unreasonable application of <em>Henderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-15\">. Welfare fraud in the fourth degree requires the commission of a \u201cfraudulent welfare act,\u201d <em>see </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 158.10, which is further defined as <em>\"knowingly and with intent to defraud, </em>engaging in an act or acts pursuant to which a person ... makes a false statement or provides false information for the purpose of (i) establishing or maintaining eligibility for public assistance benefits or (ii) increasing or preventing reduction of public assistance benefits, and such statement or information is material,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 158.00(b)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
