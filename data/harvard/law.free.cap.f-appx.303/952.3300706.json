Sager-man, finding that he had abandoned his opportunity to file for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Earl Abel Martinez, </em>No. A44 132 988 (B.I.A. Nov. 5, 2007), <em>ajfg </em>No. A44 132 988 (Immig. Ct. Fishkill Aug. 1, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review any of Martinez\u2019s arguments. Because Martinez is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (relating to convictions for aggravated 2 felonies), we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s factual findings and discretionary determinations, including any challenge to the agency\u2019s conclusion that he abandoned his opportunity to apply for CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law, <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Martinez\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision raises no such argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">Further, we are without jurisdiction to review Martinez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and derivative citizenship claims because he did not raise those claims before the agency. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (We \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d). While we held in <em>Poole v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 259, 264 (2d Cir.2008), that \u201c[t]he statutory administrative exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 1252(d)(1) does not apply to a person with a non-frivolous claim to U.S. citizenship,\u201d Martinez\u2019s derivative citizenship claim is frivolous because the IJ found that neither of his parents were citizens, and that finding was never challenged. Martinez does not point to anything in the record that would suggest any error in the IJ\u2019s finding that he not a U.S. citizen. Therefore, because Martinez\u2019s derivative citizenship claim is \u201cpatently frivolous,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>Minasyan v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 1069, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
