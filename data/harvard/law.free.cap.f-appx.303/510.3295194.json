We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny Haile\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Where the BIA affirms without opinion an IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the decision of the BIA. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184 (9th Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1184-85. For instance, the agency\u2019s determination that an applicant is not eligible for asylum \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence presented by [the applicant] was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zaearias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). \u201cWhen the BIA finds past persecution but no well-founded fear of future persecution, we review its denial of humanitarian asylum for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">The IJ found Haile credible and that she suffered past persecution on account of her Eritrean heritage, but determined that she did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Haile does not have a well-founded fear of persecution because she did not seek asylum during the five year period she lived in Thailand, she voluntarily returned to Ethiopia for two months in 2001, without incident, and left her son there, and State Department reports on Ethiopia indicate somewhat improved conditions for Eritreans. <em>See Sowe v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1281, 1286 (9th Cir. 2008); <em>Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Haile humanitarian asylum because her past persecution was not \u201catrocious.\u201d <em>Vongsakdy v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 1203, 1205 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">Because Haile failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, she necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Haile did not qualify for CAT protection because the record does not indicate that Haile will more likely than not suffer torture if returned to Ethiopia. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1230 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b535-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
