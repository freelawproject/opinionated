Mulligan, denying Zhu\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yan Ping Zhu, </em>No. A200 038 107 (B.I.A. May 13, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A200 038 107 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 15, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">The agency did not err in denying Zhu\u2019s claim for asylum and withholding of removal for failure to show a nexus to a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>In re Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985). The agency reasonably rejected Zhu\u2019s proposed particular social group-defined alternately as \u201ca family of debtors\u201d to the government, or a \u201cvulnerable group[ ]\u201d consisting of impoverished individuals in China. <em>See id. </em>at 233 (An \u201cimmutable characteristic\u201d is one that members of the group \u201ceither cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d). The agency reasonably concluded that \u201cwealth\u201d was not an immutable characteristic that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>could be used to define a social group. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 240 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that \u201cpoor\u201d Yemeni Muslims are not a particular social group because group \u201cposses[es] broadly-based characteristics\u201d); <em>see also UceloGomez v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 70, 73-74 (2d Cir.2007) (holding BIA\u2019s interpretation that \u201caffluent Guatemalans\u201d did not constitute a social group was reasonable). Therefore, the agency reasonably found that Zhu had not shown membership in a particular social group.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Zhu urges this Court in the first instance to find that she was persecuted on account of her membership in the particular social group of \u201cyoung vulnerable women susceptible to exploitation.\u201d However, because Zhu failed to exhaust this issue before the agency, we decline to consider it. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104,119-20 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Because we find that the agency reasonably concluded that Zhu had not shown membership in a particular social group, we need not address Zhu\u2019s arguments that the agency erred in rendering its adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">. Zhu failed to challenge the agency\u2019s finding that she had not shown fear of persecution on account of a political opinion, and we therefore deem any such challenge waived and decline to consider it. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). We also do not reach the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Zhu expressly waived this challenge in her opening brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
