R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion challenging the dismissal of Brumfield\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against defendants Coody, Beoker, Honeycutt, and Daigrenpont for failure to perfect service of process. The district court concluded that Brumfield\u2019s claims against these defendants were not frivolous, but it granted their motion to dismiss for failure to perfect service after the court did not receive a response to its order that Brumfield had thirty days in which to perfect service.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Brumfield is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). Brumfield contends that he attempted to comply with the court\u2019s instruction to perfect service, but that the clerk of court did not respond to his correspondence. For the reasons detailed below, we VACATE the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-20\">Although Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) directs that a dismissal for failure to perfect service should be without prejudice, <em>see </em>Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>4(m), the judgment of dismissal in this case did not specify that the complaint was dismissed without prejudice. A dismissal that is silent as to prejudice sounds as a dismissal with prejudice. <em>See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm., </em>283 F.3d 650, 656 n. 26 (5th Cir.2002). Moreover, our review of the record leads us to conclude that Brumfield may be entitled to Rule 60(b) relief because his failure to perfect service was based on excusable neglect. <em>See </em>Rule 4(m); <em>see also Henderson v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 654, 661-62, 116 S.Ct. 1638, 134 L.Ed.2d 880 (1996) (holding that the 120-day provision in Rule 4 is not jurisdictional and may be extended at the discretion of the district court). The record shows that Brumfield complied with \u201cthe core function of service [by supplying] notice of the pendency of [the] legal action, in a manner and at a time that afford[ed] the defendants] a fair opportunity to answer the complaint and present defenses and objections.\u201d <em>See Henderson, </em>517 U.S. at 671-72,116 S.Ct. 1638.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Because the district court determined that the appeal was not taken in good faith, it did not address whether Brumfield is financially eligible to appeal IFP. We note that Brumfield received $10000 in settlement of a prior civil rights lawsuit in December 2006. <em>See Brumfield v. Cain, </em>No. 3:03-cv-486 (M.D.La. Dec. 19, 2006). Brumfield states that the majority of this award was used to pay his criminal attorney. Although Brumfield\u2019s current affidavit of poverty provides adequate grounds to support a grant of IFP, a court may require additional proof of poverty as part of its inherent authority under \u00a7 1915(d). <em>Prows v. Kastner, </em>842 F.2d 138, 140 (5th Cir.1988). Accordingly, the motion to appeal IFP is HELD IN ABEYANCE and the case is REMANDED to the district court for clarification of Brumfield\u2019s financial status. We express no intimation regarding Brumfield\u2019s financial eligibility to appeal IFP.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
