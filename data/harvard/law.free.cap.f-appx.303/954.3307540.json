On April 9, 2007, this court granted Burton a certificate of appealability on the single issue of \u201cwhether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate or use an anonymous tipster\u2019s report containing potentially exculpatory statements.\u201d Order, <em>Button v. Phillips, </em>No. 06-5595-pr (2d Cir. Apr. 9, 2007). In addressing that point, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">1. <em>Standard of Review and Procedural Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of Burton\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 motion, <em>see Bell v. Miller, </em>500 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir.2007), applying the familiar two-part test for ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984): \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.... Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the <em>Strickland </em>test, a petitioner carries a heavy burden because the law indulges a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">As an initial matter, respondent asserts that this court should not address the merits of Burton\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim because a factual component of that claim, <em>ie., </em>information contained in a redacted police notebook that might have allowed defense counsel to locate the anonymous tipster, was never presented to the state court. Respondent therefore argues that, to the extent Burton\u2019s argument is based on the redacted notebook, it is unexhausted. <em>See McKethan v. Mantello, </em>292 F.3d 119,122 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cState remedies are deemed exhausted when a petitioner has ... informed [the state courts] about both the factual and legal bases for the federal claim.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We need not resolve this procedural challenge because, even if we were to rule in Burton\u2019s favor on this point, his petition would still fail for lack of merit, whether or not AEDPA deference applies. <em>See Jimenez v. Walker, </em>458 F.3d 130, 145 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>2006) (discussing when AEDPA deference is due); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (delineating deferential review standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">2. <em>Merits of Ineffective-Assistance Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Burton fails the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test because, as the district court observed, he adduced no evidence to support his claim that trial counsel failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into the tipster\u2019s statement implicating an individual nicknamed \u201cBorn Truth\u201d in the charged homicide. As the district court noted, Burton\u2019s counsel might well have investigated the report and concluded, as a matter of strategy, that it would not assist the defense. First, the tipster never indicated that his knowledge was firsthand. Rather, he appeared to be reporting based partly on a conversation that he overheard while on a payphone and partly on statements made to him by \u201cBorn Truth\u201d before the crime in question. Second, and more important, the record indicates that \u201cBorn Truth\u201d may have been Burton\u2019s brother. Because prosecution witness Giovanni Watson had previously indicated that both brothers shot at him, trial counsel could have reasonably determined that efforts to put the tipster\u2019s information before the jury would have been more corroborative than exculpatory, particularly if it opened the door to excluded evidence of threatening conduct by Burton\u2019s brother to Watson that may have explained the latter\u2019s failure to inculpate the brother at trial. As that strategic decision is apparent from the record, an evidentiary hearing was not needed to explore counsel\u2019s effectiveness. <em>See United States v. Kurti, </em>427 F.3d 159, 163 (2d Cir.2005) (rejecting ineffective-assistance claim where record, \u201c[vjiewed in its entirety,\u201d showed that attorney\u2019s \u201cstrategic advice\u201d fell \u201cwithin prevailing professional norms\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">In sum, on this record, Burton has failed to raise a colorable claim that his trial counsel\u2019s defense fell outside the broad range of conduct considered objectively reasonable. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 689,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-11\">. Although the state court rejected Burton\u2019s ineffectiveness claim primarily on procedural grounds, <em>see </em>N.Y.Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 440.10(2)(a), (c) (instructing court to deny motion to vacate where, <em>inter alia, </em>basis for motion was previously determined on merits or movant unjustifiably failed to raise issue despite sufficient record facts for adequate judicial review), the district court\u2019s determination that, in the circumstances of this case, this rule was not \"firmly established and regularly followed,\u201d <em>Burton v. Phillips, </em>No. 03-cv-4955, 2006 WL 2927832, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 2006), is not challenged by respondent on appeal, <em>see Murden v. Artuz, </em>497 F.3d 178, 196 (2d Cir.2007) (addressing \u00a7 2254 challenge on merits where procedural rule relied upon by state court was not firmly established and regularly followed). Accordingly, like the district court, we decline to dismiss Burton\u2019s petition on this ground. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 191, 195 (holding that claim rejected on state procedural grounds was procedurally barred).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
