We review a district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits de novo. <em>Schneider v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>223 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cWe may set aside the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits when the AL J\u2019s findings are based on legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find that the administrative law judge (ALJ) did not support his decision with substantial evidence, and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">Central to the ALJ\u2019s decision was his determination that Wilson\u2019s testimony regarding the impact of her fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) was not credible. The examples cited by the ALJ failed to meet the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard required to discredit a claimant\u2019s testimony as to the severity of her symptoms when she has provided medical evidence of her underlying impairment. <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998). Evidence that Wilson occasionally drove to Phoenix, took a vacation to Hawaii, and sometimes found the energy to go grocery shopping are not clear and convincing evidence that the claimant led a life that is not compatible with disabling pain and limitations. Wilson\u2019s undertakings were \u201csporadic and punctuated with rest. Even more prolonged undertakings might be consistent with [her disability].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Disability claimants should not be penalized for attempting to lead normal lives in the face of their limitations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">The ALJ also failed to support his discrediting of Wilson\u2019s four treating physicians with clear and convincing reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Holohan v. Massanari, </em>246 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir.2001). The medical opinion of Wilson\u2019s treating physicians was supported by medically acceptable diagnostic techniques and was not inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record; it therefore should have been giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>en controlling weight. <em>See Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Additionally, the ALJ erred by dismissing the opinions of Wilson\u2019s three lay witnesses on the assumption that they merely reiterated her own allegations regarding her pain and fatigue. <em>See Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993). Disregard of this evidence on such a slender basis \u201cviolates the Secretary\u2019s regulation that he will consider observations by non-medical sources as to how an impairment affects a claimant\u2019s ability to work.\u201d <em>Sprague v. Bowen, </em>812 F.2d 1226, 1232 (9th Cir.1987) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Finally, the ALJ failed to support his residual functional capacity determination with substantial evidence. It does not suffice to determine that the claimant is capable of some of the activities of normal life; the ALJ must also demonstrate that \u201cthe ability to perform those daily activities translated into the ability to perform appropriate work.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.1990). Here, the ALJ failed to demonstrate how Wilson\u2019s daily activities translated into the ability to perform sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Because the limitations caused by the pain of fibromyalgia and the fatigue of CFS are non-exertional limitations, vocational expert testimony was required in this case. <em>See Reddick, </em>157 F.3d at 729. By failing to provide either the testimony of a vocational expert or substantial evidence that Wilson was capable of sustained sedentary work, the ALJ failed to support his denial of Wilson\u2019s claims. <em>See Penny v. Sullivan, 2 </em>F.3d 953, 959 (9th Cir.1993). We conclude that a remand for further proceedings would serve no useful purpose. <em>See Reddick, </em>157 F.3d at 730. We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to remand to the ALJ for an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
