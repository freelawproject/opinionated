Straus, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Bledar Agastra, </em>No. A79 417 042 (B.I.A. Mar. 26, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A79 417 042 (Immig. Ct. Hartford, Connecticut Sep. 8, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, because the BIA affirms \u201cthat portion of the [IJ]\u2019s decision finding that the DHS has demonstrated that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in Albania,\u201d we limit our review to that portion of the IJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121,129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">We find that the IJ properly determined that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in Albania such that, even assuming Agastra suffered past persecution, any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution has been rebutted. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A); <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179 (2d Cir.2006). Agastra argues that the IJ erred in giving disproportionate weight to the Department of State Country Reports in making his fundamental change in circumstances finding, and failing to give weight to \u201ccontradictory information and evidence\u201d that Agastra provided. However, Agastra fails to, with respect to applicants who base their asylum claims on their involvement with the Democratic Party, indicate any such \u201ccontradictory\u201d evidence in the record, and the IJ did note that \u201c[t]here are no documents from Amnesty International or other human rights organizations indicating that political violence has continued to any significant degree in Albania.\u201d Finally, our past decisions on this matter clearly support the agency\u2019s conclusion that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in Albania \u201c[b]ased on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>improvement in the human rights situation, and the election of the democratic party in 2005.\u201d <em>See Hoxhallari, </em>468 F.3d at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">While Agastra argues that the past persecution he suffered warrants a grant of humanitarian asylum, he did not raise that argument before the agency, and we decline to consider any such argument as unexhausted. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2007) (describing the issue exhaustion requirement as \u201cmandatory\u201d). Further, because the agency\u2019s fundamental change in circumstances finding is dispositive of Agastra\u2019s application for asylum, particularly considering his failure to exhaust his argument for a grant of humanitarian asylum, we need not consider the IJ\u2019s finding that he could have reasonably relocated within Albania.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Agastra\u2019s application for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur, </em>494 F.3d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Finally, the IJ properly found that Agastra had not provided sufficient evidence to establish eligibility for CAT relief, and he fails to indicate anything in the record to compel the contrary conclusion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">. As an initial matter, although petitioner is challenging the denial of relief in \"asylum-only\u201d proceedings, as opposed to an actual removal order, this Court nonetheless has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">. The Government correctly argues that Agastra's failure to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his withholding of removal claim constitutes a waiver of that category of relief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
