Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s factual findings regarding eligibility for asylum are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). To prevail, the applicant must show that the evidence not only supports, but compels, the conclusion that the asylum decision was incorrect. <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">As an initial matter, government counsel stated before the IJ that she \u201cwould stipulate that [Singh] is statutorily eligible\u201d for asylum. She did not question Singh\u2019s credibility, gave no closing argument, and asked him only if he could live safely elsewhere in India. When asked by the IJ for the government\u2019s position, she stated, \u201cif the Court is inclined, we would not oppose.\u201d Given the apparent agreement of the parties, it is surprising that the IJ denied Singh\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Nonetheless, regardless of whether the government stipulated to asylum, the record before us does not support the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum. Singh testified that, during his arrests and beatings, the police repeatedly accused him of being a \u201cKhalistani\u201d \u2014 a supporter of an independent Sikh state \u2014 and told him they would \u201cteach [him] a lesson because [of his plan] to make a complaint against the police.\u201d The IJ did not make an explicit credibility finding as to Singh\u2019s testimony concerning his prosecution. Thus, this testimony must be deemed credible. <em>See De Leon v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 1185, 1191 (9th Cir.2005). Taking into account the expressions of motive by the police, Singh demonstrated that at least one of the reasons for his persecution was an imputed political opinion. <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Singh v. Ilchert, </em>63 F.3d 1501, 1508-09 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Singh is eligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">We GRANT the petition for review and REMAND this case to the BIA so that the Attorney General may exercise his discretion in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b460-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">. Singh does not seek review of that portion of the BIA\u2019s order denying Convention Against Torture (CAT) relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
