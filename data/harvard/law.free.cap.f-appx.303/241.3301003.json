R. CRIM. P. 11.?\u2019 In that motion, Johnson challenged his sentence and eonviction on various bases. On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court erred by recharacterizing his motion as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and dismissing it as an unauthorized successive motion. He asserts that his motion actually arose under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">Johnson\u2019s motion was not authorized under any of the cited legal authorities. The unauthorized motion was therefore without jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141\u2014 42 (5th Cir.1994). Because the district court construed the motion as an attempted successive \u00a7 2255 motion, dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was proper due to Johnson\u2019s failure to obtain permission from this court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">On appeal, Johnson alternatively requests a certificate of appealability (COA) in order to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court. Johnson is conflating two different requirements. Permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in district court arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) and 2255. A COA is not required. To the extent he seeks a COA, that request is unnecessary. To the extent he seeks permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in district court, that request is denied as improperly submitted without prejudice to his ability to submit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>proper request under \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) and 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO FILE A SECOND OR SUCCESSIVE \u00a7 2255 MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-13\">. Johnson argues that the district court was required to provide notice that it intended to treat his motion as a \u00a7 2255 petition. However, the Supreme Court has held only that a district court must provide notice when the motion is treated as the party\u2019s <em>first </em>\u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 382, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Because Johnson had already filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion, we see no error in the district court\u2019s treatment of Johnson\u2019s motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
