Petitioners therefore do not have a qualifying relative for purposes of applying for cancellation of removal and the BIA correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioners were ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">Al other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b560-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
