The IJ denied the request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.29, an IJ \u201cmay grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d We review the denial of a motion for continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sandoval-Luna. v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the IJ did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s request for a continuance that was based on speculation that there would be comprehensive immigration reform and that petitioner would qualify for relief arising out of that reform. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b513-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
