Dille sued the defendants-appellees under a series of Federal and State employment discrimination claims. After reviewing the record, the applicable law, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find that the magistrate judge\u2019s opinions carefully and correctly set out the facts and the governing law. Because this court\u2019s issuance of a full opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose and would be duplicative, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to defendants-appellees, adopting the reasoning of the magistrate judge\u2019s opinions of August 24, 2007 except on one point. We consider it a close question whether Dille failed to set forth a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge under Title VII. But even assuming Dille met the prima-facie-case test, we agree with the magistrate judge\u2019s reasoning that Dille failed to produce evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the non-diseriminatory reason LVI gave for discharging him was a pretext for race discrimination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
