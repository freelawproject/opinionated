We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review \u201cwhether substantial evidence supports a finding by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that [Guerrero-Aguilar] abandoned [her] lawful permanent residence in the United States.\u201d <em>Khodagholian v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.2003). We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the government met its burden of showing Guerrero-Aguilar abandoned her lawful permanent resident status because the record does not compel the conclusion that she consistently intended promptly to return to the United States. <em>See Singh, v. Reno, </em>113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that \u201c[t]he relevant intent is not the intent to return ultimately, but the intent to return to the United States within a relatively short period\u201d and an alien \u201cmay extend his trip beyond that relatively short period only if he intends to return to the United States as soon as possible thereafter\u201d); <em>see also Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, </em>792 F.2d 932, 937 (9th Cir. 1986) (alien\u2019s trip abroad is temporary only if he has a \u201ccontinuous, uninterrupted intention to return to the United States during the entirety of his visit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Contrary to Guerrero-Aguilar\u2019s contention that the IJ violated due process, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfaii\u2019 that [Guerrero-Aguilar] was prevented from reasonably presenting [her] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Guerrero-Aguilar\u2019s contention that the agency decision is internally inconsistent is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
