Clarke argues that the district court erred by determining that she failed to make any \u201cdisclosures\u201d necessary to sustain her claims under the statute. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-26\">The facts and procedural history of this case are familiar to the parties, and we do not repeat them here. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Devereaux v. Abbey, </em>263 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-27\">The Oregon whistleblowing protection statute, Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 659A.203, forbids a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>public employer from \u201c[p]rohibit[ing] any employee from disclosing, or takfing] or threatening] to take disciplinary action against an employee for the disclosure of any information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of,\u201d among other things, \u201c[a] violation of any federal or state law\u201d or \u201cMismanagement, gross waste of funds or abuse of authority or substantial and specific danger to public health and safety resulting from action of the state, agency or political subdivision.\u201d Oregon courts have not had the occasion to consider whether a person can make a disclosure of information that is already publicly known.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The plain language of the Oregon statute, however, confirms that merely reporting publicly available information does not constitute a protected \u201cdisclosure.\u201d Dictionaries confirm that one cannot \u201cdisclose\u201d information that is already publicly known. <em>See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>497 (Garner 8th ed. 2004) (\u201cThe act or process of making known <em>something that was previously unknown; </em>a revelation of facts.\u201d) (emphasis added); 4 <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>737 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c... To open up to the knowledge of others; to make openly known, reveal ... ); <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>360 (1984) (\u201c[T]o expose to view ... to make known or public.\u201d). We are confident that the Oregon courts would agree with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">None of Clarke\u2019s alleged disclosures provided any information that was not already publicly known. The personal tax measure issue, according to Clarke, was \u201cwidely known\u201d throughout the Mental Health and Addiction Services Division (\u201cMHASD\u201d), where Clarke was employed. Likewise, the Cascadia issue was brought to Clarke\u2019s attention by others at MHASD, and was apparently a recurring problem. The intensive treatment services overpayment issue was also known to at least one other employee (Tom Wirshup) before Clarke became involved. Finally, the 9.1% decreased funding issue was relayed to Clarke at a \u201cRates and Finance\u201d meeting by other employees. Clarke has thus failed to make a \u201cdisclosure\u201d under section 659A.203.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b536-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
