The Department of Homeland Security issued a notice to appear, charging her with removability, and instructed her to appear at a removal hearing on February 14, 2007. Zhou was warned that the failure to do so could result in the issuance of a removal order. When Zhou and her attorney failed to appear at the hearing, the IJ entered a removal order <em>in absentia </em>and denied all claims for relief from removal. Zhou timely moved to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that her lack of photo identification left her unable to board a flight to attend the hearing and that this situation constituted extraordinary circumstances justifying her motion to reopen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ rejected this argument and denied the motion. The BIA affirmed, stating that Zhou \u201cshould have been aware of the photo documentation required to travel by plane in the United States.\u201d This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 146, 172 L.Ed.2d 40 (2008). \u201cThe BIA abuses its discretion when its decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Mickeviciute v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 1159, 1162 (10th Cir.2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in removal proceedings and the BIA\u2019s discretion to consider such motions is \u201cquite broad.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Where, as here, the alien does not argue lack of notice, a motion to reopen for the purpose of vacating an <em>in absentia </em>removal order must demonstrate that the alien\u2019s failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">The term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, <em>but not including less compelling circumstances) </em>beyond the control of the alien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\u00a7 1229a(e)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Upon review, we conclude the BIA did not abuse its discretion. The BIA\u2019s determination that Zhou could have anticipated the need for photo identification was reasonable. Therefore, Zhou failed to meet her burden of demonstrating circumstances beyond her control that were no less compelling than serious illness, battery, or extreme cruelty. Zhou\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-14\">. After presenting her immigration paperwork and notice to appear to airline authorities, Zhou was allowed to board a later flight, which did not arrive in time for the hearing due to weather delays. The IJ found that inclement weather was not an exceptional circumstance to justify reopening the removal proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
