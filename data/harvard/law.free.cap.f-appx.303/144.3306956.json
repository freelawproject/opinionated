Burrell asserts two sentencing errors. First, he contends that the district court erred by finding that a Virginia court\u2019s sentence of boot camp for a 1993 drug conviction counted as a \u201cprior sentence of imprisonment\u201d under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.2(e) (2007), for purposes of determining whether Burrell qualified for a sentence enhancement as a career offender. Second, Burrell argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary and does not serve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-25\">We review sentences for reasonableness, under an abuse of discretion standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Gall v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). This court may afford sentences that fall within the properly calculated guidelines range a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473; <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness of within-guidelines sentence). This presumption can be rebutted only by showing \u201cthat the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In considering the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">When determining a defendant\u2019s criminal history, \u201c[a]ny prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month that was imposed within fifteen years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense is counted.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l). A \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d is \u201ca sentence of incarceration and refers to the maximum sentence imposed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(1). A defendant qualifies as a career offender if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(2) the instant offenses of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Before a conviction is counted for career offender purposes, we consult the guidelines provision for computing criminal history. USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Mason, </em>284 F.3d 555, 558 (4th Cir.2002). As Burrell correctly notes, if his time in boot camp did not count as a \u201cprior sentence of imprisonment,\u201d then he has only one crime of violence or controlled substance offense for which he served a sentence longer than one year and one month in the last fifteen years, and should not have been sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Though we have yet to address this specific issue, two other Courts of Appeals have held that \u201ctime served in a boot-camp style program counts as a form of imprisonment under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Gajdik, </em>292 F.3d 555, 558 (7th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>166 F.3d 723, 726 (5th Cir.1999). In <em>Brooks, </em>the Fifth Circuit noted that, under the commentary to USSG \u00a7 4A1.1, \u201cconfinement sentences of over six months qualify for \u00a7 4A1.2(b) treatment,\u201d but \u201ctypes of sentences not requiring twenty-four hours a day physical confinement, such as probation, fines, and residency in a halfway house\u201d were expressly distinguished. <em>Brooks, </em>166 F.3d at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court held that \u201cphysical confinement is a key distinction between sentences of imprisonment and other types of sentences. The guidelines make no distinction between offenders incarcerated primarily for rehabilitation and those incarcerated simply to remove the offender from society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726-27 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We find this rationale persuasive, and therefore conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Burrell\u2019s sentence to boot camp qualified as a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(b). Therefore, Burrell was properly sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Burrell\u2019s second sentencing claim also fails. In determining an appropriate sentence, a district court \u201cneed not robotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection,\u201d but should \u201cprovide [this court] an assurance that the sentencing court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with regard to the particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the district court explained that it had considered both the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guideline range. The court specifically noted that the promotion of respect for the law and the protection of the community were of paramount importance in this case. The court found the sentence appropriate when viewed in light of Burrell\u2019s repeated criminal convictions and continued disregard for the law. Accordingly, we find that the 160-month sentence, which is within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range, is reasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Because we reject Burrell\u2019s challenge to his sentence, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
