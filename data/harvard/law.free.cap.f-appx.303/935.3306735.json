We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">Tibbetts filed the instant lawsuit seeking to set aside the judgment rendered in <em>Tibbetts v. Dittes, </em>No. 95 Civ. 995 (D.Conn. Mr. 29, 2000), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>No. 01-7377-ev (2d Cir. Sept. 16, 2003). To the extent that Tibbetts asks us to construe his action as a motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(1) or (b)(3), we agree with the district court that, even if timely brought, such a motion must be made \u201cin the court and in the action in which the judgment was rendered,\u201d and cannot be maintained as a separate action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60, 1946 advisory committee note.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">Tibbetts appears to abandon any claim that his action may be maintained as an \u201cindependent action\u201d for equitable relief under Rule 60(d), however, by failing to raise the issue in his counseled brief. In any event, the district court did not err in finding that Tibbetts failed to state such a claim. \u201cGenerally, claimants seeking equitable relief through independent actions must meet three requirements. Claimants must (1) show that they have no other available or adequate remedy; (2) demonstrate that movants\u2019 own fault, neglect, or carelessness did not create the situation for which they seek equitable relief; and (3) establish a recognized ground \u2014 such as fraud, accident, or mistake \u2014 for the equitable relief.\u201d <em>Campaniello Imports, Ltd. v. Saporiti Italia S.p.A., </em>117 F.3d 655, 662 (2d Cir.1997). The district court properly concluded that Tibbetts either had available remedies before the court in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number><em>Dittes </em>action or did not, even assuming his allegations were true, plead the requisite fraudulent conduct to sustain an independent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The amended complaint does not allege that the <em>Dittes </em>judgment is void pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) as a result of due process violations. Nonetheless, Tibbetts raises the argument on appeal. This claim is precluded by the district court\u2019s denial of Tibbetts\u2019s Rule 60 motion in <em>Dittes, </em>and by this Court\u2019s affirmance of that denial. <em>Tibbetts v. Dittes, </em>167 Fed.Appx. 851 (2d Cir.2006). Tibbetts does not challenge the district court\u2019s denial of the post-judgment motion to amend the complaint, nor do we find any error in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In disposing of Tibbetts\u2019s appeal in <em>Tibbetts v. Levin, </em>Nos. 05-5826-ev et al., we noted that the instant appeal remained pending and cautioned Tibbetts and his counsel that \u201cthis Court may resort to restrictive measures that except from normally available procedures litigants who have abused them litigation opportunities,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhese measures include barring a party from filing further appeals or motions without the leave of this Court.\u201d <em>Tibbetts v. Levin, </em>288 Fed.Appx. 743, 746 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Tibbetts has long been on notice that the instant action was wholly without merit, <em>see Tibbetts v. Stempel, </em>Nos. 3:97-cv-2561-cfd <em>et al, </em>2005 WL 2146079, at *7 (\u201cTibbetts cannot be said to have had an objective good faith belief in the merits of the lawsuits filed subsequently to <em>Dittes, </em>particularly <em>Tibbetts v. President and Fellows of Yale College, </em>which was filed four years after the three consolidated actions, and which sought substantially the same relief.\u201d), and was recently informed by this Court that any \u201cclaims challenging defendants\u2019 conduct during the course of the <em>Dittes </em>litigation\u201d \u2014 precisely the kind of claims alleged in this action\u2014 \u201care precluded by the District Court\u2019s denial of Tibbetts\u2019s Rule 60 motion in <em>Dittes, </em>and by this Court\u2019s affirmance of that denial.\u201d <em>Tibbetts v. Levin, </em>288 Fed.Appx. at 745. Nevertheless, Tibbetts pursued this appeal and, over the past several years, has filed numerous motions, both in this and in his six related appeals (Nos. 05-5826, 05-5873, 05-5830, 05^695, 05-0694, 01-7377), raising claims that have been addressed and rejected repeatedly by both this Court and the district court. In sum, having warned Tibbetts that sanctions may be imposed under these circumstances, it is hereby:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">ORDERED that Jeffery Tibbetts must file in this Court within 20 days of the filing of a notice of appeal from a judgment rendered by a district court within this Circuit a motion for leave to take such appeal. Such motion shall indicate supporting grounds, and all proceedings in this Court relating to such appeal shall be stayed until such a motion is decided. If such a motion is not filed within 20 days, the appeal shall be dismissed. A copy of this order is to be appended to any notice of appeal;</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">ORDERED that Jeffery Tibbetts is enjoined from filing applications for relief other than an appeal from a judgment rendered by a district court in this Circuit unless such application is accompanied by a motion for leave to file such application that states supporting grounds. All proceedings in this Court shall be stayed until such motion is decided. The clerk shall accept no papers that do not comply with this order; and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">ORDERED that nothing herein shall apply to petitions for rehearing of the present decision by this panel or by the Court en banc or shall be construed to limit Jeffery Tibbetts\u2019s access to the Supreme Court of the United States on any matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>We believe this procedure protects the parties and this Court from frivolous litigation, while still preserving Tibbetts\u2019s right of access to the courts. <em>See Gyadu v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 590, 591-92 (2d Cir.1999); <em>see also Hong Mai Sa v. Doe, </em>406 F.3d 155,158 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. We DENY as moot defendants\u2019 motion for leave to file a supplemental appendix and final-form brief. The outstanding motions filed by Tibbetts in this and other cases are addressed in a separate order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-14\">. Tibbetts, in fact, filed three Rule 60 motions in the <em>Dittes </em>action, each of which was denied by the district court; those denials were affirmed on appeal. <em>See Tibbetts v. Dittes, </em>167 Fed.Appx. 851 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Tibbetts v. Dittes, </em>No. 05-4695 (2d Cir. Aug. 10, 2006). Tibbetts has been barred from filing further motions related to the Dittes action without written leave from the district court. <em>Tibbetts v. Stempel, </em>Nos. 97 Civ. 2561 <em>et al., </em>2005 WL 2146079, at *8 (D.Conn. Aug.31, 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
