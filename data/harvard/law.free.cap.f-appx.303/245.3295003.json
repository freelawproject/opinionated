Mardusha argues that the IJ\u2019s determination that Mardusha had not made a sufficient showing to establish her date of entry deprived Mardusha of her right to due process. Mardusha also asserts that the BIA abused its discretion when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Mardusha asylum and withholding of removal on the grounds that Mardusha was not credible. For the reasons discussed below, we DENY the petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying Mardusha asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-28\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b269-29\">Mardusha is an Mbanian citizen who was born in Shkoder, Abania in 1974. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 125 (App. for Asylum at 1). Mardusha is single and has two children who were born in the United States and who are United States citizens. J.A. at 126-27 (App. for Asylum at 2-3). In Abania, Mardusha was a member of the Democratic Party (\u201cDP\u201d) and worked as the host of a children\u2019s television pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>gram. J.A. at 130 (App. for Asylum at 6). Mardusha asserts that because of her visibility and political affiliation, she was persecuted by the Albanian police. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">At her merits hearing before the IJ, Mardusha testified that she and her family first became involved in the democratic movement in Albania in 1990. J.A. at 79 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 26). Mardusha explained that she officially became a member of the DP after she participated in a demonstration on April 2, 1991. J.A. at 80 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 27). The first major event that Mardusha described at her hearing was the death of her uncle. J.A. at 80-82 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 27-29). Mardusha testified that in November of 1999, her uncle broke up a fight between his wife and the wife of a police officer. <em>Id. </em>Mardusha explained that the police officer\u2019s wife called her husband and that, in response, the police came to Mardusha\u2019s uncle\u2019s house and shot him inside his home<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in front of his family. <em>Id. </em>Mardusha was not present when her uncle was killed, but Mardusha stated that her aunt witnessed the shooting and told Mardusha what had happened. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Around the time of her uncle\u2019s death, Mardusha started to have difficulties with the police. Mardusha testified that in 1998 when she began appearing on television, a police officer approached her as a fan of her show. J.A. at 115 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 64). Mardusha explained that this police officer began to stalk her and to threaten her and her friends. J.A. at 92-93 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 41-42). Mardusha told the IJ that the problems with her stalker intensified after her uncle died because she continued to question publicly the circumstances surrounding her uncle\u2019s death. J.A. at 113-14 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 62-63). Mardusha stated that shortly after her uncle\u2019s death, also in November 1999, the police detained her. J.A. at 89 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 38). The police threatened Mardusha during this time, and the officer who had been stalking Mardusha was present. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">After her uncle\u2019s death, Mardusha\u2019s stalker and other police officers continued to follow her. J.A. at 90 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 39). This police harassment culminated in Mardusha\u2019s kidnapping in December 2000. J.A. at 90-91 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 39-40). Mardusha testified that as she was walking home, some men grabbed her, threw her into a van, tied her up, and brought her to a house. <em>Id. </em>According to Mardusha\u2019s hearing testimony, the police officer who had been stalking her arrived at this house, removed her clothing, punched her, and did \u201cwhat he wanted to do for a long time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Mardusha was later able to escape and return home. J.A. at 92 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 41).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Mardusha testified that after this kidnapping and assault she went into hiding, but the police were still able to find and follow her. J.A. at 93-94 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 42-43). As a result of this on-going persecution, Mardusha decided to leave Albania. Mardusha\u2019s parents paid a man who got Mardusha a fake passport and accompa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>nied her to America. J.A. at 94-95 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 43-44). Mardusha testified that she arrived in America on January 5, 2001, but that she had no paperwork to prove this because the man who brought her into America had kept all of the documentation. J.A. at 95-101 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 44-50).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Mardusha filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal in November 2001. J.A. at 146 (App. for Asylum at 1). On January 22, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) charging Mardusha with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). J.A. at 244 (NTA at 1). On October 8, 2003, Mardusha and her counsel appeared before an IJ, and Mardusha conceded removability. J.A. at 62-63 (2003 Hr\u2019g Tr. at 11-12). Mardusha\u2019s merits hearing was held on July 11, 2005. Mardusha testified to the events described above, submitted corroborating documents, and asserted that she feared she would be killed if she returned to Albania. J.A. at 95 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 44).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The IJ issued an oral decision denying Mardusha asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ first found that Mardusha \u201chas not satisfied the requirement of showing by clear and convincing evidence that her application for asylum was made within one year of her last arrival.\u201d J.A. at 25 (IJ Decision at 3). Though the IJ concluded that Mardusha\u2019s application for asylum was untimely, the IJ went on to consider Mardusha\u2019s testimony. The IJ found Mardusha not credible based on the following inconsistencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkF\">Mardusha testified that her uncle was killed inside his home while the newspaper article she submitted stated that he was killed outside. Accounts of the dispute that led to the killing also differed. J.A. at 37-38 (IJ Decision at 15-16).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9n\">Mardusha submitted a document from a DP leader which failed to mention her detention after the April 1991 rally. J.A. at 38-39 (IJ Decision at 16-17).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL2\">Mardusha\u2019s application for asylum had included the 2000 kidnapping, but it did not state that the officer who had been stalking her was present at the kidnapping or that he had raped her. She testified for the first time at the hearing that her stalker participated in her kidnapping. J.A. at 39-40 (IJ Decision at 17-18).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The IJ also noted that Mardusha had not submitted much credible corroborating material and that she had not submitted material that was available to her that would have corroborated her testimony. J.A. at 40-43 (IJ Decision at 18-21). Mardusha had not, for example, submitted affidavits from her family members to corroborate her date of entry or her kidnapping even though some of her relatives lived in America or had provided affidavits attesting to other information. <em>Id. </em>The IJ also found that Mardusha had not alleged sufficiently that the events she described, such as her kidnapping and her uncle\u2019s death, were politically motivated, and that therefore, she had not \u201cestablished that she is entitled to\u201d asylum or to withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). J.A. at 42-46 (IJ Decision at 20-24). The IJ finally concluded that Mardusha did not qualify for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) because she had not shown that the government of Albania either directed or acquiesced in the events she described and hence she could not establish that it was likely that she would be tortured by the government if she returned to Albania. J.A. at 46 (IJ Decision at 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Mardusha appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. Mardusha argued that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>met her burden of establishing her date of entry because the government included the date of entry from her application for asylum in its NTA, and she conceded removability based on this document. J.A. at 11-12 (Mardusha BIA Br. at 4-5). Mardusha next suggested that the IJ had not made a specific finding that Mardusha was not credible and that any implications that Mardusha was not credible were not due deference. J.A. at 12-14 (Mardusha BIA Br. at 5-7). Mardusha also asserted that she had suffered persecution and that she had shown that this persecution was politically motivated. J.A. at 14-15 (Mardusha BIA Br. at 7-8).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">On January 31, 2007, the BIA dismissed Mardusha\u2019s appeal and upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. J.A. at 2-4 (BIA Order at 1-3). The BIA noted that although the NTA contained a date of entry, the government contested this date at the hearing, and Mardusha failed to provide any evidence to support this date. J.A. at 3 (BIA Order at 2). The BIA concluded that there was \u201cno reason to disturb the [IJ\u2019s] decision denying [Mardusha\u2019s] application for asylum as untimely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA also concluded that the IJ\u2019s determination that Mardusha was not credible was supported by the record and that the IJ had \u201cprovide[d] specific and cogent reasons\u201d for finding that Mardusha was not credible. <em>Id. </em>The BIA specifically noted that Mardusha\u2019s testimony that her uncle was killed inside his home was contradicted by a newspaper article that Mardusha submitted that stated that her uncle had been killed in his front yard. <em>Id. </em>The BIA also highlighted the fact that Mardusha\u2019s application for asylum had not stated that her stalker was present at her kidnapping or that he had raped her. J.A. at 4 (BIA Order at 3). The BIA concluded that there was no reason \u201cto disturb the [IJ\u2019s] denial of [Mardusha\u2019s] application\u201d for withholding of removal under the INA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and dismissed Mardusha\u2019s appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Mardusha now petitions us for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. First, Mardusha asserts that the IJ\u2019s decision to dismiss Mardusha\u2019s application for asylum as untimely deprived Mardusha of her right to due process. Mardusha Br. at 5, 7-8. Mardusha suggests that the IJ acted with \u201cextreme prejudice\u201d throughout the hearing and that the IJ\u2019s conclusions are not, therefore, due our deference. <em>Id. </em>at 9-12. Mardusha further argues that she has shown past persecution and that the IJ and the BIA abused their discretion when they denied Mardusha\u2019s petitions for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 12-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Anqz\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u201cWhen the BIA does \u2018not summarily affirm or adopt the IJ\u2019s reasoning and provide^] an explanation for its decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final agency determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fang Huang v. Mukasey, </em>523 F.3d 640, 651 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Ilic-Lee v. Mukasey, </em>507 F.3d 1044, 1047 (6th Cir.2007)). \u201cWe review factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 667, 672 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This standard of review requires us to take findings of fact as conclusive \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672-73 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>B. Timeliness of Asylum Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The legal standards governing applications for asylum are laid out in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. An alien cannot apply for asylum under this section \u201cunless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). This statute states that \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\u201d that a given individual\u2019s application for asylum is untimely. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). After the passage of the REAL ID Act in 2005, we concluded that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201cbar[s] our review of asylum applications denied for untimeliness only when the appeal seeks review of the discretionary or factual questions, but not when the appeal seeks review of constitutional claims or matters of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 748 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Mardusha\u2019s brief seems to argue that the IJ\u2019s timeliness determination violated Mardusha\u2019s due-process rights because the IJ was prejudiced. Mardusha Br. at 2, 7-9. However, Mardusha failed to raise before the BIA the argument that the IJ was prejudiced. J.A. at 11-12 (Mardusha BIA Br. at 4-5). Therefore, any constitutional arguments that Mardusha makes are unexhausted, and we cannot consider them. <em>Ramani v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 554, 560 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201c[W]e hold that only claims properly presented to the BIA and considered on their merits can be reviewed by this court in an immigration appeal.\u201d). Additionally, Mardusha\u2019s brief contains only limited argument on this point and does not present any evidence of the alleged prejudice. To the extent that this argument seeks review of factual questions, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. Because Mardusha has waived and failed to support any constitutional claim, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s factual determination that Mardusha\u2019s petition for asylum was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">C. Asylum Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Even if Mardusha\u2019s claim that the IJ\u2019s finding that Mardusha had not met her burden of proving that her application was timely were successful, Mardusha cannot prevail on her claim that she should be granted asylum. An applicant for asylum must prove that he or she cannot return to his or her country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 674. After an applicant makes this showing, the IJ has the discretion to grant or deny asylum. <em>Mapouya v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 396, 406 (6th Cir.2007). If the IJ or BIA finds an applicant\u2019s testimony credible, an applicant can rely solely on his or her own testimony to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 674; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). The IJ must support an adverse credibility finding with specific reasons \u201cbased on issues that go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>388 F.3d 924, 925-26 (6th Cir.2004). We review credibility determinations under the deferential substantial-evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>As the IJ\u2019s credibility deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>mination is a finding of fact, we cannot overturn it unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 672-73 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In Mardusha\u2019s case, we cannot say that we are compelled to conclude that the IJ and the BIA erred in their determinations that Mardusha was not credible. Both the IJ and the BIA made specific findings of the inconsistencies that led them to conclude that Mardusha was not credible. The two inconsistencies that the BIA noted are related to the two major incidents that Mardusha described: her uncle\u2019s death and her own kidnapping. Because the IJ and BIA identified some discrepancies that go to the heart of Mardusha\u2019s application for asylum, we hold that there is \u201cnot sufficient evidence to compel a finding of credibility, which is the standard for reversal by this Court.\u201d <em>Sail v. Gonzales, </em>251 Fed.Appx. 337, 341 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">D. Withholding of Removal Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Mardusha also apparently seeks review of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decision to deny her withholding of removal under the INA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, \u201can alien must show that there is a clear probability, that is, that it is more likely than not, that she would be subject to persecution on the basis of [race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion] were she removed from the country.\u201d <em>Almuhtaseb, </em>453 F.3d at 749 (internal quotation marks omitted). This substantive qualification standard for withholding of removal under the INA is more stringent than the one applied to claims for asylum. Therefore, because Mardusha is not eligible for asylum, it necessarily follows that she is not eligible for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">We must \u201cuphold the BIA\u2019s determination against withholding the removal of an alien, unless it is manifestly contrary to the law. Furthermore, any administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Ndrecaj, </em>522 F.3d at 677 (internal quotation marks omitted). As discussed above, because the IJ described inconsistencies that go to the heart of Mardusha\u2019s claims, we cannot say that denial of withholding of removal under the INA is manifestly contrary to law. Given this deferential standard of review, we must deny Mardusha\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Mardusha\u2019s petition seeking review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her application for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. Mardusha submitted a newspaper article regarding her uncle\u2019s murder which stated that he was shot in his front yard, not while he was inside his home as Mardusha testified. J.A. at 117 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 66). When the IJ noted this difference, Mardusha explained that the article had misreported that detail but that she had submitted the article despite the error because it highlighted the importance and political nature of her uncle\u2019s murder. J.A. at 117-18 (Hr\u2019g Tr. at 66-67).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-11\">. As the IJ noted, in the statement that Mardusha submitted with her application for asylum, Mardusha mentioned the December 2000 kidnapping but stated that she had been kidnapped by \"some unknown men\u201d and did not note the presence of the officer who had been stalking her. J.A. at 39-40 (IJ Decision at 17-18); <em>see also </em>J.A. at 158 (Mardusha Stmt, at 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\">. The BIA did not discuss withholding of removal under the CAT because it found that Mardusha did \"not articulate any arguments disputing\u201d the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for CAT protection. J.A. at 2 (BIA Order at 1 n. 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">. Section 1158(a)(2)(D) provides that an individual can apply for asylum after this one-year period if the individual can show changed or extraordinary circumstances. Mardusha contends that she sufficiently proved that her date of entry was less than a year before she filed for asylum, and she does not argue that either of the exceptions in \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) apply to her case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">. We do not consider the availability of withholding of removal under the CAT because the BIA found that Mardusha did \"not articulate any arguments disputing\" the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT protection. J.A. at 2 (BIA Order at 1 n. 1). Mardusha\u2019s claims under CAT are, therefore, unexhausted, and we cannot consider them. <em>Ramani, </em>378 F.3d at 560.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
