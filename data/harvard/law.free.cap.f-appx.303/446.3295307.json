The IJ held that Petitioner was not credible because Petitioner allegedly made four inconsistent statements and was evasive during the hearing. Based on that holding, the IJ denied Petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">We review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence. <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination. Inconsistent statements can only serve as a basis for an adverse credibility determination if they are material and go to the heart of the claim. <em>Zhu v. Mukasey, </em>537 F.3d 1034, 1038-39 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">The IJ identified four inconsistencies. First, the IJ concluded Petitioner\u2019s declaration stating that a \u201cfew\u201d people persecuted her and her testimony that \u201cfive or six\u201d people persecuted her created \u201ca material discrepancy\u201d because \u201cearlier she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>said that five to six would be something more than a few people.\u201d These statements are not inconsistent because a \u201cfew\u201d can mean \u201cfive or six,\u201d and Petitioner stated as much when asked to clarify the alleged discrepancy. Even if this was inconsistent, it is not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Second, the IJ concluded Petitioner\u2019s statement in her declaration that the \u201csame people\u201d visited her in the August and December incidents was inconsistent with her testimony that \u201cfive or six\u201d members had visited her in August, and fifteen to twenty people assaulted her in December. Petitioner explained this alleged discrepancy, testifying that in December, the same five or six members who persecuted her in August came to her business again, left once her family members appeared, and then returned later with others. This explanation is entirely reasonable and consistent with her declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Third, the IJ concluded Petitioner\u2019s testimony that President Ter-Petrossian had resigned in 1999 was inconsistent with the State Department Country Report, noting his resignation in 1998. Because the Yerkrapah was aligned with Ter-Petrossian, the IJ concluded that the Yerkrapah could not have been part of the government for purposes of asylum during the time the alleged acts of persecution occurred. The IJ, however, did not find this material, so this court need not consider this ineonsis- \u25a0 tency. Even if it did, the IJ\u2019s conclusion is speculative and speculation is \u201can impermissible basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167-68 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Fourth, the IJ concluded Petitioner\u2019s testimony that, as a result of the December incident, all three of her sons and her husband needed medical attention in a hospital was inconsistent with her declaration stating that only one of her sons and her husband needed medical attention in a hospital. A failure to file an application that is not as complete as hearing testimony, however, does not mean that a petitioner is not credible. <em>See Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381-82 (9th Cir. 1990). Furthermore, Petitioner explained this inconsistency by stating that although she did not recall specific details, she did recall that her husband and one of her sons needed considerably <em>greater </em>medical attention and treatment. Nor does this inconsistency go to the heart of her claim because what matters is Petitioner\u2019s persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In sum, the four material discrepancies identified by the IJ are either not inconsistent, not material, or both. They therefore cannot support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]o support an adverse credibility finding based on unresponsiveness, the BIA must identify particular instances in the record where the petitioner refused to answer questions asked of him.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109,1114 (9th Cir.2002). Because the IJ did not identify any specific examples of Petitioner\u2019s alleged evasiveness, his unsupported conclusion cannot form the basis of the determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Because substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding, we grant the petition and remand so that the IJ may consider whether, accepting the petitioner\u2019s testimony as true, the petitioner qualifies for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under CAT. <em>See, e.g., Mousa v. Mukasey, </em>530 F.3d 1025, 1030 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
