We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and review de novo. <em>Lopez v. Schriro, </em>491 F.3d 1029,1036 (9th Cir.2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The district court properly denied habeas relief as to petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim which she premised on the alleged suppression of information regarding two body shop employees. Setting aside the question of whether there was sufficient foundation for the employees\u2019 proposed testimony about the van they allegedly cleaned, petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim fails because she supposedly took the van to the body shop herself and knew its condition. She was therefore \u201caware of the essential facts enabling [her] to take advantage of [the] exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Raley v. Ylst, </em>470 F.3d 792, 804 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The district court properly denied petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because she failed to show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result of the proceeding would have been different had her attorney presented the testimony of two belatedly-retained experts. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The experts\u2019 declarations fail to undermine the central prosecution theory because they do not rebut consistent testimony from multiple witnesses regarding the lividity and body temperature of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The district court also correctly denied habeas relief with respect to the trial court\u2019s handling of the jury note. The California Court of Appeal ruled that the note was ambiguous and that the trial judge correctly invited the jury to clarify its question. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling is not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). <em>See Weeks v. Angelone, </em>528 U.S. 225, 233-34, 120 S.Ct. 727, 145 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000); <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>351 F.3d 988, 995-97 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b399-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
