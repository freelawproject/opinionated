It is true that the district court misspoke at the change-of-plea hearing when it stated that the maximum penalty for that offense was 20 years under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860; in fact, the maximum penalty was life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), as accurately stated in the Presentence Report. However, defendant never sought below, and does not seek now, to vacate his guilty plea and go to trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, in the district court, his only hesitation about pleading guilty was based on his persistent hope (despite the repeated advice of his counsel and the prosecutor to the contrary) that he could belatedly accept the government\u2019s prior offer of a plea agreement (which defendant had previously rejected and the government had since withdrawn), rather than enter a straight plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In this court, defendant\u2019s only dispute is with the length of the sentence imposed, which was apparently higher than he hoped to receive when he pled guilty. That, of course, is no basis for challenging the validity of his plea, <em>United States v. Mercedes Mercedes, </em>428 F.3d 355, 359 (1st Cir.2005), much less his sentence. \u201cDefendants cannot have it both ways\u2014 one way when they plead and another when they come to sentence, unless they express a willingness to have the pleas set aside.\u201d <em>Dawson v. Wainwright, </em>440 F.2d 1259,1262 (5th Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Moreover, any defect in defendant\u2019s plea colloquy had no bearing on his ultimate sentence. The drug quantity used to calculate defendant\u2019s guideline range was based not on the amount of drugs to which he pled guilty but on the evidence presented by the government at sentencing. Defendant pled guilty to the indictment, which charged him with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute \u201c50 grams or more of crack cocaine\u201d but did not specify the precise amount of drugs involved. Because defendant disputed the amount of drugs found attributable to him in the presentence report, the government called an agent involved in the underlying investigation to testify on that issue at the sentencing hearing. Based on the agent\u2019s testimony, the court found that the total amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy was 3.8 kilograms. Defendant does not challenge the factual accuracy of that calculation on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Although defendant argued below that he should be held accountable for only half of that amount (based on the agent\u2019s testimony that defendant shared leadership of the drug point in question with another defendant), the court found it unnecessary to resolve that issue since the base offense level, 36, would have been the same whether the drug amount attributable to defendant were 3.8 or 1.9 kilograms. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (applying level 36 to at least 1.5 but less than 4.5 kilograms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>cocaine base). Defendant acknowledged as much below and does not press this issue on appeal either.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Defendant\u2019s only remaining argument is that the district court failed to give adequate weight to certain purportedly mitigating sentencing factors \u2014 namely, defendant\u2019s age (21), his limited education (11th grade), his upbringing in a drug-infested environment, and his lack of a criminal record. However, the record indicates that the district court did consider those factors but found them outweighed by the seriousness of the offense \u2014 large-scale drug trafficking in plain view of young children on a basketball court in a public housing project and near a public middle school \u2014 and the resulting need for punishment and deterrence. Given the deference due to the district court\u2019s balancing of the applicable factors, <em>United States v. Deppe, </em>509 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2007); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir.2006), particularly where, as here, the chosen sentence falls within the guideline range, <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), we decline to second-guess its plausible reasoning or its defensible result, <em>United States v. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is <em>summarily affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-6\">. Although he stated both at the change-of-plea hearing and at the sentencing hearing that he \"felt pressured\u201d into entering a straight plea as opposed to a negotiated plea, there is nothing in the record to indicate that he felt pressured to plead guilty rather than stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">If defendant were asking this court to vacate his guilty plea, we would review such an unpreserved claim only for plain error and would find none since the record contains no indication, much less a \"reasonable probability,\u201d that defendant would have decided to go to trial rather than plead guilty if he had been correctly informed of the maximum penalty for his offense at the time of his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
