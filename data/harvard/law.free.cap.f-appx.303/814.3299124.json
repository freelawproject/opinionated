Guerra Gonzalez challenges the three-level enhancement of his sentence for creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>the application of the risk or death or serious injury enhancement to a sentence. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004). The decision that Guerra Gonzalez created a risk of death or serious injury to the aliens he transported is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>Id. </em>A district court may enhance a sentence by three levels if the defendant created, either intentionally or recklessly, a substantial risk of death or serious injury to the illegal aliens who he smuggled or transported and the total offense level is less than eighteen.

Guerra Gonzalez attempted to smuggle twelve aliens from Cuba to the Florida keys on a boat equipped with only five life vests. The aliens would have in all likelihood died or suffered serious injuries if they had fallen overboard in the open seas without a flotation device. The application of the enhancement is consistent with the instruction to apply the enhancement flexibly.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Guerra Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
