Unum Life Insurance Company of America terminated the long-term disability benefits of Ross Glenn Moorman Jr. after twelve months because there was no medical evidence that Moorman continued to qualify for benefits. Moorman sued Unum under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act of 1970, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Unum and this appeal followed. After oral argument and a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion or commit any reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">The summary judgment in favor of Unum is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
