Counsel submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), averring there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting this court should consider whether the district court erred by enhancing Taste\u2019s sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2006), because he had at least three previous convictions for violent felonies. Specifically, Taste was convicted of four counts of breaking or entering in North Carolina state court in 2007 and was convicted of strong arm robbery in South Carolina state court in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Under \u00a7 924(e), a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that is one of several specified offenses, or a crime that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2006). In considering whether the district court properly designated Taste an armed career criminal, we review the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Wardrick, </em>350 F.3d 446, 451 (4th Cir.2003). In determining whether a crime is a violent felony within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e), the offense is considered generieally in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion. <em>Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1584, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). In particular, \u201cthe phrase \u2018maximum term of imprisonment, prescribed by law\u2019 for the \u2018offense\u2019 was not meant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriquez, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 1792, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">In <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242 (4th Cir.2005), the defendant argued that one of his Armed Career Criminal Act predicate convictions, a North Carolina Class I felony, did not qualify as \u201can offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year\u201d because \u201cthe maximum non-aggravated punishment\u201d was twelve months. <em>Harp, </em>406 F.3d at 245^16. Declining, as in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205 (4th Cir.1999), to apply an \u201cindividualized analysis,\u201d we held in <em>Harp </em>that, \u201cto determine whether a conviction is a crime punishable by a prison term exceeding one year, <em>Jones </em>dictates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>that we consider the maximum <em>aggravated </em>sentence that could be imposed for that crime upon a defendant with the worst possible criminal history.\u201d <em>Harp, </em>406 F.3d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Taste acknowledges that the maximum sentences that could be imposed upon any defendant for his prior convictions exceed one year. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 924(e)(1) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Taste, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Taste requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Taste.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
