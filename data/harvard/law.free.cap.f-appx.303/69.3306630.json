Mar. 26, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A99 592 581 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, June 16, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see In re J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">As a general matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that an asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>see also Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 720 (2d Cir.2007). While we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Lin makes no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>argument that would invoke our jurisdiction. Accordingly, we dismiss Lin\u2019s petition to the extent he asks us to review the agency\u2019s determination that his asylum application was untimely. <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">As to Lin\u2019s application for withholding of removal and CAT relief, we find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). The IJ drew an adverse inference as to Lin\u2019s credibility after observing his demeanor and finding both that Lin\u2019s \u201cconfusion was feigned\u201d regarding his testimony about his hospital stay and that \u201che became visibly nervous\u201d when questioned about the availability of his wife\u2019s examination booklet. We accord particular deference to such assessments of an applicant\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005). Lin also testified inconsistently with his documentary evidence regarding whether he received \u201cChinese traditional medicine\u201d or \u201cChinese herbal medicine\u201d when he sought treatment for a sore throat at a Chinese hospital in July 2005. Writing on a clean slate, we may not have found that Lin\u2019s testimony on this matter undermined his credibility, but we cannot conclude that \u201cno reasonable fact-finder\u201d would have done so. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Having called Lin\u2019s credibility into question, the IJ properly noted Lin\u2019s failure to produce reasonably available corroborative evidence, including his wife\u2019s gynecological examination booklet and his own travel documents. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Assuming the IJ\u2019s finding that Lin gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether his wife was visibly pregnant in the fall of 2004 was based on a mischaracterization of the record, remand is not required because we can \u201cconfidently predict\u201d that, in the absence of that error, the agency would adhere to its decision to deny Lin\u2019s asylum application based on an adverse credibility determination. <em>See id. </em>at 339-40. Because the only evidence of a threat to Lin\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. Any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">. We find no merit in Lin\u2019s argument that the agency erred by failing to conduct a separate analysis of his CAT claim. Lin failed to establish a basis for his CAT claim separate from his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
