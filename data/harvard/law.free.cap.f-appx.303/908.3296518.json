The parties agree that the controlling substantive law is that of Connecticut. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal, including its determination of state law. <em>See Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, </em>499 U.S. 225, 231, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991); <em>Vietnam Ass\u2019n for Victims of Agent Orange v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>517 F.3d 104, 115 (2d Cir.2008). In doing so, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">1. <em>Breach Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">Omni asserts that the district court erred in relying on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Leon\u2019s Bakerg, Inc. v. Grinnell Corp., </em>990 F.2d 44 (2d Cir.1993), to enforce the limitation-of-damages clause in the parties\u2019 contract. It submits that such clauses have now effectively been declared void for public policy by the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hanks v. Powder Ridge Rest. Corp., </em>276 Conn. 314, 885 A.2d 734 (2005). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\"><em>Hanks </em>did not categorically hold that exculpatory agreements or limitation-of-damages clauses violated public policy. Rather, it ruled that the issue could be determined only by reference to the factual circumstances of the particular case in light of current societal expectations. <em>See id. </em>at 330, 885 A.2d 734. The circumstances that prompted the court in <em>Hanks </em>to invalidate an exculpatory agreement are largely absent from this case. First, the premises and instruments causing plaintiffs personal injuries in <em>Hanks </em>were designed, maintained, and controlled by the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 331, 885 A.2d 734. Second, plaintiff, a private person, lacked the knowledge, experience, and authority to discern, much less ensure, that these premises and instruments were maintained in a reasonably safe condition. <em>See id. </em>Third, defendant alone could insure against the risks and effectively spread the costs of that insurance among its thousands of customers. <em>See id. </em>at 332, 885 A.2d 734. By contrast, in this case, the premises at issue were maintained and controlled by Omni, a commercial entity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Thus, Omni was better able to discern and ensure that the premises were reasonably maintained to minimize the risk of flooding than was defendant, which was retained simply to monitor the site and provide notice if any flooding was detected. Finally, Omni, as the owner and custodian of the property, was in a far better position than defendant to know the value of its premises \u201cand to bargain with an insurance company for appropriate coverage and an appropriate premium.\u201d <em>Leon\u2019s Bakery, Inc. v. Grinnell </em>Corp., 990 F.2d at 49. Indeed, in the contract at issue, Omni specifically represented that it had adequate insurance to protect its premises and property, and it did not avail itself of the opportunity offered in the contract to increase the amount of defendant\u2019s liability limitation by paying an additional charge. <em>See id. </em>(observing that damages-limitations clauses serve to keep alarm systems affordable, which can itself be viewed as consistent with the public interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Nothing in <em>Hanks </em>signals that, in such circumstances, Connecticut law would fail to apply the reasoning relied on in <em>Leon\u2019s Bakery </em>to enforce the challenged limitations clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">The rationale for upholding an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer of an alarm system to limit the liability of the manufacturer is that [m]ost persons, especially operators of business establishments, carry insurance for loss due to various [hazards]. Presumptively insurance companies who issue such policies base their premiums on their assessment of the value of the property and the vulnerability of the premises. No reasonable person could expect that the provider of an alarm service would, for a fee unrelated to the value of the property, undertake to provide an identical type coverage should the alarm fail....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 48-49 (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In fact, after <em>Hanks, </em>lower Connecticut courts continue to cite favorably to <em>Leon\u2019s Bakery </em>in upholding damages-limitations clauses in contracts for alarm services. <em>See New London County Mut. Ins. v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., </em>No. UWYCV024003594S, 2007 WL 1299185, at *6, *8 (Conn.Super.Ct. Apr. 23, 2007) (citing <em>Leon\u2019s Bakery </em>to uphold limitation-of-liability clause and award summary judgment on breach-of-contraet claim relating to fire-alarm services); <em>Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co. v. PPG Indus., </em>No. X03CV024022069, 2006 WL 1391542, at *4 (Conn.Super.Ct. May 8, 2006) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court correctly enforced the damages-limitation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">2. <em>CUTPA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Omni does not dispute that, to pursue a CUTPA claim, it must demonstrate aggravating circumstances beyond a simple breach of contract. <em>See Boulevard Assocs. v. Sovereign Hotels, Inc., </em>72 F.3d 1029, 1038-39 (2d Cir.1995); <em>A-G Foods, Inc. v. Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 215, 579 A.2d 69 (1990) (holding that CUT-PA addresses practices that \u201coffend[ ] public policy\u201d; are \u201cimmoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous\u201d; and cause \u201csubstantial injury to consumers\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). It submits that the \u201cunconscionable\u201d nature of the contract\u2019s limitations clause satisfies this requirement. Like the district court, we conclude that this is simply a recasting of its public-policy argument. <em>Cf. Smith v. Mitsubishi Motors Credit of Am., Inc., </em>247 Conn. 342, 353, 721 A.2d 1187 (1998) (rejecting claim of \u201csubstantive unconscionability\u201d where it was \u201cno more than a reformulation\u201d of appellant\u2019s \u201cpublic policy argument\u201d); <em>Leon\u2019s Bakery, Inc. v. Grinnell Corp., </em>990 F.2d at 49 (discussing en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>forceability of limitation-of-liability clause in terms of unconscionability). Omni\u2019s CUTPA theory therefore duplicates its breach-of-contract claim, and our rejection of the latter disposes of the former. <em>See Boulevard Assocs. v. Sovereign Hotels, Inc., </em>72 F.3d at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">We have considered all of Omni\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
