Tucker, Jr. appeals from the June 22, 2007 final decision of the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d), regarding an award of workers compensation under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Though we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the factual and procedural history of the case, we revisit key portions of that history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-18\">In 1993, Tucker filed a claim for compensation under the Act for occupational diseases alleged to have been caused by exposure to hazardous substances in the course of work for Electric Boat Corporation in Connecticut. In 2000, Tucker filed additional claims naming respondent Thames Valley Steel (\u201cTVS\u201d) and others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>as alternatively liable employers. Hartford Insurance Company (\u201cHIC\u201d), which is TVS\u2019s insurance carrier, was also named as a respondent by Tucker. The claims came before the District Director of the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs in Boston, Massachusetts, in an attempt to bring the parties to a resolution, but the parties could not come to a full agreement. The District Director then referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Law Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Following a formal hearing, Administrative Law Judge Daniel F. Sutton (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a \u201cDecision and Order Awarding Benefits and Denying Special Fund Relief\u2019 in September 2003. In the decision, the ALJ found that Tucker had established that he suffers from \u201casbestos-related interstitial lung disease which is causally related to his employment at TVS.\u201d J.A. at 25. Tucker alleged that he had been totally disabled since 1985 as a result of his disease, and the ALJ noted that a series of chest x-rays from that year revealed \u201ca poor inspiratory effort with pleural thickening and tenting at the cardiac apex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The ALJ also noted, however, that it was not until 1993 that Tucker was given a full examination which revealed that he had \u201cindisputable evidence of asbestos-related pleural disease with scarring in the lower lobe lining\u201d as a result of his exposure to asbestos. <em>Id. </em>Still, the ALJ ordered TVS and HIC to pay Tucker total disability compensation benefits from May 1985 onwards because Tucker had stopped work \u201cat least in part, [due] to his occupational disease,\u201d and was thus an involuntary retiree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Following the ALJ\u2019s decision, Tucker filed a motion asserting that the ALJ erred in his computation of Tucker\u2019s weekly compensation rate. TVS and HIC in turn filed a motion for reconsideration on several of the ALJ\u2019s determinations, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) Tucker\u2019s claim against them was not timely filed; (2) Tucker\u2019s medical condition had not caused Tucker permanent and total disability since May 1985; and (3) Tucker is not an involuntary retiree but a voluntary retiree for purposes of the Act. In a November 5, 2003 Order, the ALJ granted the motion of TVS and HIC for reconsideration on whether Tucker\u2019s claim against them was timely filed, and upon reconsideration the ALJ concluded that it was, indeed, timely. The ALJ then denied TVS and HIC\u2019s motion for reconsideration with respect to its other claims, and also denied Tucker\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">On November 13, 2003, TVS and HIC appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Benefits Review Board. The BRB acknowledged this appeal on December 12, 2003, and assigned it the docket number BRB No. 04-0136. At roughly the same time, TVS and HIC filed a motion for reconsideration with the ALJ, which was denied on December 17, 2003. On December 23, 2003, TVS and HIC filed another appeal to the BRB. TVS and HIC attached a cover letter to the December 23 notice, addressed to the Clerk of the Board, stating that \u201c[a]s we discussed, the BRB <em>will not </em>assign a new docket number to this appeal, but rather, the BRB will consolidate this Notice with the previously filed Notice of Appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94 (emphasis in the original). On February 23, 2004, the BRB dismissed their original appeal \u2014 BRB No. 04-0136 \u2014 as premature, pursuant to \u00a7 802.206(f) of the BRB\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure, since TVS and HIC had subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also in its Order of February 23, 2004, the BRB acknowledged TVS and HIC\u2019s second appeal and construed it as an appeal of all of the underlying decisions, and assigned it the docket number BRB No. 04-0136.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">In December 2004, the BRB issued a decision reversing the ALJ\u2019s decision that Tucker was an involuntary retiree, on the ground that \u201cthere is no evidence that [Tucker] left his employment in 1985 due to his lung disease.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 73. The BRB further concluded that, \u201c[a]s we have held that [Tucker]\u2019s 1985 retirement was not related to his lung disease, we cannot affirm [the May 1985] onset date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">On remand, the ALJ determined that Tucker was \u201centitled to an award of permanent partial disability compensation,\u201d and that, \u201c[s]ince the Board also held that [Tucker]\u2019s testimony cannot support a finding regarding the date on which his work-related disability commenced[,] his work-related disability [is deemed to have] commenced on April 1,1993,\u201d when a medical report first linked Tucker\u2019s illness to his past employment. <em>Id. </em>at 84. The ALJ\u2019s decision was issued April 13, 2006, and Tucker filed a motion for reconsideration soon after. Among other things, Tucker requested reconsideration of the ALJ\u2019s new commencement date for benefits, which the ALJ declined to revisit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Tucker appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision of April 13, 2006 to the BRB, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the December 23, 2003 appeal of TVS and HIC to the BRB had sought review only of the ALJ\u2019s decision on the second motion for reconsideration, and, accordingly, that the BRB should not have considered all of the ALJ\u2019s previous decisions in the case. Tucker also argued that the ALJ erred in finding that the onset date of his work-related disability was in 1993 and not in 1985. In a June 22, 2007 Decision and Order, the BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s April 13, 2006 Decision and Order. Tucker then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">On appeal, Tucker makes three central arguments. First, he renews his argument, made to the BRB, that TVS and HIC\u2019s December 23, 2003 appeal sought review only of the ALJ\u2019s decision on the second motion for reconsideration, and thus that the BRB lacked jurisdiction to consider all of the ALJ\u2019s previous decisions in the case. <em>See </em>Appellant Br. at 21. Second, Tucker argues that even if the BRB had jurisdiction to review the ALJ\u2019s previous decisions, the BRB exceeded its \u201csubstantial-evidence\u201d scope of review when it reversed the ALJ\u2019s original determination that the onset of Tucker\u2019s disability was in 1985. <em>Id. </em>at 32. Third, Tucker argues that the BRB erred in affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination on remand of the \u201conset\u201d date for Tucker\u2019s impairment award because the ALJ erroneously thought it was constrained to conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support an onset date of 1985. <em>Id </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">The Act grants jurisdiction to the Courts of Appeals to \u201cgive a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, [an] order of the [BRB] and enforcing same to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c). However, \u201c[o]ur review is limited to whether the BRB made any errors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>law and whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d <em>Rainey v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>517 F.3d 632, 634 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>decisions of law by the BRB. <em>Universal Mar. Serv. Carp. v. Spitalieri, </em>226 F.3d 167,172 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">With respect to Tucker\u2019s first argument on appeal, we agree with the BRB that it did have jurisdiction to consider the ALJ\u2019s previous decisions and not only its denial of reconsideration. As the BRB noted, the cover letter of TVS and HIC\u2019s December 23, 2003 appeal specifically requested that it be consolidated with its November 13, 2003 appeal, which had not yet been dismissed as premature, and which sought review of the ALJ\u2019s September 2003 Decision and Order Awarding Benefits. Because the BRB may treat as a notice of appeal \u201cany written communication which reasonably permits identification of the decision from which an appeal is sought,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.208(b), it was within its authority to consider the cover letter to the December 23, 2003 appeal, along with the appeal itself in determining that TVS and HIC sought review of the ALJ\u2019s original grant of benefits as well as its subsequent denial of reconsideration. Accordingly, we conclude that Tucker\u2019s claim regarding the BRB\u2019s jurisdiction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">With respect to Tucker\u2019s second claim, we conclude that the BRB did not exceed its scope of review when it reversed the ALJ\u2019s findings that May 1985 was the date of the onset of Tucker\u2019s disability. Although the record shows that Tucker experienced health problems of several types in 1985, we agree with the BRB that the record \u201c[does] not support the existence of a permanent respiratory impairment at that time.\u201d J.A. at 100. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s original finding was not supported by the necessary \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d and the BRB did not exceed its scope of review in reversing that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Finally, with respect to Tucker\u2019s third claim, we conclude that, on remand, the ALJ correctly determined that he was precluded by the BRB\u2019s prior decision from finding that Tucker\u2019s disability arose is 1985. The BRB expressly concluded that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that [Tucker\u2019s] lung condition affected [his] ability to perform his job\u201d in 1985, <em>id. </em>at 73, refused to affirm a 1985 impairment commencement date for this reason, and noted that mere diagnosis of an illness and evidence of pleural thickening were insufficient to support a finding of disability. In the circumstances of this case, the BRB\u2019s determination that there was no substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s original conclusion that Tucker was disabled by a work-related condition in 1985 necessarily implied that there was also insufficient evidence that he suffered any impairment from a work-related condition at that time. The ALJ was therefore correct to conclude that he could not find that Tucker\u2019s disability arose in 1985. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in finding that the onset of Tucker\u2019s impairment was in 1993, and the BRB did not err in affirming that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">We have considered all of plaintiffs arguments on appeal and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition of review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">. Though the ALJ\u2019s order states that Tucker should receive benefits '\u2018commencing May 21, 1984,\u201d <em>see </em>J.A. at 28, he later amended his decision to provide that the correct date from which compensation was payable was May 21, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">. Section 802.206(0 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">If a timely motion for reconsideration of a decision or order of an administrative law judge ... is filed, any appeal to the Board, whether filed prior to or subsequent to the filing of the timely motion for reconsideration, shall be dismissed without prejudice as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.206(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
