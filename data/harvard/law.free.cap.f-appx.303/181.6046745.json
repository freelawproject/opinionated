LLC, Ltd. (\u201cBuckeye\u201d), as successor in interest to the Cadle Company, appeals the judgment of the bankruptcy court, as affirmed by the district court, rejecting Buckeye\u2019s claim that a debt owed to it by Appellees Vernon Lee Laux and Pamela Sue Laux (\u201cDebtors\u201d) should not be discharged in their bankruptcy. The gravamen of Buckeye\u2019s contention is that the Debtors\u2019 original Schedules and Statements of Financial Affairs were knowingly false by virtue of omissions and misrepresentations and that these errors should not be deemed cured by revised filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">We are satisfied by our review of the record on appeal, including the facts and the law as set forth in the briefs of the parties, the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion &amp; Order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s rejection of Buckeye\u2019s opposition to the discharge of the subject debts, that the rulings of those courts are correct. For essentially the reasons set forth by the district court in its careful and exhaustive opinion, the judgment of the bankruptcy court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1034-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
