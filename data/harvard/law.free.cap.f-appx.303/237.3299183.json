Kennedy argues on appeal that the district court erred by converting 80.28 grams of powder cocaine found in his codefendant\u2019s residence into an equivalent amount of crack cocaine when determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">This court reviews the sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Bums, </em>526 F.3d 852, 859 (5th Cir.2008). Based upon the evidence regarding Kennedy and his codefendant\u2019s crack cocaine dealings, it was foreseeable to Kennedy that the powder cocaine located in the codefendant\u2019s residence would be converted into crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>334 F.3d 406, 414 (5th Cir.2003). The district court therefore did not clearly err by converting the 80.28 grams of powder cocaine into an equivalent amount of crack cocaine for sentencing purposes. <em>See Burns, </em>526 F.3d at 859. Moreover, to the extent that Kennedy relies upon <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), his argument lacks merit because the crack/powder disparity discussed in <em>Kimbrough </em>does not prohibit a district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>from converting powder cocaine into crack cocaine for sentencing purposes when it is otherwise appropriate for it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
