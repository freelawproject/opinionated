We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">In 2004, Hernandez and Juan Chavez, a local drug dealer, engaged in a series of drug transactions, whereby Hernandez would arrange a delivery of marijuana and cocaine to Chavez through Hernandez\u2019s Mexican contacts. After two major deliveries, Chavez defaulted on payment and owed the Mexican dealers over one million dollars. Under pressure from the Mexican suppliers to collect from Chavez, Hernandez conceived a scheme to kidnap Chavez\u2019s mother, Rosa Chavez, hold her captive, and then demand that Juan Chavez pay a ransom for her release. Hernandez recruited the other defendants to help him execute the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">On August 7, 2004, the five defendants traveled from Dalton, Georgia, to Rosa Chavez\u2019s home in Nashville, Tennessee. Around midnight, Borrego forced open Mrs. Chavez\u2019s front door and went inside, followed by Bencomo-Castillo, Mendez, and Perez openly displaying firearms. The defendants abducted the three occupants of the home, Rosa Chavez, Eloy Florez (Rosa\u2019s boyfriend), and Estephany Marquez (Juan Chavez\u2019s fourteen year old niece), at gunpoint, eventually driving them to a Super 8 Motel in Dalton, Georgia, and holding them as hostages.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">On August 9, 2004, the police arrested all five kidnapers before any ransom was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">Following a joint trial at which Hernandez was the only defendant to testify, the jury found each defendant guilty on all counts. The district court sentenced each defendant to serve between 324-408 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-17\">The defendants argue an array of evidentiary issues. We review a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tion. <em>Sommer v. Davis, </em>317 F.3d 686, 693 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">First, all the defendants argue that the district court improperly restilcted their \u201cright\u201d to cross-examine Rosa Chavez, a government witness, regarding her earlier involvement in her son Juan\u2019s drug trafficking. Specifically, the defendants wished to impeach Rosa\u2019s credibility by introducing into evidence two allegedly conflicting \u201c302 forms,\u201d or summaries of Rosa\u2019s FBI interviews generated by Agent Brett Curtis, containing statements regarding her receiving some of her son\u2019s drug proceeds. In one of the statements, a May 2005 interview, Curtis questioned Rosa about events occurring <em>before </em>the kidnaping, and as to those events, she denied profiting from Juan\u2019s drag sales. Then, in October 2005, Curtis questioned Rosa about events occurring <em>after </em>the kidnaping, and as to those events, she admitted \u201claundering\u201d Juan\u2019s drag money.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution assures defendants the right to confront the witnesses against them, but the right is not absolute. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 678-80, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). The trial judge retains \u201cwide latitude\u201d in imposing limits to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">After allowing defense counsel to question Curtis and Rosa outside the presence of the jury, the district court correctly determined that Rosa\u2019s statements to Curtis in the 302 forms were <em>not </em>inconsistent, one with the other, because Rosa\u2019s statements as recorded in the 302 forms concerned her activity at two different times. Moreover, the district court properly excluded the 302 forms because they consisted of extrinsic evidence of matters collateral to the defendants\u2019 kidnaping cases, which rendered them inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b). The court allowed unrestricted cross-examination of Rosa concerning her knowledge of the kidnaping events and the defendants were allowed to attempt to impeach Rosa\u2019s credibility by inquiring whether she knew that Juan\u2019s money was being derived from drag trafficking; she responded, \u201cYes.\u201d She admitted that she benefited from her son\u2019s drug money, which, according to the defendants, was the \u201ccrux of the argument.\u201d For these reasons, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Rosa\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">The crux of Mendez\u2019s defense was that he was compelled, under duress, to participate in the kidnaping. He now claims that the district court abused its discretion by restricting, on hearsay grounds, the government\u2019s direct examination of Agent Frank O\u2019Neill concerning Mendez\u2019s post-arrest statements. Mendez argues that Mendez\u2019s statements, had the court not excluded them, would have established his then existing state of mind, which in turn tended to prove his duress defense, and should have been admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Inadmissible hearsay includes out-of-court statements used in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted and generally, such statements are inadmissible. Fed.R.Evid. 801, 802. But, under Fed. R.Evid. 803(3), there is an exception for statements that tend to show, circumstantially, the declarant\u2019s \u201c[t]hen existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.\u201d In order to be admissible under Rule 803(3), the statement must have been contemporaneous with the declarant\u2019s experience of the mental, emotional, or physical condition referred to when the declarant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>have \u201can opportunity to reflect and possibly fabricate or misrepresent his thoughts.\u201d <em>United States v. LeMaster, </em>54 F.3d 1224,1231 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The district court correctly determined that Mendez\u2019s statements did not qualify under the Fed.R.Evid. 803(3) exception. Mendez claims that the statements he made to O\u2019Neill two days <em>after </em>the kidnaping suggesting that he acted under duress, reflected his state of mind <em>at the time </em>of the kidnaping. Because Mendez\u2019s statements were not made contemporaneous with the kidnaping, but two days later, and under police interrogation, the district court properly excluded the statements as inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Finally, Hernandez argues that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded his proffered evidence that his father had been kidnaped in Mexico, which, he argues, would have supported his duress defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Hernandez sought to introduce various types of evidence (Hernandez\u2019s testimony and Hernandez\u2019s father\u2019s and sister\u2019s video-taped depositions) to show that his father had been kidnaped and held for ransom in Mexico and that, as a result, Hernandez was \u201cforced\u201d to kidnap Rosa, Eloy, and Estephany in order to get money to pay the ransom demanded by his father\u2019s kidnappers.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We conclude the district court properly excluded the proffered evidence because it was not shown that at the time Hernandez kidnaped <em>his </em>victims, he was aware that his father had been kidnaped. The result is that the proffered testimony by Hernandez\u2019s father and sister regarding the father\u2019s kidnaping was irrelevant and inadmissable. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402 and 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Borrego, Bencomo-Castillo, Hernandez, and Perez also argue that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to declare a mistrial following an alleged <em>Bruton </em>violation. <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. Zu<em>ern v. Tate, </em>336 F.3d 478, 485 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\"><em>Bruton </em>holds that in a joint trial, an out-of-court statement by one defendant incriminating a codefendant is inadmissable as to the codefendant under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620. We have held that \u201cthe introduction of a ... [ defendant\u2019s self-incriminating, extrajudicial statement, in a joint trial, where the [cojdefendant\u2019s name is redacted and a neutral term is substituted,\u201d does not offend <em>Bmton </em>or the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Vasilakos, </em>508 F.3d 401, 408 (6th Cir.2007). Likewise, there is no violation where a district court provides a proper limiting instruction to the jury after the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the codefendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his existence. <em>See Richard</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>son v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 208-09, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The defendants claim a <em>Bruton </em>violation occurred during trial when O\u2019Neill recounted Mendez\u2019s statements during his post-arrest interview, which included several references to \u201cfour other people\u201d and \u201cthe five people\u201d involved in the kidnaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">O\u2019Neill\u2019s references did not facially incriminate the other codefendants. O\u2019Neill mentioned no specific names during his testimony, and the district court immediately provided a limiting instruction to the jury regarding O\u2019Neill\u2019s references to the \u201cothers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The defendants\u2019 remaining assignments of error are manifestly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\"> There is an old argument some evidence law theorists find enthralling, to the effect that at common law, in the right circumstances, an out-of-court statement tending to show the declarant\u2019s then state of mind may be admissible, but not as an \"exception\u201d to the hearsay rule, because such statements are not offered \u201cfor the truth of the matter asserted,\" but <em>only </em>to prove that the statement was made, thus illuminating the declarant's thinking or \u201cstate of mind.\u201d But Fed.R.Evid. 803(3), like the proverbial 800 pound gorilla, precludes such interesting reasoning, by simply pronouncing then existing state-of-mind statements to be an exception to the prohibition against hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
