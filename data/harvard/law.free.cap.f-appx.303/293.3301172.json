Martin seeks review of a decision of the Administrative Review Board (\u201cARB\u201d) of the United States Department of Labor. He asserts that the ARB failed to address his claims under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105 (the \u201cSTAA\u201d). We disagree, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Prior to his termination on January 28, 2002, Martin was a tractor-trailer driver for United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), driving a round-trip route from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Atlanta, Georgia. His route was time-sensitive, requiring final delivery of his payload in Knoxville at 3:45 a.m. each morning. Martin concedes, however, that in the four months immediately preceding his termination, he arrived late for all but one of his deliveries. Martin also concedes that he made unrecorded stops on his route, exceeded allotted meal-break periods, and falsified timecard entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">These infractions led to progressive discipline by UPS. On December 4, 2001, Martin exceeded his meal period by 45 minutes, made a stop at a service station without logging the stop on his timecard, and arrived 90 minutes late in Knoxville. Martin told his supervisor that he was late because he had become \u201csick and it would be unsafe for me to continue on.\u201d Martin told the supervisor that UPS was \u201cin violation of\u2019 the STAA because it \u201cstates that if you feel sick, to pull over, if you feel fatigued or sick, to pull over ... if your life or the lives around you are in danger.\u201d The supervisor told Martin that, because he exceeded his one-hour meal time, UPS would be issuing him a letter of intent to terminate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">Nonetheless, the infractions continued. On December 7, 2001, Martin exceeded his meal period by 23 minutes, made unrecorded stops, and was 90 minutes late. Again, his supervisor confronted him. Martin explained that he \u201chad become very sleepy while driving ... and could not go any further.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-17\">On December 13, 2001, UPS issued a warning letter to Martin for his failure to follow instructions regarding his meal peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ods on December 4 and 7. The letter warned Martin that if he continued to fail to comply with meal-period policies, he would face \u201cfurther disciplinary action up to and including discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Martin did not heed the warning. On December 28, 2001, and again on January 4, 2002, Martin exceeded meal periods, made unrecorded stops, and arrived late. On January 8, 2002, he met with UPS management and a union representative to discuss his delinquency. Martin explained that he had trouble staying awake during his runs. His supervisor told him that UPS intended to terminate his employment for failure to follow instructions regarding his meal periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The next day, UPS sent Martin a \u201cLetter of Intent to Terminate.\u201d Under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between the union and UPS, however, Martin was entitled to continue working for UPS until a formal grievance process ended. He did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Martin\u2019s violations continued still. UPS conducted direct surveillance of Martin on his January 16, 22, and 25 runs, and observed him make several stops at a service station. Martin did not log any of these stops on his timecards.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">For these violations, UPS terminated Martin\u2019s employment on January 28, 2002, and escorted him off its premises. In a January 31, 2002 termination letter, UPS stated that Martin was terminated for just cause under the CBA, for \u201cacts of dishonesty, [and] falsifying [his] timecard[,] which resulted in theft of paid time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Martin filed an STAA complaint on June 4, 2002, alleging that he engaged in STAAprotected activity when he informed his supervisor on December 12, 2001, and January 8, 2002, that he had been unable to timely complete his routes due to fatigue and illness. He alleged that UPS\u2019s subsequent discipline was unlawful retaliation for his STAA complaints.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated and found no violation by UPS. Martin objected, and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the United States Department of Labor. The ALJ issued a Recommended Decision and Order, in which she found that Martin \u201cwas disciplined and discharged for his consistent failure to follow instructions on how he should take and record his required meal period, and for acts of dishonesty,\u201d not in retaliation for his STAA complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Martin appealed to the ARB, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(b) and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.109. The ARB concurred with the findings of the ALJ and denied Martin\u2019s complaint. It found that the ALJ\u2019s finding that \u201cUPS did not discriminate against Martin in violation of the STAA\u201d was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">Martin now petitions this Court for review of the ARB\u2019s final decision and order, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(d) and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.110.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">We review the ARB\u2019s decision under the STAA to \u201cdetermine whether it was supported by substantial evidence, which is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moon v. Transport Drivers, Inc., </em>836 F.2d 226, 229 (6th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Martin does not argue that the ARB\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. Instead, he argues that the ARB failed to address his STAA claims with respect to the December 13, 2001 warning letter and the January 9, 2002 intent-to-discharge letter. He further argues that the ARB should not have reached his claim regarding the January 28, 2002 discharge because \u201cit was not properly before the ALJ or the [ARB].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Martin asserts that the ARB \u201csidestepped\u201d his claims regarding the first two letters by \u201cupholding] the second discharge for alleged dishonesty.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 22-23. Martin argues that \u201cthis case should be remanded to the ARB with instructions to determine whether UPS violated the STAA by issuing the December 13, 2001 and January 9, 2002 disciplinary notices[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We disagree. The ARB unmistakably considered and rejected Martin\u2019s STAA claims with respect to the December 13 and January 9 letters. It wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\"><em>We reject Martin\u2019s contention that </em>\u2018[a]ssuming arguendo [he] was properly discharged for dishonesty, <em>he is still entitled to relief under the STAA for the disciplinary letters issued on December 13, 2001 and January 9, 2002.\u201d </em>The December 13, 2001 Warning Notice addresses Martin\u2019s \u201ccontinuing failure to follow instructions regarding the taking of the contractual meal period.\u201d The January 9, 2002 Intent to Discharge Notice points to his \u201cfailure to take [his] meal periods as instructed\u201d and \u201cadditional violations of the meal policy with the most recent occurrences being December 28, 2001 and January 4, 2002.\u201d Again, Martin\u2019s contention that he was sick on certain dates does not explain his failure to follow UPS\u2019s policy regarding the recording of meal periods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">J.A. 11 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Martin does not argue that this finding was unsupported by substantial evidence. He has therefore waived that argument. <em>Bickel v. Korean Air Lines Co., </em>96 F.3d 151, 153 (6th Cir.1996). In any case, the ARB\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence, including Martin\u2019s undisputed and repeated disciplinary violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Martin\u2019s second argument \u2014 that the ARB erred in addressing his January 28 discharge \u2014 is also meritless. Martin argues that this discharge was \u201cnot properly before the ALJ or the [ARB]\u201d because his STAA \u201ccomplaint did not allege that UPS\u2019 attempt to discharge him on January 28, 2002 was motivated by protected activities.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 12, 18. Martin asserts that \u201c[u]nder the <em>Steelworkers </em>trilogy of Supreme Court decisions, the [ARB] lacked jurisdiction to decide the merits of the January 28, 2002, discharge.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 11 (footnote omitted) (citing <em>United Steelworkers v. American Mfg., </em>363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960); <em>United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960); <em>United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">Those cases are inapposite here. Each addressed the authority of a court to interpret provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, where the parties had agreed to submit those issues to an arbitrator. Martin\u2019s claims did not involve interpretation of the CBA; rather, they were STAA claims, over which the ARB had jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(b). Martin concedes that the ARB had authority to address his second discharge. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r Br. at 18 (\u201cMartin does not dispute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the ALJ and the [ARB] could determine if the January 28, 2002 discharge violated the STAA\u201d). Indeed, though he now claims to the contrary, Martin himself placed that issue before the ARB. He argued there that \u201cthe articulated reason for discharging [him] on January 28, 2002 [was] a pretext for discriminating]\u201d against him for his STAA complaints. J.A. 740. Having presented this challenge to the ARB, Martin cannot now complain that the ARB addressed it. As it did with respect to Martin\u2019s December 13 and January 9 disciplinary notices, the ARB considered and rejected his January 28 STAA claim. That finding too was supported by substantial evidence, including Martin\u2019s undisputed acts of falsification of his time-cards on January 16, 22, and 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the ARB.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-18\">.
