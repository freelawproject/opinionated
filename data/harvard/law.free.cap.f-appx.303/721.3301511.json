Zheng asserts he is entitled to asylum and withholding of removal because he was persecuted in China based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>his violation of China\u2019s family planning policy and his practice of Falun Gong. The Government argues we lack jurisdiction over his asylum claims because the BIA determined Zheng had not filed his application within one year of entering the United States. After review, we conclude we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s conclusion Zheng failed to file his asylum application within one year. We do have jurisdiction to review Zheng\u2019s claim for withholding of removal, however, and because the BIA failed to consider Zheng\u2019s corroborating evidence, we remand for consideration of such evidence in evaluating Zheng\u2019s claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). An alien may apply for asylum if \u201cthe alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An alien may apply for asylum more than one year after arrival if the alien \u201cdemonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d an application was untimely or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the delay. 8 U.S.C. '\u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have held \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination an asylum applicant filed an untimely application and failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">According to the REAL ID Act of 2005, we retain jurisdiction to review legal or constitutional claims. REAL ID Act of 2005, \u00a7 106(a), H.R. 1268, 109th Cong., Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the \u201ctimeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the REAL ID Act\u2019s changes.\u201d <em>Chaconr-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Zheng does not address whether this Court has jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s conclusion his asylum application was untimely. Accordingly, Zheng has abandoned this issue. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 n. 12 (11th Cir.2001) (stating issues not argued in the initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned). Even if Zheng had not abandoned this issue, our jurisdiction would be limited by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) because the timeliness of an asylum application is not a legal or constitutional question. Because the BIA determined Zheng filed his asylum application more than one year after his arrival of the United States, and Zheng did not prove extraordinary circumstances, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision regarding the timeliness of Zheng\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>soning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without adopting it, and we will review the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). However, factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test and \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. Like any finding of fact, a credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, under this standard, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the [BIA]\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an applicant produces evidence beyond his own testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the [BIA] to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Here, Zheng offered several items of evidence to support his application for withholding of removal, including, <em>inter alia, </em>a letter from his wife, two personal statements, his friends\u2019 affidavits, and articles supporting the existence of persecution for violating the family planning policy and practicing Falun Gong. After finding Zheng not credible, the BIA did not mention or evaluate this additional, corroborating evidence offered by Zheng. Because the BIA did not consider this evidence, it committed error. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Accordingly, we remand to the BIA to consider Zheng\u2019s corroborating evidence in evaluating his claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, GRANTED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">.
