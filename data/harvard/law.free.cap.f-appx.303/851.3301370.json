She contends that the district court incorrectly calculated her advisory sentencing guidelines range when it increased her offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) after finding that her offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">On February 19, 2006, the United States Coast Guard learned that a white 30-foot Scorpion \u201cgo-fast\u201d vessel with a black top had departed from Cuba. Coast Guard officers intercepted the boat as it was traveling north toward the Florida Keys. The vessel\u2019s operator initially refused to stop, but the officers succeeded in boarding the boat. They discovered twenty-two Cuban migrants on board, an occupancy level that \u201cgrossly overweighed\u201d the vessel. As a result of the incident, twelve defendants were charged with various alien smuggling conspiracies and offenses. Dimeys Sanchez was among those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">Sanchez pleaded guilty to conspiracy under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(v)(I) for encouraging aliens to come to the United States unlawfully and for attempting to bring aliens to a place in the United States other than a designated port of entry. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(i), (iv). The district court imposed a sentence of 1 year plus 1 day imprisonment followed by 2 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">Sanchez appeals her sentence, contending that the district court improperly calculated her sentencing guidelines range when it applied an enhancement to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). That section provides for an enhancement where the \u201coffense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). Sanchez asserts that the erroneous application of that section led to a sentencing guidelines range of 12-18 months imprisonment. Without that increase, the range would have been 8-14 months imprisonment. She argues the district court erred because: (1) her co-conspirators\u2019 actions caused the substantial risk of death or bodily harm and she should not be held responsible for those actions because they were not reasonably foreseeable; and (2) even if her coconspirators\u2019 actions were reasonably foreeseable, that alone would not justify the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Whether a co-conspirator\u2019s actions were reasonably foreseeable is a question of fact that we review only for clear error. <em>United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2000). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if, after reviewing all of the evidence, we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1136-37 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Whether the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) is a legal question that we review <em>de novo. See United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1353 (11th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[W]hether the district court misapplied the Guidelines remains ... subject to <em>de novo </em>review [after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)\u201d]). Notwithstanding a district court\u2019s error, \u201cwe are not required to vacate the sentence and remand the case if the court would have likely sentenced [the defendant] in the same way without the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-21, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)). Remand is unnecessary if the party defending the sentence shows that the district court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the error. <em>See Williams, </em>503 U.S. at 203, 112 S.Ct. at 1120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Sanchez first argues that the district court erred in imposing the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) enhancement because she was a minor participant in the conspiracy and she could not have reasonably foreseen the actions of her co-defendants that created the \u201csubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Sanchez asserts that she was only a \u201cstrawman\u201d used for the purchase of the vessel. She points out that she did not lead the operation, organize the trip, load the boat, or ride along on the voyage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, she concludes, she was not sufficiently involved in the operation to have reasonably foreseen that her co-conspirators would intentionally or recklessly create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Sanchez also argues that even if the acts of her co-defendants did recklessly create a reasonably foreseeable, substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) enhancement can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>not be based on reasonable foreseeability alone. Instead, she asserts that there must be evidence that she aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced or wilfully caused the other person\u2019s reckless activity. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The statutory maximum sentence for conspiring to smuggle aliens is ten years imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824(a)(l)(B)(i). Section 2L1.1 of the sentencing guidelines provides for the calculation of the offense level for defendants who smuggle, transport, or harbor unlawful aliens. Under that section, \u201cif the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person\u201d the offense level is increased by 2 levels, but if the resulting offense level is less than 18, the offense level is increased to level 18. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6). The commentary to that section provides that \u201creckless conduct\u201d covers a \u201cwide variety of conduct\u201d including \u201ccarrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1 cmt n. 5. \u201cOffense\u201d is defined in the sentencing guidelines as \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under 1B1.3 ... unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(H). Because no \u201cdifferent meaning is specified or ... otherwise clear from the context\u201d \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) provides the definition of relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(H). \u201cRelevant conduct\u201d under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) includes \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of ... jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">As to Sanchez\u2019s first argument, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the actions of her co-conspirators that created the substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury were reasonably foreseeable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sanchez agreed to be involved in a conspiracy to smuggle twenty-two Cuban aliens into the United States. The 30-foot vessel was purchased in Sanchez\u2019s name. She attended a meeting about the smuggling operation where she provided the vessel\u2019s operator with a cover story to use if approached by Coast Guard officers. At that meeting, there was a list of the Cuban aliens to be picked up and a handheld Global Positioning System with the coordinate route entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">The district court, therefore, did not clearly err in finding that it was reasonably foreseeable that the 30-foot vessel purchased under Sanchez\u2019s name would transport twenty-two Cuban migrants to the United States, and that the overcrowding on the vessel would recklessly create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to those on board. The fact that Sanchez\u2019s participation in the operation was not more extensive does not mean that the actions of her coconspirators were not reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">As to Sanchez\u2019s second argument, the district court did not misapply U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). It was not required to find that Sanchez aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced or wilfully caused the specific activity or actions that made her co-conspirator\u2019s conduct reckless. The only Eleventh Circuit authority Sanchez offers in arguing that for this requirement is <em>United States v. Cook, </em>181 F.Bd 1282 (11th Cir.1999), which involved a U.S.S.G \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight. Application note 5 to \u00a7 3C1.2 specifies that a \u201cdefendant is accountable for his own conduct and for conduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.\u201d In Cook, we held that the inclusion of that note altered the definition of \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for that section. <em>Cook, </em>181 F.3d at 1235. In other words, \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of ... jointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d have been defined out of relevant conduct under \u00a7 3C1.2 and its application notes. <em>Id. </em>For that reason <em>Cook </em>is inapplicable and does not support the argument that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Even if we assume that the district court did err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, remand is unnecessary because the district court likely would have imposed the same sentence anyway. <em>See Scott, </em>441 F.3d at 1329. The sentence Sanchez received would still be within the guideline range (8 to 14 months) that would have resulted without applying \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). There is also the fact that the district court initially was going to give Sanchez a sentence of 3 years imprisonment but then decided to lower it to 1 year and a day because of her co-defendant\u2019s lesser sentence. That makes it unlikely that the court would have been inclined to sentence her any lower than the sentence she did receive. Thus, we are persuaded that the district court would have imposed the same sentence even without the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">We conclude that the district court did not err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, and even if it did, remanding the case is unnecessary because we are persuaded that the district court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of that enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\">. She also asserts in her brief that she \u201chad no knowledge nor say in who or how many aliens were involved.\u201d However, during the change of plea hearing before the district court, Sanchez conceded that all of the government\u2019s evidence, including evidence that she agreed to be involved in a conspiracy to smuggle twenty-two Cuban aliens into the United States, was undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\">. Sanchez does not argue that her co-conspirators' actions were not in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">. Although the district court did not make an explicit factual finding about reasonable foreseeability, that finding was implicit in the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6). The district court stated that \u201d[T]he defendant need not have personally engaged in the ... behavior to receive this enhancement. However, it can be attributable to her as relevant conduct if done by others in jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d Here, relevant conduct as applied to jointly undertaken criminal activity requires that a co-defendant\u2019s actions be reasonably foreseeable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(6), 1B1.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
