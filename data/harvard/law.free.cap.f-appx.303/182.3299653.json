Cabello-Chavez\u2019s pro se brief fails entirely to address the BIA\u2019s finding that his motion to reconsider was untimely and instead challenges the BIA\u2019s previous order denying his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination that he was a removable alien and that he was ineligible for relief from removal. Because CabelloChavez fails to address the basis of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider, he has abandoned any argument that challenges that decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Moreover, we do not have jurisdiction to consider Cabello-Chavez\u2019s arguments challenging the BIA\u2019s order denying his appeal. The BIA\u2019s denial of an appeal and its denial of a motion to reconsider are two separate final orders, each of which requires its own petition for review. <em>Stone v. I.N.S., </em>514 U.S. 386, 394,115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). A timely petition for review is a jurisdictional requirement in the absence of which this court lacks jurisdiction to review the decision of the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. I.N.S., </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993). As Cabello-Chavez did not file a petition for review from the BIA\u2019s order denying his appeal, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
