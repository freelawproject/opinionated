BENAVIDES, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Defendant-Appellant Herman Carr pleaded guilty to extortion under color of official right under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). Carr challenges his eighty-seven month sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">On August 29, 2006, the Defendant-Appellant, Herman Carr, was charged by indictment with extortion under color of official right, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). The indictment alleged that Carr obtained $5,000 in exchange for providing protection for a vehicle he believed contained five kilograms of cocaine. Carr entered a plea of guilty to the indictment on November 6, 2006. Carr admitted to the entire factual basis proffered for his guilty plea, which stated in part that while he was employed as a police officer for the city of Elsa, Texas, he accepted payment to escort a vehicle that he believed contained cocaine. On November 20, 2007, the district court sentenced Carr to eighty-seven months in prison followed by a two-year term of supervised release, as well as a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">Applying the 2006 sentencing guidelines, the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated Carr\u2019s total offense level by: (1) starting with an offense level of fourteen pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(a)(l), the guideline applicable to extortion under color of official right; (2) adding two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(b)(l) on the ground that the offense involved more than one bribe or extortion; (3) adding two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(b)(2) for payments that exceeded five thousand dollars; and (4) adding four levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(b)(3) for an offense involving an elected public official or any public official in a high-level decision-making or sensitive position. This calculation resulted in a total offense level of twenty-two. With an offense level of twenty-two and a criminal history of category I, Carr\u2019s guideline range would have been forty-one to fifty-one months.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">However, the PSR then applied a cross reference under USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l), which provides that \u201c[i]f the offense was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another criminal offense, apply the offense guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined\u201d pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2C1.1. Because Carr admitted during his plea colloquy that the extortion was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another criminal offense \u2014 possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute \u2014 the district court applied the cross reference. The district court assigned Carr a base offense level of thirty-two because he had been paid to escort what he believed to be over nine but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846; USSG \u00a7 2D1.1. Following a two-level safety valve reduction, a two-level increase for abuse of position of trust, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the district court determined that Carr\u2019s total offense level was twenty-nine. USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(9), 5C1.2, 3B1.3, 3E1.1. Coupled with Carr\u2019s criminal history of category I, his total offense level of twenty-nine yielded a guidelines range of 87-108 months of imprisonment. The district court, applying the calculation under the cross reference, sentenced Carr at the bottom of the guidelines range to eighty-seven months of imprisonment. Carr timely filed a notice of appeal, raising four issues concerning his sentence. Each of these issues is addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">1. The district court did not err when it applied the cross reference under USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">This Court reviews questions of the interpretation and application of the federal sentencing guidelines de novo and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. GonzalezTerrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Rankin, </em>487 F.3d 229, 231 (5th Cir.2007) (reviewing de novo the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a cross-referencing provision). Carr argues that, because there was no cognizable conspiracy, the district court erred in applying the offense guideline applicable to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine pursuant to the cross reference provision contained in USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l). After hearing arguments by the parties regarding whether the cross reference should apply to the facts in this case, the district court overruled Carr\u2019s objection to the application of the provision and applied the cross reference. We hold that the district court properly applied the cross reference provision because Carr admitted that he committed the extortion offense for the \u201cpurpose of facilitating\u201d the commission of a drug trafficking offense, which is all that is required under USSG \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Section 2Cl.l(c)(l) of the sentencing guidelines provides that: \u201cIf the offense was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another criminal offense, apply the offense guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined [pursuant to \u00a7 2Cl.l(a) and (b) ].\u201d Carr admitted as part of the factual basis for his guilty plea that, while he was employed as a police officer, he accepted payment to escort a vehicle that he believed contained cocaine. In actuality, the vehicle contained no drugs, and, unbeknownst to Carr, the individual who paid him was an FBI informant. No other individuals were involved in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Appellant argues that because, as a matter of law, he could not have conspired with the FBI informant who paid him, the court should not have applied the cross reference. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>239 F.3d 722, 738 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201c[A] government agent cannot be a co-conspirator and ... there can be no conspiracy between one defendant and a government informer.\u201d). However, although the cross reference is to the \u201cguideline applicable to a conspiracy,\u201d it applies not when there has been a conspiracy, but rather when \u201cthe offense was committed for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>pose of facilitating the commission of another criminal offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 201.1(c)(1). Thus, the issue of whether a conspiracy between Carr and the informant was legally impossible does not affect the applicability of the cross reference. By its plain language, \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l) requires only that the primary offense be committed for the \u201cpurpose of facilitating\u201d another offense, leading to the application of the guideline for conspiracy to commit that other offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The only issue, then, is whether the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Carr had committed the extortion offense with the \u201cpurpose of facilitating\u201d a drug trafficking offense. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range.\u201d). Though the phrase \u201cpurpose of facilitating\u201d has never been expressly defined by this Court, Carr\u2019s admission that he was being paid for the purpose of \u201cescorting narcotics through the Elsa jurisdiction\u201d and his belief that the FBI informant, who was posing as a drug trafficker, was transporting a number of kilograms of cocaine, provide sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s application of the cross reference. The commentary accompanying \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l) further supports the conclusion that conspiracy need not be proven to apply the cross reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">Under \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of another criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling of a quantity of cocaine, the guideline for conspiracy to import cocaine would be applied if it resulted in a greater offense level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Offenses involving attempted bribery are frequently not completed because the offense is reported to authorities or an individual involved in the offense is acting in an undercover capacity. Failure to complete the offense does not lessen the defendant\u2019s culpability in attempting to use public position for personal gain. Therefore, solicitations and attempts are treated as equivalent to the underlying offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">USSG \u00a7 2C1.1, cmt., background. The commentary suggests that the purpose of the cross reference is to increase the sentence based on the defendant\u2019s intent to participate in the underlying offense, and contemplates the situation presented here. Thus, because USSG \u00a7 201.1(c)(1) does not by its language or stated purpose require that the elements of conspiracy be established, the court did not err in applying the provision to Carr\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">2. The district court did not err in applying the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust under USSG \u00a7 3B1.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">In determining Carr\u2019s offense level under the cross reference provision set forth in \u00a7 201.1(c), the district court applied a two-level increase pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.3, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">If the defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels. This adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in the base offense level or specific offense characteristic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Carr argues that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.3 constitutes impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d because the base offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>levels set forth in \u00a7 201.1(a), the guideline for extortion (the offense of conviction), already take abuse of trust into account. This Court reviews the question of whether \u00a7 3B1.3 was properly applied in Carr\u2019s case de novo. <em>Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d at 296. This Court has previously addressed whether the abuse of trust enhancement is applicable to a sentence determined by a cross reference pursuant to \u00a7 2Cl.l(c). <em>United States v. Partida, </em>385 F.3d 546, 567 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Partida, </em>the defendant\u2019s sentence was calculated via the cross reference enhancement under the guideline for extortion under color of right, because his extortion offense was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a drug trafficking offense. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>Partida, </em>the upward adjustment was applied to the base offense level for the drug offense, not to the base offense level for the extortion offense. <em>Partida, </em>385 F.3d at 567. This Court noted that unlike the base offense levels for the extortion offense, the base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 do not take a position of trust into account. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, this Court found the district court\u2019s enhancement of the sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.3\u2019s abuse of trust provision was not in error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Carr notes that the <em>Partida </em>decision was determined under the 2002 sentencing guidelines, which contained express language in the commentary to \u00a7 2C1.1 carving out an exception to the prohibition against applying \u00a7 3B1.3 in cases where the \u00a7 2C1.1(c)(1) cross reference applied. The commentary provided: \u201cDo not apply \u00a7 3B1.3 ... except where the offense level is determined under \u00a7 2Cl.l(e)(l), (2), or (3).\u201d USSG \u00a7 2C1.1 cmt. n. 6 (2003); <em>see also Partida, </em>385 F.3d at 567 (relying upon commentary language). However, as part of a 2004 amendment to \u00a7 2C1.1, the language expressly noting the allowance of the application of \u00a7 3B1.3 in \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l) cross reference cases was excised from the commentary notes. The commentary to \u00a7 2C1.1 now reads: \u201cDo not apply \u00a7 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\u201d USSG \u00a7 2C1.1, cmt. n. 6 (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The excision of this language does not warrant a different result than that reached in <em>Partida. </em>Carr\u2019s base offense level was not calculated pursuant to \u00a7 201.1(a), the guideline applicable to the offense of conviction \u2014 extortion under col- or of official right. The district court applied the cross reference and sentenced Carr under the guideline applicable to conspiracy to possess cocaine, \u00a7 2D1.1. The base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 does not take into account abuse of trust, and the prohibition against the use of \u00a7 3B1.3 thus does not apply. The rules of interpretation in the sentencing guidelines confirm this result. Section IB 1.5 of the sentencing guidelines, entitled \u201cInterpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines,\u201d states that \u201c[i]f the offense level is determined by a reference to another guideline\u201d pursuant to a cross reference, \u201cthe adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) also are determined in respect to the referenced offense guideline, except as otherwise expressly provided.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.5(c). The abuse of trust adjustment, must therefore, in the case of a cross reference, be applied with respect to the referenced offense, here the conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>to possess cocaine, \u00a7 2D1.1. Because the commentary in \u00a7 2C1.1 is inapplicable with regard to adjustments once the offense level is determined pursuant to the cross-referenced guideline, and because the base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 does not take into account abuse of trust, the district court correctly applied the enhancement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">3. Any potential error in the application of \u00a7 201.1(b)(3) is harmless in light of the district court\u2019s proper application of the cross reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Carr argues that, in the event that this Court determines that the \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l) cross reference does not apply in the instant case, this Court should hold that the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement for an offense involving a public official in a sensitive position to \u00a7 201.1(b)(3). The four-level enhancement was applied only to the first PSR calculation, under the guidelines applicable to the extortion offense, which was not the calculation utilized by the district court in determining Carr\u2019s sentence. As the government correctly points out, the enhancement under \u00a7 2Cl.l(b)(3) was not applied to, and does not affect, the sentence imposed pursuant to the cross-referenced provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we hold that the district court did not err in applying the cross reference and sentencing Carr under \u00a7 2D1.1, the issue of whether \u00a7 2Cl.l(b)(3) was correctly applied to Carr\u2019s potential sentence under \u00a7 2Cl.l(a) need not be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">4. The district court imposed a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Carr contends as his last point of error that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the changes to the federal sentencing regime wrought by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Because Carr did not argue before the district court that this Circuits\u2019s precedent impermissibly restricted the court\u2019s discretion in sentencing, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d 381, 387-88 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">In <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>this Court recognized that certain \u201copinions have arguably supported the view, rejected in <em>Gall, </em>that we may, at least in certain instances, require district courts to find extraordinary circumstances before\u201d deviating from the sentencing guidelines. 530 F.3d at 388. However, this Court went on to hold that where there was no indication the district court felt in any way limited in the alternatives it desired to consider by this Court\u2019s sentencing jurisprudence, or in any way disagreed with the guidelines or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>felt that a sentence within the guideline range was too harsh, or had any inclination to impose a lesser sentence than it did, affirming a within-guidelines sentence \u201cwould not seriously adversely affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.; United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals should correct a plain forfeited error affecting substantial rights if the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d) (internal citation omitted). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">As in <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court believed it could not deviate from the guidelines absent extraordinary circumstances or otherwise felt constrained to impose a sentence within the guidelines; that the court thought that the guidelines were too harsh; or that the court was in any way inclined to deviate below the guidelines range. The district court stated with regard to the appropriateness of Carr\u2019s sentence that \u201cthe only question I would have is whether the sentence is sufficient. I know it\u2019s not more than necessary.\u201d Thus, like the defendant in <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>Carr has not shown any plain error. Because there was no plain error, and the sentence imposed was within a properly calculated guidelines range, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed on Carr by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b191-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">. This calculation added the amount of drugs Carr believed he was escorting in the charged offense, which occurred in August 2006, to an amount of drugs from uncharged conduct that occurred in March 2006 to reach the range of nine to fifteen kilograms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-5\">. Indeed, even in the absence of the express commentary, the base offense level for the extortion offense under \u00a7 2Cl. 1(a) provides for a two-level increase to the defendant's base offense level, from twelve to fourteen, in cases where the defendant is a public official, thus exempting the offense from the application of the abuse of trust enhancement under the express language contained in the enhancement itself. USSG \u00a7 3B1.3 (\u201cThis adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in the base offense level....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">. The commentary to the cross referencing provision under the extortion sentencing guideline, \u00a7 2C 1.1(c), supports this interpretation by noting that enhancements such as the abuse of trust enhancement are applied with regard to the cross-referenced offense, and subsequently compared with the offense level determined under the offense of conviction, in order to determine which offense results in a greater offense level. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2C1.1, cmt., n. 5 (\"For the purposes of determining whether to apply the cross references in this section, the \u201cresulting offense level\u201d means the final offense level (i.e., the offense level determined by taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts A-D.\")).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-18\">. The total offense level under the first calculation was used in determining whether to apply the cross reference, because the cross reference can only be applied when the cross-referenced provision results in a greater total offense level. However, the resulting offense level calculated under the drug guidelines was greater than the extortion adjusted offense level, regardless of whether the court applied the four-level increase for a public official in a sensitive position to the extortion offense level.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
