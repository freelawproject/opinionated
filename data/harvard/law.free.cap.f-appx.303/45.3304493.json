Koeltl, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Defendant-Appellant Tranel McCoy was convicted by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Kravitz, J.) of one count of conspiracy to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846; one count of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B); one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B); and one count of possession of a firearm in furtheranee of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). On appeal, McCoy argues that (1) there is insufficient evidence to sustain the firearm possession conviction and (2) evidence obtained from the apartment where McCoy was arrested should have been suppressed because the affiants to the warrant application intentionally omitted material information. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a claim of insufficient evidence. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>301 F.3d 59, 64 (2d Cir.2002). \u201cA defendant challenging the sufficiency of trial evidence bears a heavy burden, and the reviewing court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Gagliardi, </em>506 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Giovanelli, </em>464 F.3d 346, 349 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam)). We will affirm a jury verdict unless \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149-50 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">In order to convict under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), the government must prove that the defendant (1) possessed a firearm (2) in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <em>See United States v. Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 203 (2d Cir.2001). We conclude that a rational fact-finder could find both elements satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">\u201cPossession of a firearm may be established by showing that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u2018knowingly [had] the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id, </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>918 F.2d 369, 373 (2d Cir.1990)). This may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Payton, </em>159 F.3d 49, 56 (2d Cir.1998). The firearm at issue here was found in the drawer of an \u201centertainment-style cabinet\u201d in the master bedroom of the apartment, a bedroom shared by McCoy and his wife. The firearm contained a magazine loaded with ammunition. The cabinet also contained \u201ca pretty large amount of crack cocaine,\u201d \u201ca glass style plate which had a razor blade and an amount of ... cocaine or rock cocaine residue on it,\u201d a \u201cBaggie containing several individual bags of marijuana,\u201d some \u201cpackaging material\u201d and \u201ca scale.\u201d When police located the crack cocaine during the execution of the search warrant, McCoy\u2019s spouse became \u201cverbally upset,\u201d and Detective Farrell testified that he heard McCoy say something to the effect of \u201c[d]on\u2019t worry, they know it\u2019s mine, they know you had nothing to do with it,\u201d which he repeated over and over. Further, a black pouch located under the bed in the master bedroom contained $1700 and a credit card. There was evidence of a matching credit card receipt listing the name Freddy McCoy and the address of the searched apartment. There were also \u201cother documents in the residence\u201d that indicated the name Freddy McCoy and the address of the searched apartment. Finally, although McCoy asked John Ball, who was also present when the search warrant was executed, to take responsibility for the firearm, McCoy never suggested that Ball take responsibility for the drugs in the master bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">This evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that McCoy exercised \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the drugs and drug-related materials in the master bedroom, as well as the firearm located in the same cabinet. <em>Finley, </em>245 F.3d at 203. The jury was free to credit the testimony of Ball to the effect that the firearm did not belong to him and to reject the testimony of McCoy\u2019s stepdaughter and son suggesting the contrary. <em>See Payton, </em>159 F.3d at 56 (2d Cir.1998) (stating, with respect to an \u201calternative explanation\u201d for a firearm, that the \u201cjury heard this version of events and was free to assign whatever weight it \u25a0wished to the defense witnesses\u2019 credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">There was also sufficient evidence for a rational jury to \u201cfind beyond a reasonable doubt that possession of the firearm facilitated [McCoy\u2019s] drug trafficking crime ...; [that is,] afforded some advantage (actual or potential, real or contingent) relevant\u201d to the offense. <em>United States v. Lender, </em>402 F.3d 319, 322 (2d Cir.2005). The proximity of the firearm to drug-related contraband seized in the master bedroom \u2014 particularly in light of McCoy\u2019s admission that the crack cocaine belonged to him \u2014 supported the jury\u2019s finding that the gun was used to facilitate drug trafficking. There was additional evidence that the firearm\u2019s safety was off, and that the magazine was loaded with hollow point bullets, which provide greater protection than normal bullets; there was in addition expert testimony that firearms are commonly used for protection in the drug trade. <em>See United States v. Snow, </em>462 F.3d 55, 63 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cFrom the proximity between the handguns, proceeds, trace amounts of drugs, and drug paraphernalia, a reasonable juror could conclude that the person to be protected was a drug dealer and drug packaging paraphernalia, and the proceeds of drug trafficking were among the things being protected.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Lewter, </em>402 F.3d at 323 (\u201cIn this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>case, the person to be protected was a drug dealer, and among the things being protected were a saleable quantity of drugs, drug packaging paraphernalia, and the proceeds of drug trafficking.\u201d); <em>United States v. </em>Garner; 388 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.2003) (\u201cWhen guns and drugs are found together and a defendant has been convicted of possession with intent to distribute, the gun, whether kept for protection from robbery of drug-sale proceeds, or to enforce payment for drugs, may reasonably be considered to be possessed \u2018in furtherance of an ongoing drug-trafficking crime.\u201d). This evidence was sufficient to permit a rational fact-finder to conclude that the weapon was possessed in furtherance of drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">II. Validity of the Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Under the doctrine of <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 164-72, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), McCoy contends that there were \u201cintentional and material misrepresentations or omissions\u201d in the warrant application for the search of the apartment, thereby \u201cundermin[ing] the validity of the warrant and the resulting search or seizure.\u201d <em>United States v. Awadallah, </em>349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cA misrepresentation or omission is intentional when the claimed inaccuracies or omissions are the result of the affiant\u2019s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth. It is material when the alleged falsehoods or omissions were necessary to the [issuing] judge\u2019s probable cause finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64-65 (internal quotation marks omitted). When gauging materiality, \u201c[t]he ultimate inquiry is whether, after putting aside erroneous information and material omissions, there remains a residue of independent and lawful information sufficient to support probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65 (internal quotation marks omitted). While we review \u201c[w]hether the untainted portions [of the affidavit] suffice to support a probable cause finding\u201d <em>de novo, </em>the issue of \u201c[w]hether a person acted deliberately or recklessly is a factual question of intent that we review only for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">McCoy raises the following alleged omission: that in the early morning of December 13, 2005, the same day the warrant application was presented to a Connecticut Superior Court Judge, the confidential informant used to conduct controlled drug purchases at the apartment building was arrested for, and admitted to, the illegal possession of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gov. App. 19, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">This argument is without merit. First, the district court specifically credited the testimony of detectives Salkeld and Farrell that they were unaware of the informant\u2019s arrest until after the execution of the search warrant. Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. I. 10. The district court also noted their testimony that the informant had provided reliable information in the past, that they were unaware of the informant providing any false information, and that the informant was warned he could be prosecuted for providing false information. <em>Id. </em>10-11. McCoy\u2019s bare assertion that the detectives\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>testimony \u201cis just not credible when the officers have been running the informant for more than six months,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 17, absent citation to any evidence, is not sufficient to disturb the district court\u2019s factual finding to the contrary as clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Second, the alleged omission would not vitiate the Superior Court Judge\u2019s finding of probable cause in the circumstances of this case. The informant had provided reliable information in the past that lead to arrests and the seizure of drugs and other illegal substances. Moreover, the affiants to the search warrant affidavit conducted two controlled drug purchases at the apartment building with the confidential informant. The informant was checked for narcotics, contraband, and money before each purchase, and after exiting the apartment building, was observed until his arrival at a predetermined location, where he was searched again. Gov.App. 32-33. Both December 7, 2005 and December 12, 2005, the informant delivered a substance testing positive for the presence of narcotics to the affiants after visiting the apartment building. <em>Id. </em>Although the affiants relied on the credibility of the informant in that they could not personally observe him conduct the purchase in the second floor apartment at issue (as opposed to the first floor apartment or a hallway), his story was independently corroborated by (1) the affiants\u2019 observation of a pattern of visitors to the building consistent with narcotics related activity, <em>id. </em>32, and (2) the fact that the informant had secured narcotics from inside the building. The above evidence provides sufficient corroboration so as to constitute a \u201cresidue of independent and lawful information sufficient to support probable cause.\u201d <em>Awadallah, </em>349 F.3d at 65 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the alleged omission here does not undermine the validity of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">For the foregoing reasons, McCoy\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">. It was also disclosed that in January 2006, <em>after </em>the warrant was executed on December 20, 2005, the confidential informant provided false information about a prospective purchase and attempted to steal money from the agents handling him. Suppression Hr\u2019g Tr. 8-9; Gov.App. 43 n. 1. McCoy does not dispute on appeal that these events transpired after the warrant issued in this case, vaguely asserting that \u201cit became known that the informant had lied to law enforcement officials and had stolen money from an Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 16. This subsequent information could not have been intentionally or recklessly omitted from the warrant application, and thus provides no basis for a <em>Franks </em>challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
