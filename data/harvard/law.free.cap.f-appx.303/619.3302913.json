McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b643-21\">Petitioner seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition as an unauthorized \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petition. Respondents have filed a letter conceding that the instant petition was not a second or successive petition because the prior habeas petition, while raising similar claims, originated from a different conviction. <em>See Hardeman v. Quarterman, </em>516 F.3d 272, 275-76 (5th Cir.2008) (holding that \u201c \u2018to be considered \u201csuccessive,\u201d a prisoner\u2019s second petition must, in a broad sense, represent a second attack by federal habeas petition on the same conviction\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Vasquez v. Par</em>rott, 318 F.3d 387, 390 (2d Cir.2003)). Therefore, construing Petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate brief as an implied motion for leave to file a successive petition, <em>see Pease v. Klinger, </em>115 F.3d 763, 764 (10th Cir.1997), we dismiss the motion as unnecessary and direct the district court to entertain Petitioner\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
