California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cortez has filed a response. This court is not able to resolve on direct appeal Cortez\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the Government breached the plea agreement because the record is lacking in factual predicate concerning the existence of any subsidiary promise. <em>See United States v. Corbett, </em>742 F.2d 173, 175-76 (5th Cir.1984). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Cortez\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b205-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
