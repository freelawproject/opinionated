Mar. 5, 2008), aff'g No. A97 957 386 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 21, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-24\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99,110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">As a preliminary matter, because Lin\u2019s brief to this Court does not sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 545 n. 8 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We find that the agency properly denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum because he failed to establish a nexus to a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). Lin argues that the agency erred in making this finding, contending that his refusal to pay what he considered to be unreasonable parking and education fees constituted an expression of political opinion for which he was detained, beaten, and deprived of his livelihood. That argument, however, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We have held that punishment for violation of a generally applicable law is not persecution. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). Likewise, \u201cmere subjection to [a generally applicable] policy or practice will not itself qualify as persecution \u2018on account of political opinion.\u201d <em>Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 545. Although Lin claims that he \u201cstood up [to] the unjust fees (taxes) the same way as the members of the Boston Tea Party did,\u201d he does not indicate that he took any action to demonstrate his opposition to the government policy beyond arguing with officials about his own subjection to the policy. Lin argues further that the local cadres deprived him of his livelihood by denying his work authorization when he refused to pay an education fee. He testified he should not have been required to pay the fee because he had already paid it earlier in the year. He conceded, however, that he had lost his receipt and was unable to prove to the local government that he had paid the fee. Based on Lin\u2019s testimony the IJ properly found that Lin was merely subjected to a law of general applicability to \u201cpeople conducting business in China.\u201d <em>See </em>JA at 51 (Oral Decision); <em>Saleh, </em>962 F.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Lin has not provided evidence to establish that a \u201ccentral reason\u201d for his detention and beating was his actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). The agency\u2019s denial of his asylum application was proper. <em>See id. </em>Further, because Lin failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal, which has a higher burden of proof. <em>See Tian-Yong Chen v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>359 F.3d 121,127 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
