Stephens was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 43 months, which is within the Guidelines range for an offense level of 21. In his plea agreement, Stephens agreed to waive his right to appeal such a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-23\">Stephens argues that the waiver of the right to appeal should be invalidated, as failure to grant him a downward departure results in a miscarriage of justice due to his exceptional circumstances. The miscarriage of justice exception is to be applied sparingly after consideration of the clarity, gravity, and character of the-error, the error\u2019s impact on the parties, and the extent of the defendant\u2019s acquiescence. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>429 F.3d 455, 458 (3d Cir.2005) (citation omitted). There is nothing extraordinary or exceptional about Stephens\u2019s claims of extenuating circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>stances as to his youth, first felony offense, cooperation, lack of education, mental and physical state, community ties, and family responsibilities. In any case, the sentencing court heard and considered all such claims, and it is unlikely any error was committed. Thus, this is not an appropriate case for invalidating a waiver of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s appeal will be dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-17\">. This matter did not proceed on the basis of the government's Motion for Summary Action, as such motion was filed some months after the government first entered a notice of appearance. By that time, various activities in the case had taken place, including the filing of appellant\u2019s brief. This case is not a model for efficiently obtaining a dismissal of appeal based on a waiver. Accordingly, we reject the government\u2019s request for a precedential opinion setting forth what that model should be.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
