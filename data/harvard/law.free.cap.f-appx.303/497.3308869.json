INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-31\">We have reviewed the opposition to the motion to dismiss in part this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction, and we conclude that petitioner has failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss in part this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">To the extent petitioner raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to remand on this ground because petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was previously addressed by the BIA\u2019s February 24, 2005 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b521-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
