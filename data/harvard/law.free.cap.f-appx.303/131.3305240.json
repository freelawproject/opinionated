For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Wiggins filed a complaint against his union, United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local # 56 (\u201cthe Union\u201d); the union\u2019s president, Anthony R. Cinaglia; the union\u2019s business representative, Jack Swift; his employer, Heinz North America; and its plant manager, William H. McNeece. Wiggins claimed that defendants violated his rights under sections 101(a)(1), 101(a)(2), and 501 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (\u201cLMRDA\u201d) [29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 411(a)(1), 411(a)(2), and 501]. Wiggins claimed his rights were violated when the union held a meeting and the majority of union members present voted for a two-year extension to the union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with Heinz. Wiggins, who did not attend the meeting, claimed he did not receive adequate notice. He filed a claim with the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) on May 17, 2002. In a July 25, 2002 decision, the NLRB refused to issue a complaint against the union, and the NLRB\u2019s office of the General Counsel denied Wiggins\u2019 appeal on October 31, 2002. Wiggins filed his federal complaint on August 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The District Court held that Wiggins\u2019 complaint was untimely, and further held that his claims were barred by his failure to exhaust internal union remedies and, in the alternative, that the claims were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">We agree that even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Wiggins\u2019 complaint was timely, and that exhaustion of union remedies was not required, his complaint lacks merit. Wiggins complained that he was denied his right to vote on the two-year extension of the CBA. However, Wiggins had no statutory right to vote on the extension, and no such right was provided in the constitution, bylaws or rules and regulations of the union. <em>Confederated Independent Unions v. Rockwell-Standard Co., </em>465 F.2d 1137, 1140 (3d Cir.1972). Therefore, Wiggins\u2019 claims that his equal rights were violated or that he was not allowed to express his views and opinions are irrelevant. Further, Wiggins cannot show that he was discriminated against in any manner, as the meeting notice was posted, all union members were welcome to attend, and he was not prevented from attending the meeting in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">In his opening brief, Wiggins did not address his claims of breach of fiduciary duty under LMRDA \u00a7 501, nor the District Court\u2019s holding that an employee may not state a cause of action under sections 101(a)(1), 101(a)(2) and 501 against his employers. Those issues are therefore waived. <em>F.D.I.C. v. Deglau, </em>207 F.3d 153, 169-70 (3d Cir.2000). We further find no record support for Wiggins\u2019 claim that Appellees perpetrated a fraud on the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
