Campos argues that his sentence, which was within the recommended guidelines range, was unreasonable because the district court did not adequately explain the basis for imposing the within-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-24\">Campos did not challenge the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentence imposed in the district court. Accordingly, his argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir. 2000). Campos thus must demonstrate that (1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear or obvious; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If these conditions are met, this court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>exercise its discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s sentencing decision, this court must first determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court commits a procedural error if it miscalculates or fails to calculate the proper guidelines range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its chosen sentence or any deviation from the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Rita v. United States </em>stated that a sentencing judge \u201cwill normally\u201d explain why he has rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments, the Court did not mandate that a sentencing court state reasons for rejecting a defendant\u2019s specific arguments for a lower sentence. 551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A sentencing judge is required only to \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Campos has not shown that the district court plainly erred by failing to sufficiently state its reasons for sentencing. The district court\u2019s adoption of the presentence report and its consideration of Campos\u2019s arguments for a downward departure and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining his within-guidelines sentence constituted sufficient reasons for imposing his sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468-69; <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
