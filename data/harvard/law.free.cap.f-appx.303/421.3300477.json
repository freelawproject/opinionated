The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect this status.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-32\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>We review the BIA\u2019s ruling on a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(2). Because this is petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen, filed well beyond the 90-day deadline, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted in part because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">As to petitioner\u2019s request to the BIA for sua sponte reopening, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision to deny sua sponte reopening of petitioner\u2019s case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the petition for review is dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b445-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
