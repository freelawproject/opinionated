Elstein, denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Aleksander Hametaj, </em>No. A95 862 364 (B.I.A. Apr. 28, 2008), <em>affg </em>No. A95 862 364 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jun. 12, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). However, when the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in some respects but not others, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA\u2019s decision, <em>i. e. </em>minus the arguments for denying relief that were rejected by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA\u2019s decision focused on the IJ\u2019s alternate finding of changed country conditions, making it unclear whether the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. Thus, we dispose the petition for review on burden of proof grounds, assuming Hametaj\u2019s credibility for purposes of our decision. <em>See Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99,110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that country conditions in Albania have changed sufficiently such that Hametaj no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i). Hametaj argues that the IJ failed to conduct an \u201cindividualized analysis\u201d of how any change in country conditions would affect his particular situation. That argument fails as it ignores our statement in <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>that the agency need not enter specific findings supporting a changed country conditions determination where the agency is aware of \u201cthe salient historical events and conditions of countries that are the subject of an appreciable proportion of asylum claims,\u201d such as Albania. 468 F.3d 179, 186-87 (2d Cir.2006). Regardless, the agency provided a reasoned basis for its finding where it observed that \u201cthe Democratic Party had gained control of Albania\u2019s government in 2005,\u201d and that \u201cthe record reflected that a smooth transition of power had occurred.\u201d Hametaj does not point to any evidence compelling a conclusion contrary to that of the agency. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution was rebutted. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A); <em>Manzur, </em>494 F.3d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Because Hametaj was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal where that claim relied on the same factual predicate. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(A); <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Finally, because Hametaj failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim before the BIA or this Court, we deem any such argument abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
