The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect this status.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-23\">We review the BIA\u2019s ruling on a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-24\">An alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was filed beyond the 90-day deadline, and petitioner has not contended that any exceptions to this time limit apply, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition of this petition for review in part is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-25\">In addition, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review in part is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-26\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b517-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
