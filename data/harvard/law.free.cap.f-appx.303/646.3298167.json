Following an unsuccessful direct appeal, he filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the federal district court. The petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">Williams now appeals. We issued a certificate of appealability to consider whether Williams\u2019 trial counsel was ineffective for not pursuing a defense that the victim was sixteen years old at the time of the proposal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-18\">In 2004, Williams was charged with three counts of lewd molestation of S.J., his step-daughter; one count of making a lewd and indecent proposal in 2000 to K.J., his friend\u2019s daughter; and one count of indecent exposure toward K.J. in 2002. Williams was acquitted on the molestation and exposure counts. But he was convicted, as mentioned above, on the lewd-and-indecent-proposal count. That count was premised on Williams asking K.J., in a lewd and lascivious manner, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it feel so good to have sex with me[?]\u201d R., Vol. 2 at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-19\">At trial, K.J. testified that Williams began commenting on her appearance in the summer of 2000, when she was fifteen-and-a-half years old. He would say that she was \u201creally pretty\u201d and had big \u201cboobs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Id., </em>Vol. 5 at 834, 835. Williams\u2019 behavior soon escalated. When K.J. was inside Williams\u2019 house one day doing \u201cbilling ... for [his] hardware store,\u201d he \u201cgrabbed [her] arm\u201d and kissed her. <em>Id. </em>at 836. On a subsequent occasion, again when K.J. was in the home doing billing work, Williams forced her onto a bed, attempted to rub and kiss her, and asked, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it feel good to have sex with me?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838. K.J. began \u201cscreaming and kicking,\u201d and when Williams \u201cfinally let [her] go,\u201d she ran home. <em>Id. </em>She kept the incident to herself for some time, however, because she \u201cdidn\u2019t think anyone would really listen to [her] and [she] didn\u2019t want to put [the] families through all of this.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844 \u2014 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">On cross-examination, Williams\u2019 counsel attempted to undermine KJ.\u2019s accusations by, among other things, suggesting that if she had screamed, she would have been heard by Williams\u2019 son, whom she was dating. Specifically, defense counsel noted that K. J. had provided a written statement to Sheriffs Investigator Brian Layton, in which she claimed that around the time of incident, Williams\u2019 son \u201cwas in the garage working on his truck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863 (quotation marks omitted). Defense counsel then elicited from K.J. that Williams\u2019 son did not come inside after she screamed. <em>Id. </em>at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Williams\u2019 defense, identified initially during opening remarks, was that he was merely asking K.J. whether it would \u201cbe better to wait until [she was] older to have sex?\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. 2 at 158. Williams later testified in support of that defense, explaining that he had a \u201cfather-daughter relationship\u201d with K.J., and that he was attempting to discourage her from \u201chaving sex at such a young age\u201d when she was seeing his son. <em>Id., </em>Vol. 7 at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The jury found Williams guilty, and he was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA), Williams argued, among other things, that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because he failed to pursue a defense that K.J. was over sixteen years old when Williams made the proposal. The ineffectiveness was premised on the fact that the garage was not built until after K.J. had turned sixteen in October 2000. Consequently, Williams could not have been guilty of making a lewd proposal to a child under sixteen if Williams\u2019 son was, as K. J. asserted, in the garage when the proposal occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Williams moved for an evidentiary hearing and to supplement the appellate record. He submitted documents concerning the garage\u2019s construction and affidavits indicating that, during trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of K.J., Williams alerted his counsel to the discrepancy about the garage. Specifically, in his affidavit, Williams claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqp\">I told my trial attorney ..., \u201cThat\u2019s not right. I don\u2019t even know if the garage was there. I don\u2019t think [my son] was in the garage because there was no garage at that time.\u201d After I told [my attorney] those statements, he just shrugged his shoulders, made a motion with his hands to silence and told me, \u201c[W]e\u2019re not going there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-10\"><em>Id., </em>Vol. 9 at 1900.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The OCCA affirmed Williams\u2019 conviction, denying his motion and rejecting his ineffective-counsel argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">[Williams] claims this evidence [of the garage\u2019s construction date] would have shown it was factually impossible for him to have propositioned [K.J.] during the time frame she testified to. Yet at trial, [Williams] admitted having a conversation of a sexual nature with [K.J.] during that time frame; he simply recalled the exact wording of his state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ments a bit differently. Trial counsel\u2019s strategic decisions are entitled to considerable deference, and [Williams] has not raised a strong possibility that counsel\u2019s decision here undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Williams next petitioned the federal district court for habeas relief, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">I. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a writ of habeas corpus will not be granted unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claim (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the United States Supreme Court; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). Williams bases his request for habeas relief on the first AEDPA prong, arguing that \u201c[t]he OCCA\u2019s decision was contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of\u2019 <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Aplt. Br. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"A_U\"><em>Strickland </em>mandates a two-pronged standard for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. There must be both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To show prejudice, the defendant must establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Williams argues that the OCCA resolved his ineffective-assistance argument using a standard contrary to <em>Strickland. </em>The OCCA defined <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>\u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result as requiring a <em>\u201cstrong possibility </em>that counsel\u2019s [performance] ... undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial,\u201d R., Vol. 9 at 1940 (emphasis added), rather than a <em>\u201cprobability </em>sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added). We need not decide whether \u201cstrong possibility\u201d is the quantum of probability the Supreme Court had in mind when it expressed prejudice in terms of undermining confidence in the trial\u2019s outcome. The OCCA\u2019s determination that Williams failed to establish deficient performance dooms his ineffective-assistance claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">In reviewing trial counsel\u2019s performance, we \u201cmust be highly deferential\u201d and we \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (quotation omitted). Our deference is substantial under AEDPA because the OCCA applied this principle. <em>See Parker v. Scott, </em>394 F.3d 1302, 1320 (10th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we may grant habeas relief only if the OCCA \u201cunreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts of [Williams\u2019] case.\u201d <em>See Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>128 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quotation omitted). In other words, the OCCA\u2019s decision \u201cmust have been more than incorrect or erroneous[,] ... [it] must have been objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520-21, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Trial strategy involves whether to raise a particular defense. <em>Anderson v. Attorney Gen. of Kan., </em>425 F.3d 853, 859 (10th Cir.2005). Williams argues that the defense concerning the garage\u2019s construction date should have been raised at the start of trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or at the latest, during K.J.\u2019s cross-examination. A defense involving the garage\u2019s construction date, however, could have signaled to the jury that Williams was not contesting that he propositioned K.J. for sex, and that he instead was simply claiming it was not illegal. If the jury developed such a view of the defense, it might have been more inclined to find Williams guilty on the molestation and exposure counts. Further, success with the garage defense would have been questionable, because the jury could simply have viewed K.J.\u2019s recollection of the garage\u2019s existence as a minor error of memory, given that the incident with Williams occurred several years before she mentioned the garage to Investigator Lay-ton. And if the defense had been raised during KJ.\u2019s cross-examination, there would have been the additional negative consequence of contradicting the earlier-announced defense strategy, which was that Williams was simply counseling K.J. about sexual activity, rather than propositioning her.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Given the risks inherent in the garage defense, the OCCA did not unreasonably resolve Williams\u2019 <em>Strickland </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.

This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir.
