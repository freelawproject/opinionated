After a jury trial, Penton was found guilty and the court sentenced him to five years\u2019 probation with five months of home confinement, a $7500 fine and a $300 special assessment. On appeal, Defendant argues that (1) the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal for the insufficiency of the evidence in general and specifically with reference to Count 3 of the indictment; (2) the district court erred in refusing to give Defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction on his theory of the defense; and (3) the Government\u2019s improper closing argument deprived Defendant of his due process right to a fail' trial. After a thorough review, we find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-24\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b800-25\">The indictment charged Defendant with three counts of trafficking and attempting to traffic in counterfeit goods \u2014 cigars\u2014on October 5, 2005. Count 1 of the indictment alleges trafficking of Cuban Cigar Brands, N.V. (\u201cCCB\u201d) marks, Count 2 of Max Rohr marks, and Count 3 of General Cigar Co. marks. Three other counts were dropped by the Government at trial and are not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-26\">CCB is a corporation of the Netherlands Antilles with its principal place of business in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. CCB owns the United States trademarks for the following brands and associated artwork: Monte Cristo, H. Upmann, and Por Larra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>naga. Max Rohr is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Delaware. Max Rohr owns the United States trademarks for Romeo y Julieta and Trinidad. Altadis U.S.A. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Altadis U.S.A. is the exclusive licensee of CCB and Max Rohr.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">General Cigar Co. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, New York. General Cigar owns the United States trademarks for Coh\u00edba, Partagas, Flor de Tabacos de Partagas YCA, Hoyo de Monterrey, Hoyo de Monterrey de Jose Gener Excalibur, Bolivar Simon Bolivar, Simon Bolivar the Liberator, Punch Elite, Punch Punch, Punch Gran Fabrica de Tabacos Punch, and de J. Valley ca Manuel Lopez Habana.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The police investigation of Penton began when Altadis U.S.A. provided information to the Miami-Dade County police that enabled them to send an undercover officer to Defendant\u2019s shop. In a sting that occurred on October 5, 2005, Defendant sold to the officer and a confidential informant sixty boxes of cigars: fifteen boxes of Coh\u00edba Esplendidos, ten boxes of Montecristo Number 2, ten boxes of Romeo y Julieta Churchill, ten boxes of Partagas Lusitania, ten boxes of Hoyo de Monterrey Coronas, and five boxes of Hoyo de Monterrey Pyramid. The boxes contained a combination of trademarked terms and artwork as well as the words \u201cHabana,\u201d \u201cHabana, Cuba,\u201d \u201cHabanos SA,\u201d and \u201cHecho en Cuba.\u201d The boxes were sealed with fabricated Cuban seals and contained fake Cuban government guarantees in the boxes. \u201cHabana\u201d was also printed on the cigar rings. DE150, at 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Erie Workman, Altadis U.S.A.\u2019s vice-president of marketing and national accounts, testified at trial. He identified trademarked names and artwork for Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, Trinidad, H. Upmann, and Por Larranaga. DE150, at 67-82. Mr. Workman published to the jury genuine cigar boxes, cigars, and cigar rings for these brands. <em>Id. </em>He also testified that the boxes sold by Defendant were not sold with Altadis U.S.A.\u2019s authorization. <em>Id. </em>at 83-85, 91. Mr. Workman testified that he understood Defendant\u2019s boxes referenced Cuba, but that it was not unusual for genuine cigar manufacturers to reference Cuba in their packaging. DE150, at 91-99. Cooper Gardiner, vice president of marketing for General Cigar Co., provided similar testimony for the brands Partagas, Punch, Hoyo de Monterrey, Bolivar, and Coh\u00edba. Genuine boxes, cigars, and cigar rings for these brands were published to the jury. DE152, at 50-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Defendant\u2019s witness, Gary Arzt, an investor, business consultant, and avid cigar smoker, also testified that most consumers do not see the outside of a cigar box and simply ask 'for a brand name, such as Montecristo, without specifying whether it is the Cuban variety or variety sold in the United States. DE156, at 94-95. On cross-examination, Mr. Arzt testified that the artwork and trademark on Defendant\u2019s Romeo y Julieta cigar box was not substantially different from Altadis U.S.A.\u2019s Romeo y Julieta product. <em>Id. </em>at 110-11. Mr. Arzt testified the same concerning Defendant\u2019s Partagas artwork and that trademarked by General Cigar in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Defendant testified at trial that he was imitating the Cuban brands which were not protected in the United States. DE116, at 13-15. He said he did not think it was a crime to sell boxes of replica \u201cCuban\u201d cigars. <em>Id. </em>at 15. He testified that he had never sold full boxes before the sting sale and his business was selling empty \u201cCuban\u201d trademarked boxes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>were replicas of what he had in Cuba as a child before the Revolution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">Both at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case and his defense, Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant argued that there was no evidence in the record that the Coh\u00edba Esplendido and the Partagas Lusitania cigar brands were \u201cin use\u201d in the United States, as required by the statute. DE156, at 77-79. Defendant also contended that the evidence showed that there were \u201cparallel\u201d marks in the United States and Cuba and that Defendant\u2019s cigar boxes did not imitate the United States marks, but rather the Cuban marks which are not protected in the United States under the structure of the Helms-Burton statute. As such, Defendant\u2019s conduct did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2820(a). <em>Id. </em>at 80; DE158, at 36. With respect to Defendant\u2019s \u201cin use\u201d argument on the Coh\u00edba Esplendido and the Partagas Lusitania cigars, the district court noted that in addition to those brands, Count 3 also encompassed the Hoyo de Monterrey brand for which there was testimony of \u201cuse\u201d in the United States. Therefore, the court denied Defendant\u2019s motion on that basis but noted that it might eventually have implications for sentencing. DE156, at 79. The court also denied Defendant\u2019s motion on his Cuban imitation theory. <em>Id. </em>at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal and the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction <em>de novo </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 992 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhether the government proved the jurisdictional element [of a statute] is measured as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Key, </em>76 F.3d 350, 353 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Defendant contends that his conviction violates the expanded Helms-Burton Act because it equates to the Government granting protection to Cuban marks. He also asserts that the Government did not offer proof that the marks were \u201cin use\u201d or that their use would result in consumer confusion. We note initially that Defendant did not raise his consumer confusion argument at trial, on his motions for acquittal, or at any length in his initial appellate brief. We need not determine whether Defendant waived this issue, however, because even considering Defendant\u2019s argument, the Government presented sufficient evidence of consumer confusion at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">To understand the context of Defendant\u2019s arguments, some background on the Cuban revolution and eventual embargo imposed by the United States is helpful. <em>See generally Empresa Cubana del Tabaco v. Culbro Corp., </em>399 F.3d 462 (2d Cir.2005), and 213 F.Supp.2d 247 (S.D.N.Y.2002). Fidel Castro took control of the Cuban government on January 1, 1959. <em>Culbro, </em>213 F.Supp.2d at 256. The Castro regime nationalized cigar manufacturers on September 15, 1960. <em>Id. </em>Some of the owners of the appropriated companies fled to the United States and other countries and reopened their businesses \u201cusing the trademarks their families had owned before the government seizure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The United States imposed an embargo on Cuba in 1963. <em>Culbro, </em>399 F.3d at 465. The terms of the embargo were set forth in regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury. <em>Id. </em>Those regulations were eventually codified by Congress in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>1996 in the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (\u201cLIBERTAD Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104^114, Title I, \u00a7 102, 110 Stat. 792 (1996) (codified at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6032(h)), also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The embargo regulations prevent Cuban cigar companies from selling cigars in the United States. <em>Id. </em>As initially promulgated, however, the embargo did not prevent tobacco companies controlled by the Cuban government from registering trademarks in the United States. <em>See Culbro, </em>213 F.Supp.2d at 256; <em>Empresa Cubana Exportadora de Alimentos y Productos Varios v. United States Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>516 F.Supp.2d 43, 47 (D.D.C.2007). In a series of litigation in the 1960s and 1970s, however, U.S. courts determined that the fleeing families had obtained common law rights to the trademarks prior to the nationalizations. <em>Culbro, </em>213 F.Supp.2d at 256. As the rights of the individual owners had been clarified, some families began selling trademark registrations to U.S. cigar manufacturers. <em>Id. </em>at 256-57. Thus, the notion of \u201cparallel brands\u201d developed. That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">the Cuban government sells a Cuban cigar in Cuba and other parts of the world under the same apparent trademark as an unrelated company that sells a non-Cuban cigar in the U.S. It is not the same trademark, however, as the U.S. cigars are sold under trademarks which the owners had registered and used in the United States for the sale of their cigars prior to the expropriation of the Cuban cigar companies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The Helms-Burton Act was further amended in 1999 to expand its coverage to intellectual property rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 211 of the amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">(a) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no transaction or payment shall be authorized or approved pursuant to section 515.527 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on September 9, 1998, with respect to a mark, trade name, or commercial name that is the same as or substantially similar to a mark, trade name, or commercial name that was used in connection with a business or assets that were confiscated unless the original owner of the mark, trade name, or commercial name, or the bona fide successor-in-interest has expressly consented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-11\">(2) No U.S. court shall recognize, enforce or otherwise validate any assertion of rights by a designated national based on common law rights or registration obtained under such section 515.527 of such a confiscated mark, trade name, or commercial name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-12\">(b) No U.S. court shall recognize, enforce or otherwise validate any assertion of treaty rights by a designated national or its successor-in-interest under sections 44(b) or (e) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(b) or (e)) for a mark, trade name, or commercial name that is the same as or substantially similar to a mark, trade name, or commercial name that was used in connection with a business or assets that were confiscated unless the original owner of such mark, trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>name, or commercial name, or the bona fide successor-in-interest has expressly consented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><em>Id. </em>The import of this legislation is to prohibit Cuban companies from registering \u201cappropriated\u201d trademarks in the United States without permission of the original owner. U.S. courts are also prohibited from recognizing any such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Defendant\u2019s theory of the case is that his cigar box replicas were copies of Cuban cigars and trademarks, not those of Altadis and General Cigar Co. Because Cuban marks are not entitled to any protection in the United States, Defendant argues, he cannot have committed a crime by copying Cuban trademarked material. The problem for Defendant is that we have already rejected his defense in a similar case. In <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>293 F.3d 1279 (11th Cir.2002), three defendants were indicted for trafficking in counterfeit cigars. Guerra also defended against the charges arguing that his products were meant to copy the Cuban marks and not the United States marks. <em>Id. </em>at 1287. In affirming Guerra\u2019s conviction under the terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(d), we determined that \u201cit is irrelevant that Guerra did not know the marks were registered in the United States, or thought the marks were only unprotectable Cuban marks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on <em>Grmrra, </em>therefore, Defendant\u2019s theory of Cuban counterfeiting is not available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">We reject Defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Guerra </em>is no longer good law because it was issued prior to the 1998 amendment of the Helms-Burton Act which purportedly established the idea of the \u201cparallel marks.\u201d Defendant\u2019s argument with respect to \u201cparallel marks\u201d is premised in his belief that under the Helms-Burton Act, parallel marks are not entitled to protection in the United States. We find, however, that this is not an accurate statement of the law. The Helms-Burton Act provides that no transactions or enforcement of rights of Cuban trademarks can occur under United States law. For this reason, the district court properly instructed the jury that Cuban marks are entitled to no protection in United States courts. This limitation, however, is not extended to a trademark that is properly registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office by a company incorporated outside of Cuba. The mere fact that the trademarks used by Altadis and the other victims in this case are \u201cparallel\u201d to marks used by Cuban companies for Cuban cigars marketed outside the United States does not mean that the U.S. marks registered by U.S. companies are not protected. Here, testimony at trial demonstrated that the original owners sold their rights to various companies, including Altadis U.S.A. and Cuban Cigar Co. More significantly, however, there is nothing in the Helms-Burton Act which indicates it would apply to a federal criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Next, Defendant argues to us \u2014 as he did in the district court \u2014 that his motion for acquittal on sufficiency of the evidence should at least have been granted on Count 3 because the evidence showed that Coh\u00edba Esplendidos and Partagas Lusitania cigars are not sold in the United States and therefore could not be \u201cin use\u201d under the terms of \u00a7 2320. Title 18 Section 2320(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-9\">Whoever; intentionally traffics or attempts to traffic in goods or services and knowingly uses a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services, or intentionally traffics or attempts to traffic in labels, patches, stickers, wrappers, badges, emblems, medallions, charms, boxes, containers, cans, cases, hangtags, documentation, or packaging of any type or nature, knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>that a counterfeit mark has been applied thereto, the use of which is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive, shall, if an individual, be fined not more than $2,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACYO\"><em>Id. See also </em>\u00a7 2320(e)(l)(A)(ii) (mark must be \u201cidentical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a mark registered on the principal register in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in use\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">As the district court recognized, Defendant correctly states the law as to these two types of cigars; however, Count 3 also charged Defendant with counterfeiting the Hoyo de Monterrey cigar also produced by General Cigar Co. Because evidence was presented as to the Hoyo de Monterrey cigars, the jury was still entitled to reach a verdict on Count 3 with any question of the number of cigars impacted going to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Finally, Defendant asserted at oral argument that the Government did not present sufficient evidence with respect to whether the use was likely \u201cto cause confusion.\u201d We note that Defendant did not raise this argument to the district court at trial, although the district court carefully considered the Government\u2019s burden of proof on this statutory element. <em>See, e.g., </em>DE152, at 68-71 (district court discussing what type of testimony would be required to demonstrate confusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Significantly, during the trial, all parties agreed, based on our prior precedent, that it is not necessary to show proof of confusion through the testimony of consumers or experts or the admission of surveys. <em>See United States v. Torkington, </em>812 F.2d 1347 (11th Cir.1987). In <em>Torkington, </em>the defendant was charged with two counts of violating the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984, the same statute at issue in the instant matter. The district court held that \u00a7 2320(d)(1)(A) required a showing that direct purchasers would be likely confused, mistaken or deceived by the allegedly counterfeit goods. <em>Id. </em>at 1349. Because there was an enormous price differential between the counterfeit Rolex watches offered by the defendant and authentic Rolex watches, the district court held as a matter of law that it was unlikely that direct purchasers would be confused.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">We rejected this conclusion and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqt\">section 2320(d)(1)(A) does not require a showing that direct purchasers would be confused, mistaken or deceived; rather, the section is satisfied where it is shown that members of the purchasing public would be likely to be confused, mistaken or deceived. Moreover, we find that this likely confusion test includes the likelihood of confusion in a post-sale context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-9\"><em>Id. </em>We further noted that it was a jury question as to whether a direct purchaser would be confused, mistaken or deceived. <em>Id. </em>at 1353 n. 8. Thus, we reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment against the defendant by noting that in addition to the indictment that set forth each element of the crime, \u201cthe district court had before it evidence that the allegedly counterfeit watches are externally identical to authentic Rolex watches and bear both the name \u2018Rolex\u2019 and the Rolex crown trademark emblem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1354. Several of our sister circuits have reached the same conclusion. <em>See also United States v. Foote, </em>413 F.3d 1240 (10th Cir. 2005) (extending application beyond direct purchasers); <em>United States v. Hon, </em>904 F.2d 803 (2d Cir.1990) (same); <em>United States v. Yamin, </em>868 F.2d 130 (5th Cir. 1989) (same); <em>United States v. Gantos, </em>817 F.2d 41 (8th Cir.1987) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Furthermore, we reiterated in <em>Guerra </em>that it was not necessary for a trademark holder to testify before the jury or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>agent who conducted the investigation be qualified as an expert in a particular type of product. 293 F.3d 1279 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cIn this case, the jury had been shown registered designs of the trademarks for each cigar, as well as various cigar labels or bands produced by authorized licensees. The jury therefore had a valid basis for comparison in determining whether the designs were \u2018identical or substantially identical.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Here, Defendant was able to assert to the jury \u2014 through his own testimony, and Mr. Artz\u2019s, as well as the arguments of his counsel \u2014 that he was merely mimicking Cuban cigar brands. This activity was not illegal, Defendant averred to the jury, because Cuban trademarks do not receive protection in the United States. The Government argued to the jury that Defendant\u2019s cigar boxes were not replicas of Cuban brands, but rather were confusingly similar to trademarks and artwork registered by U.S. corporations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Numerous witnesses testified about the appearance of the boxes and the jury had the boxes in the jury room. According to its verdict, the jury ultimately concluded that Defendant\u2019s cigar boxes were likely to cause confusion with the American brands. Defendant does not \u2014 and cannot argue\u2014 that the jury\u2019s conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">We review the district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>532 F.3d 1279, 1289 (11th Cir. 2008). A refusal to give a requested instruction is an abuse of discretion if: (1) the requested instruction is correct, (2) the court did not address the substance of the instruction in the charge, and (3) the failure to give the instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">During the charge conference, the parties debated whether it was necessary for the court to instruct the jury on the Cuban embargo as well as \u201cparallel marks.\u201d The court ultimately gave the jury the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">Title 18 United States Code, Section 2320(a) makes it a Federal crime or offense for anyone to traffic in counterfeit goods or services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-10\">For you to find the Defendant guilty of these crimes alleged in Counts 1 to 3, you must be convinced that the government has proved on the date alleged in each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-11\"><em>First: </em>That the Defendant trafficked, or attempted to traffic, in goods, that is cigars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-12\"><em>Second: </em>That such trafficking, or attempt to traffic, was intentional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-13\"><em>Third: </em>That the Defendant knowingly used a counterfeit mark on, or in connection with, those goods; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-14\"><em>Fourth: </em>That the use of the counterfeit marks was likely to confuse the purchasing public to cause mistake, or to deceive. The likely confusion test includes the likelihood of confusion in a post-sale context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-15\">The term \u201ctraffic\u201d means to transport, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, to another, for common commercial advantage or financial gain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-16\"><em>See </em>DE95, at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">The court instructed the jury on \u201cCounterfeit Mark\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-18\">A \u201cmark\u201d is a word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, used to identify and distinguish goods and to indicate their source. A mark used on or in the sale of goods is known as a trademark. A certificate of registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>from the United States Patent and Trademark Office is initial evidence of the validity of the registered mark, of the ownership of the mark, and of the owner\u2019s exclusive right to use the registered mark. That is, such a certificate is sufficient proof of the existence of a valid registered mark unless outweighed by other evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">A mark need not be absolutely identical to be considered counterfeit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">A \u201ccounterfeit mark\u201d is a mark that is spurious, or not genuine or authentic and is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a mark in use and registered for those same goods or services on the principal register in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In order for the mark on the goods at issue to be genuine, it must be placed there by the legitimate owner of the mark or with the owner\u2019s authorization. The genuine mark must not only be federally registered, but must also be in actual use at the time of the defendant\u2019s use of that mark. Finally, a counterfeit mark is a mark the use of which is likely to confuse the purchasing public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">For you to find that the genuine marks were \u201cin use,\u201d the Government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the genuine marks were actually being used during the period of the offense by the genuine mark holder on or in connection with the goods or services for which the genuine marks are registered. Evidence of such use may, but need not, include testimony that the mark appears on every good; advertisement depicting the mark and its goods or services; or legal action to enforce trademark rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-13\"><em>See id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">The court described \u201cCuban marks\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbQ\">United States trademark law does not protect Cuban trademarks. However the law prohibits actions that deceive consumers and impact a producer\u2019s goodwill through the deceptive and misleading use of protected marks. The Government has the burden to prove that the use of the counterfeit of the protected marks is likely to confuse the purchasing public. The Government also has to prove that the defendant intentionally dealt in goods and knowingly used a counterfeit of a protected mark in connection with those goods. The government does not have to prove that the defendant knew the law. What the government must prove is that he intentionally trafficked in goods knowing that the goods are counterfeit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-15\"><em>See id. </em>at 11. At Defendant\u2019s request, the court specifically agreed to add the word \u201cprotected\u201d throughout the \u201cCuban marks\u201d instruction. At the charge conference, Defendant conceded that the court\u2019s addition of the word \u201cprotected\u201d mooted his request for a charge on the Cuban embargo. <em>See </em>DE158, at 131-34.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>cause of this concession before the district court, we do not consider any arguments made by Defendant with respect to the Cuban embargo instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to give his proffered instruction on \u201cparallel marks.\u201d Defendant\u2019s argument with respect to \u201cparallel marks\u201d is premised in his belief that under the Helms-Burton Act, parallel marks are not entitled to protection in the United States. We found above, however, that this is not an accurate statement of the law. The mere fact that the trademarks used by Altadis and the other victims in this case are \u201cparallel\u201d to marks used by Cuban companies for Cuban cigars marketed outside the United States does not mean that the U.S. marks registered by U.S. companies are not protected. Once this defense theory is recognized and rejected, the issue of jury instructions is more readily analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The court denied Defendant\u2019s requested instruction on \u201cparallel marks\u201d which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A89\">The defendant contends that the alleged counterfeit marks are parallel marks and that the packaging of cigars in [sic] inherently distinctive and identified the cigars as Cuban cigars with Cuban marks. The defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alleged counterfeit marks are parallel marks. Preponderance of the evidence means that you must be persuaded by the evidence that it is more probably true than not true that the counterfeit marks are parallel marks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">If you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the counterfeit mark is distinguished from the United States protected trademark, you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-9\"><em>See </em>DE103.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">The court did offer, however, to give an instruction directly from the case Defendant <em>cited </em>\u2014 Culbro, 213 F.Supp.2d 247\u2014 which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">\u201cparallel brands\u201d developed, i.e., the Cuban government sells a Cuban cigar in Cuba and other parts of the world under the same apparent trademark as an unrelated company that sells a non-Cuban cigar in the U.S. It is not the same trademark, however, as the U.S. cigars are sold under trademarks which the owners had registered and used in the United States for the sale of their cigars prior to the expropriation of the Cuban cigar companies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 256-57 (emphasis added). Defendant, however, would only agree to that instruction if the court did <em>not </em>read the portion in bold. <em>See </em>DE158, at 114-16. The court refused to give a partial definition but offered to Defendant that the court would consider any other definition of \u201cparallel marks\u201d that Defendant could locate. <em>Id. </em>at 115-34. Defendant did not provide any.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">As we have discussed above, there is no dispute that the concept of parallel marks exists. However, the fact that marks can be described as \u201cparallel\u201d does not mean that the marks registered in the United States by U.S. companies are not due any protection. The Government elicited testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>mony at trial that the marks used by Altadis and General Cigar Co. were traced to those used by the individual families that left Cuba and came to the United States after the Cuban government nationalized the cigar industry. DE152, at 4-5, 38-39. We disagree with Defendant\u2019s assertion that because one of the American companies holding the trademarks is a subsidiary of a corporation partially owned by the Cuban government, the American company would not be entitled to trademark protection under Helms-Burton. Further, the instructions given by the district court made it clear that Cuban trademarks are not protected in the United States. Thus, the jury was only comparing Defendant\u2019s cigar boxes to the American trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We conclude that Defendant\u2019s proffered \u201cparallel marks\u201d instruction was not a complete statement of the law because it omitted a portion of the statement made by the district court in <em>Culbro. </em>Further, we find that Defendant was adequately able to argue his theory of defense to the jury without a \u201cparallel mark\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">C. Prosecutorial Misconduct/Closing Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">\u201cIn reviewing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, \u2018we must assess (1) whether the challenged comments were improper; and (2) if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>279 Fed.Appx. 950, 951-52 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (quoting <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1177 (11th Cir. 2006)). As Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the comments at trial, the standard of review is <em>de novo. United States v. Bailey, </em>123 F.3d 1381, 1400 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Eekhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">In its initial closing, the Government argued that although Defendant used boxes and labels designed to look like \u201cCuban\u201d cigars, the names, symbols, and artwork Defendant used were identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the U.S. trademarks. Defendant\u2019s attorney argued in his closing that copying Cuban cigars and marks was not a crime because Cuba had no rights in the United States.. Defendant\u2019s attorney also implied that Altadis U.S.A. was a puppet of the Cuban government and that the Cuban government was behind Altadis U.S.A.\u2019s registration of marks in the United States and behind the prosecution of Defendant. Specifically, Defendant\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-10\">This is not about U.S. trademarks. Let me tell you how you know that. You have to analyze, look at the big picture .... What is the big picture here? The big picture is easy. These guys are the little puppets of Altadis. Who is Altadis? Altadis is fifty percent business partner of the Cuban Government. What were they looking for? They were trying to figure out a way around U.S. laws to figure out how they could protect Cuban trademarks. That\u2019s really what this is all about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-11\"><em>See </em>DE151, at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">In its rebuttal closing, the Government responded to defense counsel\u2019s assertions that Defendant did not commit a crime because Cuba had no rights in the United States. The Government argued that if Defendant\u2019s interpretation were correct, if a country such as Cuba or Venezuela decided to copy a McDonald\u2019s trademark, then anyone in the United States could open a McDonald\u2019s (without authorization from the company) by contending it was legal to do so because he was just copying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the Cuban or Venezuelan McDonald\u2019s and not the U.S. McDonald\u2019s. In response to defense counsel\u2019s comments about Altadis U.S.A., the Government stated that the case was not about the Cuban embargo and that the jury would be receiving no instructions on the Cuban embargo. Rather, the jury was only to determine whether Defendant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(a). Specifically, Mr. Gilfarb, the prosecutor, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">I think Burger King used to have the phrase, have it your way. The defendant cannot have it his way. He can\u2019t have it his way because the argument is that if Cuba or any other nation decides to ignore our laws about what is protected then anyone here in the United States can copy that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">MR. HERRERA: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-6\">THE COURT: Grounds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">MR. HERRERA: Inconsistent with the law and facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">THE COURT: Overruled. What the lawyers say is not the law nor is it the facts. It\u2019s what they think the facts are. And the law I will give you the law. You will decide what the facts are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">MR. GILFARB: Now Cuba decides it\u2019s going to have a McDonalds\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">MR. HERRERA: Objection, Golden</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\">Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">MR. GILFARB: Then somebody in Hialeah says I am going to have a McDonalds too, so it\u2019s the Cuban McDonalds. Then you have Hugo Chavez who decides he wants a Mc-Donalds in Venezuela\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-14\">MR. HERRERA: Objection. This is Golden Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-15\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-16\">MR. GILFARB: How long will that go on before U.S. trademark law means nothing. That is the defendant having it his way. U.S. law would mean nothing in the end. This defendant stole what Castro couldn\u2019t. Reached into the United States and stole what Castro could not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-18\">Stole from these expatriates their reputations and their names. That Altadis, S.A., the parent company to one of the victims, only one of the victims \u2014 by the way, if you decide to for some reason ignore Altadis as the victim what is the defense to General Cigar that Altadis, S.A. is violating the embargo because it\u2019s a Spanish corporation not subject to the jurisdiction here that has a subsidiary company that is victim to a company that violates the embargo? Despite that the U.S. Government granted them protection, the protection of the Patent and Trademark Office. That doesn\u2019t make sense. Just because a company that does business here has a parent that does business with Cuba that violates the embargo. There is not going to be an embargo instruction. You will be instructed on the law relevant to this case. There\u2019s no embargo instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-19\"><em>See </em>DE151, at 20-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-20\">We do not find the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to be improper. Throughout the trial, Defendant\u2019s counsel referred to the situation in Cuba and accused the Government of siding with Fidel Castro and protecting Cuban trademarks. He also repeatedly argued that the Government was going after the \u201clittle guy\u201d and protecting companies owned by the Cuban government. The Government\u2019s comments were in direct response to Defendant\u2019s assertion that a guilty verdict would be tantamount to supporting the Cuban government.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-21\">Even if we did find the comments to be improper, we would not find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant. Upon objection of defense counsel, the district court reminded the jury that the comments of the lawyers reflect neither the law nor the facts. Both the Government and Defendant were able to press their theories to the jury. The Government argued that Defendant was copying the trademarks of U.S. companies; Defendant argued he was copying Cuban trademarks which are not afforded protection in the United States. With this issue squarely presented to the jury, nothing in the rebuttal argument of the Government prejudiced Defendant\u2019s right to have the jury consider his theory of the evidence. We do not find there is a reasonable probability that but for these remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">For the above-stated reasons, we AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">.
