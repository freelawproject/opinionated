In the present case, the Court of Appeal interpreted <em>Ingersoll </em>to require advance publicity as a <em>prerequisite </em>to the constitutional validity of a sobriety checkpoint. As we shall explain, however, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints in <em>Michigan State Police Dept. </em>v. <em>Sitz </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 444 [110 L.Ed.2d 412, 110 S.Ct. 2481] (hereafter <em>Sitz), </em>decided three years after our <em>Ingersoll </em>decision, establishes that advance publicity is not a constitutional prerequisite to the operation of such a checkpoint. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Defendant Mary Louise Banks was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol on November 18, 1990, after being stopped at a sobriety checkpoint located on Pacific Coast Highway at the intersection of First Street in the City of Seal Beach. The checkpoint was operated by law enforcement officials of the Seal Beach, Cypress, La Palma, and Los Alamitos police departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">A complaint thereafter was filed in municipal court charging defendant with violations of Vehicle Code former section 23152, subdivisions (a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>(b), and other vehicular offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant entered a plea of not guilty and moved, pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5, to suppress evidence (obtained at the sobriety checkpoint) establishing her alcohol-related impairment. Her motion, challenging the lawfulness of the sobriety checkpoint under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, maintained that the checkpoint did not conform to the guidelines set forth in <em>Ingersoll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">At the hearing on the motion, the following evidence was adduced. The location of the sobriety checkpoint, on a heavily congested roadway, was chosen by supervisory law enforcement officials. The officers at the checkpoint were instructed to select the first four vehicles from every ten vehicles that approached the checkpoint between 10:10 p.m. and 12:15 a.m., and the first four vehicles from every six vehicles thereafter until 2:30 a.m., for the purpose of questioning the occupants. Prior to establishment of the checkpoint, the law enforcement officers operating it were briefed as to the manner in which the checkpoint was to be marked clearly and conspicuously. The officers used highway flares, cones, stop signs, overhead white lights, traffic barricades mounted with flashing lights, and a truck marked with arrows to identify the checkpoint and to divert motor vehicles safely away from the flow of traffic. Drivers approaching the checkpoint were confronted with a sign that read \u201cSobriety Checkpoint Ahead.\u201d Officers were instructed not to pursue motorists who turned their vehicles away before reaching the checkpoint. Numerous uniformed officers and marked police vehicles were visible at the checkpoint. Officers were instructed to detain approaching vehicles only for such time as was necessary to question the driver briefly and look for signs of intoxication. In the event such signs were found, the driver was asked to exit from his or her vehicle so that a law enforcement official could administer a field sobriety examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">At the hearing, defendant testified that she did not observe highway flares, a flashing arrow, or a sign indicating the presence of a sobriety checkpoint, and that she drove through the checkpoint (until she was asked to stop, as she was exiting from it) because she believed someone was \u201cmaking a movie.\u201d The municipal court found defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the warnings at the checkpoint to be less credible than that furnished by law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>Although one of the police officers testified that he previously had participated in the operation of sobriety checkpoints, and that the establishment of these prior checkpoints had been preceded by publicity, the prosecution did not adduce any evidence specifically demonstrating that the establishment of this particular sobriety checkpoint was preceded by advance publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the municipal court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, ruling that advance publicity was not a prerequisite to the constitutional validity of a sobriety checkpoint and that the checkpoint otherwise complied with the standards set forth in <em>Ingersoll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Following the municipal court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress, defendant pled guilty, received a suspended sentence, and was placed on informal probation pending disposition of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">In the appellate department of the superior court, defendant reiterated her contention that advance publicity was required in order to establish a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint. Rather than decide the issue, the appellate department certified defendant\u2019s case to the Court of Appeal, which ordered transfer of the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 62(a), 63(a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal thereafter reversed the judgment of the municipal court, resting its decision on twin premises: (1) that under our decision in <em>Ingersoll, </em>advance publicity is a \u201crequirement\u201d of a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint, and (2) because the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. 444, upheld a sobriety checkpoint program that provided for advance publicity (and that otherwise was similar to the program discussed in <em>Ingersoll), </em>precheckpoint publicity is necessary if a checkpoint is to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">We granted the People\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Pursuant to article I, section 28, of the California Constitution, a trial court may exclude evidence under Penal Code section 1538.5 only if exclusion is mandated by the federal Constitution. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 896 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].) Thus, exclusion of the evidence obtained at the sobriety checkpoint, supporting the charge that defendant was under the influence of alcohol while driving her vehicle, was proper only if that evidence was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">That amendment provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . . .\u201d (U.S. Const., Amend. IV.)  State and local law enforcement officials are subject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment based upon the operation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (M<em>app </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643 [6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 84 A.L.R.2d 933]; <em>Wolfv. Colorado </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 25, 27-28 [93 L.Ed. 1782, 1785-1786, 69 S.Ct. 1359].)  The detention incident to the operation of sobriety \u201ccheckpoints\u201d (which, for purposes of our analysis, we consider indistinguishable from sobriety \u201croadblocks\u201d) constitutes a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. 444, 450 [110 L.Ed.2d 412, 420].)  The purpose of the Fourth Amendment prohibition is to \u201csafeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d <em>(Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 523, 528 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 935, 87 S.Ct. 1727]; see also <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 648, 653-654 [59 L.Ed.2d 660, 667-668, 99 S.Ct. 1391].) Thus, the narrow question presented in the present case is whether the detention involved in a sobriety checkpoint, established without advance publicity, constitutes a \u201creasonable\u201d seizure and thus complies with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">The People contend this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ingersoll </em>does not require advance publicity, which we identified as one of eight <em>factors </em>to be examined in determining whether a sobriety checkpoint satisfies the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment. In the People\u2019s view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number><em>Ingersoll </em>contemplates a <em>balancing </em>of all relevant factors in determining the constitutionality of a sobriety checkpoint. The People further contend that, because the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sitz </em>relied upon a balancing test identical to that employed in <em>Ingersoll, Sitz </em>is corroborative of Ingersoll's analysis and therefore lends no support to defendant\u2019s argument. Finally, the People argue that because <em>Sitz, </em>in evaluating the intrusiveness of a sobriety checkpoint, focused solely upon the nature of the detention, that decision implicitly rejects the notion that advance publicity is necessary if the constitutionality of a sobriety checkpoint is to be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Defendant contends <em>Ingersoll </em>and <em>Sitz each </em>establish advance publicity as a <em>requirement </em>of a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint. Defendant also relies upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [270 Cal.Rptr. 597] (a decision rendered by the Appellate Department of the San Francisco Superior Court after <em>Ingersoll, </em>but prior to <em>Sitz), </em>which affirmed a motion to suppress evidence on the ground the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence of advance publicity for the sobriety checkpoint\u2014publicity that the court characterized as \u201cessential.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 4.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">As we shall explain, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that such publicity is necessary to the operation of a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint. Although our decision in <em>Ingersoll </em>did not determine explicitly whether each of the safeguards discussed in that opinion was essential to the constitutional validity of a sobriety checkpoint, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Sitz </em>demonstrates that advance publicity is not a constitutionally required prerequisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">A. <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Palmer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">In <em>Ingersoll, </em>we examined the question whether sobriety checkpoints are permissible under the United States and California Constitutions. The case involved a challenge brought by California taxpayers against various law enforcement officials and cited, as an example, a sobriety checkpoint program established by the Burlingame Police Department. As part of that program, law enforcement officials prepared a manual governing checkpoint operations, including guidelines established by the Attorney General, a cost analysis, factors affecting selection of the checkpoint location, required personnel and equipment, training, press relations and publicity, and procedures for a follow-up evaluation. The Burlingame sobriety checkpoint operated pursuant to these guidelines. <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1325-1327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>In examining the challenge presented in <em>Ingersoll, </em>we held: \u201cThe touchstone for all issues under the Fourth Amendment and article I, section 13 of the California Constitution is reasonableness. (See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>[1968] 392 U.S. 1, 19 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 904, 88 S.Ct. 1868]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hyde </em>[1974] 12 Cal.3d 158, 166 [115 Cal.Rptr. 358, 524 P.2d 830], cone. opn. [of Wright, C. J.] at pp. 172-173.) [\u00b6] The federal test for determining whether a detention or seizure is justified balances the public interest served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest and the severity of the interference with individual liberty. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 47, 50-51 [61 L.Ed.2d 357, 361-362, 99 S.Ct. 2637].) In addition, federal constitutional principles require a showing of <em>either </em>the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred or is occurring <em>or, </em>as an alternative, that the seizure is \u2018carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.\u2019 <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>443 U.S. at p. 51 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 362], citing <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse </em>(1979) 440 U.S. 648, 663 [59 L.Ed.2d 660, 673-674, 99 S.Ct. 1391] and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 543, 558-562 [49 L.Ed.2d 1116, 1128-1131, 96 S.Ct. 3074].)\u201d <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The primary purpose of a sobriety checkpoint is to \u201cprevent and deter conduct injurious to persons and property.\u201d <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1321, 1331.) In <em>Ingersoll, </em>in applying <em>Brown's </em>three-pronged balancing test, we determined that (1) \u201c[d]eterring drunk driving and identifying and removing drunk drivers from the roadways undeniably serves a highly important governmental interest,\u201d and (2) sobriety checkpoints advance this interest. (43 Cal.3d at pp. 1338-1341.)  In examining the third prong of the <em>Brown </em>balancing test, which we rephrased as \u201cthe intrusiveness on individual liberties engendered by the sobriety checkpoints,\u201d we identified eight \u201cfactors important in assessing intrusiveness,\u201d noting that such factors \u201cprovide functional guidelines for minimizing the intrusiveness of the sobriety checkpoint stop.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1341.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The factors identified in <em>Ingersoll </em>are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-6\">(1) Whether the decision to establish a sobriety checkpoint, the selection of the site, and the procedures for the operation of the checkpoint are made and established by supervisory law enforcement personnel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">(2) Whether motorists are stopped according to a neutral formula, such as every third, fifth or tenth driver;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-8\">(3) Whether adequate safety precautions are taken, such as proper lighting, warning signs, and signals, and whether clearly identifiable official vehicles and personnel are used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>(4) Whether the location of the checkpoint was determined by a policy-making official, and was reasonable, i.e., on a road having a high incidence of alcohol-related accidents or arrests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-5\">(5) Whether the time the checkpoint was conducted and its duration reflect \u201cgood judgment\u201d on the part of law enforcement officials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-6\">(6) Whether the checkpoint exhibits sufficient indicia of its official nature (to reassure motorists of the authorized nature of the stop);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-7\">(7) Whether the average length and nature of the detention is minimized; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-8\">(8) Whether the checkpoint is preceded by publicity. <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1341-1347.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">In discussing the eighth factor\u2014advance publicity\u2014we stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-10\">\u201cAdvance publicity is important to the maintenance of a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint. Publicity [without disclosure of the precise location of the checkpoint] both reduces the intrusiveness of the stop and increases the deterrent effect of the roadblock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-11\">\u201cThe concurring opinion in <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Ekstrom </em>v. <em>Justice Ct. of State </em>[1983] [136 Ariz. 1] 663 P.2d 992, at page 1001 explained the value of advance publicity: \u2018Such publicity would warn those using the highways that they might expect to find roadblocks designed to check for sobriety; the warning may well decrease the chance of apprehending \u201cordinary\u201d criminals, but should certainly have a considerable deterring effect by either dissuading people from taking \u201cone more for the road,\u201d persuading them to drink at home, or inducing them to take taxicabs. Any one of these goals, if achieved, would have the salutary effect of interfering with the lethal combination of alcohol and gasoline. Advance notice would limit intrusion upon personal dignity and security because those being stopped would anticipate and understand what was happening.\u2019 (663 P.2d 992, 1001, cone, opn. [of] Feldman, J.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Deskins </em>[(1983) 234 Kan. 529] 673 P.2d 1174, 1182.) .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-12\">\u201cPublicity also serves to establish the legitimacy of sobriety checkpoints in the minds of motorists. Although the court in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State </em>[Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1984] 459 So.2d 1068, found that advance publicity was not constitutionally mandated for all sobriety roadblocks, nevertheless the court offered the observation, consistent with finding reasonableness under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>the Fourth Amendment, that \u201c[A]dvance publication of the date of an intended roadblock, even without announcing its precise location, would have the virtue of reducing surprise, fear, and inconvenience.\u201d'[Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1080.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-5\">\u201cIn the instant case, substantial advance publicity accompanied each sobriety checkpoint instituted.\u201d <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1346-1347.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">After completing our discussion of the eight factors, we concluded in <em>Ingersoll </em>that, \u201cwhile the intrusiveness of a sobriety checkpoint stop is not trivial, the enumerated safeguards operate to minimize the intrusiveness .... The fright or annoyance to motorists condemned in connection with roving stops is absent when the checkpoint is operated according to the guidelines followed here. [\u00b6] On balance, the intrusion on Fourth Amendment interests is sufficiently circumscribed so that <em>it is easily outweighed </em>and justified by the magnitude of the drunk driving menace and the potential for deterrence.\u201d <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1347, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Because the sobriety checkpoint program discussed in <em>Ingersoll </em>encompassed all eight factors, we had no occasion in that decision to examine the narrower question presented in this case\u2014whether the absence of evidence relating to the factor of advance publicity is fatal to the constitutional validity of a sobriety checkpoint. As previously noted, that question was addressed by the appellate department of the superior court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">B. <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, the defendant contended that a sobriety checkpoint was unconstitutional because it had not been preceded by advance publicity. In <em>Morgan, </em>evidence was introduced that a California Highway Patrol officer contacted a news service 24 to 48 hours in advance of the checkpoint\u2019s operation, following up with a telephone call on the evening of the checkpoint to advise the news service of the checkpoint\u2019s precise location. A television news crew was present at the checkpoint. No evidence was presented indicating whether the media actually conveyed any advance information to the public. In view of this factual record, the <em>Morgan </em>court upheld the order granting the motion to suppress evidence, observing that, because our opinion in <em>Ingersoll </em>referred to a finding of \u201c \u2018substantial advance publicity,\u2019 \u201d such publicity constituted a \u201crequirement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Although our discussion in <em>Ingersoll </em>noted that one of the decisions upon which we relied in explaining the significance of advance <em>publicity\u2014Jones </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1984) 459 So.2d 1068, 1080\u2014had determined that such publicity was <em>not </em>constitutionally mandated (see 43 Cal.3d at pp. 1346-1347), the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, held that our discussion of the issue in <em>Ingersoll, </em>viewed as a whole, established that such publicity is constitutionally required. In <em>Morgan, </em>the court also concluded that the efforts undertaken by law enforcement officials to publicize the checkpoint in that case were inadequate, rendering the checkpoint stop unconstitutional, and the evidence obtained at the stop inadmissible at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">C. <em>Michigan State Police Dept. v. Sitz</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Three months after the <em>Morgan </em>decision (and three years after <em>Ingersoll), </em>the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Sitz, </em>addressing for the first time the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints.  In analyzing the issue of the validity of the initial detention of a motor vehicle at such a checkpoint, the court in <em>Sitz </em>acknowledged at the outset \u201cthat a Fourth Amendment \u2018seizure\u2019 occurs when a vehicle is stopped at a checkpoint\u201d (496 U.S. at p. 450 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 420]), recognizing that \u201c[t]he question thus becomes whether such seizures are \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Ib<em>id.) Sitz </em>mirrored the opinion in <em>Ingersoll </em>in determining that the balancing analysis of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 47 [61 L.Ed.2d 357, 99 S.Ct. 2637] provided the governing framework for ascertaining the reasonableness of such a sobriety-checkpoint seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">In applying <em>Brown\u2019s </em>balancing analysis, the court in <em>Sitz </em>first considered the importance and strength of the state interest sought to be served by such checkpoints, finding such interest to be of considerable weight and observing that \u201c[n]o one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the States\u2019 interest in eradicating it.\u201d <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 451 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">The court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sitz </em>then turned to \u201cthe weight bearing on the other scale\u2014the measure of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>checkpoints,\u201d finding such intrusion to be \u201cslight.\" <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 451 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 421].) The court explained: \u201cWe reached a similar conclusion as to the intrusion on motorists subjected to a brief stop at a highway checkpoint for detecting illegal aliens. See <em>[United States </em>v.] <em>Martinez-Fuerte </em>[(1976) 428 U.S. 543], at 558 [49 L.Ed.2d at 1128-1129]. We see virtually no difference between the levels of intrusion on law-abiding motorists from the brief stops necessary to the effectuation of these two types of checkpoints, which to the average motorist would seem identical save for the nature of the questions the checkpoint officers might ask.\u201d (496 U.S. at pp. 451-452 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 421].) The court in <em>Sitz </em>thus concluded that the lower courts in that case had \u201caccurately gauged the \u2018objective\u2019 intrusion, measured by the duration of the seizure and the intensity of the investigation, as minimal.\u201d (496 U.S. at p. 452 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 421].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Although the lower courts in <em>Sitz </em>had found the \u201cobjective\u201d intrusion of the sobriety checkpoint to be minimal, those courts had found the \u201csubjective\u201d intrusion, that is, the potential for generating \u201cfear and surprise\u201d in motorists, to be substantial, and had invalidated the checkpoint on that basis. <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 452 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 421].) The high court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sitz </em>observed that, although the lower courts had agreed that \u201cthe guidelines governing checkpoint operation minimize[d] the discretion of the officers on the scene. . . ,\u201d those courts had concluded that \u201cthe checkpoints ha[d] the potential to generate fear and surprise in motorists . . . because the record failed to demonstrate that approaching motorists would be aware of their option to make U-turns or turnoffs to avoid the checkpoints. On that basis, the court[s] deemed the subjective intrusion from the checkpoints unreasonable.\u201d (496 U.S. at p. 452 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 421].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">In rejecting the lower courts\u2019 conclusion on this point, the high court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sitz </em>explained that those courts had \u201cmisread our cases concerning the degree of \u2018subjective intrusion\u2019 and the potential for generating fear and surprise. The \u2018fear and surprise\u2019 to be considered are not the natural fear of one who has been drinking over the prospect of being stopped at a sobriety checkpoint but, rather, <em>the fear and surprise engendered in law-abiding motorists by the nature of the stop. </em>This was made clear in <em>Martihez-Fuerte. </em>Comparing checkpoint stops to roving patrols considered in prior cases, we said, [\u00b6] \u2018we view checkpoint stops in a different light because the subjective intrusion\u2014the generating of concern or even fright on the part of lawful travelers\u2014is appreciably less in the case of a checkpoint stop. In <em>[United States </em>v.] <em>Ortiz </em>[(1975) 422 U.S. 891 (45 L.Ed.2d 623, 95 S.Ct. 2585)], we noted: [\u00b6] \u2018 <em>\u201c[The circumstances surrounding a checkpoint stop and search are far less intrusive than those attending a roving-patrol stop. Roving patrols often operate at night on seldom-traveled roads, and their approach may </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number><em>frighten motorists. At traffic checkpoints the motorist can see that other vehicles are being stopped, he can see visible signs of the officers\u2019 authority, and he is much less likely to be frightened or annoyed by the intrusion. </em>422 U.S. at [pp.] 894-895.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Here, checkpoints are selected pursuant to the guidelines, and uniformed police officers stop every approaching vehicle. The intrusion resulting from the brief stop at the sobriety checkpoint is for constitutional purposes indistinguishable from the checkpoint stops we upheld in <em>Martinez-Fuerte.\u201d (Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 452-453 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 421-422], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Finally, in <em>Sitz </em>the United States Supreme Court explained that the lower courts in that case also had erred in applying the third prong of the <em>Brown </em>balancing test, which concerns \u201c \u2018the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 453 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 422], quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>433 U.S. at p. 51 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 362].) The lower courts in <em>Sitz </em>had interpreted this language in <em>Brown </em>to require a judicial determination as to the effectiveness of the checkpoint program, and, on the basis of evidence adduced at trial, had concluded that the program failed the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d test. The majority opinion in <em>Sitz </em>explained, however, that \u201c[t]his passage from <em>Brown </em>was not meant to transfer from politically accountable officials to the courts the decision as to which among reasonable alternative law enforcement techniques should be employed to deal with a serious public danger. Experts in police science might disagree over which of several methods of apprehending drunk drivers is preferable as an ideal. But for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, the choice among such reasonable alternatives remains with the governmental officials who have a unique understanding of, and a responsibility for, limited public resources . . . (496 U.S. at pp. 453-454 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 422].) The high court concluded in <em>Sitz </em>that the evidence presented in that case, which indicated that, on the average, sobriety checkpoints resulted in the arrest of approximately 1 percent of all motorists stopped, was sufficient to sustain the program\u2019s constitutionality under the \u201cpublic interest\u201d component of the <em>Brown </em>test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">D. <em>Application of Sitz to the present case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Relying upon <em>Sitz, </em>the People contend that the United States Supreme Court has determined that, under the federal Constitution, advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>publicity is not an essential element of a valid sobriety checkpoint. Arguing to the contrary, defendant urges that <em>Sitz </em>is not controlling authority for the narrow question posed in the present case, and that instead we should adopt the reasoning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, to conclude that a sobriety checkpoint is constitutionally invalid in the absence of advance publicity. We are persuaded by the People\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">As noted above, in discussing the advance-publicity guideline in <em>Ingersoll, </em>we suggested that such publicity was significant in two respects\u2014in reducing the intrusiveness of the sobriety checkpoint stop, and in increasing the deterrent value of the checkpoint itself. The reasoning of the <em>Sitz </em>majority makes it clear, however, that advance publicity is not a constitutional prerequisite to a valid sobriety checkpoint in either respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">In analyzing the question of intrusiveness, the high court in <em>Sitz </em>considered both the \u201cobjective intrusion\u201d of a checkpoint stop upon motorists, and the \u201csubjective intrusion\u201d involved. <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 452 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 421].) With respect to the objective-intrusion criterion, that is, \u201cthe duration of the seizure and the intensity of the investigation,\u201d the court in <em>Sitz </em>found that the objective intrusion occasioned by a sobriety checkpoint is no different from the intrusion involved in a border-control checkpoint, which the court previously had upheld. (496 U.S. at pp. 451-452 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 420-421] [citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 543, 558 (49 L.Ed.2d 1116, 1128, 96 S.Ct. 3074)].) The presence or absence of advance publicity would appear to be irrelevant to the objective intrusion occasioned by a sobriety checkpoint, and defendant does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">With respect to the subjective-intrusion criterion, that is, a sobriety checkpoint\u2019s potential for generating fear and surprise in motorists, the high court rejected the lower courts\u2019 conclusion that the subjective intrusion posed by the sobriety checkpoints involved in that case was unreasonable because of the approaching motorists\u2019 unawareness of their option to avoid the impending detention. Explaining that \u201c[t]he \u2018fear and surprise\u2019 to be considered are ... the fear and surprise engendered in law-abiding motorists by the nature of the stop,\u201d the court in <em>Sitz </em>contrasted sobriety checkpoints with the \u201croving patrols\u201d considered in earlier cases, emphasizing that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a]t traffic checkpoints the motorist can see that other vehicles are being stopped, he can see visible signs of the officers\u2019 authority, and he is much less likely to be frightened or annoyed by the intrusion.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 452-453 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 421-422].) Because sobriety checkpoints share these characteristics with the border-patrol checkpoints upheld in <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>the court in <em>Sitz </em>concluded that \u201c[t]he intrusion resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>from the brief stop at the sobriety checkpoint is for constitutional purposes indistinguishable from the checkpoint stops ... in <em>Martinez-Fuerte.\u201d </em>(496 U.S. at p. 453 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 422].) Although Justice Stevens (joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall) argued vigorously in dissent that temporary sobriety checkpoints were more akin to roving patrols than to the permanent border-control checkpoint upheld in <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>because motorists were likely to be surprised upon encountering temporary sobriety checkpoints, the court in <em>Sitz </em>rejected that view, concluding that, for constitutional purposes, sobriety checkpoints are not impermissibly frightening or surprising\u2014provided the motorist encountering the checkpoint \u201c \u2018 \u201ccan see that other vehicles are being stopped, [and] . . . can see visible signs of the officers\u2019 authority . . . (496 U.S. at p. 453 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 422] [quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ortiz </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 891, 894-895 (45 L.Ed.2d 623, 627-628, 95 S.Ct. 2585)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Although publicizing in advance the location of a sobriety checkpoint may serve to minimize the surprise or inconvenience experienced by motorists alerted by the publicity, Sitz\u2019s analysis of the subjective intrusion engendered by a sobriety checkpoint makes clear that advance publicity is not a constitutional prerequisite to ensuring that the subjective intrusion involved is confined to a reasonable level.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\"><em>Sitz </em>also makes clear that, however persuaded a court may be that advance publicity will increase the deterrent value of the checkpoint and thereby increase the procedure\u2019s effectiveness, the constitutionality of the checkpoint does not hinge upon such judicial evaluation of its effectiveness.  As we have seen, the high court in <em>Sitz </em>explained that the language contained in its prior decision in <em>Brown, </em>identifying \u201c \u2018the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest\u2019 \u201d as one factor in the balancing process, \u201cwas not meant to transfer from politically accountable officials to the courts\u201d the responsibility for making policy decisions among reasonable alternative law enforcement techniques. In so concluding, the court emphasized that \u201cfor purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, the choice among such reasonable alternatives remains with the governmental officials who have a unique understanding of, and a responsibility for, limited public resources . . . .\u201d <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 453-454 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 422].)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Thus, <em>Sitz </em>establishes that a sobriety checkpoint may not be held violative of the federal Constitution simply because a court may believe that the law enforcement interests sought to be served by the checkpoint would more effectively be served by a level of advance publicity greater than that believed appropriate by politically accountable officials. The nature and degree of publicity sought or provided by law enforcement officials prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>the operation of sobriety checkpoints inevitably involve policy judgments reflecting not only the fiscal resources available to the agencies in question, but also a determination as to whether to attempt to achieve greater deterrence during a specified time period (e.g., a holiday weekend) or at a particular location (e.g., near a professional sports stadium), or whether, instead, to seek the more generalized deterrence arguably obtainable when motorists learn\u2014through personal experience or by word of mouth\u2014that sobriety checkpoints may be established <em>without </em>advance publicity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Sitz </em>establishes that the constitutionality of a sobriety checkpoint should not hinge upon a court\u2019s evaluation of the wisdom of policy decisions made by accountable law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Nonetheless, courts have recognized that the absence of advance publicity does not so lessen the deterrent effect of a sobriety checkpoint as to tip the scales in favor of the detained motorist who subsequently challenges the checkpoint. A sobriety checkpoint conducted without advance publicity is unlikely to be totally without deterrent effect, at least among those motorists who pass through, or by, the checkpoint. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rister </em>(Colo. 1990) 803 P.2d 483, 489 [\u201c[T]he announcement <em>and establishment </em>of a sobriety checkpoint undoubtedly had some effect on advancing the state\u2019s interest in preventing drunken driving.\u201d (Italics added.)].) If, in accordance with the <em>Ingersoll </em>guidelines, the checkpoint is established on a roadway \u201chaving a high incidence of alcohol related accidents and/or afrests,\u201d the deterrent effect may be considerable. <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1343.) Also, if law enforcement agencies choose to publicize the number of arrests made at sobriety checkpoints, an additional deterrent effect may be realized. Thus, even in the absence of advance publicity, a sobriety checkpoint has the potential of substantially furthering the state\u2019s vital interest in deterring motorists from driving \u201cunder the influence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">In arguing that <em>Sitz </em>must be read to establish advance publicity as a prerequisite to a constitutionally valid sobriety checkpoint program, defendant relies upon the circumstance that the statement of facts in <em>Sitz </em>indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>the sobriety checkpoint at issue in that case was established under guidelines providing for some form of unspecified publicity. (See <em>Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 447 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 418].) Defendant maintains that, because the sobriety checkpoint program in <em>Sitz </em>contained advance publicity, the decision in that case cannot be relied upon as authority for the proposition that advance publicity is not constitutionally required.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Defendant\u2019s claim is untenable. In analyzing the constitutionality of the sobriety checkpoint challenged in <em>Sitz, </em>the court\u2019s opinion placed no reliance upon, and indeed made no reference to, any advance publicity that might have been provided regarding the checkpoint. It is well settled that language contained in a judicial opinion is \u201c \u2018to be understood in the light of the facts and issue then before the court, and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>0Marks) (1991) 1 Cal.4th 56, 65-66 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 389, 820 P.2d 613], quoting <em>Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689].) The reasoning contained in the <em>Sitz </em>opinion indicates that the validity of a sobriety checkpoint turns upon the duration of the stop and the intensity of the investigation, and upon the adequacy of measures taken to apprise motorists who encounter the checkpoint that it is an official law enforcement operation and that other motorists also are being detained in regular fashion. Particularly in light of the high court\u2019s implicit rejection of Justice Stevens\u2019s dissenting opinion, which argued that the \u201csurprise\u201d nature of sobriety checkpoints rendered them unconstitutional, we conclude that the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Sitz </em>reasonably must be understood to hold that advance publicity is not a prerequisite to a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint.

Although nearly all of these decisions predate <em>Sitz, </em>we briefly review them to demonstrate that, even prior to <em>Sitz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>defendant\u2019s position was rejected overwhelmingly by the state courts that have considered the issue now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">We commence our survey of sister state courts with an examination of those decisions that address the precise issue that confronts us in the present case\u2014whether advance publicity is necessary to the operation of a constitutionally permissible checkpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bartley </em>(1985) 109 Ill.2d 273 [93 Ill.Dec. 347, 486 N.E.2d 880], the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a sobriety roadblock, finding that the roadblock had been operated pursuant to guidelines that served to limit the intrusiveness of the detention. Although the media was advised in advance of the roadblock, little (if any) media coverage actually preceded its operation, and the Illinois Supreme Court considered the case as one involving a lack of advance publicity. The court noted that such publicity \u201cserves to minimize any apprehension\u201d on the part of detained motorists, and promotes the goal of deterrence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 888.) Notwithstanding these observations, the court held that the failure of law enforcement officials to publicize the roadblock in advance was not fatal to its constitutionality. \u201cGiven the other factors serving to reduce the subjective intrusion, the lack of advance publicity is not sufficient to invalidate this roadblock.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Little </em>(1987) 162 Ill.App.3d 6 [515 N.E.2d 846, 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCamera </em>(1989) 237 N.J. Super. 380 [568 A.2d 86], the defendant, having been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, challenged the constitutionality of the sobriety roadblock on the ground there had been no advance published notice of the roadblock. In rejecting this challenge, the court held: \u201cWe are cognizant of the fact that some positive results might flow from advance newspaper notice of police roadblocks. It is possible that if the public was aware that there was to be a sobriety checkpoint on a particular day, but was not aware of its location, intoxicated persons might be less likely to attempt to drive. This heightened effectiveness, however, does not rise to the level of a constitutional imperative.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88; accord, <em>State </em>v. <em>Valencia Olaya </em>(1987) 105 N.M. 690 [736 P.2d 495, 498] [\u201cBecause no one guideline is dispositive,\u201d the court upheld the constitutionality of a sobriety roadblock where, with the exception of advance publicity, the roadblock \u201csatisfied the intent\u201d of each guideline subsequently set forth in Ingersoll].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Other state courts that have upheld the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints, operated pursuant to guidelines that included advance publicity, have characterized such publicity\u2014as we did in Ingersoll\u2014as a factor or guideline to be considered as part of a court\u2019s balancing analysis, rather than as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>prerequisite.

(See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>500 N.E.2d 158, 162; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1984) 63 N.Y.2d 518 [483 N.Y.S.2d 649, 473 N.E.2d 1, 5]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Super.

Accordingly, in this decision we limit our discussion to that issue and do not revisit the broader questions addressed in <em>Ingersoll </em>and <em>Sitz </em>pertaining to the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints generally, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>the conflicting empirical evidence as to their effectiveness.

Furthermore, because the question presented in this case is limited to whether advance publicity is a <em>prerequisite </em>to a constitutionally valid sobriety checkpoint, nothing in our decision should be construed to suggest that any of the eight guidelines set forth in <em>Ingersoll, </em>including advance publicity (43 Cal.3d at pp. 1341-1347), are not <em>relevant </em>to a consideration of the intrusiveness of a sobriety checkpoint stop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\"><em> People </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, appears to be the only published decision in the nation (other than the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in this case) that has invalidated a sobriety checkpoint exclusively upon the basis of a lack of adequate advance publicity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b973-9\"> Although, as previously noted, <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>apparently is the only published decision (other than the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in this case) that has found a sobriety checkpoint invalid based solely upon the absence of advance publicity, it is not the only California decision to have considered this particular one of Ingersoll\u2019s eight guidelines. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Squire </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 775 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 121], the Court of Appeal reversed an order granting a motion to suppress evidence obtained at a sobriety checkpoint, where an article in a local newspaper had publicized the forthcoming checkpoint operation. The court in <em>Squire </em>found it unnecessary to decide whether advance publicity was a prerequisite to a constitutionally valid sobriety checkpoint, because of the court\u2019s conclusion that, assuming such publicity was required, the single newspaper article was adequate for that purpose. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 781-782.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Following remand from the United States Supreme Court, the Michigan Supreme Court invalidated sobriety checkpoints in that jurisdiction on state constitutional grounds, without referring in its analysis to the advance-publicity component of Michigan\u2019s sobriety checkpoint program.

Among these concerns are the geographical area in which the advance notice must be provided, the type and number of media organizations that must be contacted, the minimum advance-notice period, the requisite content of the notice, whether the notice should be provided in languages other than English, the number of times the notice must be repeated, the typeface size of the notice intended for dissemination in the print media, and whether law enforcement agencies must purchase necessary airtime or publishing space in the event media organizations decline to convey the notice as a public service.

The court reached that conclusion by applying the administrative search rationale articulated in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 47 [61 L.Ed.2d 357, 99 S.Ct. 2637] and by comparing sobriety roadblocks to metal detectors at airports. (See <em>Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1329-1331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Justice Mosk and I joined Justice Broussard\u2019s dissent in <em>Ingersoll. </em>Since then, most courts have yielded to the overwhelming public pressure to approve this type of warrantless, suspicionless search. Under these circumstances there is little point in writing another long dissent. However, when future courts are asked to approve still more intrusive \u201cadministrative\u201d searches by analogy to the sobriety checkpoint, it may be useful for them to recall the reasons why some of us were unwilling to take even the first small steps in this direction. In Justice Broussard\u2019s words:</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment is highly inexpedient to law enforcement, yet to date we have not allowed mass detentions on the theory that these might prove useful in combating crime. I see no basis for distinguishing a drunk driving roadblock from any other mass detention established to prevent crime or apprehend wrongdoers. While drunk driving is a revolting crime, it is not the only one which the community abhors. If we abandon constitutional protections to combat every abhorrent crime which has captured the public\u2019s attention, we will find ourselves naked and unprotected in a hurry.\u201d <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1356 (dis. opn. of Broussard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">At least the <em>Ingersoll </em>court saw the danger to our constitutional protections. Because it did, the court tempered its holding by distilling from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>relevant cases a set of \u201cfunctional guidelines for minimizing the intrusiveness . . . <em>(Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1341.) The court explained its reasons for including one of those guidelines, advance publicity, in these words: \u201cAdvance publicity is important to the maintenance of a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint. Publicity both reduces the intrusiveness of the stop and increases the deterrent effect of the roadblock.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">For six years the <em>Ingersoll </em>guidelines, including advance publicity, have served the state well by minimizing the intrusiveness of one type of warrant-less, suspicionless search. Today, however, the majority concludes that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the constitutionality of sobriety checkpoints in <em>Michigan State Police Dept. </em>v. <em>Sitz </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 444 . . . establishes that advance publicity is not a constitutional prerequisite to the operation of such a checkpoint.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 931.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">I am not entirely sure what this means. Perhaps the majority means to say only this: While the presence or absence of advance publicity is still <em>relevant </em>in assessing the intrusiveness, and thus the constitutionality, of sobriety checkpoints, an unpublicized checkpoint can still pass constitutional muster if it obtains a high score on the other seven <em>Ingersoll </em>factors. In a footnote the majority invites this interpretation with the statement that \u201cnothing in our decision should be construed to suggest that any of the eight guidelines set forth in <em>Ingersoll, </em>including advance publicity (43 Cal.3d at pp. 1341-1347), are not <em>relevant </em>to a consideration of the intrusiveness of a sobriety checkpoint stop.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 933, fn. 3, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">If this is the correct interpretation of the majority opinion, then it is still possible as a matter of logic that the lack of advance publicity in a particular case will be decisive in holding unconstitutional a checkpoint that does not score high on the other seven <em>Ingersoll </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Unfortunately, the opinion does not clearly say this. The majority repeats, but will not reaffirm, Ingersoll's statement that advance publicity is <em>\u201cimportant </em>to the maintenance of a constitutionally permissible sobriety checkpoint.\u201d (Ing<em>ersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1346, italics added; cf. maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 931.) Then, as if to take back what the footnote gives, the majority declares that \u201ca sobriety checkpoint may not be held violative of the federal Constitution simply because a court may believe that the law enforcement interests sought to be served by the checkpoint would more effectively be served by a level of advance publicity greater than that believed appropriate by politically accountable officials.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">In my view the majority wants it both ways. Clearly it does not wish to encourage law enforcement officials to announce sobriety checkpoints in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>advance, but it also does not want to hold that advance publicity is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">One good reason not to hold that advance publicity is irrelevant would be that the high court\u2019s opinion in <em>Michigan State Police Dept. </em>v. <em>Sitz </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 444 [110 L.Ed.2d 412, 110 S.Ct. 2481], on which the majority places so much weight, would not support such a holding. <em>Sitz </em>was an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the operation of a sobriety checkpoint program in Michigan. The plaintiffs \u201cchallenge[d] only the use of sobriety checkpoints generally\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 450 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 420]), and the court held that such checkpoints are constitutional if they satisfy the balancing test set out in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>443 U.S. 47. This holding neither compels us, nor gives us a reason, to abandon the guidelines that we adopted in <em>Ingersoll, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1321, for applying the <em>Brown </em>test in the context of sobriety checkpoints. This is especially true since the guidelines of the checkpoint program that the high court approved in <em>Sitz </em>did include publicity. <em>(Sitz, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 447 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 418]; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 475, fn. 19 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 436] (dis. opn. of Stevens, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">In summary, the majority invites law enforcement officials to dispense with advance publicity while reassuring those who fear for the vitality of the Fourth Amendment that all of the <em>Ingersoll </em>factors, including advance publicity, are still in effect. In view of this ambiguous message, the only prudent course of action is for law enforcement officials and courts to continue to determine in each case whether the lack of advance publicity has made each particular checkpoint too intrusive to satisfy the Fourth Amendment. Only then can we be confident that the Fourth Amendment is still alive and well.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
