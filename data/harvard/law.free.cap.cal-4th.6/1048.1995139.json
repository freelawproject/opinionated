Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b)) from a judgment of death under the 1978 death penalty law <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 190 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">On November 2, 1987, the District Attorney of Kern County filed an information against defendant Rodney Berryman in the superior court of that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>Count I charged that on or about September 6, 1987, defendant murdered Florence Hildreth. (Pen. \"Code, \u00a7 187.) It was alleged for death eligibility that he did so under the special circumstance of felony murder in the course of rape <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 261). <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(iii).) It was alleged for enhancement of sentence that he personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon, viz., a knife. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 12022, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Count II charged that on or about September 6, 1987, defendant raped Hildreth. (Pen. Code, former \u00a7 261, subd. (2), as amended by Stats. 1985, ch. 283, \u00a7 1, pp. 1307-1308, Pen. Code, present \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2).) It was alleged for enhancement of sentence that he personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon, viz., a knife. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 12022, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges and denied the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Trial was by jury. The panel returned a verdict of guilty as to murder and fixed the degree at the first. It found true the accompanying allegations of the felony-murder-rape special circumstance and the personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. It specially found that defendant killed Hildreth intentionally. It also returned a verdict of guilty as to rape. It found true the accompanying allegation of the personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. It subsequently returned a verdict of death for the murder. The court denied, among other motions, defendant\u2019s automatic application for modification of the verdict of death. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.4, subd. (e).) It proceeded to enter judgment as follows. For the murder, it imposed the sentence of death, with an additional and consecutive term of one year for personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. For the rape, it imposed a sentence of imprisonment comprising the upper term of eight years, with an additional and consecutive term of one year for personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon. It stayed the sentence of imprisonment temporarily pending execution of the sentence of death and permanently thereafter. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 654.) It also ordered payment of a restitution fine in the amount of $100. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">Finding no reversible error or other defect, we conclude that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">A. <em>Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">The People introduced evidence to the following effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-11\">The time relevant is September 1987; the place is the small city of Delano in rural Kern County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>Florence Hildreth resided in Delano with her mother. She was a senior at Delano High School; she was 17 years of age, 5 feet 7 inches tall, and 108 pounds in weight. She had never been married. Her nickname was \u201cMimi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Defendant had recently arrived in Delano, where he had spent part of his youth, in a red, black, and gray Mitsubishi pickup truck, having come from Los Angeles County. He was apparently unemployed; he was 21 years of age, 6 feet 2 inches tall, and approximately 190 pounds in weight. He was married and had a young son; he was estranged from his wife, who remained in Los Angeles County with the child. He was a womanizer. He was staying in Delano with a \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d Crystal Armendariz, who lived at the home of her mother, Brenda Clark, and her stepfather, Martin Clark; Armendariz was Hildreth\u2019s cousin and the Clarks were her aunt and uncle. Defendant and Hildreth were acquaintances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">On September 6, 1987, defendant and Armendariz drove to Bakersfield in his pickup truck and returned to Delano sometime in the late afternoon or early evening. Apparently about 8:30 p.m., they arrived at the Clark home. They ate lasagne for dinner. Defendant then left alone. About 9 p.m., he drove a short distance to the residence of a woman named Donna Faye Warner; he attempted to \u201cpick her up\u201d; he was unsuccessful. About 9:20 p.m., he drove a short distance to the residence of a woman named Melinda Regina Pena; he attempted to \u201cpick her up\u201d; this time, he was successful. They drove to Lake Woollomes. There they stayed about 30 minutes, having sexual intercourse on the grass. On the trip back, he asked her to be his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d; she refused, saying she already had a \u201cboyfriend\u201d; he became upset. Thereupon, he dropped her off outside her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">About 10:30 p.m., Hildreth was at the house of Diane Pruitt, one of her aunts, with whose family she had planned to spend the night. At that time, she set out to walk to the Clark home to find out whether she had received a telephone call she had been expecting. She promised she would return straightway. The distance was approximately one block. About 10:34 p.m., she arrived at the Clark home. Armendariz was there. Defendant was not. Apparently, he was then about to return, or actually returning, from Pena\u2019s home, which was also located in Delano. Hildreth checked for telephone calls, and found none. About 10:45 p.m., she left to go back to Pruitt\u2019s residence. One of her uncles offered to escort her, but she declined. She never arrived at her destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">About 11 p.m., defendant\u2019s pickup truck was seen pulling out of a convenience store onto Cecil Avenue and proceeding in a westbound direction. Two persons were observed in the vehicle. Shortly thereafter, it appears, defendant\u2019s pickup truck was seen parked on the shoulder of Cecil Avenue in the westbound direction some few miles away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>Later that night\u2014the time is uncertain\u2014defendant returned to the Clark home. Armendariz let him in. He was calm. He asked for something to eat. She warmed up a plate of leftover lasagne. He ate the food and eventually went to sleep. Apparently, he had drunk alcoholic beverages throughout the day but did not become intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">On the morning of September 7, 1987, Hildreth\u2019s body was found sprawled on an isolated dirt road extending south off Cecil Avenue at a right angle, about four-tenths of a mile from the location at which defendant\u2019s pickup truck had been seen parked the previous night. Before death, Hildreth had apparently been dragged to the spot and beaten about her head and body, including the right iliac or pelvic region. She was fatally stabbed in the front of her neck on the right side to a depth of about three quarters on an inch, with a nick to the carotid artery. It appears that a knife was used, and broken, in the attack. As she lay dying, her right cheek was evidently pressed down and abraded by the sole of a shoe for some appreciable period of time\u2014 apparently more than one minute and perhaps as long as three to five. When found, her body was practically nude, with the upper clothing pushed up above her chest toward her neck and the lower clothing pulled down around her left ankle; two pubic hairs rested on the left side of her head; her legs were spread apart; her right iliac or pelvic region showed abrasions; and her vagina contained blood and sperm cells\u2014a serologist testified that a vaginal swab revealed the presence of a \u201cvery small amount of blood,\u201d the \u201cpresence of sperm cells, spermatozoa,\u201d and the presence of a \u201cvery, very small amount of semen.\u201d All the injuries were ante mortem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">At the scene of the crime were discovered distinctive shoe prints and tire tracks. The shoe prints were very similar to those of defendant\u2019s shoes. The tire tracks were very similar to those of his pickup truck. At least one of the tires in question was seen leaning, without a rim, against a fence at the Clark home about 8 a.m. on September 7; it had not been seen there on September 6. Also discovered at the crime scene was a small round yellow metal jewelry clasp that could have come from a chain that defendant owned and that was found in his pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">It was determined that the passenger-door window of defendant\u2019s pickup truck bore Hildreth\u2019s right thumbprint on its inside surface. It was also determined that the abrasion on Hildreth\u2019s right cheek displayed a pattern similar to that of the sole of defendant\u2019s right shoe. It was ascertained that the shoelace of defendant\u2019s right shoe was stained with blood that could have been deposited by only 0.068 percent of the Black population; he was not a possible donor, but Hildreth was. It was also ascertained that one of the two pubic hairs resting on the left side of Hildreth\u2019s head was consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>with defendant\u2019s and inconsistent with hers, and that the other was consistent with hers and inconsistent with defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">In statements made to friends and acquaintances on September 7, 1987, defendant revealed that Hildreth had been killed and, more specifically, that she had been killed by stabbing; he did so before that fact was generally known. He claimed that Hildreth had met her death at the hands of some unidentified persons from Los Angeles, and said that he wanted a gun to pay them back. He also claimed that a scratch that marked his face resulted from a game of basketball earlier in the day. Overhearing a comment that his pickup truck had been seen on Cecil Avenue sometime the previous night, he immediately denied the fact, stating that \u201cit wasn\u2019t his truck\u201d and that \u201che was at a girl\u2019s house the whole time.\u201d He telephoned a \u201cgirl\u201d he called \u201cConnie\u201d and \u201ctr[ied] to make [her] say that he was there the whole time\u201d\u2014evidently without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">In statements made to investigating law enforcement officers later on September 7, 1987, defendant denied that he or his pickup truck had been on Cecil Avenue at any time the night before. He also denied that Hildreth had ever been in his vehicle. He said that the scratch on his face resulted from a game of basketball earlier in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">For his part, defendant introduced evidence to undermine the probativeness of the People\u2019s evidence, in an effort to show that they had not carried their burden. He played on various uncertainties, including uncertainties related to time. He did not take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">In aggravation, the People introduced evidence of other violent criminal activity in which defendant had engaged and prior felony convictions that he had suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">Specifically, there was a stipulation that defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County of three counts of transportation of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11360, subd. (a)) in March 1984, and one count of grand theft (Pen. Code, former \u00a7 487, subd. (1), as amended by Stats. 1982, ch. 375, \u00a7 1, p. 1693, Pen. Code, present \u00a7 487, subd. (1)) in August 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">There was also testimony that defendant had committed assault (Pen. Code, \u00a7 240) and/or assault with a deadly weapon <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 245) in two separate incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>David Edmund Perez testified that on July 19, 1987, he was involved in a traffic altercation in Los Angeles County with a number of other men, including defendant; in its course, defendant \u201ccame up from behind me with a tire iron and hit me in the back of the head,\u201d causing a wound that later required 10 stitches to close; \u201cafter he hit me and tried to hit me again and I blocked it, the second one, he started chasing me, and him and his buddy were yelling out L A Cr[i]ps\u201d\u2014an apparent reference to a notorious street gang. It appears that defendant was arrested and charged with respect to the attack on Perez, but subsequently fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Howard Dean Fuller, who was the father of defendant\u2019s wife, testified that in early August 1987 at his home in Los Angeles County, he and defendant engaged in a dispute about family matters: \u201c. . . Rodney came to the door, came into the yard, and I had told him several times not to come to the house, period, and I told him that he couldn\u2019t come in\u201d; \u201c[h]e continued to come in, I told him no, and I stood in his way, and we began to push backwards and forth\u201d; and \u201che hit me\u201d on the \u201cbridge of the nose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">In mitigation, defendant introduced evidence relating to his background and character.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Family members and friends testified to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">In 1965, defendant was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming; his father and mother had an older son and would have a younger daughter and son; at the time of defendant\u2019s birth, his father was serving in the Air Force. Defendant\u2019s childhood and adolescence were troubled. His parents\u2019 marriage was stormy, marked by physical violence by his father against his mother, and punctuated with a number of separations before an eventual divorce. He moved back and forth among his father and mother and others in various locations, including Delano; he was not given adequate attention and affection; he did poorly in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">During his teenage years, defendant became a \u201cCasanova\u201d; he began to abuse alcohol, run away, and get in trouble with the law; his father died; and he started to experience recurrent disabling headaches, which were apparently connected (at least in part) to a work-related injury to his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">In May 1986, defendant married his wife, Carol Lynn Berryman, n\u00e9e Fuller. They set up house together in Los Angeles County, and participated in activities at Carol\u2019s father\u2019s church. In August 1986, Carol gave birth to a son, Rodney, Jr. Defendant attempted to discharge his responsibilities as husband and father, providing for his wife and son and showing them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>affection. Before long, however, he began to falter. There were problems in his personal life, marriage, and employment, which exacerbated, and were exacerbated by, his abuse of alcohol. By June 1987, he began a precipitous downward spiral. He seems to have recognized his difficulties with alcohol, but could not, or simply did not, bring them under control. Soon, he and his wife separated. In August 1987, he went to Delano, in part at least to avoid the legal consequences of his attack on Perez. On or about September 6, 1987, Hildreth was raped and murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">In the opinion of family members and friends, defendant was \u201cwarm,\u201d \u201ccaring,\u201d and \u201cnice\u201d; he had been, and remained, close to those who loved him and whom he loved; he was not violent, either generally or specifically in his dealings with women. His wife continued to \u201clove him very much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">William D. Pierce, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, testified as an expert witness in relevant part as follows. His \u201caxis one\u201d diagnosis of defendant\u2014 which \u201crefers to the type of symptomatology or problems that you feel the person is experiencing like right now, or that are most important\u201d\u2014was \u201calcohol induced organic disorder, alcohol intoxication and rule out organic mental syndrome, not otherwise specified.\u201d He had discovered certain \u201csoft signs\u201d of \u201corganicity,\u201d but could not \u201cconfirm or disconfirm\u201d its presence because he was unable to obtain specified neurological testing. His \u201caxis two\u201d diagnosis\u2014which \u201crefers to long-standing kind of personality traits or characteristics that have been occurring over a longer period of time\u201d\u2014was \u201cpersonality disorder, not otherwise specified, with dependent narcissistic and depressive features.\u201d He opined, in substance, that the rape and murder of Hildreth was \u201cuncharacteristic\u201d of defendant, and his conduct in the incident was \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cout of control.\u201d He admitted that there was \u201cno serious psychological disorder\u201d\u2014neither \u201cpsychosis\u201d nor \u201cneurosis\u201d\u2014but simply \u201cevidence of ongoing personality and interpersonal problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Samuel George Benson, Jr., M.D., a psychiatrist, gave testimony as an expert witness that generally followed that of Dr. Pierce. He \u201cconfirmed\u201d the \u201csoft signs of organicity\u201d found by Dr. Pierce. He proceeded to opine that defendant \u201cdoes, in fact, suffer from an organic mental syndrome, that it\u2019s probably alcohol induced, but there is [szc] some other factors in addition to his consumption of alcohol that\u2019s [led] to it,\u201d including \u201chead trauma.\u201d He stated that his \u201cdiagnosis\u201d included \u201cmiddle brain dysfunction.\u201d He added: \u201cIncreasingly more important in trying to understand and care for people from a medical point of view, it is necessary to know about their lifestyle.\u201d \u201cIn evaluating Rodney, Mr. Berryman, what I really noted and I thought was very important about his lifestyle was a kind of constant seeking for\u2014to be taken care of, a kind of dependency, particularly on women, and almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>exclusively on women, of becoming very close, to get nurturing by being charming, kind, somewhat immature, but constantly needing numbers, more than the average, more than most people, of women, so that he feels as though he\u2019s loved, so he feels as though he can somehow be taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Defendant also introduced evidence concerning incarceration in state prison and infliction of death by lethal gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Defendant did not take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">II. Guilt Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">Defendant raises a number of claims attacking the judgment as to guilt. As will appear, none is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">A. <em>Denial of Motion to Substitute Attorneys</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">On September 11, 1987, Charles J. Soria was appointed as counsel to defendant. On April 6, 1988, George W. Peterson was appointed cocounsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">On December 15, 1987\u2014after Soria\u2019s appointment but before Peterson\u2019s \u2014defendant orally moved the court to relieve Soria and appoint new counsel in his place: \u201cI would like another attorney appointed to me . . . . Because I don\u2019t feel comfortable with the attorney that I have.\u201d The court responded: \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have a right to be comfortable with him, sir.\u201d Defendant: \u201c. .'. I feel I have a right to change lawyers if I want to. I don\u2019t feel comfortable with the man. [1J] And I\u2019m looking at the death penalty and he\u2019s going to tell me that I don\u2019t have the right to change lawyers?\u201d The court: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m telling you. If it\u2019s simply a matter of being comfortable with him.\u201d Defendant: \u201cThere is a reason why I don\u2019t feel comfortable with him.\u201d The court set a hearing for December 17 pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44], in order to afford defendant an opportunity to state his reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">On December 17, 1987, the court held a hearing in camera on defendant\u2019s motion, with only defendant, Soria, and court personnel present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">The court inquired as to the grounds of the motion. Defendant stated: \u201c[D]uring our preliminary hearing I asked him to bring a witness in for me and he didn\u2019t. He failed to do that. He gave me some excuse I really can\u2019t remember.\u201d The court determined that this ground was insufficient: \u201c[Tactically it is generally an accepted practice for the defense not to put on any evidence at the time of the preliminary hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>The court continued its inquiry. Defendant stated: \u201cHe\u2019s talking about my case to other inmates in the jail. One inmate told me that he said he feels that I\u2019ve done this crime and the reason why he\u2019s holding onto this case is because he has to. Like\u2014you know, like he\u2019s not determined to win this case or fight it, just had to do it.\u201d Allowed to respond, Soria said that he had indeed asked \u201cother inmates how Mr. Berryman was doing,\u201d but had \u201cnever said to any inmate that I believe that Mr. Berryman has done this.\u201d The court impliedly determined that this ground was unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The court went on with its inquiry. Defendant stated: \u201cHe\u2019s holding conversations with Lisa Green\u201d\u2014who was the deputy district attorney then assigned to the case. \u201cAnd I think that these two have something going on together that\u2019s\u2014instead of him defending me, trying to convict me with her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Soria volunteered an explanation for the various acts and omissions of which defendant complained. He then commented: \u201cHe has not liked me from the start. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s\u2014even though he is born and raised in Delano, for some extent, the last few years of his life, he\u2019s been in Los Angeles. His people are in Los Angeles. They desperately wish to have a Los Angeles attorney or someone from down there. They don\u2019t have the money.\u201d \u201cIn this case I will [need his cooperation]. And if he\u2019s not going to place his confidence in me\u2014the trial is set May 2nd. There\u2019s adequate enough time for new counsel. I don\u2019t know if Mr. Berryman will have the same disagreements with new counsel, but I don\u2019t believe our relationship is ever going to get any better. And I\u2019ll leave it up to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">The court determined that this ground was unsupported as well: \u201cWe have appointed counsel to represent you, Mr. Berryman. ... I have seen nothing that you\u2019ve offered today that indicates that Mr. Soria is doing anything short of a journeyman job for you. [\u00b6] I\u2019m confident that your suspicions not only are not well founded based on what you\u2019ve told me, but my experience with both Mrs. Green and Mr. Soria is there certainly is no underlying conspiracy between them that is working to your disadvantage and no underlying conspiracy between them in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">Thereupon, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion. \u201cYou\u2019ve not shown grounds that would justify me granting that motion. [\u00b6] I will urge you to cooperate with Mr. Soria in the preparation of your defense. Your failure to cooperate with him will only be to your undoing and not to Mr. Soria\u2019s. And if you do fail to cooperate with him that is an unfortunate situation that you may find yourself in later on. [\u00b6] But it\u2019s not the doing of Mr. Soria and certainly not the doing of the Court. And it\u2019s inappropriate simply for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>whatever reason to keep changing attorneys until you find one that you feel that you like. . . . Your motion will be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Defendant contends that the court erred by denying his motion to relieve Soria and appoint new counsel in his place. The applicable standard of review is abuse of discretion. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 123.) No abuse appears. It was not at all unreasonable for the court to decline defendant\u2019s request for substitution: it determined\u2014soundly, in our view\u2014that each of the grounds on which he relied was either insufficient or unsupported. Certainly, it was not required to appoint an attorney whom defendant might like.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Defendant argues to the contrary. He fails to establish the merit of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">To be sure, a defendant may be entitled to an order substituting appointed counsel if he shows that, in its absence, his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel would be denied or substantially impaired. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Defendant did not make the requisite showing in his motion. Notwithstanding his present assertion, he and Soria were <em>not </em>\u201cembroiled in [such an] irreconcilable conflict\u201d that ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment was likely to result. True, defendant claimed a \u201clack of trust in, or inability to get along with,\u201d Soria. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crandell </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 833, 860 [251 Cal.Rptr. 227, 760 P.2d 423] (lead opn. by Kaufman, J.).) That was not enough. \u201c[I]f a defendant\u2019s claimed lack of trust in, or inability to get along with, an appointed attorney were sufficient to compel appointment of substitute counsel, defendants effectively would have a veto power over any appointment and by a process of elimination could obtain appointment of their preferred attorneys, which is certainly not the law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Defendant maintains that Soria admitted an \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d of the kind that compels substitution. That is not the case. Indeed, Soria stated: \u201cI agree with the Court there are probably no grounds before it to rule\u201d in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">Defendant may not attempt to make up for what was lacking in his motion by relying on matters subsequent to its denial. A reviewing court \u201cfocuses on the ruling itself and the record on which it was made. It does not look to subsequent matters . . . <em>.\u201d (People v. Douglas </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 468, 542 [268 Cal.Rptr. 126, 788 P.2d 640] (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.).) In any event, the matters on which defendant relies are without significance for present purposes. To the extent that he may be understood to assert that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>court erred by denying a similar motion he made on May 5, 1988, he is not persuasive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">B. <em>Evidence Concerning the Compensation of a Defense Expert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">In his case-in-chief, defendant called as an expert witness Stephan A. Schliebe, a criminalist. On cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to inquire into his compensation\u2014specifically, the amount. Defense counsel objected to the admissibility of such evidence on the basis of provisions including Penal Code section 987.9 and its \u201cconfidentiality requirement.\u201d The court overruled the objection. On the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry, Schliebe testified in substance that his firm had already billed about $2,500 for his services and would bill about $1,300 in addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">In relevant part, Penal Code section 987.9 provides: \u201cIn the trial of a capital case,\u201d among others, \u201cthe indigent defendant, through the defendant\u2019s counsel, may request the court for funds for the specific payment of investigators, experts, and others for the preparation or presentation of the defense. . . . <em>The fact that an application has been made shall be confidential and the contents of the application shall be confidential. </em>Upon receipt of an application, a judge of the court, other than the trial judge presiding over the case in question, shall rule on the reasonableness of the request and shall disburse an appropriate amount of money to the defendant\u2019s attorney. The ruling on the reasonableness of the request shall be made at an in camera hearing.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">Defendant contends that the court erred by overruling his Penal Code section 987.9 objection to the admissibility of evidence of Schliebe\u2019s compensation and subsequently allowing the testimony in question. We disagree. Evidence Code section 722, subdivision (b), declares that the \u201ccompensation and expenses paid or to be paid to an expert witness by the party calling him is a proper subject of inquiry by any adverse party as relevant to the credibility of the witness and the weight of his testimony.\u201d We do not read Penal Code section 987.9 to carve out an exception when the expert witness happens to be paid under its provisions. \u201cThe confidentiality requirement was evidently intended to prevent the prosecution from learning of the application for funds and thereby improperly anticipating the accused\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1132 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306].) Such a result was not threatened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>C. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct as to Guilt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Defendant contends that on numerous occasions before the jury the prosecutor engaged in misconduct as to guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">\u201cIn general, a prosecutor commits misconduct by the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to persuade either the court or the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 447 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].) His \u201cgood faith <em>vel </em>non\u201d is not \u201ccrucial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 754, 793 [276 Cal.Rptr. 827, 802 P.2d 330].) That is because the standard in accordance with which his conduct is evaluated is objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">\u201c \u2018It is, of course, the general rule that a defendant cannot complain on appeal of misconduct by a prosecutor at trial unless in a timely fashion\u2019\u2014 and on the same ground\u2014\u2018he made an assignment of misconduct and requested that the jury be admonished to disregard the impropriety.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, 976 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">After review, we reject defendant\u2019s claim at the threshold. He failed to satisfy the general rule requiring assignment of misconduct and request for admonition as to any of the comments by the prosecutor of which he now complains. No exception is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">We also reject defendant\u2019s claim on the merits. When, as here, the point focuses on comments made by the prosecutor before the jury, the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].) On this record, the answer is no. We do not overlook some apparent misstatements and other infelicities by the prosecutor. But when we consider each of the challenged comments in its context, we simply cannot conclude that the prosecutor used a method to persuade the jury that was \u201cdeceptive\u201d or \u201creprehensible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">Let us consider as representative examples the three complaints to which defendant devotes the greatest number of pages in his briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">In the course of his summation, the prosecutor sought to elucidate for the jury certain aspects of the court\u2019s charge. The court had already instructed the jury that it could find defendant not guilty of murder but guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The court would soon declare that the jury could return partial verdicts, and related findings, as to homicide, including first degree murder, second degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter. And the court would soon explain how the jury was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>complete the forms for the possible verdicts and findings. In commenting on the foregoing, the prosecutor evidently used a demonstrative aid in the form of a chart \u201cto make sure that all of you understand . . . how you would work down this ladder of lesser included offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Following our decision in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 503 [183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809] (hereafter sometimes <em>Stone), </em>we held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kurtzman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 322, 324-325 [250 Cal.Rptr. 244, 758 P.2d 572] (hereafter sometimes <em>Kurtzman), </em>that a court may \u201crestrict[ ] a jury from <em>returning a verdict </em>on a lesser included offense before acquitting on a greater offense\u201d but may not \u201cpreclude [it] from <em>considering </em>lesser offenses during its deliberations.\u201d (Italics in original.) We thereby impliedly rejected a \u201cstrict acquittal-first rule under which the jury must acquit of the greater offense before even considering lesser included offenses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">Defendant claims to discern misconduct in a number of comments by the prosecutor that arguably suggested, contrary to <em>Stone </em>and <em>Kurtzman, </em>that the jury was required to deliberate on the charges and allegations in a specified order. We do not. At most, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks may have amounted to a misstatement of the law. Even if \u201cerroneous, however, they cannot be characterized as misconduct. \u2018[A] prosecutor is not guilty of misconduct because in his argument of the law to the jury, he is wrong as to the law. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 659, 702 [250 Cal.Rptr. 687, 758 P.2d 1217].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Next, in the course of his summation, the prosecutor set out to explicate for the jury the People\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, on which the court had already given an instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>\u201c. . .

Defendant argues that, by using the words quoted above, \u201c[t]he prosecutor lessened his burden of proof and appealed to the passions of the jurors . . . .\u201d There is simply no reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an objectionable fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-12\">Last, in the course of his summation, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]o return a verdict on the first degree intentional premeditated and deliberate killing, there would be [several] elements to be proved,\u201d one of which was that a \u201chuman being was killed. . . . Well, it seems like well, that obvious. But you do have in some cases, well, it wasn\u2019t really a human being that was killed. [\u00b6] They try to place the victim outside of the pale of humanity, as it was, that person did something wrong, it was a bad person, he or she deserved this. We didn\u2019t have that in this particular case. No one could say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>a bad word against Mimi. If they could have, they would have been here on the stand. [\u00b6] That is a 17 year old girl, looking forward to her senior year, and just an absolute gem, and no one can say she deserved to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Defendant claims to discern misconduct in the comments by the prosecutor quoted above. We do not. Defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to the effect that Hildreth was \u201cjust an absolute gem\u201d were \u201cunsupported by the record . . . .\u201d That is not the case. The words in question constitute a reasonable inference from, and fair comment on, the evidence adduced at trial. Defendant also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cfalsely attribut[ed] to the defense a claim that [Hildreth] deserved to die because she was not a human being.\u201d (Underscoring omitted.) That is also not the case. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury so construed or applied the words under review. A reasonable juror would have understood and employed the language for what it was, i.e., a reasonable inference from, and fair comment on, the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">D. <em>Instructions on Lesser Included Offense and Partial Verdicts as to Homicide</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">As noted above (see pt. II.C., <em>ante), </em>the court instructed that the jury could find defendant not guilty of murder but guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. It also declared that it could return partial verdicts, and related findings, as to homicide, including first degree murder, second degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter. Finally, it explained how it was to complete the forms for the possible verdicts and findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">As also noted above (see pt. II.C., <em>ante), </em>we held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 322, after our decision in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 503, that a court may \u201crestrict[ ] a jury from <em>returning a verdict </em>on a lesser included offense before acquitting on a greater offense\u201d but may not \u201cpreclude [it] from <em>considering </em>lesser offenses during its deliberations.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 324-325, italics in original.) We thereby impliedly rejected a \u201cstrict acquittal-first rule under which the jury must acquit of the greater offense before even considering lesser included offenses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>Defendant contends that by instructing the jury as it did, the court erred under <em>Stone </em>and Kurtzman: it effectively imposed, he asserts, an acquittal-first rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">On this record, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied the challenged instructions in a manner offensive to <em>Stone </em>and <em>Kurtzman. </em>We do not overlook certain language in the instructions themselves that arguably suggested that the jury was required to deliberate on the charges and allegations in a specified order. Neither do we overlook a number of comments in the prosecutor\u2019s summation, referred to above (see pt. II.C., <em>ante), </em>to similar effect. Nevertheless, we believe that a reasonable juror would have understood and employed the instructions\u2014which he or she was directed to consider as a whole and in context\u2014simply to govern how the jury was to return its verdicts and findings after it completed its deliberations on the charges and allegations. This is because, in accordance with their very terms, the instructions spoke much of returning verdicts and findings and little of deliberating on the charges and allegations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>E. <em>Instruction on Implied Malice Aforethought</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">The court instructed the jury on the definition of murder, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cThe crime of murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The court further instructed the jury on the definition of malice aforethought, including the following: \u201c \u2018Malice\u2019 may be either express or implied. [\u00b6] Malice is express when there is manifested an intention unlawfully to kill a human being. [\u00b6] Malice is implied when the killing results from an intentional act involving a high degree of probability that it will result in death, which act is done for a base, antisocial purpose and with a wanton disregard for human life or when the killing results from an intentional act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life.\u201d (Brackets omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">Defendant contends that the court erred by instructing the jury as it did on implied malice. He argues that the instruction in question established a \u201cmandatory presumption\u201d of implied malice that relieved the People of their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on that element and thereby violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">We reject the claim. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misconstrued or misapplied the challenged instruction as a \u201cmandatory presumption\u201d of implied malice, less still as one that reduced the People\u2019s burden of persuasion in any way. Indeed, a reasonable juror would have understood and employed the instruction in accordance with what it purported to be, to wit, a <em>definition </em>of implied malice\u2014a definition, we may note, that is adequate (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dellinger </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1212, 1221, fn. 1 [264 Cal.Rptr. 841, 783 P.2d 200] [finding \u201cno error in the giving of\u2019 a substantially identical instruction]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>F. <em>Refusal of \u201cSpecial\u201d Instructions Requested by Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Defendant requested the court to give the jury the following instructions, among others: (1) \u201cSpecial Instruction No. \u2018A\u2019,\u201d which declared to the effect that first degree felony-murder-rape requires the perpetrator to form a specific intent to rape either prior to or during the commission of the fatal act; (2) \u201cSpecial Instruction No. \u2018B\u2019,\u201d which stated in part that rape must involve a live victim and \u201cnot a dead body\u201d; and (3) \u201cSpecial Instruction No. \u2018E\u2019,\u201d which would have told the jury, in language derived from <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15, 27 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942], that \u201c[b]efore you may find that the killing in this case was deliberate and premeditated, you must find evidence of planning activity, motive to kill, and a calculated killing; or extremely strong evidence of planning activity; or evidence of a motive to kill, in conjunction with either planning activity or a calculated killing,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The court refused each of the three \u201cspecial\u201d instructions. In substance, its reasoning (at least in part) was this: to the extent that it was legally correct, each of the instructions was duplicative of one or more other instructions that it intended to give.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">The court subsequently gave each of its intended standard instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">Defendant contends that the court erred by refusing each of the three \u201cspecial\u201d instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">Of course, it is not erroneous to refuse an instruction that is not legally correct. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Benson, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 799.) Indeed, it would be improper not to. (See <em>ibid.) </em>Further, \u201c[i]t is not erroneous to refuse\u201d even a legally correct instruction if it is duplicative. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 805, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">There was no error in the court\u2019s refusal of any of the three \u201cspecial\u201d instructions. The question of the appropriate standard of review need not be addressed. Even if examined de novo, the court\u2019s determination is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-11\">To be sure, it is clear that \u201cSpecial Instruction No. \u2018A\u2019 \u201d is legally correct at least in part. \u201c \u2018[I]n order to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt of first degree murder on the theory that he committed the killing during the perpetration . . . of one of the enumerated felonies . . . , the prosecution must prove that he harbored the specific intent to commit one of such enumerated felonies.\u2019 [Citation.] Additionally, the evidence must establish that the defendant harbored the felonious intent either prior to or during the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>the acts which resulted in the victim\u2019s death . . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at p. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Similarly, it is clear that \u201cSpecial Instruction No. \u2018B\u2019 \u201d is legally correct at least in part. Rape \u201cmust involve a live victim . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 269 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 841 P.2d 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">By contrast, it is doubtful whether \u201cSpecial Instruction No. \u2018E\u2019 \u201d is legally correct in any part. By its very terms, <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 15, guides appellate courts in conducting sufficiency-of-evidence review of findings by juries of premeditation and deliberation. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 24-34.) It does not even purport to constrain juries in making such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">Nevertheless, to the extent that it was legally correct, each of the three \u201cspecial\u201d instructions was indeed duplicative. Each was adequately covered by one or more of the standard instructions actually given. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied the latter so as not to embrace the substance of the former.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">G. <em>Omission of an Instruction on Involuntary Manslaughter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">Manslaughter is deemed to be related to murder as a lesser included offense. (See, e.g., 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Defenses, \u00a7 327, p. 379; compare Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a) [defining murder as the \u201cunlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice aforethought\u201d] with <em>id., </em>\u00a7 192 [defining manslaughter as the \u201cunlawful killing of a human being without malice\u201d].) As relevant here, manslaughter is voluntary, i.e., \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 192, subd. (a)), or involuntary, i.e., \u201cin the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 192, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">The court instructed the jury on murder. It also instructed on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense. Defendant had so requested. By contrast, it did not instruct on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense. Defendant had not so requested. In discussing proposed instructions, defense counsel Soria had stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is an involuntary [manslaughter] situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">Defendant contends that the court erred by failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>There was no error. A court is not obligated to instruct sua sponte on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense unless there is substantial evidence, i.e., evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal. 3d 307, 325 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311]) that the defendant killed his victim \u201cin the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to felony; or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (b)). Such evidence is lacking here. To be sure, one might speculate that defendant killed Hildreth as he perpetrated some unspecified misdemeanor or performed some unspecified act with criminal negligence. But speculation is not evidence, less still substantial evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 250 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Any error, however, would not have required reversal. Indeed, it would \u201cnecessarily [have been] harmless in light of the jury\u2019s special circumstance finding that defendant killed [Hildreth] in the perpetration of [rape]. Under this finding, the [Hildreth] killing was necessarily felony murder.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 464.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">H. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel as to Guilt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Defendant contends that defense counsel provided him with ineffective assistance as to guilt in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and/or article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">To succeed under the Sixth Amendment or article I, section 15, a defendant must show (1) deficient performance under an objective standard of professional reasonableness and (2) prejudice under a test of reasonable probability of an adverse effect on the outcome. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 215-218 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839] [discussing both the federal and state constitutional rights to the assistance of counsel].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">The prosecutor called many witnesses and used many exhibits to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. For their part, defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>called several witnesses and used several exhibits to raise such a doubt, playing on various uncertainties in the prosecutor\u2019s evidence, including uncertainties related to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Defendant claims that defense counsel performed deficiently with regard to numerous cited acts and omissions and thereby subjected him to prejudice. In large part, he simply recasts arguments for reversal that we have expressly or impliedly disposed of in the course of the preceding analysis. He is indeed forceful in presenting his complaints. We have carefully considered each in its proper context. In few, if any, instances does he show professionally unreasonable conduct. In none does he show a reasonable probability of an adverse effect on the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">For example, defendant does not establish ineffective assistance in defense counsel\u2019s asserted failure to more fully prepare criminalist Schliebe for his testimony. He does not demonstrate that fuller preparation would have yielded favorable results. Hence, he cannot demonstrate that its omission adversely affected the outcome within a reasonable probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">Neither does defendant establish ineffective assistance in defense counsel\u2019s asserted failure to investigate his mental state at the time of the crime or to introduce evidence thereon. Here as well, he does not demonstrate that the investigation would have yielded favorable results and hence cannot demonstrate that its omission adversely affected the outcome within a reasonable probability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">I. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence for the Convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">Defendant contends in substance that the evidence is insufficient under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and/or the due process clause of article I, section 15 of the California Constitution to support his convictions for rape and first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and/or the due process clause of article I, section 15, the \u201cquestion we ask is \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\u2019 \u2019\u2019\u2014and the identity of the criminal\u2014\u201c\u2018beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 269, quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573, 99 S.Ct. 2781], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Defendant claims that the evidence is insufficient to support either his rape or first degree murder conviction on the ground that it is inadequate to identify him as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">In view of the evidence described above (see pt. I.A., <em>ante), </em>a rational trier of fact could surely have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was in fact the perpetrator. One need only recall the evidence relating to defendant\u2019s pickup truck, its tires, and the tire tracks; defendant\u2019s shoes and the shoe prints; defendant\u2019s jewelry clasp; the abrasion on Hildreth\u2019s right cheek displaying a pattern similar to that of the sole of defendant\u2019s right shoe; the stain on the shoelace of defendant\u2019s right shoe apparently produced by Hildreth\u2019s blood; defendant\u2019s and Hildreth\u2019s pubic hairs found on the latter\u2019s body; Hildreth\u2019s right thumbprint on the inside surface of the passenger-door window of defendant\u2019s pickup truck; and defendant\u2019s self-incriminating statements to friends and acquaintances and to investigating law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Defendant argues to the contrary. To be sure, the inculpatory evidence is not without weaknesses in certain particulars, including the matter of time. But considered as a whole, it is altogether substantial. Defendant establishes nothing more than that some rational trier of fact might perhaps have declined to identify him as the perpetrator. That is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">Defendant separately claims that the evidence is insufficient to support his rape conviction. In particular, he argues that evidence is lacking that he engaged in sexual intercourse with Hildreth, and specifically that he accomplished penetration; that he did so without her consent; and that he did' so while she was alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">As charged here, \u201c[r]ape is an act of sexual intercourse . . . with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator\u201d \u201caccomplished against a person\u2019s will by means of force or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.\u201d (Pen. Code, former \u00a7 261, subd. (2), as amended by Stats. 1985, ch. 283, \u00a7 1, pp. 1307-1308; accord, Pen. Code, present \u00a7 261, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>subd. (a)(2); cf. <em>id., </em>\u00a7 262, subd. (a) [rape of spouse].) \u201cAny sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">Thus, for rape there must be, inter alia, an act of sexual intercourse with at least some penetration, \u201cinvolving] a live victim [citation] who does not effectively consent [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">In view of the evidence described above, a rational trier of fact could certainly have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant raped Hildreth. As to sexual intercourse with at least some penetration: Hildreth\u2019s vagina contained sperm cells. As to lack of consent: Hildreth\u2019s upper clothing had been pushed up above her chest toward her neck and the lower clothing had been pulled down around her left ankle; her right iliac or pelvic region had been abraded; and her vagina contained blood cells. As to vitality: all the injuries on Hildreth\u2019s body were ante mortem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Defendant\u2019s contrary argument again proves too little, establishing nothing more than that some rational trier of fact might perhaps have declined to find him guilty of rape. Notwithstanding his implication, the \u201cabsence of genital trauma is not inconsistent with nonconsensual sexual intercourse.\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 265.) And notwithstanding his assertion, in his summation the prosecutor did not concede lack of penetration. Defendant attempts to deny the existence of evidence that Hildreth\u2019s vagina contained sperm cells. He cannot succeed. As noted, a serologist testified that a vaginal swab revealed the \u201cpresence of sperm cells, spermatozoa.\u201d That he also testified that the swab revealed the presence of only a \u201cvery, very small amount of semen\u201d is without consequence here\u2014especially in light of the fact that defendant had apparently ejaculated not long before the rape when he engaged in sexual intercourse with Pena. One point deserves special comment. Relying on the evidence referred to in the preceding paragraph and also on the fact that Hildreth\u2019s legs were spread apart in death, a rational trier of fact could have rejected, beyond a reasonable doubt, the following scenario that defendant suggests, to wit, that he engaged in consensual sexual intercourse <em>and only thereafter </em>turned to violence: such a trier could have concluded to the requisite degree of certainty that violence accompanied sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">Finally, defendant claims that the evidence is insufficient to support his first degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">The People prosecuted the case on two theories of first degree murder. The primary was felony-murder-rape. The secondary was willful, deliberate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>and premeditated murder. In his summation, the prosecutor all but expressly withdrew the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">\u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice aforethought.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">As pertinent here, \u201c[a]ll murder which is perpetrated ... by any . . . kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing ... is murder of the first degree . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189.) The mental state required is, of course, a deliberate and premeditated intent to kill with malice aforethought. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">Similarly, \u201c[a]ll murder . . . which is committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate,\u201d certain enumerated felonies, including rape, \u201cis murder of the first degree . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189.)  The mental state required is simply the specific intent to commit the underlying felony; neither intent to kill, deliberation, premeditation, nor malice aforethought is needed. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Coefield </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 865, 868-869 [236 P.2d 570]; see, generally, 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Crimes Against the Person, \u00a7 470, p. 528; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 315, 346 [253 Cal.Rptr. 199, 763 P.2d 1289] [stating that \u201c[w]e have required as part of the felony-murder doctrine that the jury find the perpetrator had the specific intent to commit one of the enumerated felonies, even where that felony is a crime such as rape\u201d].) There is no requirement of a strict \u201ccausal\u201d (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1016 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017]) or \u201ctemporal\u201d (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 348) relationship between the \u201cfelony\u201d and the \u201cmurder.\u201d All that is demanded is that the two \u201care parts of one continuous transaction.\u201d (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1016; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 348.) There is, however, a requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the underlying felony. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitehorn </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 256, 264 [32 Cal.Rptr. 199, 383 P.2d 783].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Defendant maintains that the evidence is insufficient as to the felony-murder-rape theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">In part, defendant argues that evidence is lacking for rape. He is unpersuasive. The analysis above proves the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">In other part, defendant argues that evidence is lacking for specific intent to commit the underlying felony of rape. Again, he is unpersuasive. A rational trier of fact could surely have found the requisite intent beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>reasonable doubt. There are facts disclosing defendant\u2019s manifest desire to engage in sexual intercourse with any woman whom he could \u201cpick up\u201d: remember Pena. There are also facts disclosing Hildreth\u2019s manifest desire not to engage in sexual intercourse with him: remember the appearance and condition of her body when it was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">In still other part, defendant argues that the \u201cevidence failed to establish either an intent to kill or, if such intent existed, that it arose prior to conclusion of the rape. An intent to kill formed after termination of any actual or attempted rape, and unrelated to those offenses, would not support a felony-murder conviction . . . .\u201d Yet again, he is unpersuasive. Contrary to what appears to be his assumption, felony murder does not require intent to kill or a strict \u201ccausal\u201d or \u201ctemporal\u201d relationship between the \u201cfelony\u201d and the \u201cmurder.\u201d In any event, the relationship that a rational trier of fact could have discerned from the evidence is enough.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Defendant also maintains that the evidence is insufficient as to the willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder theory. This point need not be addressed. The conviction rests, at least, on the adequately supported felony-murder-rape theory. The fact is established by the jury\u2019s first degree murder and rape verdicts and its felony-murder-rape special-circumstance finding\u2014 which, under the instructions actually given, necessarily entail a unanimous determination of felony-murder-rape beyond a reasonable doubt. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 351 [arriving at- a similar conclusion on a similar record]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 1015-1016 [same].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">J. <em>Reversibility of the First Degree Murder Conviction Under the Green Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468] (hereafter <em>Green), </em>we stated the following rule: \u201c[W]hen the prosecution presents its case to the jury on alternate theories, some of which are legally correct and others legally incorrect, and the reviewing court cannot determine from the record on which theory the ensuing general verdict of guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>rested, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 69, disapproved on another point, <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 834, fn. 3 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45] (hereafter Guiton), we construed the rule of <em>Green </em>\u201cas applying only to cases of <em>legal </em>insufficiency\u201d and not to cases of <em>factual </em>insufficiency, i.e., those in which the evidence is insufficient. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1128, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Defendant contends that, under the rule of <em>Green, </em>his conviction for first degree murder must be reversed. We disagree. The <em>Green </em>rule simply does not apply. We have already determined from the record that the first degree murder verdict rests, at least, on the theory of felony-murder-rape. (See pt. ILL, <em>ante.) </em>To our mind, that theory is legally sufficient. Defendant argues otherwise. He asserts that the theory is \u201ctainted by reversible legal error . . . .\u201d He does not persuade: his points have previously been considered and rejected. He also argues that the theory is factually insufficient. As construed in <em>Guit\u00f3n, </em>the <em>Green </em>rule does not cover such inadequacy. All the same, the evidence is indeed sufficient. (See pt. ILL, <em>ante.)</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">III. Death-eligibility Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Defendant challenges the determination that he was subject to the death penalty. As relevant here, death eligibility is established when the defendant is convicted of murder in the first degree under at least one special circumstance. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.3.) As shown above, defendant has not successfully attacked the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty as to murder in the first degree. As shown below, he does not successfully attack its felony-murder-rape special-circumstance finding. Hence, the challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">A. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct as to Death Eligibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Defendant contends in substance that on numerous occasions before the jury the prosecutor engaged in misconduct as to death eligibility. This claim is dependent on the point charging the prosecutor with misconduct as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>guilt. The latter fails both at the threshold and on the merits. (See pt. II.C., <em>ante.) </em>So must the former.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">B. <em>Refusal of an Instruction on Intent to Kill as an Element of the Felony-murder Special Circumstance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">The felony-murder special circumstance covers the situation in which the \u201cmurder was committed while the defendant was engaged in or was an accomplice in the commission of, attempted commission of, or the immediate flight after committing or attempting to commit\u201d certain enumerated felonies, including rape. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(iii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">The felony-murder special circumstance is generally similar to felony murder. (3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Punishment for Crime, \u00a7 1582, pp. 1886-1887.) Two comments, however, should be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">The first relates to independent felonious purpose. The felony-murder special circumstance requires that the \u201cdefendant [must] commit[] the act resulting in death in order to advance an independent felonious: purpose.\u201d <em>CPeople </em>v. <em>Bonin </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 808, 850 [254 Cal.Rptr. 298, 765 P.2d 460].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">The second\u2014which is of direct concern here\u2014relates to intent to kill. In <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131, 153-154 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862] (hereafter <em>Carlos), </em>we concluded in substance that intent to kill is an element of the felony-murder special circumstance. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1104, 1147 (hereafter <em>Anderson), </em>we overruled <em>Carlos </em>and held to the contrary. But when, as here, the \u201cfelony-murder special circumstance is alleged to have occurred after <em>Carlos </em>and before <em>Anderson, </em>the former governs.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashmus, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 981.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">The court generally instructed the jury on the felony-murder-rape special circumstance alleged in this case. In most respects, it did so properly. Under the erroneous belief that <em>Anderson </em>controlled and not <em>Carlos, </em>however, it refused to instruct on the element of intent to kill. But in an evident attempt to cure error or avoid prejudice in the event that its view proved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>be unsound, it effectively instructed the jury, if it found defendant guilty of the first degree murder of Hildreth, to determine whether he killed her intentionally. As noted, the jury subsequently so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Defendant contends that the court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on intent to kill as an element of the felony-murder-rape special circumstance alleged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">The standard of review for a claim of instructional error of this kind is de novo: the question is one of law, involving as it does the determination of the applicable legal principles (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Louis </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 969, 985 [232 Cal.Rptr. 110, 728 P.2d 180]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">After independent scrutiny, we conclude that the court did indeed err. As stated, <em>Carlos </em>governs here. Under <em>Carlos, </em>intent to kill is an element of the felony-murder special circumstance. Pursuant to <em>Carlos, </em>the court should have so instructed. Its refusal to do so was error under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Odle </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 386, 412 [247 Cal.Rptr. 137, 754 P.2d 184]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539, 552 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">We further conclude, however, that the error does not require reversal. The erroneous omission of the element of intent to kill is not automatically reversible but rather is subject to harmless-error analysis under the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard for federal constitutional error laid down in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824]. (See generally, <em>People </em>v. <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 410-415.) In our view, it is not prejudicial on the facts of this case. \u201cWhen, as here, under proper instructions the jury necessarily and soundly makes a finding adverse to the defendant on an issue erroneously omitted from the instructions\u201d\u2014in this case, intent to kill\u2014\u201cthere is no prejudice arising from the omission.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 354, 371-372 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 841 P.2d 961] (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">Defendant argues to the contrary, attacking both our analysis and our conclusion. He is unpersuasive. His assertion, among others, that the jury\u2019s intentional-killing finding is ineffective for present purposes because it was allegedly not made \u201cin the context of felony-murder or the special circumstance,\u201d and did not specify that he had the \u201cintent to kill concurrent with any sexual assault\u201d or \u201csexual activity,\u201d is altogether lacking in merit. Neither \u201ccontext\u201d nor \u201cconcurrence\u201d is of any consequence. here. Notwithstanding what appears to be his assumption, the felony-murder special circumstance does not require a strict \u201ccausal\u201d or \u201ctemporal\u201d relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>between the \u201cfelony\u201d and the \u201cmurder.\u201d Indeed, as noted, it extends even to the situation in which the \u201cmurder was committed while the defendant was engaged in . . . the immediate flight <em>after </em>committing\u201d the felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(iii), italics added.) Plainly, it does not necessitate the \u201csimultaneity\u201d that defendant demands.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">C. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel as to Death Eligibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Defendant contends in substance that defense counsel provided him with ineffective assistance as to death eligibility in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and/or article I, section 15 of the California Constitution. This claim is dependent on the point charging counsel with ineffective assistance as to guilt. The latter fails. (See pt. II.H., <em>ante.) </em>So must the former.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">D. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence for the Felony-murder-rape Special-circumstance Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">Defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the felony-murder-rape special-circumstance finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">\u201c \u2018In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence for a special circumstance\u2019\u2014as for a conviction\u2014\u2018the question we ask is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 271, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickey, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 678, italics in original.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">Defendant\u2019s claim of insufficiency goes to the underlying felony of rape itself, independent felonious purpose, and intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>In view of the evidence, which is described above (see pt. I.A., <em>ante) </em>and need not be rehearsed here, a rational trier of fact could certainly have found the felony-murder-rape special-circumstance allegation to be true beyond a reasonable doubt. That is to say, such a trier of fact could surely have determined to that degree of certainty that defendant murdered Hildreth while he was engaged in raping her or at least in fleeing the crime scene immediately thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Defendant\u2019s complaint about the asserted lack of evidence of the underlying felony of rape fails. Its substance has already been assessed and found wanting. (See pt. ILL, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Defendant\u2019s complaint about the asserted lack of evidence of independent felonious purpose also fails. A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the act resulting in death in order to commit rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">Finally, defendant\u2019s complaint about the asserted lack of evidence of intent to kill fails as well. A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he sought to eliminate Hildreth as a witness to his crimes, a witness who could have identified him positively. Without question, such a trier of fact could have declined to accept as accidental the act of fatally stabbing Hildreth or the act of pressing down her cheek with the sole of a shoe as she lay dying. Defendant asserts that an \u201cintent to kill formed after termination of any actual or attempted rape, and unrelated to those offenses, would not support a felony-murder . . . special circumstance.\u201d Contrary to what appears to be his assumption, the felony-murder special circumstance does not require a strict \u201ccausal\u201d or \u201ctemporal\u201d relationship between the \u201cfelony\u201d and the \u201cmurder.\u201d In any event, the relationship that a rational trier of fact could have discerned from the evidence is enough.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">IV. Penalty Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">Defendant raises a number of claims attacking the judgment as to penalty. As will appear, none is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>A. <em>Evidence Concerning the Compensation of a Defense Expert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">As noted, in his case in mitigation defendant called as an expert witness Samuel George Benson, Jr., M.D., a psychiatrist. On cross-examination, the prosecutor sought to inquire into his compensation\u2014specifically, the amount. Defense counsel objected to the admissibility of such evidence on the basis of Penal Code section 987.9 and its \u201cconfidentiality requirement.\u201d The court overruled the objection. On the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry, Dr. Benson testified: \u201cMy fee is $250 per hour. I believe I have spent about 32 hours on this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">Defendant contends that the court erred by overruling his Penal Code section 987.9 objection to the admissibility of evidence concerning Dr. Benson\u2019s compensation and subsequently allowing the testimony in question. We reject the claim for the reasons stated against a similar point arising from the guilt phase. (See pt. II.B., <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">B. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct as to Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">Defendant contends that on numerous occasions before the jury the prosecutor engaged in misconduct as to penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">After review, we reject defendant\u2019s claim at the threshold. He failed to satisfy the general rule requiring assignment of misconduct and request for admonition as to any of the comments or questions by the prosecutor of which he now complains. No exception is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">We also reject defendant\u2019s claim on the merits. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the complained-of comments or questions in an objectionable fashion. We do not overlook some apparent misstatements and other infelicities by the prosecutor. But when we consider each of the challenged remarks and queries in its context, we simply cannot conclude that the prosecutor used a method to persuade the jury that was \u201cdeceptive\u201d or \u201creprehensible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">Let us consider as representative examples the three complaints to which defendant devotes the greatest number of pages in his briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">Defendant called his older brother Ronald Berryman as a witness in his case in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-12\">On direct examination, defense counsel Peterson elicited potentially mitigating testimony from Ronald relating to defendant\u2019s background and character. In its course, Ronald compared defendant to \u201cCasanova.\u201d Near its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>conclusion, counsel asked, \u201cRonald, you\u2019ve been convicted of a felony, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Ronald answered, \u201cYes, I have.\u201d Counsel: \u201cAs I understand it, it has something to do with marijuana, and a transaction that Rodney was involved in, too; is that right?\u201d Ronald: \u201cCorrect.\u201d Counsel: \u201cAnd Rodney spent a little time in the county jail down in Los Angeles, right?\u201d Ronald: \u201cYeah, but not that much.\u201d Counsel: \u201cYou went to state prison, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Ronald: \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor pursued the matter of Ronald\u2019s felony conviction. The following colloquy ensued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-6\">\u201cQ. And you were convicted of a felony. What felony specifically were you convicted of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-7\">\u201cA. Robbery, possession of dangerous weapons, firearms, drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-8\">\u201cQ. You?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-9\">\u201cA. Me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-10\">\u201cQ. Now, were all those incidents in which your brother was involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-11\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-12\">\u201cQ. And the one that your brother was involved in, what one was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-13\">\u201cA. That was narcotic\u2014I think that might be when I was first arrested in the city of West Covina, when they had the biggest raid there, and we got caught up in a mix, Catch 22, and got busted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-14\">\u201cQ. Sales of marijuana, from an investigation coming from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-15\">\u201cA. The West Covina High School.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-16\">\u201cQ. West Covina High School?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-17\">\u201cA. Uh-huh, it was undercover in the West Covina High School.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-18\">\u201cQ. Yeah, they thought you were selling to kids; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-19\">\u201cA. Well, not I, myself, but my brother, my brother was in high school at the time, so he was able to do that, because he was a high school kid himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-20\">\u201cQ. You were supplying the stuff and he was actually doing the transaction, the transporting?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>&lt;&lt;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-4\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">Defendant claims to discern misconduct in the questioning of Ronald by the prosecutor. We do not. The prosecutor sought to impeach Ronald\u2019s credibility. His effort in this regard was not improper. Defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary is unpersuasive. His assertion to the effect that the prosecutor \u201cintentionally elicit[ed] inadmissible and prejudicial evidence,\u201d namely, evidence that he \u201csold marijuana to kids\u201d (underscoring omitted), is without adequate support. Strictly speaking, the prosecutor did not elicit the evidence by his question. Rather, Ronald volunteered it in an answer beyond the question\u2019s scope. The prosecutor\u2019s query did not portray defendant\u2014as he would have it\u2014as a \u201ccorrupter of the youth.\u201d Indeed, at the relevant time, defendant was a youth himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">Next, in the course of his summation, the prosecutor referred to the penalty factor dealing with \u201cwhether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Any evidence of that? No, there was not. ... No evidence that while this act was occurring that he was under any extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\u201d The prosecutor also referred to the penalty factor dealing with \u201c[wjhether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or the effects of intoxication. That\u2019s the old insanity defense. Did he know what he was doing was criminal? Did he have the ability to perform it, his behavior? No indication from anyone he had any sort of psychotic break or anything even approaching it that he didn\u2019t know what he was doing was criminal. Not a factor in mitigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">Defendant claims to discern misconduct in the comments by the prosecutor quoted above. We do not. Defendant is right that the prosecutor misstated the law in remarking that the penalty factor on impairment of capacity, was \u201cthe old insanity defense\u201d (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 660, 720-721 [248 Cal.Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253])\u2014although his mistake is readily understandable (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Drew </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 333, 336-337, 339-348 [149 Cal.Rptr. 275, 583 P.2d 1318] [adopting the standard proposed by the Am. Law Inst, in Model Pen. Code (Proposed Official Draft 1962) \u00a7 4.01, subd. (1): \u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d], superseded by Pen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>Code, \u00a7 25, subd. (b).) But as noted, misstatement is not enough. Defendant is wrong, however, in the rest of his complaints. Contrary to his assertion, the prosecutor did not lead \u201cthe jury away from considering [potentially] mitigating evidence . . . .\u201d (Underscoring deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Last, in the course of his summation, the prosecutor argued that the following penalty factors \u201chad not been factors in mitigation\u201d: \u201c[W]hether or not the victim was [a] participant in the defendant\u2019s homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act\u201d; \u201cdid the defendant have a reasonable belief to be a moral justification or extenuation of his conduct?\u201d; and \u201cwhether or not the defendant acted under extreme duress or under substantial domination of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">Defendant claims to discern misconduct in the comments by the prosecutor quoted above. We do not. Defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks implied that the absence of each of the cited circumstances in mitigation amounted to the presence of a corresponding circumstance in aggravation. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury so construed or applied the words in question. A reasonable juror would have understood and employed the language to mean nothing more objectionable than the tautology that the absence of mitigation is the absence of mitigation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">C. <em>Instruction on the \u201cCircumstances of the Crime\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">In accordance with Penal Code section 190.3, as effectively construed in such decisions as <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 877-878 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813], the court instructed the jury as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">\u201cIn determining which penalty is to be imposed on . . . defendant, you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case . . . .You shall consider, take into account and be guided by the following factors, if applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>\u201c(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstance found to be true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-4\">\u201c(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-5\">\u201c(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-6\">\u201c(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-7\">\u201c(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant\u2019s homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-8\">\u201c(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstances which the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-9\">\u201c(g) Whether or not the defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-10\">\u201c(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or the affects |&gt;zc] of intoxication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-11\">\u201c(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-12\">\u201c(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice to the offense and his participation in the commission of the offense was relatively minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-13\">\u201c(k) Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime and any sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense which he is on trial. You must disregard any jury instruction given to you in the guilt or innocence phase of this trial which conflicts with this principle.\u201d (Brackets omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-14\">Defendant contends that the penalty factor dealing with the \u201ccircumstances of the crime,\u201d as specified in Penal Code section 190.3 and as set out in the instruction quoted above, is impermissibly vague under the cruel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>unusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as construed in <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>Black </em>(1992) 503 U.S. _ [117 L.Ed.2d 367, 112 S.Ct. 1130], and required clarification by the court even, as here, in the absence of a request. We reject the claim under the holding of <em>People </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo, ante, </em>page 457, at pages 478-479 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 808, 862 P.2d 808] (hereafter <em>Bacigalupo). </em>Defendant argues that the court\u2019s \u201cerror\u201d was \u201ccompounded\u201d by its refusal of two \u201cspecial\u201d instructions he requested, viz., \u201cSpecial Instruction \u20184\u2019 \u201d and \u201cSpecial Instruction \u201810\u2019.\u201d (See pt. IV.F., <em>post.) </em>There was no \u201cerror\u201d to be \u201ccompounded.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">D. <em>Instruction on Pity, Sympathy, and Mercy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">At the guilt phase, the court had instructed the jury, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cAs jurors you must not be influenced by pity for a defendant or by prejudice against him. . . . [\u00b6] You must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling. Both the People and the defendant have a right to expect that you will conscientiously consider and weigh the evidence and apply the law of the case, and that you will reach a just verdict regardless of what the consequences of such verdict may be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">At the penalty phase, defendant requested the court to give the jury, among others, \u201cSpecial Instruction \u201816,\u2019\u201d which as pertinent here would have told the jurors that \u201c[i]n this part of the trial you may consider pity, sympathy or mercy for the defendant in deciding on the appropriate penalty for him. If a mitigating circumstance or an aspect of the defendant\u2019s background or his character, called to you[r] attention by the evidence or your observation of the defendant . . . arouses sympathy or compas[s]ion such as to persuade you that death is not the appropriate penalty, you shall act in response thereto and impose a punishment of life without parole on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">The court refused. It made plain its view that \u201cSpecial Instruction \u201816\u2019\u201d was legally correct. It determined, however, that the \u201cspecial\u201d instruction was duplicative of certain other instructions that it intended to give. Defense counsel Peterson was in accord. \u201cDefense would agree .... [W]e would invite the Court to refuse this instruction on the basis that the Court has already done substantially what is being proposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-11\">The court subsequently gave, among others, the following instruction, which it had itself drafted, in accordance with its expressed intent. \u201c[Y]ou <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>were previously instructed not to consider penalty in the guilt or innocence phrase of the trial, and of course, that is your consideration in this phase. That instruction would be totally inapplicable, [\u00b6] You will also be instructed at this time that you can consider sympathy for the defendant in deciding this continuing issue, and that was, of course, precluded from the guilt or innocence phase of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">As pertinent here and noted above (see pt. IV.C., <em>ante), </em>the court told the jurors that in determining penalty they were to consider several specified factors, if applicable, including \u201c[ajny . . . circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime and any sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is on trial. You must disregard any jury instruction given to you in the guilt or innocence phase of this trial which conflicts with this principle.\u201d (Brackets omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">The court also told the jurors that in determining penalty, \u201cyou shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed. [\u00b6] The weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances does not mean a mere mechanical counting of factors on each side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignment of weights to any of them. You are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider. In weighing the various circumstances you simply determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the totality of the aggravating circumstances with the totality of the mitigating circumstances. To return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating evidence is so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of life without parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">Defendant now contends that, by instructing the jury as it did, the court erred under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In support, he effectively asserts that the instructions quoted above told the jury that in determining penalty it could not consider or give effect to pity, sympathy, or mercy, or at least did not tell it that it could. We reject the claim out of hand. A reasonable juror would have understood and employed the instructions in question to allow him to consider and give effect to pity, sympathy, and mercy to the extent he deemed appropriate in this case\u2014and indeed to require him to do so. There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misconstrued or misapplied the instructions in violation of the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment or any other legal provision or principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>E. <em>Instruction to Weigh the \u201cTotality\u201d of the Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">As noted (see pt. IV.D., <em>ante), </em>the court instructed the jury that in determining penalty, \u201cyou shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed, [\u00b6] The weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances does not mean a mere mechanical counting of factors on each side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignment of weights to any of them. You are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider. In weighing the various circumstances you simply determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the <em>totality </em>of the aggravating circumstances with the <em>totality </em>of the mitigating circumstances. To return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating evidence is so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of life without parole.\u201d (Italics added.) Defendant had requested an instruction to such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">Defendant now contends that, by instructing the jury as it did, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument appears to be this: with its language referring to the \u201ctotality\u201d of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the instruction in question erroneously implied that a single mitigating circumstance could not outweigh any and all aggravating circumstances and hence could not support a decision that death was not the appropriate punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">An instruction containing an implication of this sort would indeed have been erroneous. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 829, 857, footnote 5 [248 Cal.Rptr. 444, 755 P.2d 894], we characterized as \u201cproper\u201d an instruction that stated, inter alia, that \u201c \u2018[o]ne mitigating circumstance may be sufficient to support a decision that death is not appropriate punishment in this case.\u2019 \u201d An instruction to the contrary would obviously be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-10\">The instruction here, however, was not such. In fact, a reasonable juror would have understood and employed its words to embrace the substance of what was found proper in <em>Grant. </em>Certainly, such a juror would not have interpreted or used its language referring to the \u201ctotality\u201d of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in a \u201cdeath oriented\u201d fashion to \u201crelate[]\u201d solely to the \u201cquantity ... of the factors\u201d and not to their \u201cquality,\u201d or to entail \u201c \u2018a <em>mere mechanical counting </em>of factors on each side of the imaginary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>scale . . . (Underscoring in original.) There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misconstrued or misapplied the challenged instruction in violation of the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or any other legal provision or principle. True, an instruction like that in <em>Grant </em>would have been proper. But it was simply not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">F. <em>Refusal of \u201cSpecial\u201d Instructions Requested by Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">Defendant contends that the court erred by refusing to give the jury certain \u201cspecial\u201d instructions he requested. We shall consider his claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Defendant requested \u201cSpecial Instruction \u20181\u2019\u201d: \u201cThe only aggravating factors which you may consider are those listed in . . . the instruction I have just read to you. No other facts or circumstances may be considered in aggravation or as a reason to support a verdict of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">The court refused, reasoning in part that this \u201cspecial\u201d instruction was duplicative of another instruction that it intended to, and did in fact, give, which specified the factors to be considered in determining penalty \u201cif applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">The refusal was not error. What was express in this \u201cspecial\u201d instruction was implicit in the instruction actually given. Reasonable jurors would have understood and employed the latter to \u201callow [them] to consider [for purposes of aggravation] the listed penalty factors, \u2018if applicable,\u2019 and to prohibit [them] from considering others.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 1275 [arriving at a similar conclusion as to a similar instruction on a similar record].) There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have construed or applied the standard instruction otherwise. In this regard, we do not overlook certain of the prosecutor\u2019s comments and questions to which defendant points. As a general matter at least, the prosecutor did not mislead.

The court gave a lengthy and detailed statement of reasons. In part, it declared: \u201c[As] to factor A under [Penal Code section] 190.3, and that\u2019s the circumstances of the present offense, [\u00b6] In that situation, the Court is aware of all of the circumstances and the evidence presented. The Court is satisfied, in reviewing that evidence, that this was a particularly vicious and brutal and senseless killing of a 17 year old girl, who apparently refused to give into the amorous advances of Mr. Berryman. He thereafter forced himself on her, and stabbed her in the neck, and apparently stood over her with his foot on her face until she bled to death. [\u00b6] Then not long after that, he returns home for a little lasagne, [\u00b6] This is an extremely substantial factor in aggravation, and in the Court\u2019s view, this factor in aggravation, in and of itself, would outweigh all of the mitigating circumstances . . . .\u2019\u2019In our view, the court satisfied the requirements of Penal Code section 190.4, subdivision (e). Its denial of modification was sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">Defendant argues to the contrary. Unpersuasively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">For example, defendant asserts that the court read the probation report before ruling on the verdict-modification application. Even if it did, \u201cabsent evidence in the record to the contrary, we must assume that the court was not improperly influenced\u201d thereby. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adcox </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 207, 274 [253 Cal.Rptr. 55, 763 P.2d 906].) No improper influence appears. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s claim, reversal is not required by the Fifth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or by any other legal provision or principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">Defendant asserts that the court did not independently reweigh the evidence. The record is otherwise. The court\u2019s statement of reasons reveals that it recognized, and actually discharged, its obligation in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>On a related point, defendant asserts that the court did not <em>properly </em>reweigh the evidence. His complaint is essentially a disagreement with the result. It is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Defendant may be understood to assert that the court could not have independently and properly reweighed the evidence in the absence of \u201cfindings\u201d by the jury on aggravating and mitigating circumstances. We disagree. Contrary to what appears to be his assumption, the court is required to review the verdict of death itself and not any underlying \u201cfindings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">Defendant also asserts that the court failed or refused to consider evidence he had offered in mitigation. Here too, the record is otherwise. The court\u2019s statement of reasons proves the point. Defendant maintains that the court \u201crelied upon and was misled by\u201d the probation report. We cannot so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">Defendant cites the court\u2019s omission of reference to certain potentially mitigating background and character evidence. \u201cAlthough the trial court did not expressly <em>mention </em>the [potentially] mitigating evidence referred to by defendant, there is no indication in the record that the court ignored or overlooked such evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 589, 625 [244 Cal.Rptr. 200, 749 P.2d 854], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">Defendant appears to assume that the court was required to conclude that the evidence he had offered in mitigation did in fact amount to a mitigating circumstance. The assumption is unsound. One matter deserves specific mention. The court stated: \u201cNext factor I want to comment on is I, which is age of the defendant at the time of the incident, was 21 years of age.\u201d \u201cAlthough the defendant was young at that particular point in time, he was not that young, and he had been out of school for several years, he was married, had a child. As far as this Court is concerned, that factor is a neutral factor in this particular case.\u201d Defendant argues that this penalty factor in Penal Code section 190.3 is impermissibly vague under the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We have held contra. (See fn. 21, <em>ante.) </em>Defendant then argues that the court was required by the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to find that his age was in fact a mitigating circumstance. It was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">In addition, defendant asserts that the court found aggravating circumstances that were not specified in Penal Code section 190.3 or, if specified, were not supported by the evidence. That is simply not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">Defendant also asserts that the court converted \u201cmitigating evidence into aggravating evidence\u201d and \u201cmitigating circumstances into nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\u201d That is also not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>H. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel as to Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Defendant contends that defense counsel provided him with ineffective assistance as to penalty in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and/or article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">At the penalty phase, the prosecutor called only a few witnesses in the case in aggravation. For their part, defense counsel called more than a score in the case in mitigation, presenting, inter alia, evidence about defendant\u2019s background and character from the mouths of family members and friends and also from a psychologist and a psychiatrist. After the penalty phase, they made several motions, including the verdict-modification application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Defendant claims that defense counsel performed deficiently with regard to numerous cited acts and omissions and thereby subjected him to prejudice. In large part, he simply recasts arguments for reversal that we have expressly or impliedly disposed of in the course of the preceding analysis. He is indeed forceful in presenting his complaints. We have carefully considered each in its proper context. In few if any instances does he show professionally unreasonable conduct. In none does he show a reasonable probability of an adverse effect on the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">For example, defendant does not establish ineffective assistance in defense counsel\u2019s asserted failure to pursue neurological testing to determine whether and to what extent he suffered from an organic mental syndrome or disorder. He does not demonstrate that such testing would have yielded favorable results. Hence, he cannot demonstrate that its omission adversely affected the outcome within a reasonable probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">Neither does defendant establish ineffective assistance in defense counsel\u2019s asserted failure to further investigate his background and character and then to introduce additional evidence thereon. He does not demonstrate that such further investigatory efforts would have yielded favorable results. Hence, he cannot demonstrate that their omission adversely affected the outcome within a reasonable probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">Further, defendant does not establish ineffective assistance in defense counsel Peterson\u2019s decision not to personally prepare witnesses for their testimony: \u201cI . . . make it a practice to not talk directly with witnesses but have that done by investigation\u201d\u2014evidently to avoid suspicion of \u201ccoaching.\u201d He does not demonstrate that personal preparation would have yielded favorable results. Hence, he cannot demonstrate that its omission adversely affected the outcome within a reasonable probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>In addition, defendant does not establish ineffective assistance in defense counsel Peterson\u2019s opening statement or summation. We have reviewed, among all the others, Peterson\u2019s comments in his opening statement and summation to the effect that a governor could, but would not, commute any sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole imposed on defendant. The remarks appear to be a reasonable attempt to anticipate and allay a possible concern on the part of the jurors. We have also reviewed Peterson\u2019s argument for life in his summation, the gravamen of which was that a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole was severe and sufficient punishment in this case. The plea, although not as positive as defendant now asserts it should have been, seems a reasonable effort in light of the evidence introduced as to the criminal and his crime. Finally, we have reviewed Peterson\u2019s comment in his summation that \u201cgiving you the greatest latitude, it took you 15 minutes to reach a verdict\u201d at the guilt phase and \u201c[t]hat was an insult to [the trial judge], to the prosecutor, and to the defense attorney, but it is your verdict.\u201d The remark was indeed intemperate. But it was also brief. It did not deny defendant effective assistance.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">I. <em>Constitutionality of the 1978 Death Penalty Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">Defendant contends that the 1978 death penalty law is facially invalid under the United States and California Constitutions, and hence that the judgment of death entered pursuant thereto is unsupported as a matter of law. \u201c[A]s a general matter at least, the 1978 death penalty law is facially valid under the federal and state charters. In his argument here, defendant raises certain specific constitutional challenges. But. . . in the . . . series of cases [beginning with <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 777-779 (230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113)], we have rejected each and every one.

Defendant contends that the sentence of death imposed on him violates this prohibition. In view of the evidence adduced at trial, which is described above (see pt. I, <em>ante) </em>and need not be rehearsed here, we must reject the claim as lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">K. <em>Constitutionality of the Method of Execution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">As originally enacted, Penal Code section 3604 provided that the \u201cpunishment of death shall be inflicted by the administration of a lethal gas.\u201d (Stats. 1941, ch. 106, \u00a7 15, p. 1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">In his opening brief, defendant raised the contention that this method of execution amounts to \u201ccruel and unusual punishment[]\u201d within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and/or \u201c[cjruel or unusual punishment\u201d within the meaning of article I, section 17 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">Subsequent to the filing of defendant\u2019s opening brief, the Legislature amended Penal Code section 3604 to provide that the \u201cpunishment of death shall be inflicted by the administration of a lethal gas <em>or by an intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause </em>death\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd.

In his reply brief, defendant states his point is now \u201cmoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">In any event, the claim must be rejected out of hand as a ground for reversal of the judgment of death. It bears solely on the legality of the execution of the sentence and not on the validity of the sentence itself.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>V.

There was no error, however, under <em>Stone </em>and <em>Kurtzman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">We recognize that in <em>Kurtzman </em>we broadly stated that instructions like those under challenge here \u201cmay confuse jurors . . . as to how deliberations should proceed,\u201d \u201cmay create ambiguity as to just what is prohibited and what is required,\u201d and are \u201cpotentially misleading.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 336.) \u201cWhatever its validity in the abstract, that statement does not affect our view as to how a reasonable juror would have . . . understood [or employed] the instructions actually given in this case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickey </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 673, fn. 10 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84] [rejecting a claim of error against similar instructions on a similar record].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">Whether and when an erroneous instruction imposing an acquittal-first rule would be reversible is a difficult question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-12\">Error of this sort appears to implicate California law only. \u201cIt is the general rule for error under state law that reversal requires prejudice and prejudice in turn requires a reasonable probability of an effect on the outcome.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1253 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251].)

From the defendant\u2019s standpoint, it may prevent any conviction at all; a jury unable either to convict or acquit on the greater charge will not be able to reach a lesser charge on which it might have been able to agree. But it entails disadvantages to both sides as well: By insisting on unanimity with respect to acquittal on the greater charge before the jury can move to the lesser, it may prevent the Government from obtaining a conviction on the lesser charge that would otherwise have been forthcoming and thus require the expense of a retrial. It also presents dangers to the defendant. If the jury is heavily for conviction on the greater offense, dissenters favoring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>lesser may throw in the sponge rather than cause a mistrial that would leave the defendant with no conviction at all, although the jury might have reached sincere and unanimous agreement with respect to the lesser charge.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Tsanas </em>(2d Cir. 1978) 572 F.2d 340, 346, fn. omitted (per Friendly, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">As stated, in the abstract, an acquittal-first instruction appears capable of either helping or harming either the People or the defendant. In any given case, however, it will likely be a matter of pure conjecture whether the instruction had any effect, whom it affected, and what the effect was. Certainly, even if we could conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury in this case construed or applied the challenged instructions as imposing an acquittal-first rule, on this record we could not conclude that defendant suffered prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">Defendant claims in effect that the asserted instructional error amounts, at'least in this case, to error violative of, inter alia, the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
