J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkK\">In <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 103 [43 L.Ed.2d 54, 95 S.Ct. 854] (hereafter <em>Gerstein), </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of \u201cprobable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime\u201d as a prerequisite to an extended pretrial detention following a warrantless arrest, <em>(id., </em>at pp. 114, 120 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 65, 69].) The court stopped short of mandating a specific timetable for making a \u201cprompt\u201d determination of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">In <em>County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 44 [114 L.Ed.2d 49, 111 S.Ct. 1661] (hereafter <em>McLaughlin), </em>the high court sought to further define the \u201cpromptness\u201d requirement for making the probable cause determination mandated in <em>Gerstein. </em>The court held that, \u201cTaking into account the competing interests articulated in <em>Gerstein, </em>we believe that a jurisdiction that provides judicial determinations of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest will, as a general matter, comply with the promptness requirement of <em>Gerstein.\u201d (McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 63, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1670].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Neither <em>Gerstein </em>nor <em>McLaughlin </em>was a juvenile detention case. In contrast, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 253 [81 L.Ed.2d 207, 104 S.Ct. 2403] (hereafter <em>Schall) </em>did directly address the constitutional parameters of a key provision of New York State\u2019s <em>juvenile </em>pretrial detention statute. <em>Schall </em>was decided nine years after <em>Gerstein </em>but seven years prior to <em>McLaughlin. Schall, </em>and other decisions of the high court, make it abundantly clear that Fourth Amendment and related due process claims pertaining to the pretrial detention of juveniles following warrantless arrests for criminal activity cannot be viewed in the same light as similar challenges to adult detentions. This is so because, in the words of the Supreme Court, juvenile proceedings are \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from adult criminal proceedings, requiring that a \u201cbalance\u201d be struck between the \u201cinformality\u201d and \u201cflexibility\u201d that must of necessity inhere in juvenile proceedings, and the further requirement that those proceedings comport with the juvenile\u2019s constitutional rights, and the \u201c \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 demanded by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 263 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">In July of 1991, the Los Angeles County Juvenile Court, after consultation with county counsel, adopted the \u201cofficial position\u201d that McLaughlin\u2019s strict 48-hour rule does not apply in <em>juvenile </em>detention proceedings,  We granted review in this case to determine whether that position passes constitutional muster, or whether <em>McLaughlin\u2019s </em>48-hour rule strictly applies to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>pretrial detention of adults and juveniles alike following warrantless arrest for criminal activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">It is beyond dispute that Gerstein's constitutional requirement of a <em>prompt </em>judicial determination of probable cause for the extended pretrial detention of any person arrested without a warrant applies to juveniles as well as adults. However, for reasons to be explained, and having considered the comprehensive analysis the court invoked in <em>Schall </em>to scrutinize the constitutionality of the juvenile detention provisions there at issue, we have concluded that the high court did not intend that the strict 48-hour rule subsequently announced in McLaughlin\u2014a ruling handed down in a case involving the pretrial detention of adults\u2014should automatically apply in the juvenile detention setting. To conclude otherwise we would have to ignore the fundamental differences between adult and juvenile proceedings recognized in all of the high court\u2019s cases that have specifically addressed juvenile detention issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">As will be explained, California\u2019s juvenile detention statutes basically afford juvenile detainees who have been arrested without a warrant a formal, adversarial \u201cdetention hearing\u201d within 72 hours of a warrantless arrest, which proceeding incorporates the \u201cprobable cause\u201d determination mandated under <em>Gerstein, supra, </em>420 U.S. 103. The relevant statutes also prescribe various other procedures designed to ensure that an arrested juvenile will be released, in accordance with well-established and codified policies, at the earliest possible time following arrest, preferably to the custody of a parent or legal guardian. Given the fundamental difference in purpose and procedure between the treatment of adult and juvenile detainees, we have further concluded that <em>juvenile </em>detainees are constitutionally entitled to a judicial \u201cprobable cause\u201d determination within 72 hours of arrest, consistent with the integrated provisions of our juvenile detention statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">On July 24, 1991, petitioner Alfredo A., a minor, was taken into custody without a warrant pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code sections 602 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>and 625<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on suspicion of having possessed cocaine base for sale on that date. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\">On July 25, 1991, petitioner sought his immediate release by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District. He based his challenge to his postarrest detention on the holding in <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44, alleging that he was a juvenile who had been arrested without a warrant the previous day for commission of a criminal offense, and that: \u201cPursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination of probable cause for his continued detention within 48 hours of his arrest. No such judicial determination has been made, and no determination will be made within the 48-hour period. This is because the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Juvenile Court, has adopted as its \u2018official position\u2019 that a juvenile is not entitled to such a prompt probable cause determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Several weeks prior to petitioner\u2019s arrest, the Presiding Judge of the Los Angeles County Juvenile Court sent a memorandum to all juvenile court judges, commissioners, and referees, indicating that county counsel had furnished the juvenile court with an opinion concluding that McLaughlin's 48-hour rule does not apply in juvenile court proceedings. County counsel based that determination on the reasoning of <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. 253, in which a New York juvenile \u201cpreventive detention\u201d statute was found facially valid under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The presiding judge and supervising judges thereafter unanimously agreed to adopt county counsel\u2019s position as the Los Angeles County Juvenile Court\u2019s \u201coffical position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">By an order to show cause filed the following day, the Court of Appeal determined to treat the petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a petition for a writ of mandate, and directed respondent Los Angeles County Superior Court to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue ordering that judicial probable cause determinations for the extended post-arrest detention of juveniles be made within 48 hours of their arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">On that same day, July 26, 1991, a wardship petition was filed in the juvenile court alleging petitioner came within the provisions of section 602 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>by having violated Health and Safety Code sections 11351 and 11351.5 on July 24, 1991. However, when petitioner appeared in court on the next \u201cjudicial day\u201d (July 29, 1991), no detention report was provided to the juvenile court in preparation for the detention hearing, and petitioner was ordered immediately released. He thereafter waived the statutory time limitations for arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">In the mandamus proceeding, petitioner acknowledged that his release after spending five days in custody rendered the petition moot as to him. The Court of Appeal nonetheless determined to hear and decide petitioner\u2019s systemic challenge to the juvenile court\u2019s \u201cofficial position,\u201d concluding that similar claims had proved \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d because \u201creview usually takes longer than the [challenged] temporary detention . . . .\u201d (See <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 256, fn. 3 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 212]; <em>Gerstein, supra, 420 </em>U.S. at pp. 110-111, fn. 11 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 63].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">In its opinion, the Court of Appeal reviewed the relevant provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code governing pretrial detention of juvenile arrestees. After determining that the juvenile detention issue in this case must be evaluated in light of the constitutional analysis conducted in <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. 253, the court concluded that California\u2019s statutory postarrest juvenile detention scheme withstands constitutional scrutiny, reasoning that: \u201c[The] statutes provide procedural safeguards that accommodate the individual\u2019s right to liberty and the state\u2019s duty to control crime. They reflect the balance that must be struck between the informality and flexibility of juvenile proceedings even as they comport with the fundamental fairness required by due process. The statutory scheme protects a minor\u2019s right to freedom, consistent with the state interest in protecting the minor and society.\u201d Implicit in these conclusions was the court\u2019s rejection of petitioner\u2019s claim that McLaughlin\u2019s strict 48-hour rule applies to juvenile as well as adult postarrest detention proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">A. <em>Mootness of Petitioner\u2019s Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">As noted, petitioner acknowledges that his release after spending five days in pretrial custody has technically rendered this proceeding moot as to him. The Court of Appeal nevertheless determined to hear and decide the claim. We agree that the issue, as presented in this case, is ripe for resolution. The high court reached a similar conclusion in <em>Schall </em>and <em>Gersteim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">\u201cAlthough the pretrial detention of the class representatives has long since ended, . . . this case is not moot for the same reason that the class action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number><em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 110, [f]n. 11 (1975) [43 L.Ed.2d 54, 63, 95 S.Ct. 854], was not mooted by the termination of the claims of the named plaintiffs. \u2018Pretrial detention is by nature temporary, and it is most unlikely that any given individual could have his constitutional claim decided on appeal before he is either released or convicted. The individual could nonetheless suffer repeated deprivations, and it is certain that other persons similarly situated will be detained under the allegedly unconstitutional procedures. The claim, in short, is one that is distinctly \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 256, fn. 3 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 212].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\">B. <em>Relevant Statutory Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">In order to meaningfully examine and apply the controlling constitutional principles and case law, we need a brief overview of the relevant statutory provisions that govern juvenile detentions following warrantless arrests in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Under our juvenile criminal justice system, a peace officer can take a minor into temporary custody for violating a federal or state law, or a local ordinance. (\u00a7\u00a7 602, 625, subd. (a); see, <em>ante, </em>at p. 1217, fn. 2.) When a minor is arrested and detained on suspicion of having committed a crime, the minor is not formally \u201ccharged\u201d with the crime in the sense that adult arrestees are criminally prosecuted. Rather, a determination is made whether to commence wardship proceedings with the filing of a petition by the prosecuting attorney pursuant to section 602. (\u00a7 650, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">Various official functions must be performed at the time of the juvenile\u2019s arrest, and within the initial 24- to 48-hour period following the arrest\u2014all patently designed to ensure that the detained minor is afforded every reasonable opportunity for his or her immediate release, preferably to a parent or guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Hence, the arresting officer may release the minor outright (\u00a7 626, subd. (a)), deliver him or her to a public or private shelter facility in contract with the city or county to provide shelter care, counseling, or diversion services to such minors <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)), or release the minor on his or her written promise to appear before a county juvenile probation officer, or to a parent, guardian, or other responsible relative, who may also be required to execute a written promise to appear along with the minor <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)). If the arresting officer elects instead to deliver custody of the minor directly to the county probation officer, the officer must prepare a concise, written statement of the probable cause for taking the minor into temporary custody, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>be furnished along with custody of the minor to the juvenile probation officer within 24 hours of the initial detention following the arrest. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">The policy underlying this choice of dispositions provided for in section 626 is expressly set forth in the statute: \u201cIn determining which disposition of the minor to make, <em>the officer shall prefer the alternative which least restricts the minor\u2019s freedom of movement, </em>provided that alternative is compatible with the best interests of the minor and the community.\u201d (\u00a7 626, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">When custody of the minor is transferred to a probation officer at a juvenile hall or any other place of confinement, the detaining officer is further required to \u201ctake immediate steps to notify the minor\u2019s parent, guardian, or responsible relative that such minor is in custody and the place where he is being held.\u201d (\u00a7 627, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Section 628 requires the juvenile probation officer to \u201cimmediately investigate the circumstances of the minor and the facts surrounding his being taken into custody,\u201d and further requires the officer to \u201cimmediately release the minor to the custody of his parent, guardian, or responsible relative unless one or more . . . [specified] conditions exist. . . .\u201d (See <em>post, </em>at pp. 1221-1222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">Like the arresting officer, the county juvenile probation officer is empowered with discretion at the intake-investigatory stage to \u201cadjust the situation which brings the minor within the jurisdiction [or probable jurisdiction] of the court\u201d by \u201cdelineating] specific programs of supervision for the minor,\u201d or referring the case to another agency, arranging for informal supervision, or requesting the district attorney to prepare a wardship petition for filing. (\u00a7 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">A minor taken into custody must be released within 48 hours, excluding \u201cnonjudicial days,\u201d unless a wardship petition is filed within that initial 48-hour period. (\u00a7631, subd. (a).) If a section 602 petition is filed, the minor must be afforded a formal, adversarial \u201cdetention hearing\u201d in juvenile court \u201cas soon as possible but in any event [no later than] the expiration of the next judicial day after a petition to declare the minor a ward . . . has been filed\u201d\u2014i.e., 48 to 72 hours after arrest (excluding \u201cnonjudicial days\u201d). (\u00a7 632, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">If the offense for which the minor is taken into custody is \u201ca misdemeanor that does not involve violence, the threat of violence, or possession or use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>a weapon, and if the minor is not currently on probation or parole,\u201d then the minor must be released within 48 hours after having been taken into custody (again, excluding \u201cnonjudicial days\u201d) unless a wardship petition is filed <em>and </em>\u201cthe minor has been ordered detained by a judge or referee of the juvenile court pursuant to Section 635\u201d within that initial 48-hour period. (\u00a7631, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">Most significantly, when a minor is detained on suspicion of criminal activity, in contrast to an adult detained under similar circumstances, the inquiry into the propriety of the extended detention is much broader in scope than a determination, in the strict Fourth Amendment sense, of whether \u201cfactual\u201d probable cause exists to believe the minor committed the crime for which he was taken into custody. Section 628 lists seven \u201cconditions,\u201d one or more of which must be found to exist in order to warrant detaining the minor and scheduling a detention hearing within 72 hours of his or her arrest (again, excluding \u201cnonjudicial\u201d days). These conditions include whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-5\">\u201c(1) The minor is in need of proper and effective parental care or control and has no parent, guardian, or responsible relative; or has no parent, guardian, or responsible relative willing to exercise or capable of exercising such care or control; or has no parent, guardian, or responsible relative actually exercising such care or control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-6\">\u201c(2) The minor is destitute or is not provided with the necessities of life or is not provided with a home or suitable place of abode.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-7\">\u201c(3) The minor is provided with a home which is an unfit place for him by reason of neglect, cruelty, depravity or physical abuse of either of his parents, or of his guardian or other person in whose custody or care he is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-8\">\u201c(4) Continued detention of the minor is a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the minor or reasonably necessary for the protection of the person or property of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-9\">\u201c(5) The minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-10\">\u201c(6) The minor has violated an order of the juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-11\">\u201c(7) The minor is physically dangerous to the public because of a mental or physical deficiency, disorder or abnormality.\u201d (\u00a7 628, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">Section 635 sets forth the factors to be considered by the juvenile court at the detention hearing, and the standard the court must apply, in evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>the probation officer\u2019s findings pursuant to section 628 and determining whether to continue the minor\u2019s detention or order his or her release from custody. The section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1256-4\">\u201cThe court will examine such minor, his parent, guardian, or other person having relevant knowledge, hear such relevant evidence as the minor, his parent or guardian or their counsel desires to present, and, unless it appears that such minor has violated an order of the juvenile court or has escaped from the commitment of the juvenile court or that it is a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of such minor or reasonably necessary for the protection of the person or property of another that he be detained or that such minor is likely to flee to avoid the jurisdiction of the court, the court shall make its order releasing such minor from custody, [fl] The circumstances and gravity of the alleged offense may be considered, in conjunction with other factors, to determine whether it is a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the minor or reasonably necessary for the protection of the person or property of another that the minor be detained.\u201d (\u00a7 635.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1256-5\">The minor and his or her parent or guardian have the right to be represented by counsel at every stage of the detention proceedings. (\u00a7 633.) If the minor or the parent or guardian is indigent or cannot otherwise afford an attorney, counsel will be appointed by the court. (\u00a7 634.) In any case in which it appears to the court that there is a conflict of interest between a parent or guardian and the minor, separate counsel may be appointed for the minor and the parent or guardian. <em>(Ibid.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">As is evident from the foregoing summary of the relevant statutory provisions, the determination whether to detain a <em>minor </em>following a warrant-less arrest for criminal activity is a complex one, requiring consideration of various factors personal to the minor and his family situation (\u00a7 628), and the application of several important statutory presumptions favoring the minor\u2019s early release to a parent, guardian or responsible relative (\u00a7\u00a7 626, 628, 631, subd. (a)), or, if extended detention is warranted, selection of the detention alternative most \u201ccompatible with the best interests of the minor . . . ,\u201d and \u201cwhich least restricts the minor\u2019s freedom of movement\u201d (\u00a7 626). These presumptions, and the policies they implement, are unique to juvenile detention proceedings and are <em>not </em>implicated when a judicial determination is made whether factual probable cause exists to extend the detention of an adult arrestee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">Bearing these distinctions in mind, we turn next to the opinions in <em>Gerstein, supra, </em>420 U.S. 103 [43 L.Ed.2d 54, 95 S.Ct. 854], <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. 253 [81 L.Ed.2d 207, 104 S.Ct. 2403], <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>U.S. 44, and, most recently, <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1993) 507 U.S__[123 L.Ed.2d 1,113 S.Ct. 1439] (hereafter Flores), to see if those decisions will support an inference that the high court intended the strict 48-hour rule announced in <em>Mclaughin </em>to apply in juvenile detention proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">C. <em>Applicability of McLaughlin\u2019s 48-Hour Rule to Juvenile Detention Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">In <em>Gerstein, supra, </em>420 U.S. 103, the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional Florida procedures under which persons arrested without a warrant could be kept in police custody for 30 days or more without a probable cause determination. The court held that the Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of \u201cprobable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime\u201d as a prerequisite to an extended pretrial detention following a warrantless arrest. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 114, 120 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 65, 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">In <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44, the court reiterated some of the competing policy concerns underlying its earlier holding in <em>Gerstein:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">\u201cIn reaching this conclusion we attempted to reconcile important competing interests. On the one hand, States have a strong interest in protecting public safety by taking into custody those persons who are reasonably suspected of having engaged in criminal activity, even where there has been no prior opportunity for a prior judicial determination of probable cause. 420 U.S., at 112 [43 L.Ed.2d at page 64]. On the other hand, prolonged detention based on incorrect or unfounded suspicion may unjustly \u2018imperil [a] suspect\u2019s job, interrupt his source of income, and impair his family relationships.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at page 65]. We sought to balance these competing concerns by holding that States \u2018must provide a fair and reliable determination of probable cause as a condition for any significant pretrial restraint of liberty, and this determination must be made by a judicial officer either before <em>or promptly after </em>arrest.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 125 [43 L.Ed.2d at pages 71-72] (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">\u201c[We] thus established a \u2018practical compromise\u2019 between the rights of individuals and the realities of law enforcement. <em>Id., </em>at 113 [43 L.Ed.2d at page 65]. Under <em>Gerstein, </em>warrantless arrests are permitted but persons arrested without a warrant must promptly be brought before a neutral magistrate for a judicial determination of probable cause. <em>Id., </em>at 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at page 65]. Significantly, the Court stopped short of holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>jurisdictions were constitutionally compelled to provide a probable cause hearing immediately upon taking a suspect into custody and completing booking procedures. We acknowledged the burden that proliferation of pretrial proceedings places on the criminal justice system and recognized that the interests of everyone involved, including those persons who are arrested, might be disserved by introducing further procedural complexity into an already intricate system. <em>Id., </em>at 119-123 [43 L.Ed.2d at pages 68-71], Accordingly, we left it to the individual States to integrate prompt probable cause determinations into their differing systems of pretrial procedures. <em>Id., </em>at 123-124 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 70-71].\u201d <em>(McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 53 [114 L.Ed.2d at pp. 60-61, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1668].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">In <em>Gerstein, </em>the court explained that the Fourth Amendment does not require that the arrestee be afforded the \u201cfull panoply of adversary safeguards\u2014counsel, confrontation, cross-examination, and compulsory process for witnesses\u201d in connection with a judicial determination of probable cause. <em>(Gerstein, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 119 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 68].) The court delineated the scope of that determination as follows: \u201cThe sole issue is whether there is probable cause for detaining the arrested person pending further proceedings. . . . The standard is the same as that for arrest. That standard\u2014probable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime\u2014 traditionally has been decided by a magistrate in a nonadversary proceeding on hearsay and written testimony . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 120 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 69], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">In contrast, the constitutional parameters of <em>juvenile </em>detentions were directly at issue in <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. 253, a case decided nine years after <em>Gerstein, supra, </em>420 U.S. 103. In <em>Schall, </em>the court found the juvenile \u201cpreventive detention\" provisions of the New York Family Court Act facially valid under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The New York statute authorized the detention of a juvenile arrested for the commission of a crime when there is a \u201cserious risk\u201d the juvenile \u201cmay before the return date commit an act which if committed by an adult would constitute a crime.\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 255 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 211], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Whereas the sole issue in <em>Gerstein </em>was whether there was factual probable cause to detain the adult arrestee pending further proceedings\u2014i.e., the same standard as that for arrest: \u201cprobable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime\u201d <em>(Gerstein, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 120 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. <em>69])\u2014Schall </em>makes it abundantly clear that, where <em>juvenile </em>detentions are concerned, such a factual probable cause determination <em>is but one component </em>of the broader inquiry implicated in the determination whether to extend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>pretrial detention of a juvenile arrested without a warrant for criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\">In <em>Schall, </em>three juveniles were detained for more than six days before being afforded a \u201cprobable cause\u201d hearing\u2014the functional equivalent of a \u201cdetention hearing\u201d\u2014pursuant to the provisions of the New York Family Court Act. <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 257-260 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 212-214].) The juveniles were brought before the family court for an \u201cinitial appearance\u201d within one day following their arrests. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under New York law, at the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d the family court judge makes a preliminary determination as to the jurisdiction of the court, appoints counsel, and advises the minor of his or her rights. <em>(Id.., </em>at pp. 257-258, fn. 5 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 212-213].) If the family court is not in session, the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d must be conducted \u201cwithin 72 hours or the next day the court is in session, whichever is sooner.\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 257-258, fn. 5 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 212-213], refering to the New York Family Court Act, \u00a7 307.3(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">The high court first explained in <em>Schall: </em>\u201cThere is no doubt that the Due Process Clause is applicable in juvenile proceedings. \u2018The problem,\u2019 we have stressed, \u2018is to ascertain the precise impact of the due process requirement upon such proceedings.\u2019 <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 13-14 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 538-539, 87 S.Ct. 1428] (1967). We have held that certain basic constitutional protections enjoyed by adults accused of crimes also apply to juveniles. See <em>id., </em>at 31-57 [18 L.Ed.2d at pages 548-563] (notice of charges, right to counsel, privilege against self-incrimination, right to confrontation and cross-examination); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068] (1970) (proof beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519 [44 L.Ed.2d 346, 95 S.Ct. 1779] (1975) (double jeopardy). But the Constitution does not mandate elimination of all differences in the treatment of juveniles. See, <em>e.g., McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. 528 [29 L.Ed.2d 647, 91 S.Ct. 1976] (1971) (no right to jury trial). The State has \u2018a <em>parens patriae </em>interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child,\u2019 <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 766 [71 L.Ed.2d 599, 615, 102 S.Ct. 1388] (1982), which makes a juvenile proceeding fundamentally different from an adult criminal trial. We have tried, therefore, to strike a balance\u2014to respect the \u2018informality\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 that characterize juvenile proceedings, <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>at 366 [25 L.Ed.2d at page 377], and yet to ensure that such proceedings comport with the \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 demanded by the Due Process Clause. <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>at 531 [44 L.Ed.2d at page 356]; <em>McKeiver, supra, </em>at 543 [29 L.Ed.2d at pages 659-660] (plurality opinion).\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 263 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">The court in <em>Schall </em>did initially indicate, in a footnote to its opinion, that the propriety of any detention \u201cprior to a juvenile\u2019s initial appearance in Family Court\u201d was not directly at issue in that case. <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>at pp. 257-258, fn. 5 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 212-213].) This was so because the petitioners had been afforded an \u201cinitial appearance,\u201d and therefore were not directly challenging the period of detention from arrest until their first appearance in court. But one must read on in <em>Schall, </em>for the high court had elected to decide the class members\u2019 facial challenge to the constitutionality of the New York juvenile preventive detention statute even though petitioners\u2019 individual cases were moot due to their release from custody. <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 256, fn. 3 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 212].) The court then went on to consider the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d requirement along with the other procedural components of the statutory juvenile detention scheme. Acknowledging that the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d could be adjourned <em>for up to 72 hours, </em>and that \u201cthe Family Court judge is not required to make a finding of probable cause at the initial appearance,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court nevertheless concluded that the lack of a requirement that factual probable cause be determined at the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d \u201c[did] not, under the circumstances, amount to a deprivation of due process.\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 275-276, and fn. 27 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 224-225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">The high court went on to explain that New York\u2019s preventive detention statute served the dual legitimate state objectives of protecting both society and the juvenile from the hazards of further criminal activity, by undertaking enforcement of the criminal law for the sake and protection of the community generally, while also serving as <em>parens patriae </em>for the benefit of the minor-detainee. <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 264-274 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 216-224].) The court ultimately concluded the procedural protections afforded postarrest juvenile detainees under the New York statute satisfied the requirements of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and found the statutory scheme facially valid. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">For purposes of responding to petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim in this case, it is important to note that the high court in <em>Schall, </em>in scrutinizing the constitutional claims of the class members therein, examined all the procedural components of New York\u2019s statutory scheme\u2014the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d requirement (for appointment of counsel and advisement of rights); the formal \u201cprobable cause\u201d hearing that followed 72 hours thereafter (analogous to our \u201cdetention hearing\u201d); and the \u201cfactfinding hearing\u201d* (analogous to our \u201cjurisdictional hearing\u201d)\u2014and concluded that, taken together, they comprised \u201c[such] flexible procedures [as] have been found constitutionally adequate <em>under the Fourth Amendment, </em>see <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh-[supra, </em>420 U.S. 103], <em>and </em>under the Due Process Clause, see <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>States [(1966) 383 U.S. 541], at 557 [16 L.Ed.2d 84, 95, 86 S.Ct. 1045].\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 277 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 225], italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\">Seven years after <em>Schall </em>was decided, the high court decided <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44. The court set out in <em>McLaughlin </em>to further define the \u201cpromptness\u201d requirement for making the Fourth Amendment probable cause determination required under <em>Gerstein. </em>The court concluded: \u201c[A] jurisdiction that provides judicial determinations of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest will, as a general matter, comply with the promptness requirement of Gerstein.\u201d <em>(McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 63, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1670].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Unlike <em>Schall, </em>the facts in <em>McLaughlin </em>did not present the court with an opportunity to reach or discuss the Fourth Amendment probable cause requirement in the specific context of <em>juvenile </em>detention proceedings. Critically, the court had no occasion in <em>McLaughlin </em>to consider the fundamental necessity, in the administration of <em>juvenile </em>criminal justice systems, to \u201cstrike a balance . . . respecting] the \u2018informality\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 that characterize juvenile proceedings [citation] . . . [while ensuring] that such proceedings comport with the \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 demanded by the Due Process Clause. [Citations.].\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, 461 </em>U.S. at p. 263 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Most recently, however, the high court had the opportunity, in a post-<em>McLaughlin </em>case, to reaffirm some of the constitutional principles found relevant to juvenile detentions in <em>Schall. </em>In <em>Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S._[123 L.Ed.2d 1], a class of alien juveniles who had been arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (hereafter INS) on suspicion of being deportable were detained pending deportation hearings pursuant to a regulation (8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.24 (1992)) providing for the release of detained minors only to their parents, close relatives, or legal guardians, except in unusual and compelling circumstances. Pursuant to a consent decree entered into in the litigation, juveniles who were not released under the regulation\u2019s provisions had to be placed in juvenile care facilities that met or exceeded state licensing requirements for the provision of such services to dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>children. The juvenile class members in <em>Flores </em>contended they had a right under the federal Constitution and immigration laws to be routinely released into the custody of other \u201cresponsible adults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Relying on principles reiterated in its earlier opinions in <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745 [71 L.Ed.2d 599, 102 S.Ct. 1388] and <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. 253, the court reaffirmed that the state\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>interest in \u201cpreserving and promoting the welfare of the child\u201d <em>(Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>455 U.S. at p. 766 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 615]) renders juvenile proceedings fundamentally different from adult criminal proceedings. The court once again emphasized that \u201c \u2018juveniles, unlike adults, are always in some form of custody,\u2019 <em>Schall, supra, </em>[467 U.S.] at 265, and where the custody of the parent or legal guardian fails, the government may (indeed, we have said <em>must) </em>either exercise custody itself or appoint someone else to do so. <em>Ibid.\u201d (Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S. at p._[123 L.Ed.2d at p. 17], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">The high court in <em>Flores </em>therefore rejected the respondent class members\u2019 \u201cprocedural due process\u201d claim under the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> :The court\u2019s conclusions regarding the constitutionality of the INS juvenile detention procedures under scruntiny in that case bear repeating here, for they reinforce our conclusion that the high court\u2019s analysis that gave rise to the strict 48-hour rule announced in <em>McLaughlin </em>does not, in isolation, adequately address all of the constitutional concerns that arise in juvenile postarrest detention cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">The court in <em>Flores </em>explained that the deportation process ordinarily begins with a warrantless arrest by an INS officer who has reason to believe that the arrestee is in the United States in violation of an immigration law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. <em>(Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S. at p._[123 L.Ed.2d at p. 20].) Arrested aliens are almost always offered the choice of departing the country voluntarily, and the great majority apparently take that course. By statute, however, before the INS can seek execution of a voluntary departure form by a <em>juvenile </em>arrestee, the juvenile must communicate with either a parent, adult relative, or friend, or with an organization found on the free legal services list. If the juvenile does not seek voluntary departure, the relevant statutes require that he or she be brought before an INS examining officer within 24 hours of his or her arrest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>The \u201cexamining officer\u201d must be someone other than the arresting officer, but is still a staff member of the INS\u2019s enforcement division, and is <em>not </em>a judge or magistrate. If the examiner finds prima facie evidence that the arrested alien is illegally in the United States, a formal deportation hearing is initiated through the issuance of an order to show cause, and within 24 hours the decision is made whether to continue the alien juvenile in custody or to release him. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-4\">The INS must notify the alien juvenile of the commencement of a deportation proceeding, and of the decision as to custody, by serving a written form notice in English and Spanish. The front of the form notifies the alien of the allegations against him or her and the date of his or her deportation hearing. The back contains a section entitled \u201cNotice of Custody Determination,\u201d in which the <em>INS officer </em>checks a box indicating whether the alien will be detained in the custody of the INS, released on his or her own recognizance, or released under bond. The form also advises the alien that he or she may request the \u201cImmigration Judge\u201d to redetermine the custody decision. The \u201cImmigration Judge\u201d is a quasi-judicial officer in the Executive Office for Immigration Review, a division \u201cseparated\u201d from the INS enforcement staff. The alien juvenile must check one of two boxes, indicating he or she does or does not seek such review, and sign and date the form. If the alien requests a hearing before the \u201cImmigration Judge\u201d and is dissatisfied with the outcome, he or she may obtain further review by the Board of Immigration Appeals, and by the federal courts. <em>(Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S. at pp. [123 L.Ed.2d at pp. 20-21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">The high court in <em>Flores </em>rejected the conclusion of the United States District Court and the in bank Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the INS procedures are flawed because they do not provide for automatic review by an \u201cImmigration Judge\u201d of the initial deportability and custody determinations. The court explained: \u201cAt least insofar as this facial challenge is concerned, due process is satisfied by giving the detained alien juveniles the <em>right </em>to a hearing before an immigration judge.\u201d <em>(Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S. at p._[123 L.Ed.2d at p. 21], italics in original.) The court further rejected respondents\u2019 contention that the regulations were infirm because they failed to set forth a time period within which the hearing before the \u201cImmigration Judge,\u201d when requested, must be held. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">In rejecting respondents\u2019 further claim that \u201cthe regulation is an abuse of discretion because it permits the INS, once having determined that an alien juvenile lacks an available relative or legal guardian, to hold the juvenile indefinitely,\u201d the court explained: \u201cThat is not so. The period of custody is inherently limited by the pending deportation hearing, which must be concluded with \u2018reasonable dispatch\u2019 to avoid habeas corpus. 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>\u00a7 1252(a)(1); cf. <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Salerno], </em>481 U.S. 739, 747 [95 L.Ed.2d 697, 708-709] (1987) (noting time limits placed on pretrial detention by the Speedy Trial Act). It is expected that alien juveniles will remain in INS custody an average of only 30 days [under the terms of the consent decree] .... There is no evidence that alien juveniles are being held for undue periods pursuant to regulation 242.24 [8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.24 (1992)], or that habeas corpus is insufficient to remedy particular abuses.\u201d <em>(Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S. at p. _ [123 L.Ed.2d at pp. 24-25], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">The court concluded in <em>Flores'. </em>\u201cWe think the INS policy now in place is a reasonable response to the difficult problems presented when the Service arrests unaccompanied alien juveniles. It may well be that other policies would be even better, but \u2018we are [not] a legislature charged with formulating public policy.\u2019 <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>467 U.S. at 281 [81 L.Ed.2d at page 228]. On its face, INS regulation 242.24 accords with both the Constitution and the relevant statute.\u201d <em>(Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S. at p__[123 L.Ed.2d at p. 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">We recognize, of course, that the holding in <em>Flores </em>is of limited precedential value here, since that case arose under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment (but see <em>ante, </em>at p. 1228, fn. 4), involved a class of deportable juvenile <em>aliens </em>who may not have enjoyed the same Fourth Amendment rights as juvenile citizens (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Verdugo-Urquidez </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 259, 265-275 [108 L.Ed.2d 222, 233-239, 110 S.Ct. 1056]), and involved the interpretation of immigration statutes as well as the terms of a consent decree. We nonetheless believe that the underpinnings of the high court\u2019s constitutional analysis in <em>Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S__[123 L.Ed.2d 1], and its express reliance in that case on several of the basic principles pertaining to juvenile detentions discussed in <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. 253, reinforce our conclusion that, in the context of juvenile detention proceedings, the high court would not today find rigid application of the 48-hour rule of <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44, compelled under a strict application of Fourth Amendment principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">We emphasize that we do not today suggest a juvenile arrestee facing postarrest detention has no Fourth Amendment liberty interest in a prompt determination of the legal cause for his or her extended detention. The Fourth Amendment principles at the core of the holding in <em>Gerstein, supra, </em>420 U.S. 103, apply to juveniles as well as adults. The high court expressly reaffirmed as much eight years ago in <em>Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pages 264, 276-277, and fn. 27 [81 L.Ed.2d at pages 217, 224-225], Indeed, although the court in <em>Schall </em>twice characterized its earlier holding in <em>Gerstein </em>to be \u201cthat a judicial determination of probable cause is a prerequisite to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>extended restraint on the liberty of an <em>adult </em>accused of crime\u201d <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 274-275 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 224], italics added), we think that such characterization cannot, in reason or fairness, be understood as an attempt by the court to limit the fundamental principles announced in <em>Gerstein </em>solely to adult detentions. The court subsequently made it clear in <em>Schall </em>that children have a protected liberty interest in \u201cfreedom from institutional restraints.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 265 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 217]; see <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 27 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 545-546, 87 S.Ct. 1428].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\">California\u2019s postarrest juvenile detention statutes are plainly designed to protect the arrested minor\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The arresting officer must, within 24 hours of the arrest, prepare a written summary of the probable cause for taking the minor into temporary custody. (\u00a7 626, subd. (d).) In contrast to adult criminal proceedings, the statutory presumptions <em>require </em>\u201cimmediate release\u201d of the minor to the custody of his or her parents or legal guardian unless specific factors warranting extended detention are found to exist. (\u00a7 628.) Even when such factors supportive of further detention are found to exist, the juvenile arrestee must nonetheless be released within 48 hours unless a wardship petition is filed within that initial 48-hour period. (\u00a7 631, subd. (a).) And, if a wardship petition is filed, a formal, adversarial detention hearing, which incorporates a probable cause determination, and at which counsel is provided for both the minor and his parents or guardian, must be conducted \u201cas soon as possible but in any event [no later than] the expiration of the next judicial day after a petition to declare the minor a ward . . . has been filed\u201d (i.e., no later than 72 hours after arrest, excluding \u201cnonjudicial days\u201d). (\u00a7 632, subd. (a).) At that detention hearing, the juvenile court will consider \u201c[t]he circumstances and gravity of the alleged offense\u201d in determining whether extended pretrial detention is warranted under all the facts and circumstances. (\u00a7 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">In light of the foregoing, we therefore conclude that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of the strict 48-hour rule in <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44, was neither foreseen nor intended by that court to be rigidly operable in juvenile postarrest detention proceedings. Given the fundamental differences between juvenile and adult detention proceedings recognized in a long line of that court\u2019s decisions, we will not infer otherwise, absent an express and definitive ruling from the high court to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">As has been shown, our Legislature, in its wisdom, has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme governing postarrest juvenile detention that is designed to implement specific policies and procedures deemed to be in the juvenile detainees\u2019 best interests, while balancing their fundamental constitutional rights against the well-recognized need for \u201cinformality\u201d and \u201cflexibility\u201d in juvenile criminal justice systems. <em>(Schall, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>263 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 216].) Our juvenile courts, of course, are duty bound to comply with both constitutional and statutory requirements. Having examined the integrated components of California\u2019s juvenile detention statutes, we conclude that the Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s pertinent decisions reviewed herein, requires no more than that <em>juvenile </em>arrestees be afforded a judicial determination of \u201cprobable cause\u201d for any postarrest detention extending beyond the 72-hour period immediately following a warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\"> In light of these conclusions, it follows that the formal detention hearing provided for in section 632, subdivision (a), may also serve to fulfill the constitutional requirement when the court at such a hearing, <em>where it is held within 72 hours of the juvenile\u2019s </em>arrest, makes a determination that sufficient probable cause exists for the extended postarrest detention of the juvenile. Consistent with our analysis and conclusions herein, if the 72-hour period immediately following arrest includes one or more \u201cnonjudicial days,\u201d such that the juvenile court is unable or unwilling to provide a full statutory detention hearing within that period, then the Constitution independently requires that the juvenile be afforded a separate, timely judicial determination of probable cause for any extended period of detention beyond the 72 hours following arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">Panelli, J., and Baxter, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">We filed our initial opinion in this case on May 4, 1993. Although neither party petitioned for a rehearing, we ordered a rehearing on the court\u2019s own motion in order to clarify the operative effect of our holding on \u201cdetention hearings\u201d which are mandated under the provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 632, subdivision (a). All further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">Section 602 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who is under the age of 18 years when he violates any law of this state . . . , is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge such person to be a ward of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">Section 625 provides, in relevant part: \u201cA peace officer may, without a warrant, take into temporary custody a minor: [\u00b6] (a) Who is under the age of 18 years when such officer has reasonable cause for believing that such minor is a person described in Section . . . 602</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">At the \u201cinitial appearance,\u201d the <em>juvenile </em>was entitled to challenge the sufficiency of the delinquency petition, thereby raising the issue of probable cause. (Schall, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 275-276 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 224-225].) This fact, however, does not appear essential to <em>Schall\u2019s </em>analysis. The <em>Schall </em>majority emphasized that postponement of a probable-cause determination until the formal, adversarial probable-cause hearing did not offend due process. Moreover, as noted, the <em>Schall </em>majority expressed no concern that the \u201cinitial appearance\u201d could itself be postponed for up to 72 hours after the juvenile\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">This court has likewise observed that in the context of juvenile wardship proceedings, a minor\u2019s constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches, seizures and arrests derives not only from the guarantee of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures embodied in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 13, of the California Constitution, but also from the minor\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy, and the guarantee under the Fourteenth Amendment against deprivation of liberty without due process of law. (See, e.g\u201e <em>In re William G. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 550, 557 [221 Cal.Rptr. 118, 709 P.2d 1287], and cases cited; <em>Skelton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 144, 149 [81 Cal.Rptr. 613, 460 P.2d 485].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">The due process claim in <em>Flores </em>arose under the Fifth Amendment because aliens have a right to due process of law at deportation proceedings under the Fifth Amendment. <em>(Flores, supra, </em>507 U.S. at p__[123 L.Ed.2d at pp. 19-20]; see <em>The Japanese Immigrant Case </em>(1903) 189 U.S. 86, 100-101 [47 L.Ed. 721, 725-726, 23 S.Ct. 611].) The discussion of Fifth Amendment procedural due process in <em>Flores </em>is functionally analogous to the Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process discussed in <em>Schall.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">We note further that, in 1992, the Legislature added subdivision (c) to Code of Civil Procedure section 134, which specifically provides: \u201cIn any superior, municipal, or justice court, one or more departments of the court may remain open and in session for the transaction of any business which may come before the department in the exercise of the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the court, or both, on a judicial holiday or at any hours of the day or night, or both, as the judges of the court prescribe.\u201d (Stats. 1992, ch. 460, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1266-8\">ARABIAN, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AqM\">I concur in the lead opinion insofar as it requires prompt probable cause determinations for juveniles within 72 hours of warrantless arrest. (See lead opn., <em>ante, </em>this page.) I respectfully dissent, however, from the due process analysis by which the lead opinion reaches this conclusion. Petitioner does not dispute his postarrest detention on that basis; nor does he raise such a challenge to any provision of the juvenile court law governing wardship detentions in general (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602 et seq.). Rather, he asserts that, like any adult in comparable circumstances, a detained minor is entitled to a probable cause determination of suspected criminal activity within 48 hours of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>warrantless arrest as mandated by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s\u2018decision in <em>County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 44 [114 L.Ed.2d 49, 111 S.Ct. 1661] (McLaughlin). As framed by petitioner, the only issue before us is whether the rule of <em>McLaughlin </em>applies to juveniles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we are constrained to refract his contentions solely through a Fourth Amendment prism, for that is the limited nature of the constitutional claim. (Cf. <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 103, 111 [43 L.Ed.2d 54, 63, 95 S.Ct. 854] [\u201cBoth the standards and procedures for arrest and detention have been derived from the Fourth Amendment and its common-law antecedents.\u201d].) The specificity of the question demands an equally precise answer, not the due process circuity submitted in the lead opinion. (See, e.g., <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O. </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 325 [83 L.Ed.2d 720, 105 S.Ct. 733] [4th Amend, search and seizure claim].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">While I agree with Justice Mosk that we should pursue a Fourth Amendment tack in resolving this case, I conclude that for juvenile detainees a probable cause determination within 72 hours satisfies the constitutional mandate of \u201cpromptness.\u201d I am unpersuaded <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44, is dispositive or controlling here. Factually, that case involved only adults. In assessing the protections afforded minors, the United States Supreme Court has consciously \u201crefrained . . . from taking the easy way with a flat holding that all rights constitutionally assured for the adult accused are to be imposed on the state juvenile proceeding.\u201d <em>(McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 528, 545 [29 L.Ed.2d 647, 661, 91 S.Ct. 1976]; <em>id., </em>at p. 541 [29 L.Ed.2d at pp. 658-659].) Thus, I do not construe the holding in <em>McLaughlin </em>to extend perforce to juveniles simply because it does not expressly restrict its scope to adults. In my view, the issue warrants an independent examination, bearing in mind both the general nature of the Fourth Amendment guaranty with its rubric of reasonableness and the particularized concerns of the juvenile justice system. (403 U.S. at p. 545 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 661]; cf. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 U.S. at pp. 337-343 [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 731-736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Since any official detention can adversely affect a minor as critically and undeniably as it does an adult, juveniles do have a protectible liberty interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>with respect to such restraint, even though they are generally subject to greater restriction of their freedom by virtue of their minority. <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 265 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 217-218].) Moreover, while juveniles do not ipso facto possess the same constitutional rights as adults (see, e.g., <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 U.S. at p. 342, fn. 8 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 735]), it is now a settled proposition that the \u201cpromptness\u201d requirement of <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at pages 111-116 [43 L.Ed.2d at pages 63-67], embraces all warrantless detentions regardless of the detainee\u2019s age. (See, e.g., <em>R.W.T. </em>v. <em>Dalton </em>(8th Cir. 1983) 712 F.2d 1225, 1230; <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(5th Cir. 1976) 525 F.2d 1258, 1259-1260.) The question remains, however, to quantify the mandate of <em>Gerstein </em>for juveniles as the United States Supreme Court has done for adults in <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at page 56 [114 L.Ed.2d at page 63, 111 S.Ct. at page 1670]. Although we lack a direct answer, decisions of the high court provide some useful contours to the analytical framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">In general, the juvenile context is highly relevant in determining whether and to what extent a particular constitutional principle applies to minors. (See, e.g., <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 265 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 217-218].) Depending upon the interest at stake, this circumstance may dictate that juveniles have rights coextensive with adults, may debar them entirely, or may necessitate some modification of rights. (See <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>403 U.S. at pp. 533-534 [29 L.Ed.2d at pp. 653-654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">For example, in <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>403 U.S. 528, the Supreme Court declined to -extend the right of jury trial to juvenile adjudications. <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 545 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 661].) In the court\u2019s view, superimposing this requirement on such proceedings would not appreciably enhance the fact-finding process, while at the same time it would impair the laudatory, if not always successful, goals of the system. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 547-550 [29 L.Ed.2d at pp. 662-664].) On the other hand, the court has ruled that minors are entitled to proof beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 368 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 377-378, 90 S.Ct. 1068]) and the defense of double jeopardy <em>(Breed </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 519, 531 [44 L.Ed.2d 346, 356, 95 S.Ct. 1779]) to the same extent these guaranties protect adults because \u201cthere is little to distinguish\u201d between adjudications and criminal trials relative to the underlying constitutional principles. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 530 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 356].) In each instance, the minimal infringement on the traditional informality of juvenile proceedings did not outweigh the substantial concerns of the minor in the fair determination of delinquency and a limitation on multiple hearings. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 536-539 [44 L.Ed.2d at pp. 359-361]; <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at pp. 366-368 [25 L.Ed.2d at pp. 376-378].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>In other cases, the Supreme Court has sought to harmonize the protectible interests of minors with their correlative constitutional underpinnings. In the seminal case of <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428], it determined that a juvenile\u2019s right to due process when taken into custody for suspected criminal activity included, inter alia, the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 55 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 561].) At the same time, the court acknowledged \u201cthat special problems may arise with respect to waiver of the privilege by or on behalf of children, and that there may well' be some differences in technique\u2014but not in principle\u2014depending upon the age of the child and the presence and competence of parents.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>id., </em>at pp. 33-34 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 549-550] [due process requires notice of charges to juvenile\u2019s parents as well as juvenile]; <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1948) 332 U.S. 596, 599-601 [92 L.Ed. 224, 228-229, 68 S.Ct. 302] [admissions and confessions of juveniles require special caution].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\">In <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 U.S. 325, the court considered \u201cwhat limits, if any, the Fourth Amendment places on the activities of school authorities\u201d who search students. (469 U.S. at p. 332 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 735].) Although schoolchildren have an expectation of privacy <em>(id., </em>at pp. 337-339 [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 731-733]), the need to maintain order in the classroom \u201crequires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 340 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 733].) Thus, in striking the balance of reasonableness, considerations unique to their particular circumstance qualified the scope of constitutional protection available to juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Regardless of its ultimate conclusion in these cases, the Supreme Court has continually emphasized in its analyses the need to maintain a measure of flexibility to accommodate the special attention with which our society still endeavors to treat youthful offenders. (See, e.g., <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 U.S. at p. 340 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 733]; <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>421 U.S. at p. 540 [44 L.Ed.2d at pp. 361-362]; <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>403 U.S. at p. 547 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 662].) I believe this concern to maximize individualized response is particularly relevant to the question of probable cause determinations because the detention of juveniles implicates additional considerations related to their minority. (See lead opn., <em>ante, </em>pp. 1219-1222.) It also segues with the explicit premise of the Fourth Amendment, which proscribes only \u201cunreasonable\u201d seizures. (Cf. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 U.S. at pp. 340-341 [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 733-734].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">These collateral matters do not necessarily preclude probable cause determinations within a shorter period; indeed, as both Justice Mosk and Justice George argue in their dissents, every effort should be made to minimize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>period of detention at this juncture in the adjudicatory process. Nevertheless, they provide a rational basis on which to premise some latitude beyond the 48-hour limit delineated in <em>McLaughlin. </em>(Cf. <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 265-266 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 217-218].) Moreover, even with respect to adult detentions, the Supreme Court has reiterated that \u201cprobable cause determinations must be prompt\u2014not immediate\u201d to maintain a necessary measure of \u201c \u2018flexibility\u2019 and \u2018experimentation\u2019 \u201d within each state\u2019s criminal justice system. <em>(McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 54 [114 L.Ed.2d at pp. 61-62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669]; see <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 123 [420 L.Ed.2d at pp. 71-72].) These latter considerations are all the more significant in the juvenile justice system, which seeks to provide intervention and rehabilitation, not simply punishment. (See, e.g., Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 626, 626.5, 628, 628.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">I therefore conclude that under the Fourth Amendment the circumstances of a juvenile differ sufficiently from those of an adult that the \u201cpromptness\u201d requirement of <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. 103, is satisfied if a juvenile detainee is provided a probable cause determination within 72 hours following a warrantless arrest with no extension of time for nonjudicial days. (Cf. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 58 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 64, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1671] [\u201cUnder <em>Gerstein, </em>jurisdictions may choose to combine probable cause determinations with other pretrial proceedings, so long as they do so promptly.\u201d].)</p>\n<author id=\"b1270-5\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution\u2014one of the core provisions of the Bill of Rights\u2014declares: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">In <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 103, 111-116, 123-125 [43 L.Ed.2d 54, 63-67, 70-72, 95 S.Ct. 854] (hereafter sometimes <em>Gerstein), </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment mandates, as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty, a prompt judicial determination that there is probable cause to believe that a person has in fact committed a criminal offense following a warrantless arrest based on suspicion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>In <em>County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 44, 56 [114 L.Ed.2d 49, 63-64, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 1670] (hereafter sometimes <em>McLaughlin), </em>the court defined \u201cpromptness\u201d under <em>Gerstein </em>as generally within 48 hours of the warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\">Thus, under the Fourth Amendment as construed by <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin, </em>a law-abiding person wrongfully arrested without a warrant is guaranteed his freedom within about 48 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Today, a majority of this court refuse to honor that guaranty when the person in question happens to be a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">I cannot join in such a breach of our constitutional obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">On July 25, 1991, petitioner Alfredo A. submitted a petition for writ of habeas corpus to the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District. His allegations were to the following effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">On July 24, 1991, petitioner, who was then 16 years of age, was arrested in Los Angeles without a warrant for possession of cocaine base for sale. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351.5.) He was placed in the custody of the probation department in juvenile hall. He was, or would soon be, restrained of his liberty in violation of the Fourth Amendment without a prompt judicial probable cause determination within 48 hours of his warrantless arrest, as required by <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin. </em>As a general matter, the juvenile court law (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 200 et seq.) does not mandate such a determination for a juvenile. It does, however, specify a formal, adversarial probable cause or \u201cdetention\u201d hearing as many as seven days after a juvenile\u2019s warrantless arrest. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 632 et seq.) The superior court sitting as the juvenile court had earlier adopted as its \u201cofficial position\u201d\u2014in accordance with a requested opinion by the county counsel based on <em>Scholl </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 253 [81 L.Ed.2d 207, 104 S.Ct. 2403] (hereafter sometimes Schall)\u2014that Gerstein's promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is not applicable to juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-10\">Through these allegations, petitioner effectively made a \u201csystemic\u201d Fourth Amendment challenge to the superior court\u2019s \u201cofficial position.\u201d In his prayer for relief, he sought immediate release from custody or an immediate judicial probable cause determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">On July 26, 1991, Division Three of the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District caused its clerk to issue an order (1) deeming petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>submission to be a petition for writ of mandate against the superior court and (2) directing that court to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue compelling it to comply with Gerstein's promptness requirement, as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>with regard to juveniles as well as adults. The superior court subsequently filed opposition as respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Also on July 26, 1991, the People submitted a petition to the juvenile court to declare petitioner a ward of the court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602.) They alleged that he came within its jurisdiction on the ground that on July 24, 1991, he was in possession of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351) and cocaine base <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 11351.5) for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">On July 29, 1991, petitioner was brought to the juvenile court and released from custody, apparently because the probation department had not submitted a detention report. He waived time for arraignment. The matter was then continued to August 19, 1991. Further proceedings, if any, are not reflected in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">On December 5, 1991, rejecting petitioner\u2019s systemic Fourth Amendment challenge to the superior court\u2019s \u201cofficial position,\u201d the Court of Appeal denied his petition. At the outset, it determined that the issue presented, even though moot as to petitioner because of his release from custody, remained suitable for resolution because, in words it quoted from <em>Gerstein, </em>.the underlying question was \u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 110, fn. 11 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 63].) It then set out to answer the question posed, viz., whether the superior court\u2019s \u201cofficial position\u201d is contrary to the Fourth Amendment as construed by <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin, </em>by addressing a question <em>not </em>posed, viz., whether the juvenile court law is compatible with \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause as interpreted in <em>Schall. </em>It purported to hold that the superior court\u2019s \u201cofficial position\u201d did not offend the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">On January 8, 1992, petitioner filed a petition for review. On February 20, 1992, we granted his request in order to determine whether Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement is applicable to juveniles and, if so, whether <em>McLaughlin's </em>definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d operates in this setting. On May \"4, 1993, we handed down our original \u201cdecision,\u201d which comprised four opinions, none commanding more than three votes. On July 15, 1993, we ordered rehearing on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">Before the issue on which this court granted review may properly be resolved, its suitability of resolution must be addressed. Little discussion is</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>called for. In fact, the words the Court of Appeal quoted from <em>Gerstein </em>are sufficient: the point is \u201c\u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 110, fn. 11 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 63].) As the <em>Gerstein </em>court explained: \u201cPretrial detention is by nature temporary, and it is most unlikely that any given individual could have his constitutional claim decided on appeal before he is either released or convicted. The individual could nonetheless suffer repeated deprivations, and it is certain that other persons similarly situated will be detained under the allegedly unconstitutional procedures.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">The question before the court is bipartite. Is Gerstein's promptness requirement applicable to juveniles? If so, does <em>McLaughlin's </em>definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d operate in this setting?</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">In <em>Gerstein, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment mandates a prompt judicial probable cause determination as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following a warrantless arrest. <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at pp. 111-116, 123-125 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 63-67, 70-72].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Gerstein </em>court sought to reconcile or at least accommodate an individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and the state\u2019s legitimate interest in law enforcement. <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at pp. 111-113 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 63-65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">Under what the <em>Gerstein </em>court called its \u201cpractical compromise,\u201d \u201ca policeman\u2019s on-the-scene assessment of probable cause provides legal justification for arresting a person suspected of crime, and for a brief period of detention to take the administrative steps incident to arrest. Once the suspect is in custody, however, the reasons that justify dispensing with the magistrate\u2019s neutral judgment evaporate. There no longer is any danger that the suspect will escape or commit further crimes while the police submit their evidence to a magistrate. And, while the State\u2019s reasons for taking summary action subside, the suspect\u2019s need for a neutral determination of probable cause increases significantly. The consequences of prolonged detention may be more serious than the interference occasioned by arrest. Pretrial confinement may imperil the suspect\u2019s job, interrupt his source of income, and impair his family relationships. [Citations.] Even pretrial release may be accompanied by burdensome conditions that effect a significant restraint of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>liberty. [Citation.] When the stakes are this high, the detached judgment of a neutral magistrate is essential if the Fourth Amendment is to furnish meaningful protection ffom unfounded interference with liberty.\" <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at pp. 113-114 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 64-65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">Thus, the <em>Gerstein </em>court made plain that the prompt judicial probable cause determination mandated by the Fourth Amendment must be \u201cprompt\u201d in terms of the time that is required for the state \u201cto take the administrative steps incident to arrest\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 64]), such as booking, photographing, and fingerprinting <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 59 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 64, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1671]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">The <em>Gerstein </em>court also made plain that this prompt judicial probable cause determination does not require the \u201cfull panoply of adversary safeguards\" of \u201ccounsel, confrontation, cross-examination, and compulsory process . . . .\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 119 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 68].) Rather, \u201ca nonadversary proceeding [based] on hearsay and written testimony\u201d is sufficient. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 120 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 69].) \u201cThe sole issue is whether there is probable cause for detaining the arrested person pending further proceedings. This issue can be determined reliably without an adversary hearing. The standard is the same as that for arrest. That standard\u2014 probable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime\u2014traditionally has been decided by a magistrate in a nonadversary proceeding \u00f3n hearsay and written testimony . . . .\" <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) The court noted: \u201cBecause the standards [for arrest and detention] are identical, ordinarily there is no need, for further investigation before the probable cause determination can be made.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 120, fn. 21 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 64].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">The <em>Gerstein </em>court \u201crecognize[d] that state systems of criminal procedure vary widely. There is no single preferred pretrial procedure, and the nature of the probable cause determination usually will be shaped to accord with a State\u2019s pretrial procedure viewed as a whole.\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 123 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 71].) It also \u201crecognize[d] the desirability of flexibility and experimentation by the States. It may be found desirable, for example, to make the probable cause determination at the suspect\u2019s first appearance before a judicial officer, [citation], or the determination may be incorporated into the procedure for setting bail or fixing other conditions of pretrial release. In some States, existing procedures may satisfy the requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Others may require only minor adjustment . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 123-124 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 71], fn. omitted.) But it declared: \u201cWhatever procedure a State may adopt, it must provide a fair and reliable determination of probable cause as a condition for any significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>pretrial restraint of liberty, and this determination must be made by a judicial officer . . . promptly after arrest\u201d when the arrest itself is made without a warrant. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 124-125 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 71-72], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">In <em>McLaughlin, </em>the United States Supreme Court undertook to define \u201cpromptness\u201d under <em>Gerstein. (County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 47 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 57, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1665].) The facts there are similar to those here. At issue was Riverside County\u2019s policy of combining judicial probable cause determinations with its arraignment procedures, which resulted in a delay of as many as seven days after a person\u2019s warrantless arrest. The Courts of Appeals were in conflict as to the meaning of \u201cpromptness.\u201d The Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits declared or suggested that a judicial probable cause determination is \u201cprompt\u201d only if it is provided <em>immediately </em>after the state has \u201ctake[n] the administrative steps incident to arrest\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 65]); see also <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Washington Metro. Area Transit Authority </em>(4th Cir. 1982) 690 F.2d 1133, 1139-1140; <em>Llaguno </em>v. <em>Mingey </em>(7th Cir. 1985) 763 F.2d 1560, 1567-1568 <em>(in bank)', McLaughlin </em>v. <em>County of Riverside </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 888 F.2d 1276, 1278, vacated <em>sub nom. County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44.) The Second Circuit held against the requirement of \u201cimmediacy.\u201d (See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(2d Cir. 1988) 845 F.2d 374, 385-386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">The <em>McLaughlin </em>court adhered to, and indeed reaffirmed, the holding of <em>Gerstein </em>that the Fourth Amendment mandates a prompt judicial probable cause determination as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following a warrantless arrest. <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 50-56 [114 L.Ed.2d at pp. 59-62, 111 S.Ct. at pp. 1667-1669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">The <em>McLaughlin </em>court also remained faithful to Gerstein\u2019s view that \u201cpromptness\u201d must be measured in terms of the time that is required for the state \u201cto take the administrative steps incident to arrest\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 65]). (See <em>County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 59 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 64, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1671].) In its own words: \u201cUnder <em>Gerstein, </em>jurisdictions may choose to combine probable cause determinations with other pretrial proceedings, so long as they do so promptly. This necessarily means that only certain proceedings are candidates for combination. Only those proceedings that arise very early in the pretrial process\u2014such as bail hearings and arraignments\u2014may be chosen.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 58 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 64, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1671].) The reason is plain. To allow \u201cpromptness\u201d to be defined with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>reference to other \u201csteps\u201d that a state might desire to \u201ctake\u201d beyond those \u201cincident to arrest\u201d\u2014for example, the holding of a preliminary examination \u2014would render the requirement nugatory. A federal constitutional mandate that is designed to constrain the states cannot be dependent on the individual policy choices that any given state might happen to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">All the same, the <em>McLaughlin </em>court recognized that the bare mandate of a \u201cprompt\u201d judicial probable cause determination had proved inadequate. It stated: \u201cUnfortunately, as lower court decisions applying <em>Gerstein </em>have demonstrated, it is not enough to say that probable cause determinations must be \u2018prompt.\u2019 This vague standard simply has not provided sufficient guidance. Instead, it has led to a flurry of systemic challenges to city and county practices, putting federal judges in the role of making legislative judgments and overseeing local jailhouse operations.\u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 55-56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">The <em>McLaughlin </em>court declined to hold that a judicial probable cause determination is \u201cprompt\u201d only if it is provided <em>immediately </em>after the state has \u201ctake[n] the administrative steps incident to arrest\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 65]). It stated: \u201cTaking into account the competing interests articulated in <em>Gerstein, </em>we believe that a jurisdiction that provides judicial determinations of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest will, as a general matter, comply with the promptness requirement of <em>Gerstein. </em>For this reason, such jurisdictions will be immune from systemic challenges.\u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 63, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1670].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">The <em>McLaughlin </em>court then added: \u201cThis is not to say that the probable cause determination in a particular case passes constitutional muster simply because it is provided within 48 hours. Such a hearing[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] may nonetheless violate <em>Gerstein </em>if the arrested individual can prove that his or her probable cause determination was delayed unreasonably.\u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 63, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1670].) But \u201c[w]here an arrested individual does not receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours, the calculus changes. In such a case, the arrested individual does not bear the burden of proving an unreasonable delay. Rather, the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate the</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance. The fact that in a particular case it may take longer than 48 hours to consolidate pretrial proceedings does not qualify as an extraordinary circumstance. Nor, for that matter, do intervening weekends. A jurisdiction that chooses to offer combined proceedings must do so as soon as is reasonably feasible, but in no event later than 48 hours after arrest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 57 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 63, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1670].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">It must be noted that <em>McLaughlin </em>was not a unanimous decision. In a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens joined, Justice Marshall would have defined \u201cpromptness\u201d under <em>Gerstein </em>to incorporate the \u201cimmediacy\u201d requirement, i.e., a judicial probable cause determination is \u201cprompt\u201d only if it is provided <em>immediately </em>after the state has \u201ctake[n] the administrative steps incident to arrest\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 65]. <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 59 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 64, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1671] (dis. opn. of Marshall, J.).) In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia would have adopted a similar definition. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 59-68 [114 L.Ed.2d at pp. 65-70, 111 S.Ct. at pp. 1672-1675] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).) He would also have rejected the court\u2019s \u201couter time limit\u201d of 48 hours in favor of a line drawn at \u201ccertainly no more than 24 hours.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 67-68 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 70, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1676] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">As stated above, the question before this court is whether Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement is applicable to juveniles and, if so, whether <em>McLaughlin's </em>definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d operates in this setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">The first issue is the applicability of Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement to juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\"><em>Gerstein </em>declares, both expressly and impliedly, from beginning to end, that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection extends to \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201cindividuals.\u201d It does not purport to limit the constitutional guaranty to adults or even to qualify its benefit to juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>I find no reason within Gerstein\u2019s four corners to cabin its conclusion. The <em>Gerstein </em>court did not itself choose to restrict the scope of the requirement that it established. I decline to do what it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Neither do I discern outside <em>Gerstein </em>any ground to delimit its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">It was firmly established almost a decade before <em>Gerstein </em>was handed down that \u201cthe Bill of Rights is [not] for adults alone.\u201d <em>(In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 13 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 538, 87 S.Ct. 1428].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">Indeed, this court itself has expressly held that among the rights of the United States Constitution to which juveniles are entitled \u201cis the guarantee of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment . . . .\u201d <em>(In re William G. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 550, 557 [221 Cal.Rptr. 118, 709 P.2d 1287]; accord, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Chard </em>(Colo. 1991) 808 P.2d 351, 353 [holding that the \u201cconstitutional guarantees\u201d to which juveniles are entitled include \u201cprotection from unreasonable searches and seizures under the fourth amendment\u201d]; <em>In re Fingerprinting of Juvenile </em>(1989) 42 Ohio St.3d 124, 126 [537 N.E.2d 1286, 1287] [stating that \u201cit is well-settled that a juvenile is as entitled as an adult to the constitutional protections of the Fourth Amendment\u201d]; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Mills </em>(1981) 290 Ore. 441, 444 [622 P.2d 1094, 1097] [holding in substance that the Fourth Amendment covers juveniles as well as adults].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">To be sure, the particular commands and prohibitions of the Fourth Amendment may vary in some respects for adults and juveniles. The basic criterion of the constitutional provision is, of course, \u201creasonableness.\u201d (E.g., <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Jimeno </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 248, 250 [114 L.Ed.2d 297, 302, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1803] [\u201cThe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">Whatever differentiation may be justified in some areas for adults and juveniles under the Fourth Amendment is not justified here. In <em>McLaughlin, </em>the court predicated Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement on the proposition that \u201c[a] State has no legitimate interest in detaining for extended periods individuals who have been arrested without probable cause.\u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 55 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669].) This applies to <em>all </em>individuals\u2014whether or not they have attained the age of majority. When probable cause is lacking, detention is unsupported as a matter of law. That proposition does not depend on how old the detainee is. The presence of youth does not make up for the absence of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">I recognize that the state, as <em>parens patriae, </em>may have a legitimate interest in detaining a juvenile for criminal activity prior to trial. That interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>however, is not served by holding Gerstein's promptness requirement inapplicable. Without question, an adult arrested without probable cause must be released as soon as reasonably possible. The reason: grounds for detention are lacking. So too, a juvenile arrested without probable cause must be released as soon as reasonably possible. The reason is the same. Absent probable cause, the state\u2019s exercise of its power to preserve and promote the welfare of the child is without support. For juveniles as for adults, Gerstein's promptness requirement operates to conserve and allocate resources by limiting the class of detainees to those who are properly subject to detention. Of course, the state, as <em>parens patriae, </em>may have a legitimate interest in detaining a juvenile for reasons <em>unrelated to criminal activity. </em>But no such interest is implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">I also recognize that, in detaining a juvenile for criminal activity prior to trial, the state may use means and/or facilities different from those it uses for adults. That fact, however, is not determinative. It simply cannot be said that the restraint of liberty imposed on a juvenile is somehow less significant, in and of itself, than that imposed on an adult. Indeed, \u201c[p]retrial detention is an onerous experience, <em>especially for juveniles </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Moss </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(5th Cir. 1976) 525 F.2d 1258, 1260, italics added; see <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 30-31 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737] [to similar effect].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Moreover, it appears that since <em>Gerstein </em>was decided, all reported decisions that have considered the question to resolution have held or stated, expressly or impliedly, that <em>Gerstein </em>is applicable to <em>all </em>\u201cpersons\u201d or \u201cindividuals,\u201d juveniles as well as adults. (See, e.g., <em>R.W.T. </em>v. <em>Dalton </em>(8th Cir. 1983) 712 F.2d 1225, 1230 [holding that under <em>Gerstein, </em>\u201cjuveniles who are detained because they are suspected of committing criminal acts must be afforded a prompt probable-cause hearing\u201d\u2014thereby deciding a question left open in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 574 F.2d 435, 439 &amp; fn. 11]; <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Weaver, supra, </em>525 F.2d at pp. 1259-1260 [holding that Gerstein's promptness requirement is applicable to juveniles]; <em>JV-114246 </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Ct.App. 1988) 159 Ariz. 357, 358 [767 P. 2d 705] [same], following <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Superior Court in &amp; for Cty. of Pima </em>(1977) 117 Ariz. 551, 553-554 [574 P. 2d 39] [same]; <em>J.T. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke in and for the Tenth Jud.

It does not purport to limit its scope to adults or even to qualify its meaning for juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">I do not see in <em>McLaughlin </em>itself any basis to restrict its definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d against juveniles. Quite the contrary. The reasoning of the <em>McLaughlin </em>court is premised on an assessment that the \u201cundefined\u201d promptness requirement of <em>Gerstein </em>is simply too \u201cvague\u201d a \u201cstandard.\u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 55-56 [114 L.Ed.2d at pp. 61-62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669].) That assessment holds as true for juvenile proceedings relating to minors as for criminal actions involving adults. Perhaps truer. For if \u201cit is not enough to say that probable cause determinations must be \u2018prompt\u2019 \u201d for criminal actions <em>(id. </em>at pp. 55-56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669]), which are governed by a procedural law that is relatively well defined, a fortiori it is not nearly enough for juvenile proceedings, which are guided by norms of another sort. Similarly, if the \u201cundefined\u201d promptness requirement has already \u201cled to a flurry of systemic challenges to city and county practices [in criminal actions], putting federal judges in the role of making legislative judgments and overseeing local jailhouse operations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669]), it will surely lead to like challenges in juvenile proceedings\u2014of which the present is, apparently, only the first\u2014involving the state judiciary as well as the federal in matters that belong largely to the other branches of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">Neither do I discover any support outside <em>McLaughlin </em>to condition its definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d against juveniles. As stated, juveniles as well as adults are entitled to the protections of the Fourth Amendment. As also stated, the basic criterion of the constitutional provision is \u201creasonableness.\u201d The definition articulated by the <em>McLaughlin </em>court serves to give content to this test. No reason appears to deny its benefit to juveniles. Unquestionably, \u201cit is not enough to say that probable cause determinations must be \u2018prompt\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 55-56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669]) when the state acts as enforcer of the criminal law for the sake of the community generally. The same is true when the state acts as <em>parens patriae </em>for the benefit of the child. The word \u201cprompt\u201d is no less \u201cvague\u201d in the latter situation than in the former. As noted, under the Fourth Amendment as construed by <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin, </em>a law-abiding person wrongfully arrested without a warrant is guaranteed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>his freedom within about 48 hours. It would be unreasonable to hold that when the person in question happens to be a juvenile, the guaranty is illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">Therefore, I conclude that McLaughlin's definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d does in fact operate in the juvenile setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">In conducting my analysis, I have not overlooked <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. 253, which was decided nine years after <em>Gerstein </em>and seven years before <em>McLaughlin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">In <em>Schall, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a section of the New York Family Court Act was not invalid under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 256-257, 263-281 [81 L.Ed,2d at pp. 211-212, 217-228].) The provision in question authorized court-ordered \u201cpreventive detention\u201d of a juvenile accused of delinquency, i.e., pretrial detention based on a judicial finding that there is a \u201cserious risk\u201d that the juvenile \u201c \u2018may before the return date commit an act which if committed by an adult would constitute a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 255 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 211].) The court expressly noted that the propriety of detention <em>based on a warrantless arrest </em>was \u201cnot at issue\u201d: the sole question concerned <em>\u201cjudicially ordered </em>detention.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 258, fn. 5 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 213], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">In scrutinizing the New York statutory scheme, the <em>Schall </em>court asked whether the authorization of court-ordered preventive detention was compatible with \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 263 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 216].) It identified two subsidiary inquiries. First, did court-ordered preventive detention under the statutory provision serve a legitimate state objective? (I<em>d. </em>at pp. 263-264 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 216-217].) Second, were the procedural safeguards contained therein adequate against erroneous and unnecessary restraints of liberty? <em>(Id. </em>at p. 264 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 217].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">At the outset, the <em>Schall </em>court observed: \u201cThere is no doubt that the Due Process Clause is applicable in juvenile proceedings. \u2018The problem . . . is to ascertain the precise impact of the due process requirement upon such proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 263 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 216].) It went on: \u201c[C]ertain basic constitutional protections enjoyed by adults accused of crimes also apply to juveniles. [Citations.] But the Constitution does not mandate elimination of all differences in the treatment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>juveniles. [Citation.] The State has \u2018a <em>parens patriae </em>interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child,\u2019 [citation], which makes a juvenile proceeding fundamentally different from an adult criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In view thereof, it had \u201ctried ... to strike a balance\u2014to respect the \u2018informality\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 that characterize juvenile proceedings, [citation], and yet to ensure that such proceedings comport with the \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 demanded by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">The <em>Schall </em>court concluded that the New York statutory scheme with its authorization of court-ordered preventive detention was indeed compatible with \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. It did so because it answered each of the two subsidiary inquiries in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">First, the <em>Schall </em>court held that court-ordered preventive detention under the New York statutory scheme served the legitimate state objective of protecting both society and the juvenile from the hazards of pretrial crime. <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 264-274 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 217-223].) On this point, it explained that in aiming at such protection, the state undertook to act as enforcer of the criminal law for the sake of the community generally and also as <em>parens patriae </em>for the benefit of the child. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 264-266 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 217-218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">Second, the <em>Schall </em>court held that the procedural safeguards contained in the New York statutory scheme were adequate against erroneous and unnecessary restraints of liberty. <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at pp. 274-281 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 223-228].) In this regard, it observed that under both the Fourth Amendment as construed by <em>Gerstein </em>and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause as interpreted in various decisions involving juvenile proceedings, there was a common concern with \u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201cinformality.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 275 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 224].) It indicated that <em>Gerstein </em>had found certain \u201cflexible procedures,\u201d which included a formal, adversarial probable cause hearing within five days of a warrantless arrest, to be adequate for the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 277 &amp; fn. 28 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 225].) It made clear that it found similar procedures under the New York statutory scheme, which included a formal, adversarial probable cause hearing within at most nine days of a warrantless arrest, to be sufficient for the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">After even brief consideration, it becomes plain that <em>Schall </em>does not affect the conclusion that Gerstein\u2019\u2019s promptness requirement is indeed applicable to juveniles and that <em>McLaughlin\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d does in fact operate in this setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>\u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d of course, \u201cthat cases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 482, fn. 7 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580]; accord, <em>McDowell &amp; Craig </em>v. <em>City of Santa Fe Springs </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 33, 38 [4 Cal.Rptr. 176, 351 P.2d 344].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">To begin with, <em>Schall </em>is based on the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>Gerstein </em>and McLaughlin, by contrast, rest on the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, the <em>Schall </em>court effectively declared that its reach did not extend to the Fourth Amendment question presented here when it expressly noted that it was solely concerned with <em>\u201cjudicially ordered </em>detention.\u201d (Sc<em>hall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 258, fn. 5 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 213] italics added.) Moreover, the <em>Schall </em>court referred only to formal, adversarial probable cause hearings, and not to the informal, nonadversarial judicial probable cause determinations discussed in <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin. </em>Lastly, and perhaps most important, the <em>Schall </em>court dealt with a situation in which the juvenile was already detained pursuant to court order\u2014unlike the situation here, where he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">To be sure, at one point in its opinion the <em>Schall </em>court stated: \u201cIn <em>Gerstein </em>. . . , we held that a judicial determination of probable cause is a prerequisite to any extended restraint on the liberty of an <em>adult </em>accused of crime.\u201d <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, 461 </em>U.S. at pp. 274-275 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 224], italics added to \u201cadult.\u201d) And at another point: \u201cIn many respects, the [New York statutory scheme] provides far more predetention protection for juveniles than we found to be constitutionally required for a probable-cause determination for <em>adults </em>in <em>Gerstein.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 275 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 224], italics added to \u201cadults.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">The <em>Schall </em>court\u2019s dicta, isolated and irrelevant as they are, cannot reasonably be read as an after-the-fact attempt to limit <em>Gerstein </em>to adults, but must be viewed merely as a reflection of the general factual context out of which <em>Gerstein </em>arose. Indeed, it appears that no reported decision\u2014with the singular exception of the opinion of the Court of Appeal below\u2014has construed these words to impose such a limitation. This is certainly true of <em>McLaughlin. </em>In that case, the court could easily have used this language, which was cited by the parties and amici curiae therein, to limit <em>Gerstein </em>to adults. Conspicuously, it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">It can perhaps be argued that there is tension between <em>Schall </em>and <em>McLaughlin. </em>The former implies that a formal, adversarial probable cause hearing within at most nine days of the warrantless arrest of a juvenile who is already in court-ordered preventive detention suffices for the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. By contrast, the latter holds that a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>probable cause determination, albeit informal and nonadversarial, is required by the Fourth Amendment generally within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Any such tension, however, must necessarily be resolved in favor of the later-decided <em>McLaughlin </em>and against the earlier-decided <em>Schall. </em>By its terms, the <em>Schall </em>implication depends on Gerstein\u2019s \u201cundefined\u201d promptness requirement and Gerstein\u2019s consequent approval of a delay of five days between a warrantless arrest and a formal, adversarial probable cause hearing. The <em>McLaughlin </em>holding, however, expressly defines \u201cpromptness\u201d as generally within 48 hours and thereby withdraws approval of a 5-day delay. Therefore, the <em>Schall </em>implication simply does not survive the <em>McLaughlin </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">In conducting my analysis, I have also not overlooked <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1993) 507 U.S. _ [123 L.Ed.2d 1, 113 S.Ct. 1439] (hereafter <em>Flores).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">In <em>Flores, </em>the United States Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge, based solely on the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, to an Immigration and Naturalization Service regulation governing the detention of allegedly deportable alien juveniles. It cited <em>Schall. </em>But it did not even allude to the Fourth Amendment, less still <em>Gerstein </em>or <em>McLaughlin. </em>That, of course, is not surprising. It appears that deportable aliens are not even within the protection of the Fourth Amendment. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Verdugo-Urquidez </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 259, 265 [108 L.Ed.2d 222, 232-233, 110 S.Ct. 1056], the court stated, albeit only in dictum, that \u201c \u2018the people\u2019 protected by the Fourth Amendment. . . refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community\u201d\u2014 among whom deportable aliens do not seem to number.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">Since a case, like <em>Schall, </em>is not authority for a proposition it <em>did not </em>consider, a fortiori, a case, like <em>Flores, </em>cannot be authority for a proposition it <em>could not have </em>considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">Like the Court of Appeal below, the lead opinion sets out to answer the question posed\u2014viz., whether the superior court\u2019s \u201cofficial position\u201d that Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is not applicable to juveniles, is contrary to the Fourth Amendment as construed by those decisions\u2014by addressing a question <em>not </em>posed\u2014viz., whether the juvenile court law is compatible with \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause as interpreted in <em>Schall. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>fatal flaw of such analysis is evident: it is altogether nonresponsive. The lead opinion may just as well have attempted to determine whether the superior court\u2019s \u201cofficial position\u201d is contrary to the Fourth Amendment by considering whether the juvenile court law violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">Perhaps the lead opinion means to declare that whether and to what extent the Fourth Amendment is applicable to juveniles in the juvenile setting somehow implicates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. No reason or authority is presented in support of such a proposition. None is evident. The coverage of the Fourth Amendment, of course, is determined by the Fourth Amendment. True, the guaranty of due process protects those who have not attained the age of majority. But it protects as well those who have.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">The lead opinion is much taken with <em>Schall. </em>Too much so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">The lead opinion implies that <em>Schall </em>is \u201cauthoritative\u201d on the Fourth Amendment standards governing the detention of juveniles. But at most, it is such only as to <em>court-ordered </em>preventive detention. Detention of that sort, however, is <em>not </em>what is involved here. The lead opinion attempts to avoid the limited scope of <em>Schall. </em>But it trips on the opinion\u2019s very words: the propriety of detention <em>based on a warrantless arrest </em>was \u201cnot at issue\u201d; the sole question concerned <em>\u201cjudicially ordered </em>detention.\u201d <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 258, fn. 5 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 213], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">The lead opinion also implies that <em>Schall </em>requires examination of \u201call the procedural components\u201d of the juvenile court law because <em>Schall </em>itself examined \u201call the procedural components\u201d of the New York Family Court Act. (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1226.) That is not so. Schall's consideration of the New York statute was dictated solely by the fact that, in that case, the statute had been challenged as invalid under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The juvenile court law is not challenged here at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">Lastly, the lead opinion assumes that the \u201cauthority\u201d of <em>Schall </em>is unaffected by <em>McLaughlin. </em>But, as explained, in part relevant here the earlier-decided <em>Schall </em>does not even survive the later-decided <em>McLaughlin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">The lead opinion then suggests that <em>Gerstein\u2019s </em>promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is inapplicable to juveniles because in juvenile proceedings the state assertedly acts as <em>parens patriae </em>to preserve and promote the welfare of the child, whereas in criminal actions it acts as enforcer of the criminal law to mete out punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>Even if the lead opinion\u2019s premise is sound, its conclusion is simply incorrect. Whenever the state predicates detention on criminal activity\u2014in whatever proceeding, under whatever role, or for whatever objective\u2014 probable cause is crucial for Fourth Amendment purposes. And whenever probable cause is crucial, Gerstein's promptness requirement, as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is applicable. A prompt judicial probable cause determination generally within 48 hours of a juvenile\u2019s warrantless arrest\u2014a determination that may be informal and nonadversarial\u2014is altogether consistent with the juvenile court law, the goals of which include the expeditious resolution of issues in a relatively open and cooperative setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">I recognize that under the juvenile court law, the state may detain a juvenile for reasons <em>unrelated to criminal activity </em>\u2014although only in a separate nonsecure facility segregated from those suspected of crime (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 206)\u2014as when the minor appears in public suffering from a sickness or injury that requires care <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 305, subd. (d)). In such a situation, <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>are not implicated by their very terms. But such a situation does not obtain here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">In a word, when the state detains a person for criminal activity, it must establish probable cause. It is now settled that \u201c[a] State has <em>no legitimate interest </em>in detaining . . . individuals who have been arrested without probable cause\u201d generally beyond 48 hours. <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 55 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669], italics added.) It is inconceivable that a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d could somehow spring into being when the individual in question turns out to be a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">The lead opinion also suggests that Gerstein's promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is inapplicable to juveniles because their interest in freedom from restraint of liberty under the Fourth Amendment is assertedly less substantial than that of adults. But as stated, the basic criterion of the constitutional provision is \u201creasonableness.\u201d Extended restraint for a criminal offense in the absence of probable cause is no more reasonable for juveniles than adults. Arguably less so. In California at least, adults generally have the right to release on bail. (See Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 12; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1268 et seq.) Juveniles do not. <em>(Aubry </em>v. <em>Gadbois </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 470, 471-475 [123 Cal.Rptr. 365] (per Kaus, P. J.) [rejecting claims substantially based on, among other provisions, Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 12, and Pen. Code, \u00a7 1268 et seq.].) \u201c[Detaining . . . individuals who have been arrested without probable cause\u201d beyond 48 hours is presumptively unreasonable. <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 55-56 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669].) It is unexplained how the individual\u2019s status as a juvenile can change the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>Similarly, the lead opinion suggests that Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is inapplicable to juveniles because restraint of liberty under the juvenile court law is assertedly more limited than restraint of liberty under the criminal law. But what matters for <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>is the <em>fact </em>of restraint and not its <em>character. </em>Indeed, as the <em>Gerstein </em>court itself observed, <em>\u201cEven pretrial release </em>may be accompanied by burdensome conditions that effect a significant restraint of liberty.\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 65], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">Most prominently, I believe, the lead opinion suggests that Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is inapplicable to juveniles because the juvenile court law assertedly has more \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d than the criminal law. The short answer is that none of these \u201cprotections\u201d even purports to be an equivalent for a prompt judicial probable cause determination. Indeed, the provisions cited by the lead opinion generally relate to the disposition of the detained juvenile within the juvenile system. <em>They do not primarily concern whether the juvenile ought to have been detained within the system in the first place. </em>That is the function of a prompt judicial probable cause determination. The cited \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d \u201cprotect\u201d the juvenile who has been arrested without probable cause in much the same way as prison health and safety regulations \u201cprotect\u201d an inmate who has been wrongfully convicted. They are too little, too late. In brief, they simply do not guarantee that a law-abiding juvenile wrongfully arrested without a warrant will regain his freedom within about 48 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">I acknowledge that in certain instances the probation officer appears obligated to investigate the question of probable cause. But, by definition, the prompt judicial probable cause determination mandated by the Fourth Amendment as construed by <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>must be made by a <em>judicial </em>officer. Obviously, the probation officer is not such. He has responsibility to law enforcement, seeing that he is possessed of the \u201cpowers and authority conferred by law upon peace officers . . . .\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 283.) The United States Supreme Court expressly recognized as much in <em>Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C. </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 707 [61 L.Ed.2d 197, 99 S.Ct. 2560], which dealt with the status of the probation officer under the juvenile court law. \u201c[T]he probation officer is the employee of the State which seeks to prosecute the alleged offender. He is a peace officer, and as such is allied, to a greater or lesser extent, with his fellow peace officers. He owes an obligation to the State, notwithstanding the obligation he may also owe the juvenile under his supervision. In most cases, the probation officer is duty bound to report wrongdoing by the juvenile when it comes to his attention, even if by communication from the juvenile himself.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 720 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 209]; accord, <em>In re Michael C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 471, 478-479 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>[146 Cal.Rptr. 358, 579 P.2d 7] (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.), revd. on other grounds <em>sub nom. Fare </em>v. <em>Michael C., supra, </em>442 U.S. 707.) The probation officer\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to law enforcement is inconsistent with the constitutional role of a neutral and detached magistrate.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 117 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 67].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">What the lead opinion may mean to suggest in alluding to the \u201cprocedural safeguards\u2019\u2019 of the juvenile court law is that, in Gerstein\u2019s words, \u201cexisting procedures . . . satisfy the requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Ger-stein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 124 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 71].) If it does, it is wrong. As stated, the cited \u201cprotections\u201d simply do not guarantee that a law-abiding juvenile wrongfully arrested without a warrant will regain his freedom within about 48 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">The lead opinion next suggests that Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is inapplicable to juveniles because it is assertedly incompatible with the \u201c \u2018informality\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 that characterize juvenile proceedings . . . .\u201d <em>(Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 263 [81 L.Ed.2d at p. 216].) No such incompatibility, however, is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">Plainly, the \u201cinformality\u201d and \u201cflexibility\" of juvenile proceedings\u2014both in American jurisdictions generally and in California specific\u00e1lly\u2014are designed to make the process <em>more expeditious </em>than that of criminal actions, <em>not less. </em>The review by the lead opinion proves the point as to the juvenile court law. Thus, if any colorable attack could be mounted against <em>McLaughlin\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cpromptness,\" it would be that it is <em>too long, not too short.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">Further, it is evident that a prompt judicial probable cause determination generally within 48 hours of a juvenile\u2019s warrantless arrest\u2014like similar determinations routinely and quickly made on application for an arrest warrant\u2014can readily be accommodated. I note that in a case such as this, the arresting officer must presently prepare a \u201cconcise written statement of . . . probable cause\u201d \u201cwithout necessary delay\u201d\u2014and specifically within 24 hours if the criminal offense in question is a misdemeanor. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 626, subd. (d).) I also note, in words from <em>Gerstein, </em>that \u201c[bjecause the standards [for arrest and detention] are identical, ordinarily there is no need for further investigation before the [judicial] probable cause determination can be made.\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 120, fn. 21 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 69].) Evidently, a longer \u201cperiod of detention\u201d is not required for the state \u201cto take the administrative steps incident to arrest\u201d for a juvenile than for an adult. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 65].) Indeed, at oral argument on rehearing, counsel for respondent effectively conceded the point: a judicial probable cause determination, he admitted, is \u201cnot . . . difficult\u201d to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>It may be true, as the lead opinion asserts, that \u201cwhen a minor is detained on suspicion of criminal activity, in contrast to an adult detained under similar circumstances, the inquiry into the propriety of the extended detention is much broader in scope\u201d\u2014and more \u201ccomplex\u201d\u2014\u201cthan a determination, in the strict Fourth Amendment sense, of whether \u2018factual\u2019 probable cause exists to believe the minor committed the crime for which he was taken into custody.\u201d (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1221-1222.) That this \u201cinquiry\u201d may be \u201cbroader\u201d and more \u201ccomplex\u201d than probable cause is a result of the Legislature\u2019s policy choice and not federal constitutional compulsion. But this \u201cinquiry\u201d does indeed depend on probable cause <em>narrowly and simply defined.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">It may also be true, as the lead opinion asserts, that the so-called \u201cfactual probable cause determination is but one component <em>of </em>the broader inquiry . . . .\u201d (Lead opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1224, italics omitted.) But this \u201ccomponent\u201d is the first to be decided both in time and in logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">To repeat: \u201cA state has <em>no legitimate interest </em>in detaining . . . individuals who have been arrested without probable cause\u201d generally beyond 48 hours <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 55 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669], italics added)\u2014whether or not such individuals have attained the age of majority. Surely, the state may have a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d in continuing to detain juveniles who have been arrested without probable cause beyond 48 hours when there exists a supported basis for doing so separate and independent from the unsupported suspicion of criminal activity, as for example the presence of sickness or injury that requires care (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 305, subd. (d)). In such cases, the state may continue to detain without implicating <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">The foregoing assessment of the feasibility of a prompt judicial probable cause determination generally within 48 hours of a juvenile\u2019s warrantless arrest is confirmed by experience. Petitioner represents, without dispute, that a number of the state\u2019s largest counties, including San Diego, Orange, Santa Clara, Sacramento, San Francisco, Fresno, and San Mateo, are successfully providing determinations of this kind. At oral argument on rehearing, counsel for respondent conceded that Los Angeles is doing the same, at least for most juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">The lead opinion then suggests, most curiously, that Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is inapplicable to juveniles because the commands laid down by the United States Constitution should yield to the preferences indicated in California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">Of course, under the supremacy clause, the reverse is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>Thus, the state may choose under the juvenile court law to fully investigate the circumstances of a detained juvenile, his parents, and his home before it decides whether and how to release him. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 628.) But it cannot extend the juvenile\u2019s detention as it pursues its investigation without a prompt judicial probable cause determination generally within 48 hours of his warrantless <em>arrest\u2014which establishes whether the juvenile should have been detained in the first place. </em>To permit the state to grant itself such an extension would allow it to avoid the promptness requirement entirely\u2014surely an untenable result. To repeat yet again: \u201cA State has <em>no legitimate interest </em>in detaining . . . individuals who have been arrested without probable cause\u201d generally beyond 48 hours <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 55 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 62, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1669], italics added)\u2014whether or not such individuals have attained the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">In any case, the state\u2019s furtherance of the choices it has decided to pursue under the juvenile court law is not adversely affected by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s mandate of a prompt judicial probable cause determination generally within 48 hours of a juvenile\u2019s warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">The experience in Orange County appears typical. In a letter in support of the petition for review, the Orange County Public Defender represented that \u201c[i]n response to [McLaughlin], law enforcement agencies . . . prepare and submit single page pre-printed forms which, when completed, summarize the basis of a warrantless arrest\u201d; the \u201carresting agency . . . submits a \u2018probable cause\u2019 sheet to Juvenile Hall intake officers when booking a minor\u201d; twice a day when court is in session and once a day when it is not, a judicial officer reviews the \u201c \u2018probable cause\u2019 sheets,\u201d either directly or over the telephone, and \u201cmakes the necessary determination\u201d; \u201c[throughout the foregoing procedures, the minor\u2019s normal Juvenile Hall routine is never interrupted or delayed and no changes have been made in this routine as a result of the above <em>McLaughlin </em>procedure\u201d; \u201c[a]t no time is the minor transported to a courtroom or holding area in conjunction with a \u2018probable cause\u2019 determination\u201d; \u201c[a]t no time is the district attorney or public defender\u2019s office consulted as to any probable cause determination\u201d; the \u201cdetermination is non-adversarial and there are no court appearances by the minor, counsel or any law enforcement personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">The lead opinion also implies that \u201cpromptness\u201d for purposes of the prompt judicial probable cause determination mandated by the Fourth Amendment as construed by <em>Gerstein </em>and <em>McLaughlin </em>may be measured in terms of the time that is required for any given state to \u201ctake\u201d whatever \u201csteps\u201d it chooses beyond those \u201cincident to arrest\u201d <em>(Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>420 U.S. at p. 114 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 65]). That cannot be. As stated, a federal constitutional mandate that is designed to constrain the states cannot be dependent on such individual policy choices. Otherwise, that mandate would be rendered empty: each individual state would effectively be allowed to define \u201cpromptness\u201d for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">One thing remains to be said. And it is important. The lead opinion\u2019s reasoning does not express the views of a majority of this court. As a result, its analysis \u201clacks authority as precedent\u201d <em>(Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 903, 918 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 838 P.2d 1198]) and hence cannot bind. Therefore, its mischief is limited to this case and to this case alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">For the reasons stated, I conclude that Gerstein's promptness requirement is indeed applicable to juveniles and that <em>McLaughlin's </em>definition of \u201cpromptness\u201d does in fact operate in this setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">From this conclusion, it follows that petitioner\u2019s systemic Fourth Amendment challenge to the superior court\u2019s \u201cofficial position\u201d that Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement, at least as defined by <em>McLaughlin, </em>is not applicable to juveniles is successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal with directions to cause issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the superior court to comply with Gerstein\u2019s promptness requirement as defined by <em>McLaughlin </em>with regard to juveniles as well as adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">In closing, I quote, with minor modifications, Justice Scalia\u2019s final words in his dissenting opinion in <em>McLaughlin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">\u201cJustice Story wrote that the Fourth Amendment \u2018is little more than the affirmance of a great constitutional doctrine of the common law.\u2019 [Citation.] It should not become less than that. One hears the complaint, nowadays, that the Fourth Amendment has become constitutional law for the guilty; that it benefits the career criminal (through the exclusionary rule) often and directly, but the ordinary citizen remotely if at all. By failing to protect the innocent [juvenile] arrestee, today\u2019s [decision] reinforces that view. . . . Hereafter a law-abiding [juvenile] wrongfully arrested may be compelled to await the grace of a Dickensian bureaucratic machine, as it churns its cycle for up to [three] days\u2014never once given the opportunity to show a judge that there is absolutely no reason to hold him, that a mistake has been made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>In my view, this is the image of a system of justice that has lost its ancient sense of priority, a system that few Americans would recognize as our own.\u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 71 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 72, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1677] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">Kennard, J., and George, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">Indeed, as the lead opinion notes <em>(ante, </em>p. 1217), the original habeas corpus petition challenged the \u201cofficial position\u201d of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, based on an opinion of county counsel, that juveniles are not entitled to a prompt probable cause determination under <em>McLaughlin, supra, </em>500 U.S. 44. For this reason, I agree with Justice Mosk and Justice George that the lead opinion is nonresponsive and therefore unpersuasive to the extent the analysis relies on <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 253 [81 L.Ed.2d 207, 104 S.Ct. 2403], a case decided on Fourteenth Amendment due process grounds, and <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1993) 507 U.S__[123 L.Ed.2d 1, 113 S.Ct. 1439], a Fifth Amendment due process decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">The Fourth Amendment, of course, is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Wolf v.

That federal constitutional rule is now settled and, of course, binding upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Although, as the lead opinion recognizes, the procedures constitutionally mandated in juvenile proceedings need not mirror in all respects the procedures required in adult criminal proceedings, I agree with Justice Mosk\u2019s conclusion that the People have not identified any state interest that would justify incarcerating a juvenile, detained solely because law enforcement authorities believe he or she has committed a crime, for a period of time (before according the juvenile an impartial judicial determination of probable cause) longer than the time the state could detain an adult under similar circumstances. Indeed, in this context, I believe the need for a very prompt judicial determination of probable cause may be a more crucial factor in assessing the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the \u201cseizure\u201d of a juvenile than of an adult, because the consequences of even a relatively brief, wrongful incarceration are likely to be more detrimental and long-lasting to an innocent, vulnerable child than to an innocent adult. (See, e.g., <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 31, fn. 25 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737].) In my view, the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is not supported either by <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 253 [81 L.Ed.2d 207, 104 S.Ct. 2403], or the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>recent decision in <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1993) 507 U.S._[123 L.Ed.2d 1, 113 S.Ct. 1439], because neither case purported to address the propriety of an extended detention of a juvenile who could be released to the custody of his or her family but has been detained solely because he or she is suspected of committing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Petitioner\u2019s application for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 18, 1994, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
