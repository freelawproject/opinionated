(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subds. (a), (c).) For offenses generally, the juvenile court is permitted to find unfitness in light of certain \u201cfitness\u201d criteria. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 707, subd. (a).) But for offenses specified in subdivision (b), it is required to presume unfitness unless it concludes otherwise under each and every one of those same criteria. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 707, subd. (c).) If it finds unfitness, prosecution in a court of criminal jurisdiction is authorized. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 707.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 1769 (hereafter section 1769) establishes the maximum period of control for a minor committed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>juvenile court to the California Youth Authority because of a criminal offense. Under subdivision (a), which applies to offenses generally, the period of control automatically extends for two years or until the minor\u2019s twenty-first birthday, whichever occurs later. But under subdivision (b), which applies to offenses specified in subdivision (b) of section 707, the period of control automatically extends for two years or until the minor\u2019s twenty-fifth birthday, whichever occurs later.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We granted review in this matter to construe subdivision (b)(3) of section 707, which specifies the criminal offense of \u201c[rjobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d The question is whether the offense specified covers \u201cvicarious\u201d as well as \u201cpersonal\u201d arming. As we shall explain, we conclude that the answer is affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Pursuant to section 602, the People filed a delinquency petition in the juvenile court against Christopher R. (hereafter minor), who was 16 years of age or older at the time relevant here. As subsequently amended, the pleading was to the following effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In count I, the delinquency petition alleged that, on or about February 21, 1991, minor committed the felony of robbery in violation of Penal Code section 211. It also alleged that he \u201cpersonally use[d] a firearm\u201d in the commission of the offense within the meaning of the sentence enhancement established by subdivision (a) of Penal Code section 12022.5. It further alleged that he was \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d in the commission of the offense within the meaning of the sentence enhancement established by subdivision (a)(1) of Penal Code section 12022. The latter enhancement, by its very terms, \u201capplies] to any person who is a principal in the commission or attempted commission of a felony if one or more of the principals is armed with a firearm, <em>whether or not such person is personally armed with a </em>firearm.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In count II, the delinquency petition alleged that, on or about February 21, 1991, minor unlawfully drove or took a vehicle contrary to former section 10851 of the Vehicle Code (Stats. 1986, ch. 1214, \u00a7 1, pp. 4293-4294). It also alleged the personal-use-of-a-firearm and armed-with-a-firearm sentence enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">In count III, the delinquency petition alleged that, on or about March 22, 1991, minor committed the felony of burglary in violation of Penal Code section 459. It also effectively alleged that the burglary was of an \u201cinhabited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>dwelling house\u201d within the meaning of former subdivision 1 of Penal Code section 460 and, as a consequence, was of the first degree (Stats. 1989, ch. 357, \u00a7 3, pp. 1475-1476).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In the delinquency petition, the People effectively moved the juvenile court under section 707 to determine that minor was unfit to be dealt with under the juvenile court law. They claimed in substance that the felony of robbery <em>plus </em>the armed-with-a-firearm sentence enhancement, which were alleged in count I, amounted to the criminal offense of \u201c[rjobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707. They also claimed in substance that the felony of robbery <em>plus </em>the personal-use-of-a-firearm sentence enhancement, which were alleged in count I, and the unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle <em>plus </em>the same enhancement, which were alleged in count II, each amounted to an \u201coffense described in Section 12022.5 of the Penal Code,\u201d as specified in subdivision (b)(17) of section 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It was undisputed that minor committed the criminal offenses alleged in the delinquency petition with other persons. It was also undisputed that in the robbery alleged in count I minor was \u201cvicariously\u201d but not \u201cpersonally\u201d armed with a firearm, that is to say, he himself was not armed but at least one of his partners was.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The juvenile court impliedly concluded that the felony of robbery <em>plus </em>the armed-with-a-firearm sentence enhancement, which were alleged in count I of the delinquency petition, amounted to the criminal offense of \u201c[rjobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707. As a result, it presumed that minor was unfit. But it then proceeded to conclude otherwise. As a consequence, it determined that minor was indeed fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Subsequently, the juvenile court declared minor a ward of the court. On minor\u2019s admission that he \u201calong with . . . two other persons went to a night depository at [a] bank\u201d and \u201caided and abetted an individual who robbed somebody at gunpoint,\u201d it found true the allegations in count I of the delinquency petition that minor committed robbery and was armed with a firearm, albeit only \u201cvicariously.\u201d It determined that the foregoing amounted to the criminal offense of \u201c[rjobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707. It dismissed all the other allegations in the delinquency petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The juvenile court committed minor to the California Youth Authority. It set the maximum term of confinement at seven years, six for the felony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>robbery and one for the armed-with-a-firearm sentence enhancement. It did so because it fixed the degree of the robbery at the first (Pen. Code, \u00a7 212.5, subd. (a)) rather than the second <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 212.5, subd. .(b)), and imposed six years as the upper term for the former <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 213, subd. (a)(1)) rather than five years as the upper term for the latter <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 213, subd. (a)(2)). Under subdivision (b) of section 1769, the period of control by the California Youth Authority was permitted to extend to minor\u2019s 25th birthday because of his commission of a criminal offense specified in subdivision (b) of section 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed. Among other things, it upheld the juvenile court\u2019s determination that minor\u2019s commission of robbery while armed with a firearm, albeit only \u201cvicariously,\u201d amounted to the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In setting out to construe \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707, we seek, of course, to discover the meaning of the provision. In other words, we aim to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent. Here, we do no more and no less than to follow the \u201cfundamental rule of statutory interpretation\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aston </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 481, 489 [216 Cal.Rptr. 771, 703 P.2d 111]; accord, e.g., <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1082, 1095 [282 Cal.Rptr. 841, 811 P.2d 1025]), viz., \u201cto ascertain and effectuate legislative intent\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154]; accord, e.g., <em>Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672]).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">As stated above, section 707 provides in relevant part as follows. The juvenile court is authorized to determine whether a minor who is alleged in a delinquency petition to have committed a criminal offense at 16 or 17 years of age is fit to be dealt with under the juvenile court law. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subds. (a), (c).) For offenses generally, it is permitted to find unfitness in light of the \u201cfitness\u201d criteria. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 707, subd. (a).) But for offenses specified in subdivision (b), it is required to presume unfitness unless it concludes otherwise under each and every one of those same criteria. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 707, subd. (c).) Included among such offenses in subdivision (b)(3) is \u201c[rjobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">What the Legislature did in specifying criminal offenses in subdivision (b) of section 707 may be simply stated. It merely referred to offenses that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>independently defined in the general criminal law. Thus, subdivision (b) of section 707 expressly points to section 602, and section 602 in turn expressly points to the \u201claw of this state\u201d and \u201cof the United States\u201d and to the \u201cordinancefsj\u201d of this state\u2019s \u201ccit[ies]\u201d and \u201ccountries].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">For some of the criminal offenses specified in subdivision (b) of section 707, the Legislature made reference to offenses independently defined in the general criminal law by means of implication, as through quotation or paraphrase. As an illustration, in subdivision (b)(1), it identified the crime of \u201c[mjurder,\u201d which is defined in Penal Code section 187, subdivision (a) , as the \u201cunlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">For the other criminal offenses specified in subdivision (b) of section 707, the Legislature made reference to offenses independently defined in the general criminal law in express terms, as through direct citation. As an example, in subdivision (b)(6), it indicated the crime of \u201c[ljewd or lascivious act as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 288 of the Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The question here is this: By specifying the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d in subdivision (b) (3) of section 707, to what offense independently defined in the general criminal law did the Legislature refer?</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">It was in 1976 that the Legislature added subdivision (b), including subdivision (b)(3), to section 707. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1071, \u00a7 28.5, p. 4826.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">In 1976, former section 211a of the Penal Code stated: \u201cAll robbery which is perpetrated by torture <em>or by a person being armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon, </em>and the robbery of any person who is performing his duties as operator of any motor vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley used for the transportation of persons for hire, is robbery in the first degree. All other kinds of robbery are of the second degree.\u201d (Stats. 1961, ch. 1874, \u00a7 1, p. 3975, italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It covered \u201cvicarious\u201d as well as \u201cpersonal\u201d arming. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Floyd </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 694, 708 [83 Cal.Rptr. 608, 464 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>64], disapproved on another point, <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 287, fn. 36 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 62, 64 [230 P.2d 353]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Barclay </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 146, 155-156 [252 P.2d 321], disapproved on another point, <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 631, 648-649 [36 Cal.Rptr. 201, 388 P.2d 33, 12 A.L.R.3d 810]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1945) 71 Cal.App.2d 646, 651 [163 P.2d 59]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(1939) 36 Cal.App.2d 1, 6 [97 P.2d 256]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>(1939) 32 Cal.App.2d 666, 667-668 [90 P.2d 595]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1931) 114 Cal.App. 91, 93 [299 P. 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In view of the foregoing, we answer the question stated above thus: By specifying the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707, the Legislature referred to the felony described in former section 211a of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We conclude therefrom that the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707, which takes its definition from former section 211a of the Penal Code, requires: (1) robbery; (2) arming, either \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cvicarious\u201d; and (3) a dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Guided by this conclusion in the case at bar, we believe that the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707 embraces the felony described in Penal Code section 211 <em>plus </em>the sentence enhancement established by subdivision (a)(1) of Penal Code section 12022.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Penal Code section 211 states: \u201cRobbery is the felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Subdivision (a)(1) of Penal Code section 12022 provides a sentence enhancement, as noted, for \u201cany person who is armed with a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of a felony,\u201d including \u201cany person who is a principal in the commission or attempted commission of a felony if one or more of the principals is armed with a firearm, whether or not such person is personally armed with a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Thus, the felony described in Penal Code section 211 <em>plus </em>the sentence enhancement established by subdivision (a)(1) of Penal Code section 12022 meets the three requirements identified above. First, of course, there is robbery. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211.) Second, there is arming, either \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cvicarious.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1).) Third, there is a dangerous or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>deadly weapon, to wit, a firearm. <em>(Ibid.) </em>When loaded, a \u201cgun is unquestionably a dangerous and deadly weapon\u201d; even when unloaded, it is at least a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d (2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Crimes Against Property, \u00a7 637, pp. 718, 719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In arguing that the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of,section 707 covers only \u201cpersonal\u201d arming, minor sets out to construe the relevant language in accordance with, among other provisions, Penal Code section 12022 as it stood in 1976, when subdivision (b)(3) was added to section 707. In that year, Penal Code section 12022 provided a sentence enhancement for \u201c[a]ny person who commits or attempts to commit any felony within this state while armed with any . . . deadly weapon[]\u201d (Stats. 1968, ch. 1386, \u00a7 1, p. 2720)\u2014\u201carmed\u201d having been construed to mean \u201cpersonally armed\u201d (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hicks </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 757, 766, fn. 4 [94 Cal.Rptr. 393, 484 P.2d 65]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 232, 241 [133 Cal.Rptr. 520, 555 P.2d 306]; see Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7304, p. 5161 [amending Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022 to reach only the \u201cperson who commits or attempts to commit any felony within this state while <em>personally </em>armed with any deadly weapon\u201d (italics added)], superseded before it became operative by Stats. 1977, ch. 165, \u00a7 91, p. 678 [amending Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022 to cover \u201cvicarious\u201d as well as \u201cpersonal\u201d arming], which became operative on the same date).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We reject minor\u2019s argument at the very threshold. It overlooks the crucial fact that, by specifying the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707 among those that originally appeared in the provision in 1976, the Legislature referred to the felony described in former section 21 la of the Penal Code and <em>not </em>to the sentence enhancement established by subdivision (a)(1) of Penal Code section 12022. A comparison of the language of the two provisions proves the point. \u201cRobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d under subdivision (b)(3) of section 707 is a close paraphrase of \u201crobbery . . . perpetrated ... by a person being armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d under former section 211a of the Penal Code. It is not a paraphrase \u2014close or otherwise\u2014of \u201c[a]ny person who commits or attempts to commit any felony within this state while armed with any . . . deadly weapon[]\u201d under Penal Code section 12022 as it then stood. Indeed, it is patently different. For example, subdivision (b)(3) of section 707 speaks of \u201crobbery\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d weapons. Not so Penal Code section 12022.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Although we need not address particular aspects of minor\u2019s argument because of our conclusion above, we may properly comment on his reliance on two purported canons of statutory construction. One is that \u201cif a statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>intended to impose a derivative liability on some person other than the actor, there must be some legislative direction that it is to be applied to persons who do not themselves commit the proscribed act.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 241-242.) The other is that any \u201cambiguity [in a statute] must be resolved in [the minor\u2019s] favor ....\u2019\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 814, 832 [176 Cal.Rptr. 521, 633 P.2d 186].) By its very terms, however, subdivision (b)(3) of section 707 was not intended to impose liability, derivative or otherwise. Neither is it ambiguous. Notwithstanding minor\u2019s claim, it clearly covers \u201cvicarious\u201d as well as \u201cpersonal\u201d arming.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We may make one additional point in passing. The criminal offense of \u201c[rjobbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707 may reasonably perform its function in the statutory scheme whether the arming is \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201cvicarious.\u201d Certainly, a minor\u2019s participation in an armed robbery may be deemed sufficient to raise the presumption of unfitness, when alleged, and to trigger the extended period of California Youth Authority control, when found, without regard to the precise character of such participation. Minor\u2019s assertion to the contrary is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the Court of Appeal did not err when it upheld the juvenile court\u2019s determination that minor\u2019s commission of robbery while armed with a firearm, albeit only \u201cvicariously,\u201d amounted to the criminal offense of \u201c[r]obbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d specified in subdivision (b)(3) of section 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Although not raised by either the People or minor and not considered by the Court of Appeal, the following matter appears on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">As noted, the juvenile court fixed the degree of the robbery at the first rather than the second, and imposed six years as the upper term for the former rather than five years as the upper term for the latter. In doing so, it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">First degree robbery comprises \u201c[e]very robbery of any person who is performing his or her duties as an operator of any bus, taxicab, cable car, streetcar, trackless trolley, or other vehicle, including a vehicle operated on stationary rails or on a track or rail suspended in the air, and used for the transportation of persons for hire, every robbery of any passenger which is perpetrated on any of these vehicles, and every robbery which is perpetrated in an inhabited dwelling house, a vessel, as defined in Section 21 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Harbors and Navigation Code, which is inhabited and designed for habitation, or a trailer coach, as defined in the Vehicle Code, which is inhabited, or the inhabited portion of any other building . . . (Pen. Code, \u00a7 212.5, subd. (a).) Second degree robbery includes \u201c[a]ll kinds of robbery other than those listed\u201d above. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 212.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">It is apparent on the face of the record that the robbery committed by minor was of the second degree and not the first. Without question, it was indeed a robbery. But it was not of any of the kinds listed as robbery of the first degree. It necessarily follows that five years was authorized as the upper term and not six.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We conclude that, to the extent that it affirms the judgment of the juvenile court fixing the degree of the robbery at the first and imposing six years as the upper term therefor, the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be reversed with directions to modify the judgment of the juvenile court to fix the degree of the robbery at the second and impose five years as the upper term therefor. We conclude that, in all other particulars, the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Lucas, C.

(See Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 137.5, p. 5100, eff. Jan. 1, 1977, operative July 1, 1977 [\u201cThe robbery of any person who is performing his duties as operator of any motor vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley used for the transportation of persons for hire, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for three, four or five years.\u201d].) In 1978, it was amended in a way not relevant here. (Stats. 1978, ch. 579, \u00a7 6, pp. 1981-1982.) In 1986, it was repealed.
