Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 189),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and found true the allegation of personal use of a knife in the commission of each offense (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) and a multiple-murder special circumstance (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)). At the penalty phase, the jury fixed the penalty at death, and thereafter the court imposed a sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">This case reaches us on automatic appeal. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 11; \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The evidence at trial established that on September 6 or 7, 1984, in a Bakersfield apartment, defendant fatally stabbed his girlfriend, Maureen Bautista, in the presence of her 14-year-old son, Telesforo. Immediately thereafter, defendant fatally stabbed Telesforo. Several hours after defendant committed the murders and departed from the crime scene, two of his acquaintances, Greg Rambo and Larry Tom Whittington, returned to the apartment and concealed the victims\u2019 bodies inside a bedroom dresser. Defendant and Rambo transported the dresser containing the bodies out of Kern County to the town of Shandon, located in San Luis Obispo County, entombing the dresser beneath a layer of fresh concrete in the yard behind Rambo\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Although no physical evidence was discovered linking defendant to the Bautista murders, several of his acquaintances testified that he confessed committing the crimes to them prior to his arrest in March of 1985. The defense focused upon impugning the credibility of these witnesses. Defendant did not present an alibi defense, nor did he testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>I. Guilt Phase Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AQz\">A. <em>The prosecution\u2019s case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">1. <em>Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The prosecution\u2019s case rested largely on evidence that defendant had, on numerous occasions, confessed his participation in the crimes to acquaintances with whom he had been involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine. According to the prosecution, defendant killed Maureen Bautista because he feared she would \u201csnitch him off\u2019 regarding his involvement in methamphetamine manufacturing, and killed her son, Telesforo, because Telesforo had witnessed defendant\u2019s lethal attack on his mother. In support of its case, the prosecution presented numerous witnesses who testified to defendant\u2019s intense hatred of \u201csnitches\u201d (persons who report illegal activities to third persons) and to defendant\u2019s frequent comments, both before and after the Bautista murders, to the effect that \u201csnitches die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">2. <em>Defendant\u2019s methamphetamine manufacturing activity, and his relationship to the victims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Greg Rambo\u2019s surviving spouse, Susan Rambo (who was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony), provided important testimony regarding the principal elements of the prosecution\u2019s case. She described defendant\u2019s methamphetamine manufacturing activity, which began during the summer of 1984 in a small trailer located behind the Shandon residence that she shared with her husband, Greg Rambo. The trailer was located unobtrusively amidst dog kennels and old, discarded automobiles. The rural, unassuming setting was well suited to the covert operation of a methamphetamine laboratory. Defendant had met the Rambos through a mutual acquaintance, Larry Tom Whittington.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">The participants in the drug operation maintained well-defined roles. Susan Rambo served as a lookout. Defendant was the \u201ccook,\u201d the person who mixed the chemicals to prepare the methamphetamine (a product that also was referred to by certain witnesses as \u201cspeed\u201d or \u201ccrank.\u201d) Larry Tom Whittington financed the trailer laboratory, provided necessary supplies, and sold the finished product. Greg Rambo cleaned up after the \u201ccook\u201d and also served as a lookout. According to Susan Rambo, Whittington paid her husband, in cash and with methamphetamine, for the use of the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">According to numerous witnesses, defendant frequently \u201cfreebased\u201d (i.e., smoked) cocaine. His profit in manufacturing methamphetamine consisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>chiefly of a ready supply of cocaine from Larry Tom Whittington. According to Susan Rambo, Whittington \u201cwould supply the cocaine for [defendant], deduct what they owed him for the cook . . . and gave [defendant] money when he needed it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Susan Rambo testified that defendant prepared his first batch of methamphetamine in the trailer laboratory in August 1984, and prepared four to six subsequent batches that year. Each batch required two to three days to prepare, during which time, according to her, defendant stayed awake, smoking his cocaine pipe. She said defendant freebased cocaine frequently, regardless whether he was manufacturing methamphetamine, and rarely was without cocaine for more than four or five days, when Larry Tom Whittington would replenish defendant\u2019s supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Larry Tom Whittington, testifying on cross-examination, substantially confirmed Susan Rambo\u2019s account of defendant\u2019s work habits and cocaine usage, stating that defendant stayed awake throughout each multi-day \u201ccook,\u201d and that defendant consumed \u201ca couple of ounces [of cocaine] a week, at least,\u201d an expense that, according to Whittington\u2019s estimate, cost defendant approximately $4,000 each week. Harlyn Codd testified (on cross-examination) that defendant \u201ccould put away an ounce of coke freebasing a day if he had it with him.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Linda Rich, a friend of Maureen Bautista, testified that in the year preceding Bautista\u2019s murder, Bautista and defendant had a stormy relationship, punctuated with numerous arguments. She recalled one such quarrel, in April or May of 1984, in which she went to the door of the Bautistas\u2019 apartment (which was open, although the screen door was closed), heard the sound of dishes breaking, and observed that a telephone had been \u201cpulled out.\u201d On cross-examination, Rich acknowledged that defendant had been kind to Telesforo and had purchased gifts for him, but also that defendant freebased cocaine in the boy\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">At the end of August or the beginning of September of 1984, the Bautistas joined defendant, Larry Tom Whittington, and Harlyn Codd on a fishing trip at Lake Isabella. Codd overheard an argument between Maureen Bautista and defendant, in which defendant threatened to kill Maureen because she planned to \u201csnitch\u201d (on the drug operation participants) to Eddie Nash whom, according to Susan Rambo, defendant considered to be his enemy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Susan Rambo testified that Codd had told her Nash was Telesforo\u2019s father; also, that Nash once had paid defendant to fulfill a contract but that defendant had failed to perform and, as a result, Nash was \u201clooking for\u201d defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">3. <em>The \u201cNash testimony\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court permitted the prosecution to introduce the testimony of several witnesses to establish a connection between defendant and Eddie Nash, who was a convicted drug dealer. By this evidence, the prosecution sought to corroborate the testimony of other witnesses that defendant knew Nash, in order to demonstrate that defendant reasonably might have harbored a great fear of Nash because of Nash\u2019s violent reputation and prior criminal activities, and generally to support the evidence, noted above, that indicated defendant murdered Maureen Bautista because he feared she would inform Nash of defendant\u2019s whereabouts and his drug manufacturing activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">4. <em>The Bautista murders: defendant\u2019s conduct, confessions, and threats</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">On September 4, 1984, Maureen and Telesforo Bautista registered at a Bakersfield motel. The motel manager testified that he recalled seeing defendant that afternoon on the premises. On the evening of September 6, Telesforo prepaid in cash for that night\u2019s lodging. At a later point that evening, or in the early hours of the next morning, defendant and the Bautistas moved to an unoccupied Bakersfield apartment rented by Patricia Shepard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Defendant telephoned Larry Tom Whittington near midnight on September 6, asking Whittington to meet him at Shepard\u2019s apartment immediately. When Whittington arrived, defendant said he and Maureen Bautista had been arguing loudly at the motel and had been concerned someone would call the police, so he and the Bautistas had moved to Shepard\u2019s apartment. Defendant told Whittington he was afraid Maureen was planning to \u201csnitch him off\u2019 to Eddie Nash or Nash\u2019s attorney; defendant\u2019s fear stemmed from his belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that Nash was scheduled to be released from prison the following day. When Whittington asked defendant where the Bautistas were, he said they were sleeping in the bedroom. Whittington did not see them, nor did he hear any sounds emanating from the bedroom. He noticed the telephone appeared to have been ripped from the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">When Whittington awoke at his Bakersfield residence the next morning, September 7, to the sound of knocking, defendant entered and announced, \u201cI did it. ... I killed them.\u201d Defendant told Whittington that Maureen Bautista \u201cwas going to snitch me off [and] I know how to take care of snitches.\u201d When Whittington asked defendant to lower his voice so Shepard would not hear the conversation, defendant replied that Shepard should hear what had happened, because the deaths had occurred in her apartment. She thereafter joined the conversation. Both Whittington and Shepard testified that defendant told them he had killed Maureen Bautista and \u201cthe kid\u201d the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Shepard further testified that defendant stated he had killed the Bautistas by slitting their throats with a knife. She testified that defendant demonstrated to her the manner of stabbing. When she (or Whittington) asked why defendant had killed Telesforo, defendant replied that Telesforo had seen him kill the boy\u2019s mother. Defendant told Shepard and Whittington that Telesforo had been afraid of \u201cJason,\u201d the fictional killer depicted in the motion picture \u201cFriday the Thirteenth,\u201d but that the boy should have been afraid of defendant instead of \u201cJason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">A quarter of an hour later, defendant departed from Whittington\u2019s Bakersfield residence, informing him that he (defendant) had to leave town, and driving off in Maureen Bautista\u2019s automobile, a beige Honda Accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Susan Rambo testified that defendant sped into her yard on a Friday morning early in September (September 7 was a Friday), driving Maureen Bautista\u2019s automobile. Defendant was \u201ccompletely erratic, very hyper, babbling, not making sense,\u201d and excitedly stated: \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t believe me. I kept telling them. They wouldn\u2019t believe me. They should know what happens to snitches. Now she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Later that morning, after smoking his cocaine pipe, defendant appeared to calm down and make more sense. Defendant explained that Maureen Bautista had been yelling about \u201csnitches,\u201d and that Maureen was going to \u201csnitch\u201d on everyone involved in the drug operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Susan Rambo testified defendant told her that when he stabbed Maureen Bautista, Telesforo began screaming hysterically. Defendant told Telesforo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>to shut up, and stabbed him when he did not. Defendant explained to Susan Rambo, \u201cYou have to take out all witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Defendant also reminded Susan Rambo she too should be aware of what happens to \u201csnitches\u201d: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it to happen to you, you know you don\u2019t say anything. This is part of the game. This is part of the rules, part of the business. You\u2019re in it. You\u2019re involved.\u201d His threat made her afraid to contact the police, as did additional threats he directed toward her on numerous subsequent occasions regarding \u201cthe laws of snitches,\u201d his reminders that he killed \u201csnitches,\u201d and his habit of arming himself with a gun and a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On that same morning, September 7, Susan Rambo noticed that dark stains had discolored the pants defendant was wearing. Later that day, she observed defendant seated near her washing machine, naked, while the machine was operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Wayne James, another acquaintance of defendant, testified that defendant hated \u201csnitches\u201d and had told James that he had killed Maureen Bautista because she was going to \u201csnitch him off,\u201d and that her son had walked in while defendant was killing her, so defendant had to \u201csnuff him\u201d too. Defendant told James he had killed the Bautistas by \u201cstab[bing] them and cut[ting] them up with a knife.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">5. <em>Disposal of the Bautistas\u2019 bodies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Greg Rambo and Larry Tom Whittington returned to Shepard\u2019s apartment on September 7, placed the bodies of Maureen and Telesforo Bautista inside a hollow bedroom dresser, and, on the following day, defendant and Rambo transported the makeshift coffin to the Rambos\u2019 residence. Defendant thereafter told Susan Rambo that he and her husband were departing for Los Angeles for the purpose of removing defendant\u2019s belongings from Maureen Bautista\u2019s apartment, and that if anyone asked about him or Maureen, she should reply by stating that she had not seen them in weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Whittington testified that he and Patricia Shepard returned to Shepard\u2019s apartment to scrub off the bloodstains. He testified that he was able to remove the bloodstains, except for those on the carpet, which required repeated efforts at cleaning. Shepard testified, on cross-examination, that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>had purchased the carpet cleaner and other materials that were used to clean her apartment following the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">After defendant and Greg Rambo departed for Los Angeles, Rambo called his wife and requested that she ask his cousin, Doug Frederick, to obtain a backhoe and dig an eight-foot by ten-foot hole in the Rambos\u2019 backyard. Rambo instructed his wife to tell Frederick that the hole was needed for the construction of a new drainage system for the Rambos\u2019 dog kennels. Susan Rambo did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Doug Frederick testified that he dug the hole on September 6, 7, or 10, 1984; Susan Rambo testified that she awoke on a Monday morning to the sound of a backhoe operating on the property, a circumstance suggesting that Frederick had dug the hole on Monday, September 10. She testified that the hole appeared to be \u201ca couple hundred feet behind the house in the back comer of the lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Following defendant\u2019s return to Shandon, Susan Rambo noticed the presence of several bags and boxes in her garage, including a computer that defendant had given Telesforo Bautista, a television, a stereo, and some guns. At defendant\u2019s request, she purchased cement, bags for the bodies, and a needle to sew up the bags. Defendant told her he intended to place one foot of cement over the Bautistas\u2019 bodies. Susan Rambo testified that during the next few days, she observed defendant shoveling dirt into the hole for periods of up to one hour at a time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">6. <em>Defendant\u2019s conduct following his entombment of the Bautistas\u2019 bodies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Defendant resided with the Rambos until late November or December of 1984. On numerous occasions during this period, Susan Rambo heard defendant refer to \u201csnitches.\u201d Once defendant told her, \u201cYou know what happens to snitches,\u201d then removed a butcher knife from a magnetic rack on her kitchen wall and, declaring the knife to be \u201cjust about right,\u201d made several stabbing or slashing motions. She testified that on another occasion, defendant popped open a switchblade knife that \u201che would play with . . . constantly,\u201d and used it to stab a cardboard box that she was carrying. Defendant also told her that the ghost of Maureen Bautista was haunting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Susan Rambo testified that defendant moved out of the Rambos\u2019 residence in late 1984 to a trailer house on her father\u2019s property in Parkfield, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>defendant continued to manufacture methamphetamine in the course of the ensuing few months.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Harlyn Codd testified that in February 1985 he and defendant were watching a violent movie at Codd\u2019s residence in Porterville, and that defendant confessed to having committed the Bautista murders. According to Codd, the movie nauseated defendant, who remarked that the film reminded him of what had happened to Maureen Bautista and to \u201cthe kid.\u201d Defendant stated to Codd that he had \u201coffed\u201d the Bautistas by \u201ccut[ting] them up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">7. <em>The murder of Greg Rambo, and the disposal of his body</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Although the present appeal does not involve defendant\u2019s conviction for the murder of Greg Rambo (see fh. 2, <em>ante), </em>the jury heard evidence, summarized below, related to that murder. Much of this evidence was introduced by the defense during its cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, in an effort to undermine the witnesses\u2019 credibility by introducing evidence of their odd behavior, complicity, and deception in the aftermath of Greg Rambo\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Susan Rambo testified (on cross-examination) that her husband had pistol-whipped her and placed a handgun to her head on January 23, 1985, because he was angry over her failure to notice a pickup truck that had parked in their backyard. She testified: \u201cHe told me he would give me five minutes to get my stuff and get out.\u201d The Rambos separated, and Susan went to live with her parents in Parkfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Susan Rambo further testified that she last had seen her husband alive on February 19, 1985\u2014on an occasion when he was in a rage. On the following day, defendant telephoned her to say her husband would \u201cnever bother her again.\u201d She feared defendant\u2019s comment meant her husband was dead. Defendant requested that she acquire a tarp or some other object that could be used to dispose of various items (which he did not identify), and she obtained a sleeping bag. Defendant also asked to borrow her father\u2019s bulldozer to dig a hole, but her father refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Harlyn Codd testified that in February 1985 defendant telephoned him and said, \u201cGreg\u2019s dead. I killed him.\" According to Codd, defendant told him he had shot Rambo three times.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Because Codd was intoxicated at the time of defendant\u2019s, telephone call, Codd refused defendant\u2019s invitation to visit him that day in Parkfield. Codd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>met defendant the following day, and the two of them went to Parkfield to retrieve Greg Rambo\u2019s body from a shed. Codd testified that defendant feared Rambo \u201cwas going to be a snitch and he offed him.\u201d Rambo\u2019s body was wrapped in a sleeping bag and a blanket when Codd saw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Resolving to move the body at a later date, defendant and Codd proceeded to defendant\u2019s trailer, where defendant freebased cocaine. Codd also ingested cocaine in order to remain awake, because he did not trust defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Codd further testified defendant said he \u201cwanted to cut [Rambo\u2019s body] up, stick dynamite in him and blow it up, cut his hands off, knock his teeth out, disfigure him to leave no identification marks or anything ... so [Rambo] couldn\u2019t be identified.\u201d Instead, the pair drove to Tulare County, deposited Rambo\u2019s body in an orange grove, and returned thereafter to Codd\u2019s residence. The following morning, Codd and defendant retrieved Rambo\u2019s body, transported it to an isolated section of the county, and dumped it in a ravine known as Deer Creek Canyon. Codd acknowledged selecting the site and on cross-examination stated that after defendant\u2019s arrest, he led sheriff\u2019s deputies to the spot where he and defendant had dumped the body.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Wayne James testified that at some point after selling defendant a vehicle in February 1985, defendant threw him a spent .38 cartridge, telling James it was the shell that had killed Greg Rambo. Defendant informed James that he and Harlyn Codd had disposed of Rambo\u2019s body the previous evening in a ravine located outside Porterville.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">On March 3, 1985, in view of Greg Rambo\u2019s extended absence from the Shandon residence he had occupied with his wife Susan, she filed a missing person\u2019s report with the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff\u2019s Department. She testified on cross-examination that despite her awareness (on that date) of evidence suggesting her husband\u2019s violent demise, she nonetheless was not certain at that time that he was dead, and simply \u201cdid not know where he was.\u201d She acknowledged being the beneficiary of her husband\u2019s $100,000 life insurance policy, and telling defendant she needed to locate her husband\u2019s body in order for her to be able to collect the insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Susan Rambo also acknowledged that after cleaning up the Parkfield shed that had concealed her husband\u2019s body prior to its removal by defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Harlyn Codd, she assisted friends in searching for her husband. She acknowledged telephoning her husband\u2019s answering machine several times in the presence of other persons in an effort to fool them into believing she was attempting to locate him. She testified she engaged in the foregoing unusual activity and refrained from calling the authorities, because she feared defendant, Whittington, and Whittington\u2019s brother, Bill, each of whom, she said, \u201ccarried machine guns and automatic weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">8. <em>Defendant\u2019s arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Susan Rambo testified that near the end of February 1985, she was \u201cvery upset,\u201d and defendant told her he did not believe she \u201cwas going to hold up in front of questioning or . . .be able to keep up [her] part.\u201d She stated that defendant gave her his driver\u2019s license, admonishing her: \u201cHere, I want you to be sure and get my name right if you snitch, if you go to the cops.\u201d Susan Rambo interpreted defendant\u2019s remark\u2014made as his gun lay on the bed near them\u2014as an odd and \u201crather macho\u201d dare. She replied that she was attempting to stay out of town so as to avoid questions and the possibility of breaking down and becoming a \u201csnitch.\u201d Defendant told her he was \u201cready for the gas chamber . . . ready any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">On March 6, 1985, Susan Rambo contacted the Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Her statements led two days later to the excavation, by law enforcement officials, of two decomposed bodies located inside a dresser buried beneath a layer of cement behind the Rambos\u2019 residence. Dental records confirmed that the bodies were those of Maureen and Telesforo Bautista.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Defendant was arrested at a coffee shop in Gorman on March 14, 1985, claiming at the time that his name was Richard Brokaw, a name he had used in registering at a nearby motel. Defendant\u2019s wallet contained documents or identification in five names, including his own and that of Greg Rambo. A search by law enforcement officers of defendant\u2019s vehicle and motel room resulted in the seizure of several types of ammunition, including three boxes of high power .38-caliber ammunition, loose cartridges, a clip, and shotgun shells.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Shortly after his arrest, defendant telephoned Codd, stating that defendant had been \u201csnitched off\u2019 and was \u201cgoing to get the pill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">9. <em>Physical evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Dr. Karl Kirschner, a forensic pathologist, testified that he conducted autopsies on the Bautistas\u2019 bodies on March 9, 1985, one day after law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>enforcement officials had exhumed the bodies. He opined that the bodies had been buried for at least four months. Narrow cuts in the victims\u2019 clothing suggested that the victims had been stabbed repeatedly. Kirschner testified that the larger body (Maureen\u2019s) had been stabbed 11 times in the chest, and he opined the victim had died as a result of those wounds. Because each of the wounds pierced the chest cavity, Kirschner believed \u201cany one of them could have been fatal.\u201d Kirschner also stated that while this victim still was alive, she suffered two stab wounds in her jaw. Kirschner testified that the smaller body (Telesforo\u2019s) had been stabbed five times in the chest and twice in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Expert witnesses testified that blood spatters identified in Patricia Shepard\u2019s comer bedroom were consistent with the infliction of stab wounds and with the victims\u2019 blood types, and that the spatters also indicated the presence of commercial detergent products. A bloodstain extending more than five feet across the living room carpet suggested that a bloody body had been dragged across the floor. Carpet fibers found within the dresser were consistent with those obtained from Shepard\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">10. <em>Defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cThey can only gas me once\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Richard Lee, an investigator for the Monterey County District Attorney, testified that on April 4, 1985, defendant, while incarcerated in the Monterey County jail (in connection with the Parkfield murder of Greg Rambo), asked, \u201cSo you guys aren\u2019t going to try me; is that right?\u201d Lee replied that defendant would be tried in Kem County for the Bautista killings committed in Bakersfield, and in Monterey County for the Rambo killing. Defendant responded, \u201cThey can only gas me once. They can only take my wheels one time. Do you know what I mean?\u201d Lee responded, \u201cCome on Bob, that\u2019s negative vibes.\u201d Defendant laughed and said, \u201cYeah, negative vibes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m still breathing and there\u2019s a few people who ain\u2019t.\u201d Defendant then laughed again.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">B. <em>The defense case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The defense sought to establish that participants in the Shandon drug operation, other than defendant, had a financial motive that might have led one or more of them to commit the Bautista murders, as well as the murder of Greg Rambo. With that objective, the defense introduced the testimony of 15 witnesses in an effort to cast doubt upon the credibility of key prosecution witnesses whose testimony had implicated defendant in all 3 murders. In particular, the defense offered testimony aimed at impugning the credibility of Whittington by highlighting his evasive and occasionally contradictory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>pretrial testimony. The defense also introduced testimony directed at undercutting Susan Rambo\u2019s credibility as a prosecution witness by highlighting her odd behavior in the immediate aftermath of her husband\u2019s disappearance. The defense additionally sought to suggest that Susan Rambo might have been involved in her husband\u2019s murder, and that her motivation to hasten his demise had been fueled by lust and greed\u2014a desire to pursue an intimate relationship with defendant, and a desire to collect on her husband\u2019s life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">II. Penalty Phase Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AMC\">A. <em>The prosecution\u2019s case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The prosecution introduced stipulations it had entered into with the defense establishing that defendant had been convicted of second degree burglary in 1972 and possession of a silencer in 1981, both felonies. Over objections of defense counsel, the prosecution also introduced the testimony of witnesses regarding defendant\u2019s possession of firearms in 1981 and 1982, and his involvement in an alleged kidnapping that occurred in 1982. We briefly summarize the prosecution\u2019s evidence regarding the firearms and the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Douglas Gerst, a police officer employed by the City of Los Angeles, testified that in 1981, during two searches of a residence located in Canoga Park, he recovered numerous weapons, including a Mac Ten machine gun (with silencer), two automatic pistols, six revolvers, six rifles, and twelve shotguns. The prosecution introduced photographs of the machine gun and silencer. Gerst testified that thousands of rounds of ammunition were found inside the residence. Utility receipts established that the premises were defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Diane Sems described an incident in June 1982 in which an acquaintance of hers, Terry Fabricant, forced her into a pickup truck that was driven by another man. Sems was blindfolded, driven to a residence that she did not recognize (and where she observed guns), and forced by Fabricant to ingest drugs. After Fabricant fell asleep a few hours later, she escaped; the next day, no longer under the influence of drugs, she identified the driver of the pickup truck in a police photo lineup. Sems testified that defendant resembled the driver of the pickup truck, although she was uncertain and, in fact, acknowledged on cross-examination that she could not identify the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">To bolster Diane Sems\u2019s testimony, the prosecution introduced the testimony of Terry Fabricant, who stated that he had been an acquaintance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>defendant\u2019s in June 1982 and that defendant drove a pickup truck at that time. Fabricant was not questioned (and did not testify) regarding the facts underlying the alleged kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">To further corroborate Sems\u2019s story, the prosecution introduced the testimony of Philip Quartararol, a police detective employed by the City of Los Angeles. Quartararol testified that he had conducted the photo lineup recalled by Sems, that Sems had identified defendant during that lineup, and that Sems did not appear at that time to be under the influence of drugs. Quartararol also testified that he had obtained a search warrant for the same residence that Officer Gerst had searched one year earlier, and in the ensuing search had recovered two semiautomatic weapons, two shotguns', and several thousand rounds of ammunition. On cross-examination, Quartararol acknowledged that, under the law in effect at the time he conducted the search in 1982, a felon\u2019s possession of the firearms he discovered was not illegal, because the weapons were not concealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">B. <em>The defense case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">At the penalty phase, the defense presented evidence in mitigation relating to defendant\u2019s prison history, his upbringing and character, and his cordial relationship with a woman and her young daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">A document summarizing defendant\u2019s prison history indicated that defendant had adjusted well to prison. Defense counsel argued that this document demonstrated that defendant had been a \u201cmodel prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The testimony of Russell Garceau, defendant\u2019s younger brother, was introduced in an effort to demonstrate positive attributes on the part of defendant as well as the repeated adversity that defendant had faced throughout his life. This testimony indicated that defendant had been an intelligent child, had won poetry and art contests, and was an avid reader. As a youth, defendant developed bone disease in his ankle that required frequent hospitalization and caused defendant to miss \u201cquite a bit of his childhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Defendant\u2019s brother testified that his father had collected firearms, and when defendant was enrolled in junior high school, defendant had brought a gun to school and then, deciding that was the wrong thing to do, had given it to a school administrator with whom defendant had maintained a good relationship. According to this testimony, defendant was arrested and placed in a detention hall, where he frequently was beaten.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Defendant\u2019s brother further testified that at 16 years of age, defendant joined the Army, serving both domestically and in Vietnam, after which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>was honorably discharged in 1968. Upon defendant\u2019s return from Vietnam, he seemed embittered and began to commit burglaries, leading to his arrest and imprisonment. Defendant had been proud to be \u201cone of the few [inmates not] involved in violence or dope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In 1976, defendant rented three or four acres of land in Chatsworth, set up a horse ranch, and attempted to start a hayriding business. Defendant\u2019s brother believed that defendant was not involved in criminal activity during the two or three years he lived on the ranch, and that he had not owned any guns during this period. When the land thereafter was sold, defendant was compelled to sell his possessions and leave the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Defendant\u2019s brother further testified that defendant had a generous nature, noting, for example, that \u201che used to borrow money from me to give to the blind man . . . .\u201d Defendant always had repaid his debts, and made three years of automobile loan payments for the widow of a deceased business partner. Defendant often forgave loans that he had made to others. After his father\u2019s death, defendant visited and kept in touch with his mother, who resided in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Defendant\u2019s brother testified that during the 1980\u2019s, defendant \u201cstarted on drugs . . . that\u2019s when I saw his whole personality change . .. .. . Up to that time I thought he was probably the most honorable person \u00cd had ever met .... Then he started getting involved in cocaine and then all of a sudden he wouldn\u2019t show up when he was supposed to, he wasn\u2019t paying back like he used to pay back his loans and in a sense, to me, became flaky, his whole life seemed to change at that time. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The defense also introduced the testimony of Starr Calliez, who described defendant as being \u201cvery sensitive [and] very considerate.\u201d Calliez stated that in 1973, she was an acquaintance of defendant\u2019s brother, who mentioned at that time that he had a brother in prison. Calliez began corresponding with defendant, visited him in prison many times, and developed an intimate relationship with him following his release. Calliez stated that defendant was \u201cvery friendly and nice\u201d to her six-year old daughter, buying her gifts, and that the three of them engaged in activities as a family. Calliez acknowledged that defendant had not adjusted easily to life outside prison but noted that during their relationship, she never had known defendant to use drugs or resort to violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Calliez\u2019s close relationship with defendant ultimately ended, and thereafter, in 1983, she married someone else. Calliez was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn of defendant\u2019s possible involvement in the illegal activities described at trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Notwithstanding the evidence establishing defendant\u2019s murder of a mother and a child, Calliez still would feel comfortable in the event she and her daughter were to be alone in defendant\u2019s company.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Dissussion</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">I. Jury Selection Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AeA\">A. <em>Alleged Wheeler error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Defendant contends the prosecutor employed peremptory challenges purposefully to exclude Hispanic-sumamed women from the jury, and that the trial court committed prejudicial error in denying defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial based upon our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748].</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to remove the following prospective jurors: Sharon Montoya, Dolores Nejera, Jane Chavez, Lucy Martinez, and Hope Vasquez. Immediately following the excusal of Vasquez, defense counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor improperly had exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of group bias, resulting in the purposeful exclusion of Hispanic-sumamed women. Defense counsel made a second motion for mistrial pursuant to <em>Wheeler </em>immediately following the prosecution\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge against Rita Asuncion, the sixth and sole remaining Hispanic woman on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The trial court denied the <em>Wheeler </em>motions, finding in each instance that defendant had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motions for mistrial. As we shall explain, we reject defendant\u2019s argument, because the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings that a prima facie case of discrimination was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Recently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 405, 428 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 853 P.2d 992], we restated the applicable law: \u201cUnder the principles articulated in <em>Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d 258, 276-277, a party may not employ peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors solely on the basis of group bias. Group bias is a presumption that jurors are biased merely because they are members of an identifiable group distinguished on racial, religious, ethnic, or similar grounds. <em>(Wheeler, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>276; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuentes </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 707, 713 [286 Cal.Rptr. 792, 818 P.2d 75]; see <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 400 [113 L.Ed.2d 411, 111 S.Ct. 1364].) \u2018If a party believes an opponent is improperly using peremptory challenges for a discriminatory purpose, that party must make a timely objection and a prima facie showing that the jurors are being excluded on the basis of group bias. [Citation.] To establish a prima facie case, the moving party should first make as complete a record as possible; second, the moving party must establish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable group; and third, the moving party must show a strong likelihood that the persons are being excluded because of group association.\u2019 <em>(Fuentes, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 714.) Once the moving party has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the other party to come forward with a group-neutral explanation for the exercise of the challenges related to the particular case being tried. <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 281-282; <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 714.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In the present case, defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial were timely made. Also, we assume that defendant is correct in asserting, without challenge by the People, that Hispanic-sumamed women constitute a \u201ccognizable group\u201d under <em>Wheeler. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 652 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Motion </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 596, 605-606 [217 Cal.Rptr. 416, 704 P.2d 176] [Black women are a cognizable subgroup]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Trevino </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 667, 686 [217 Cal.Rptr. 652, 704 P.2d 719] [Hispanics are a cognizable group for purposes of <em>Wheeler], </em>disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194, 1219-1221 [255 Cal.Rptr. 569, 767 P.2d 1047].) Nevertheless, defendant failed to show a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that these prospective jurors were excluded because of a group association. His motions merely reiterated the names of the jurors removed by the prosecution and alleged that, because the removed jurors all were Hispanic-surnamed women, he had made a \u201cprima facie showing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Thus, the factual context underlying defendant\u2019s motions resembled that described in <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1154 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315]. In <em>Howard, </em>the defendant relied solely upon the circumstance that the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges had been directed toward the only two Black jurors. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In this case, as in <em>Howard, </em>the defendant \u201cdid not make any effort to set out the other relevant circumstances, such as the prospective jurors\u2019 individual characteristics, the nature of the prosecutor\u2019s voir dire, or the prospective jurors\u2019 answers to questions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u201c[W]hen a trial court denies a <em>Wheeler </em>motion without finding a prima facie case of group bias the reviewing court considers the entire record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of voir dire. [Citations.] As with other findings of fact, we examine the record for evidence to support the trial court\u2019s ruling. Because <em>Wheeler </em>motions call upon trial judges\u2019 personal observations, we view their rulings with \u2018considerable deference\u2019 on appeal. [Citations.] If the record \u2018suggests grounds upon which the prosecutor might reasonably have challenged\u2019 the jurors in question, we affirm. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The trial court observed that there were grounds upon which the prosecutor reasonably might have challenged the jurors in question: \u201cCertainly as to Mrs. Vasquez, she repeatedly claimed hardship and was very dissatisfied when I told her she couldn\u2019t be excused. I don\u2019t see why the People should be required to keep her. ... I know Mrs. Chavez had medical problems, we had a hard time getting her in, she wanted to be excused. Martinez was very difficult getting her in, Nejera was in her first trimester of pregnancy and Montoya I just don\u2019t recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motions. Based upon hardship, Hope Vasquez expressed reluctance to serve as a juror, mentioning a logistical difficulty related to the transportation of her daughter to school and her own travel to court for the trial. Dolores Nejera stated that some members of her family had run afoul of the law and had been incarcerated; one was a fugitive. Sharon Montoya expressed strong reservations relating to the responsibility she would face in the event the trial reached the penalty phase, indicating she did not believe anyone had the right to take the life of another person, and expressed concern based upon having heard of \u201cinnocent people being sentenced all the time.\u201d Lucy Martinez\u2019s contradictory responses to questions presented to her during voir dire examination suggested that she might have difficulty comprehending the questions. Jane Chavez also provided contradictory responses regarding her views on the death penalty, stated that she found the law confusing and probably would forget testimony, and opined that serving as a juror in this case \u201cwould be awful.\u201d Rita Asuncion, whose removal led to defendant\u2019s second <em>Wheeler </em>motion, indicated it was difficult for her to understand the concept of reasonable doubt, as well as the distinction between the guilt and penalty phases of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s observations regarding the presence of other Hispanic-sumamed individuals who remained on the panel suggest that its denial of defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>motions stemmed from the court\u2019s failure to recognize Hispanic-sumamed women as a cognizable class. We disagree. The record is clear that the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial was based upon its consideration of the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>jurors\u2019 responses on voir dire, and the record is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a prima facie case of discrimination was not established. We conclude the trial court properly found that defendant failed to satisfy the <em>Wheeler </em>requirement that he establish a prima facie case of discrimination. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 1153-1156; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 605-606 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1092 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659] [prima facie case of discrimination not established where challenged jurors\u2019 responses indicated a proper basis for their excusal]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 428-432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We also reject defendant\u2019s claim of federal constitutional error involving his rights to a fair trial and to equal protection of the laws. Having failed to raise the Sixth Amendment claim below, defendant has waived this issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McPeters </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1148, 1174 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 832 P.2d 146].)  Each claim also is substantively deficient; although defendants have a right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, they have no right to a jury that reflects the racial composition of the community. <em>(Holland </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 474, 480, 482-483 [107 L.Ed.2d 905, 916, 918, 110 S.Ct. 803]; see also <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1975) 419 U.S. 522,538 [42 L.Ed.2d 690,702-703,95 S.Ct. 692].)  Defendant\u2019s equal protection claim lacks merit because, as discussed above, the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant failed to make a prima facie showing that the jurors were excluded on the basis of group bias is supported by the record. (Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 3 F.3d 1327.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">B. <em>Alleged wrongful failure to exclude jurors for cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Defendant contends the trial court improperly denied defense motions to excuse for cause three prospective jurors who possessed views favoring the death penalty that defendant alleges would have impaired their ability to be fair and impartial. The three prospective jurors <em>never were impaneled, </em>however, having been excused following defense counsel\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges against them. Defendant nonetheless argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to exclude these prospective jurors for cause violated his rights to a fair and impartial jury under the federal and state Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Both Constitutions guarantee a defendant a trial by an impartial jury. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 736, 739-740 [263 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>503, 781 P.2d 537].)  A juror may be challenged for cause based upon his or her views of capital punishment if those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of the juror\u2019s duties in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. <em>(Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 412, 424 [83 L.Ed.2d 841, 851-852, 105 S.Ct. 844].)  A defendant who claims that the trial court wrongly denied a challenge for cause must demonstrate that his or her right to a fair and impartial jury was affected. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bittaker, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 1087-1088.)</p>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">Defendant fails to make the requisite showing. At the time the jury was sworn, he had <em>16 </em>peremptory challenges remaining. Thus, defendant cannot demonstrate that his ability to excuse peremptorily any other juror was affected by his decision to exercise peremptory challenges against the three jurors in question. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Raley </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 870, 904-905 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 678, 830 P.2d 712]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 518-519 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 375, 419, fn. 17 [243 Cal.Rptr. 842, 749 P.2d 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Because defendant did not exhaust his peremptory challenges, he must justify his failure to do so. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bittaker, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 1087-1088.) He contends the presence of five <em>other </em>\u201cpro-death\u201d persons remaining among the <em>jury venirepersons on the panel </em>inhibited defense counsel\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges. We rejected a similar argument in <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 401-402 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610], noting that defendant had failed to demonstrate that exhausting his remaining peremptory challenges would have led to the seating of a juror subject to removal for cause. In the present case, if defendant was dissatisfied with the jury as comprised, he could have exercised his remaining peremptory challenges, regardless of the views of venirepersons yet to be impaneled. No error appears.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">C. <em>Alleged Witt error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred when it dismissed for cause prospective juror Cathy Wilken. During voir dire examination, Wilken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>explained she had a \u201cbias\u201d against the death penalty and did not believe she could vote in favor of a death verdict. Her responses nonetheless were somewhat equivocal; she acknowledged the possibility she could vote in favor of the death penalty. When asked whether she could evaluate penalty phase evidence pursuant to the trial court\u2019s instructions and vote in favor of the death penalty if that were the appropriate punishment, however, Wilken replied, \u201cI truly don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In excusing Cathy Wilken, the trial court relied upon <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, supra, </em>469 U.S. 412, in which the United States Supreme Court held that a juror is disqualified from serving in a capital case if his or her views regarding the death penalty would \u201c \u2018prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424 [83 L.Ed.2d at pp. 851-852], fn. omitted.) This court has adopted the <em>Witt </em>standard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 767 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].)  Our task on review is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding that the juror\u2019s beliefs would \u201csubstantially impair the performance\u201d of the juror\u2019s duties is fairly supported by the record. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 1223 [quoting <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 168, 175 [91 L.Ed.2d 144, 153-154, 106 S.Ct. 2464]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 646-647 [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 875 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s finding. Wilken\u2019s responses indicated she was troubled by the prospect of sitting on a penalty phase jury and was uncertain whether she could set aside her bias against the death penalty in favor of weighing the evidence and following the trial court\u2019s instructions. Under these circumstances, the trial court properly could find that her views would \u201csubstantially impair the performance\u201d of her duties at the penalty phase. Accordingly, no error appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">D. <em>Cumulative effect of assigned errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Defendant contends the cumulative effect of the alleged jury-selection errors warrants reversal. In view of our foregoing discussion finding no error, we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">II. Guilt Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">A. <em>Defendant\u2019s motion to strike \u201cthe Nash testimony\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">At the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, the defense moved to strike the testimony of prosecution witnesses Eddie Nash, Tony Sylvester, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Ronald Coen, and Michelle Christie (whose collective testimony we refer to as \u201cthe Nash testimony\u201d). The motion to strike was made upon relevancy grounds and under Evidence Code section 352.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Outside the presence of the jury, the parties argued the relevancy of the evidence, and whether the evidence unfairly sought to establish defendant\u2019s \u201cguilt by association\u201d with Nash, a man defense counsel described as \u201cobviously disreputable.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to strike, accepting the prosecution\u2019s argument that the testimony was relevant to three distinct issues\u2014defendant\u2019s motive, defendant\u2019s state of mind, and the corroboration of other witnesses\u2019 testimony. The trial court found that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion to strike. Defendant argues this evidence was irrelevant under Evidence Code section 210 and, even if the evidence was relevant, the trial court abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 because the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the possibility it would unduly prejudice defendant. We shall address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">1. <em>The evidence satisfied Evidence Code section 210</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The central issue at trial was the identity of the person who fatally stabbed Maureen and Telesforo Bautista. The prosecution sought to establish that defendant had both the motive (fear of \u201csnitches\u201d) and the opportunity (time spent alone with the victims, and their trust of him) to commit the murders. The prosecution offered the \u201cNash testimony\u201d in order to help establish the identity of the killer, insofar as the evidence suggested that: (1) defendant had a motive to kill Maureen; (2) defendant\u2019s state of mind could have led him to commit the killings; and (3) the \u201cNash testimony\u201d corroborated the testimony of other prosecution witnesses. In contrast, the defense theory was that defendant was not the perpetrator of the killings, that he lacked the motive to commit the crimes in view of his close relationship with the victims, and that the killings more likely were committed by a third party, such as Larry Tom Whittington, who was involved in a lucrative drug operation and had no personal relationship with the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In determining the admissibility of the challenged evidence, we apply well-settled rules.  Only relevant evidence is admissible. (Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Code, \u00a7 350; <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 660, 681 [248 Cal.Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253].) Relevant evidence is defined in Evidence Code section 210 as evidence \u201chaving any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d The test of relevance is whether the evidence tends \u201clogically, naturally, and by reasonable inference\u201d to establish material facts such as identity, intent, or motive. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 856; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 631 [205 Cal.Rptr. 775, 685 P.2d 1126].) The trial court retains broad discretion in determining the relevance of evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The \u201cNash testimony\u201d was relevant to demonstrate defendant\u2019s motive for killing the Bautistas and to establish premeditation, in view of defendant\u2019s frequently voiced hatred of \u201csnitches\u201d and his expressed fear that Maureen Bautista would \u201csnitch him off\u2019 to Eddie Nash. The \u201cNash testimony\u201d suggested that defendant\u2019s motive in killing the Bautistas was self-preservation\u2014a desire to avoid having Nash, a man with a reputation for violence, learn of defendant\u2019s whereabouts and activities. In the absence of physical evidence linking defendant to the Bautista killings, the presence of a motive was particularly significant in this case. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1027-1028 [254 Cal.Rptr. 586, 766 P.2d 1] [evidence of spousal rape charge of which defendant was acquitted held relevant to issue of motive in prosecution for murder of the spouse]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 86, 109 [246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37] [motive an important issue where defense asserts that defendant and victim had a good relationship].) We therefore discern no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that the \u201cNash testimony\u201d was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">2. <em>The \u201cNash testimony\u201d was not unduly prejudicial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Defendant contends that even if the \u201cNash testimony\u201d were relevant, the trial court committed reversible error in failing to exclude it as unduly prejudicial pursuant to Evidence Code section 352.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendant further contends that, contrary to the admonition contained in numerous decisions of this court (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983, 1016-1017, and cases cited), the trial court failed to state on the record that it had weighed prejudice against probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The basis for defendant\u2019s motion to strike pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 was his assertion that the prosecution improperly sought to link <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>defendant with Nash based upon testimony likely to compel the jury to speculate as to defendant\u2019s guilt by reason of Nash\u2019s illegal activities, reputation, and previous encounters with the law.  In opposing the motion, the prosecution relied upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 576, 585 [217 Cal.Rptr. 212, 703 P.2d 1106], in which we adopted the following view: \u201c \u2018The \u201cprejudice\u201d referred to in Evidence Code section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against. . . [one party] as an individual and which has very little effect on the issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Yu </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 358, 377 [191 Cal.Rptr. 859]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Karis </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 638 [250 Cal.Rptr. 659, 758 P.2d 1189].)  After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments as to the alleged probative value and prejudicial effect of the \u201cNash testimony,\u201d the trial court took the matter under submission, noting on the record four days later that it was denying the motion based upon the prosecution\u2019s arguments and would consider giving the jury a limiting instruction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We discern no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. The admission of the \u201cNash testimony\u201d did present a risk of undue prejudice to defendant in view of Nash\u2019s criminal conduct, his violent reputation, and his prior association with defendant. Nevertheless, the danger that the jury might rely upon the \u201cNash testimony\u201d for an improper purpose (e.g., to conclude that defendant also was a violent individual) was minimized by the trial court\u2019s decision to give a limiting instruction. That instruction directed the jury to consider the \u201cNash testimony\u201d only if it tended to establish the identity and the motive of the perpetrator of the killings, defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the killings, corroboration of other evidence, or the credibility of any other witness. The instruction directed the jury not to consider the \u201cNash testimony\u201d as proof that defendant had a bad character or a disposition to commit crimes. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the risk of undue prejudice was not great.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">By contrast, the probative value of the \u201cNash testimony\u201d was considerable, because it bore directly upon the issue of defendant\u2019s motive to kill the Bautistas. In light of the testimony that defendant had told others that he feared Maureen Bautista would inform Eddie Nash of defendant\u2019s whereabouts, evidence pertaining to Nash\u2019s past criminal conduct and violent reputation plainly was of substantial importance in explaining why defendant might have killed a close acquaintance and her son. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction rendered it unlikely that the testimony establishing defendant\u2019s former association with Nash would evoke an emotional bias <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>against defendant. Although the \u201cNash testimony\u201d might have been damaging to defendant, it was not unduly prejudicial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Karis, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 637-638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We conclude that, in admitting the \u201cNash testimony,\u201d the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Evidence Code section 352, because it properly could find that the probative value of the testimony outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Nor do we discern error in the trial court\u2019s failure to provide a more precise description of the weighing process it engaged in pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. The parties argued at length the issue of alleged probative value versus prejudice. The trial court, after taking the matter under submission, denied defendant\u2019s motion to strike, stating: \u201cThe Court accepts the arguments of the People regarding the offer of the testimony. The Court will consider a limiting instruction. . . .\u201d The record, including the trial court\u2019s comments, sufficiently establishes that the court weighed and rejected the arguments of defense counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 660; <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, Al </em>Cal.3d atpp. 1016-1017.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s admission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in permitting Richard Lee to testify regarding his conversation with defendant at the Monterey County jail, during which (according to Lee\u2019s testimony) defendant said: \u201cThey can only gas me once. They can only take my wheels one time. . . . I\u2019m still breathing and there\u2019s a few people who ain\u2019t.\u201d Defendant argues that Lee\u2019s testimony was hearsay and, in the alternative, irrelevant. He further claims that the probative value of the testimony hinged upon unreasonable speculation that his comments to Lee evinced a consciousness of guilt, thereby abridging his right to due process of law under the federal and state Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Defendant has waived any claim of error involving the admission of Lee\u2019s testimony, by reason of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object on the hearsay and relevancy grounds now raised on appeal (or on any other ground, for that matter). (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 766.)  Furthermore, even if defendant had raised a timely objection, his claim is substantively without merit, because the jury reasonably could have viewed defendant\u2019s statement to Lee\u2014a nonhearsay statement not offered for the truth of the matter asserted\u2014as an implied admission of guilt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 83-84 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127] [defendant\u2019s actions at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>his arrest were relevant to establish his consciousness of guilt and his knowledge of the magnitude of the crime], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 667, 675-676 [238 Cal.Rptr. 1] [defendant\u2019s statements were not hearsay, because they were not offered for the truth of the matters asserted, but \u201cwere properly characterized as admissions since an admission simply is any extrajudicial statement\u2014whether inculpatory or exculpatory\u2014 \u2018which tends to prove his guilt when considered with the rest of the evidence\u2019 \u201d (quoting CALJIC No. 2.71)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">C. <em>Admission of photographs and physical evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Over the objections of defense counsel, the trial court admitted into evidence a photograph depicting the victims\u2019 bodies shortly after they were unearthed, a photograph depicting a superficial depression of Maureen Bautista\u2019s sternum, which Dr. Karl Kirschner opined was the result of a knife wound, four small tissue samples taken from the victims, and Maureen Bautista\u2019s jawbone, demonstrating a penetrating stab wound. The prosecution offered the foregoing evidence to establish the identity of the victims, to corroborate the prosecution\u2019s expert testimony (that the victims had been killed in Patricia Shepard\u2019s apartment), and to establish that defendant had acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In an effort to preclude admission of the challenged evidence, defense counsel offered to stipulate that Larry Tom Whittington assisted in placing the bodies in the dresser, that Maureen Bautista\u2019s death was caused by a blow of considerable force, that the jawbone had comprised part of her anatomy, and that the bodies unearthed were those of Maureen and Telesforo Bautista. After the prosecution rejected the stipulation, the trial court admitted the challenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AGL\">\u25a0  On appeal, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings on three grounds: (1) the evidence was irrelevant; (2) even if relevant, the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and therefore the evidence should have been excluded under Evidence Code section 352; and (3) the trial court, in exercising its discretion under Evidence Code section 352, failed to engage in a meaningful weighing of probative value against prejudice.  Defendant implicitly contends that the trial court should have required the prosecution to accept the proffered stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The challenged evidence clearly was supportive of the prosecution\u2019s theory that the victims had been brutally murdered. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 926, 937-938 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 259, 838 P.2d 1212] [photos of murder victim depicting nature and placement of wounds relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to prosecution\u2019s theory of deliberate killing].) Because the prosecution tried the present case on a theory of premeditated murder, the issue of malice was material, and the photographs and the jawbone were relevant to that issue. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 594 [238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 737 P.2d 1350]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 171 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587]; 2 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Demonstrative, Experimental and Scientific Evidence, \u00a7 837, pp. 801-804.) The tissue samples (extracted from the remains of the exhumed dresser, in which carpet fibers were found consistent with those found in Patricia Shepard\u2019s apartment) indicated the probability that the victims had bled in Patricia Shepard\u2019s apartment, and therefore were relevant to the prosecution\u2019s theory that the killings were deliberate, and that defendant attempted to conceal the crimes by transporting the bodies from the Bakersfield crime scene to the town of Shandon, where the victims surreptitiously were buried.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The evidence in question also was highly probative. The photograph of the mummified victims depicted their positions within the dresser (after the dresser had been unearthed and removed), thereby corroborating Whittington\u2019s testimony relating to concealment of the bodies. The photograph illustrating the superficial wound to Maureen Bautista\u2019s sternum was offered to establish that defendant employed different degrees of force during the fatal attack, and because the use of force was relevant to the question of malice, the trial court acted within its discretion in determining that the probative value of the photographs clearly outweighed any prejudice that might have been incurred by defendant as a result of their graphic nature. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 115-116 [no error in admitting photographs of victim\u2019s head and ear, through which fatal stab wound was inflicted]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 589, 612-613 [244 Cal.Rptr. 200, 749 P.2d 854] [no error in admitting \u201cmummy-like\u201d photos of victims].) Introduced as laboratory specimens contained in small jars, the tissue samples were not readily identifiable as human tissue and, as noted, tended to support the prosecution\u2019s theory, supported by expert testimony, that the victims were killed in Patricia Shepard\u2019s apartment, then transported to Shandon. The appearance of Maureen Bautista\u2019s jawbone indicated that her assailant had stabbed her with sufficient force to enable the weapon to penetrate completely through the bone, strongly suggesting that the perpetrator acted with malice. We previously have upheld the admission of body parts over a defense objection similar to that raised in the present case, where the physical evidence is offered in corroboration of expert testimony (and where, presumably, photographs instead could have been utilized). The potentially shocking nature of such physical evidence is not, in itself, a basis for exclusion. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 524 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 199, 828 P.2d 101] [admission of teeth and bone fragments].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Defendant contends the trial court failed to engage in a meaningful weighing process and, instead, mechanically recited that the probative value exceeded the prejudicial effect as to the various exhibits that the defense sought to exclude. With respect to each item of physical evidence challenged on appeal, however, the trial court heard arguments from both sides regarding relevance and prejudice before articulating that the probative value of the challenged evidence outweighed any prejudicial effect. The record indicates that the trial court understood and fulfilled its responsibilities under Evidence Code section 352. Nothing more was required. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 660; <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1011, 1027-1029 [251 Cal.Rptr. 643, 761 P.2d 103].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">With respect to defense counsel\u2019s offer at trial, in an effort to have the actual evidence excluded, to stipulate to certain facts suggested by the challenged evidence, we reiterate the general rule that the prosecution in a criminal case \u201ccannot be compelled to accept a stipulation if the effect would be to deprive the state\u2019s case of its persuasiveness and forcefulness.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 1007, and cases cited.) The probative value of the challenged photographs, jawbone, and tissue samples (exhibits that we have reviewed) clearly extended beyond the scope of the defense\u2019s offers to stipulate. The prosecution therefore was not obligated to present its case in the sanitized fashion suggested by the defense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 243 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Based upon the foregoing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged physical evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 524; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal. 4th at p. 441; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, 973-974 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">D. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to section 1118.1, alleging that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction. The defense argued that the prosecution\u2019s key witnesses\u2014Larry Tom Whittington, Susan Rambo, Patricia Shepard, Harlyn Codd and Wayne James\u2014were accomplices as a matter of law in a drug conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of Maureen and Telesforo Bautista. Based upon the premise that a person cannot be convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice (\u00a7 1111), and upon the further premise that one accomplice cannot corroborate another <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clapp </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 835, 837 [151 P.2d 237]), the defense argued that without the testimony of the accomplices, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>would be no evidence supporting defendant\u2019s conviction. The trial court rejected these arguments and denied defendant\u2019s motion for a. judgment of acquittal. In denying this motion, the trial court found that Wayne James was not an accomplice and reasoned that, even if it were to accept defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the accomplice status of other prosecution witnesses, James\u2019s testimony would provide sufficient evidence of corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On appeal, defendant reiterates his contention that hi$ conviction rests upon the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices. As we shall explain, this contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In order for any one of the foregoing witnesses to have been an accomplice as a matter of law, the record must establish, as a matter of law, either that the witness aided and abetted defendant in committing the killings (\u00a7 31; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 460, 468 [110 Cal.Rptr. 906, 516 P.2d 298]) or was involved in a conspiracy in which that person harbored the intent to commit the offense that was the object of the conspiracy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marks </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1335, 1345 [248 Cal.Rptr. 874, 756 P.2d 260].) Neither theory was established as a matter of law by the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Patricia Shepard obtained cleaning supplies <em>after </em>learning of the killings and helped Larry Tom Whittington scrub the apartment where the killings had been committed. Whittington also helped conceal the victims\u2019 bodies. Susan Rambo provided aid in arranging for the victims\u2019 grave to be dug in her backyard. Although it is true that a person\u2019s post-offense acts are relevant to the issue whether he or she shared the requisite intent prior to the commission of the offense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brady </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 124, 136 [235 Cal.Rptr. 248]), the evidence relating to these witnesses suggests that, at most, they were accessories. (\u00a7 32; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perryman </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1546, 1549 [234 Cal.Rptr. 181].) No evidence connected these witnesses (or anyone else) to the actual killings. Nor did any evidence connect the other alleged accomplices, Harlyn Codd and Wayne James, to the killings or to defendant\u2019s subsequent coverup efforts. The aiding and abetting theory therefore fails for lack of evidence that any of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses assisted defendant in committing the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Defendant contends that because his drug cohorts were aware of his threats to kill \u201csnitches,\u201d they themselves also anticipated the victims\u2019 demise. Yet, the record clearly fails to establish, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that the killings were a \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d consequence of the methamphetamine manufacturing operation conducted on the Rambos\u2019 property. It is undisputed that the key prosecution witnesses were part of a <em>drug </em>conspiracy, but the evidence does not establish, as a matter of law, that the object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>that conspiracy was the <em>killing </em>of Maureen and Telesforo Bautista. Rather, the record discloses only one instance prior to the killings\u2014defendant\u2019s conversation with Harlyn Codd at Lake Isabella\u2014in which defendant threatened, in the presence of any key witness, to kill \u201csnitches.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That single threat, overheard by Codd, does not demonstrate, as a matter \u00f3f law, that Codd (or any other prosecution witness) was bound to defendant by a common plan to kill the Bautistas. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 760 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113] [rejecting notion that a defendant\u2019s expression of an intent to kill before a crime necessarily renders the cohort an accomplice to murder].) Defendant\u2019s other comments to the key prosecution witnesses regarding \u201csnitches\u201d occurred <em>after </em>the killings. Thus, accomplice status cannot properly be accorded the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, as a matter of law, on a theory of derivative liability. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1, 11-12, fn. 5 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">E. <em>Instructional error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">1. <em>Special instruction No. 3: other-crimes evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In addition to hearing evidence pertaining to the deaths of Maureen and Telesforo Bautista, the jury received evidence pertaining to defendant\u2019s illegal drug activity and the murder of Greg Rambo. The parties proposed instructions regarding the purposes for which the jury could consider this evidence of defendant\u2019s other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The prosecution submitted special instruction No. 3, set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The instruction was broadly written, directing the jury to consider the other-crimes evidence for numerous purposes, including defendant\u2019s \u201ccharacter or any trait of his character.\u201d Outside the presence of the jury, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>prosecutor argued that the jury should be allowed to consider evidence, such as that pertaining to the murder of Greg Rambo, bearing upon defendant\u2019s character, because the defense had indicated at the outset of the case that it would not object to the introduction of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The defense objected to the prosecution\u2019s proposed special instruction No. 3, arguing that it was overbroad, impermissible in view of Evidence Code section 1101 \u2019s proscription against the use of character evidence to prove conduct, and premised upon a mischaracterization of the defense\u2019s stipulation regarding the prosecution\u2019s use of other-crimes evidence. The defense proposed instead that the trial court instruct the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.50, set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This instruction would have limited the jury\u2019s consideration of the other-crimes evidence to establish motive or the existence of a conspiracy. It expressly would have prohibited the jury from considering such evidence to demonstrate that defendant had a bad character or a disposition to commit crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court rejected the defense request that the court instruct pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.50, ruling instead that it would give the prosecution\u2019s special instruction No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">On appeal, defendant contends he was denied his right to due process of law when the trial court instructed the jury regarding other-crimes evidence pursuant to special instruction No. 3. Specifically, defendant characterizes as erroneous that portion of the instruction specifying that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>of other crimes, \u201cif believed, may be considered by [the jury] <em>for any purpose, including but not limited to any of the following: </em>[\u00b6] <em>[Defendant\u2019s} </em>character or any trait of his character. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In response, the People concede that the italicized portion of the instruction was overbroad, but argue that the reliability of defendant\u2019s trial was not undermined by the giving of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 agreement at the outset of the case to allow the admission of evidence pertaining to the murder of Greg Rambo, it is clear the trial court erred in giving the italicized portion of special instruction No. 3. Subject to certain exceptions inapplicable here, evidence pertaining to a defendant\u2019s character is inadmissible when offered to prove the defendant\u2019s conduct on a specific occasion. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In the present case, the italicized portion of the challenged instruction impermissibly invited the jury to consider certain evidence (e.g., that defendant killed Rambo) for the purpose of establishing defendant\u2019s propensity to commit murder. Assuming the jury considered such evidence in that context, the jury arguably might have inferred that because defendant had killed Rambo, defendant also was capable of killing other friends, such as Maureen and Telesforo Bautista. If the jury drew that inference, the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof as to the central issue in the case, the identity of the Bautistas\u2019 slayer, arguably was lightened, thus raising the possibility that defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law was impaired. Because the People contend, under these circumstances, that the error is harmless under the state harmless-error analysis <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]), as well as under the more exacting federal standard, which requires us to analyze whether the trial court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]), we shall assume, without deciding, that the <em>Chapman </em>standard is applicable. (Cf. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279 [113 L.Ed 302, 111 S.Ct. 1246] [federal constitutional \u201ctrial error,\u201d such as admission of an involuntary confession, is subject to the harmless-error analysis set forth in <em>Chapman).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In ascertaining the effect of the trial court\u2019s error, we consider the potentially devastating impact of other-crimes evidence that permits the jury to conclude that a capital defendant has a propensity to commit murder. Such evidence invites the jury to be swayed by speculation that, because the defendant previously has murdered, he or she also committed the charged murder. (See <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948) 335 U.S. 469, 475-476 [93 L.Ed. 168, 173-174, 69 S.Ct. 213]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smallwood </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 415, 428 [228 Cal.Rptr. 913, 722 P.2d 197].) Thus, such evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>inadmissible to establish a defendant\u2019s criminal disposition, but is admissible when relevant to another issue, such as opportunity or intent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, 82; see also <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1991) 502 U.S. _ [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 399-402, 112 S.Ct. 475, 483-484] [jury instruction relating to prior-injury evidence did not constitute a \u201cpropensity instruction\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Unlike the more typical situation, the present case involves other-crimes evidence that was <em>not </em>introduced over the objection of the defense, but rather <em>at its invitation. </em>The defense sought to include such evidence in an effort to persuade the jury of the likelihood that some other member of the drug conspiracy killed Greg Rambo and the Bautistas. This circumstance undoubtedly diluted the probative value of the other-crimes evidence for the prosecution\u2019s case, because it was clear the defense desired that the jury consider this evidence for the purpose of establishing defendant\u2019s innocence of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We weigh the foregoing impact against defendant\u2019s damning trail of incriminating statements and the circumstantial evidence linking him to the Bautista murders. Larry Tom Whittington, Patricia Shepard, Susan Rambo, and Wayne James each testified as to defendant\u2019s confessions. The prosecution presented testimony (of Larry Tom Whittington) that placed defendant at the crime scene on the night of the killings, that established defendant had been arguing with Maureen Bautista, and that defendant had feared she would \u201csnitch him off\u2019; the victims were killed in brutal fashion according to the witnesses who related defendant\u2019s confessions\u2014testimony corroborated by the prosecution\u2019s forensic testimony, and defendant subsequently went to extreme lengths to conceal the murders, including the removal of his personal effects (and photographs depicting him) from the Bautistas\u2019 residence, transportation of the bodies from Bakersfield to Shandon, and burial of the Bautistas\u2019 bodies beneath a layer of freshly poured cement. Six days after law enforcement officials exhumed the bodies, defendant falsely identified himself to the officer who arrested him. Viewed against such overwhelming evidence establishing defendant\u2019s guilt of the charged offenses, the challenged section of special instruction No. 3, allowing the jury to consider the other-crimes evidence to establish defendant\u2019s character, led to a cumulative rather than an unduly prejudicial use of the evidence. We therefore conclude that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. 710-711].)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">2. <em>Accomplice liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error when it instructed the jury pursuant to 20 standard jury instructions relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>subjects of accomplice testimony and conspiracy. Defendant\u2019s contention rests upon three distinct arguments: (1) the trial court\u2019s instructions represented a \u201cchaotic array\u201d that confused the jury; (2) the trial court misread two instructions; and (3) the trial court erred in rejecting defense counsel\u2019s request for a special instruction pertaining to the testimony of an informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">a. <em>The standard instructions were not confusing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The trial court instructed the jury pursuant to CALJIC Nos. 2.27, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.18, and 3.19, which addressed the matter of accomplices, and CALJIC Nos. 6.10.5, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.16, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20, 6.21, and 6.22, which addressed the subject of conspiracy. Pursuant to CALJIC No. 17.31, the jurors were instructed that not all instructions necessarily were applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the foregoing instructions confused the jury is based upon several contentions, none of which has merit. First, defendant contends the conspiracy instructions were deficient because <em>he </em>was not charged with conspiracy, the instructions thus leaving the jury confused as to what conspiracy could be found. This contention ignores both the evidence at trial suggesting the presence of a drug conspiracy, and the defense theory that the killings were a foreseeable result of that conspiracy. Second, defendant contends the trial court failed to tailor the conspiracy instructions to \u201cconform\u201d to the case, instead allowing the jury to \u201croam without guidance.\u201d Yet this argument ignores both the comprehensive nature of the conspiracy instructions given and the particular instruction to the jury that it should disregard any instruction that applied to facts that the jury determined did not exist. Third, defendant contends the trial court confused the jury by giving instructions on aiding and abetting. Such instructions clearly were proper, however, in view of the evidence that other individuals participated in concealing the murders, thereby raising the possibility that one or more persons might have assisted the killer in perpetrating these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Defendant also contends the trial court confused the jury by instructing them pursuant to CALJIC No. 6.20 (withdrawal from conspiracy), even though there was no evidence that any conspirator had withdrawn from the conspiracy. This argument must fail because the presence of a conspiracy was a jury question necessarily embracing issues of who participated in the Shandon drug operation, and when that participation occurred. Moreover, because defendant moved his drug operation from Shandon to Parkfield in December of 1984, a factual issue existed as to whether the Shandon drug conspiracy existed after that move.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Defendant contends the trial court confused the jury in refusing to modify CALJIC No. 6.22, which instructed the jury, in pertinent part, that \u201cEach person in this case is individually entitled to, and must receive, your determination whether he was a member of the alleged conspiracy.\" Defendant sought to substitute the names of the five key prosecution witnesses for the words \u201c[e]ach person.\u201d Defendant\u2019s requested substitution obviously would have unduly limited the jury\u2019s consideration of who might have participated in the drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The giving of the accomplice and conspiracy instructions was justified on the basis of the defense\u2019s theory that the deaths of Maureen and Telesforo Bautista were the foreseeable result of a conspiracy involving prosecution witnesses. Whether any witness was a member of a conspiracy, whether the murders were a foreseeable consequence of a conspiracy, and whether any witness required corroboration because he or she was an accomplice to the killings were factual matters properly left for the jury\u2019s determination. Viewed singularly or collectively, the standard instructions given by the trial court were not confusing. Moreover, any theoretical possibility of confusion was diminished by the parties\u2019 closing arguments: defense counsel argued that corroboration was required because the key prosecution witnesses were conspirators, and the prosecution emphasized that the People had shown corroboration if it was needed. There is no indication in the record that the jury sought clarification of the instructions challenged on appeal. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s instructions confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">b. <em>The trial court\u2019s misreading of CAUIC Nos. 3.19 and 6.10.5 constituted harmless error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In instructing the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 3.19 (burden to prove corroborating witness is an accomplice), the trial court failed to read the full instruction, the fourth paragraph of which provided: \u201cIn the event that the defendant has not proved by a preponderance of the evidence <em>that any witness is an accomplice or the evidence </em>is evenly balanced so that you are unable to say that the evidence on either side of the issue outweighs the other, then you must find that such witness was not an accomplice.\u201d The court inadvertently omitted reading the italicized portion of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s error in rendering an incomplete version of CALJIC No. 3.19 violated his right to due process of law. We disagree. The error was harmless, because the jury received the correct version of CALJIC No. 3.19 in its written form. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Andrews </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 200, 216 [260 Cal.Rptr. 583, 776 P.2d 285]; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Heishman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 147, 163-165 [246 Cal.Rptr. 673, 753 P.2d 629] [trial court\u2019s omission of the word \u201cnot\u201d from the same sentence in CALJIC No. 3.19 held to be harmless].)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court\u2019s misreading could not have been prejudicial in light of the other instructions given. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal. 3d at p. 763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">CALJIC No. 6.10.5 defines conspiracy and explains that, in order to find that a defendant was a member of a conspiracy, there must be proof of an unlawful agreement, specific intent to commit a public offense, and proof of the commission of at least one overt act for the purpose of accomplishing the object of the agreement. Prior to the giving of the instructions, the court agreed to tailor the language in this instruction by replacing the reference to \u201cdefendant\u201d with the word \u201cpersons.\u201d In instructing the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 6.10.5, however, the trial court stated, in pertinent part, that \u201cIn order to find <em>a person </em>to be a member of a conspiracy, in addition to proof of the unlawful agreement and specific intent, there must be proof of the commission of at least one overt act.\u201d Thus, as given by the trial court, the instruction failed to reflect precisely the modification discussed with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s error violated his right to due process of law is without merit. This technical error did not render the instruction inconsistent with the defense theory of the case, nor did it impermissibly restrict the jury in determining whether <em>any </em>person was a conspirator. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyons </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 245, 271 [324 P.2d 556].) No prejudice appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">c. <em>Special instruction A: testimony of an informant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury pursuant to special instruction A, which would have cautioned the jury to examine with greater care the testimony of an informer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This instruction was patterned upon the federal rule that requires the giving of a cautionary instruction regarding the testimony of an informant when that testimony furnishes the only strong evidence of guilt. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 648 F.2d 625, 630-631.) Defendant contends the giving of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>instruction was required because the prosecution\u2019s case relied upon the testimony of five witnesses who stated that defendant had confessed to the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The federal rule supporting defendant\u2019s proposed instruction differs from the law applied in California\u2019s state courts. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 411;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 623.) This court previously has upheld the refusal to give a similar, cautionary instruction regarding the trustworthiness of an immunized witness\u2019s testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunter </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 957, 977-978 [264 Cal.Rptr. 367, 782 P.2d 608]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Payton </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1050, 1059 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 526, 839 P.2d 1035] [rejecting claim that trial court erred in failing to instruct on its own motion that testimony of a jailhouse informant \u201cshould be viewed with suspicion and distrust\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 191, 196-197 [160 Cal.Rptr. 156] [appellate court rejected instruction identical to that proposed here].) The jury in the present case received adequate standard instructions on the credibility of witnesses. (CALJIC Nos. 2.20, 2.21, 2.22, 2.23.) The trial court therefore did not err in refusing to give the special instruction requested by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">3. <em>The trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury pursuant to the defense\u2019s special instructions pertaining to reasonable doubt and the need to view with caution the testimony relating to defendant\u2019s confessions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error in rejecting special instructions, submitted by the defense, pertaining to the reasonable doubt standard of proof and the need to view with caution the testimony relating to defendant\u2019s confessions. As we shall explain, we reject defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">a. <em>Special instruction D: reasonable doubt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Defense counsel proffered special instruction D (set forth in fn. 22), directing the jury to consider specific evidentiary issues in determining the existence of reasonable doubt as to the identity of the Bautistas\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>killer.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The prosecutor objected on the ground that the instruction was argumentative. Following argument by counsel, the trial court refused the requested instruction, observing that it would confuse the jury and, \u201cfor the most part, it is argumentative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The trial court\u2019s ruling was correct. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1126, 1135-1138 [217 Cal.Rptr. 212, 703 P.2d 1106], we rejected a special instruction that similarly pinpointed specific evidence rather than a particular theory of the defendant\u2019s case. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 870-871; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1006, 1020-1021 [245 Cal.Rptr. 185, 750 P.2d 1342]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adrian </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 335, 338 [185 Cal.Rptr. 506].) Such an instruction properly is refused as argumentative because it \u201cwould invite the jury to draw inferences favorable to the defendant from specified items of evidence on a disputed question of fact, and therefore properly belongs not in instructions, but in the arguments of counsel to the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wright, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1135; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 888, 914 [254 Cal.Rptr. 508, 765 P.2d 940].) To the extent that special instruction D could be read to embrace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>stated principles of law involving reasonable doubt, it was repetitious of other instructions given, notably CALJIC No. 2.90, which this court has recognized as \u201cthe best available definition of the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crandell </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 833, 881 [251 Cal.Rptr. 227, 760 P.2d 423]; see also \u00a7\u00a7 1096, 1096a.) The giving of special instruction D therefore would have confused the jury, and properly was refused on that ground as well. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farmer, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 913.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">b. <em>Special instruction F: viewing with caution the testimony related to defendant\u2019s confessions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Defense counsel proffered special instruction F (set forth in fn. 23), directing the jury to view with caution the testimony relating to defendant\u2019s confessions, and focusing upon specific evidentiary factors relevant to the prosecution witnesses who testified that defendant confessed to committing the Bautista murders.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The prosecutor objected on multiple grounds, among them that the instruction was duplicative and argumentative. The trial court declined to instruct the jury pursuant to special instruction F, ruling that the instruction was objectionable on the latter two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.

Defendant further argues that special instruction No. 1 failed effectively to limit the jury\u2019s consideration of the \u201cNash testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s arguments. Defendant\u2019s special instruction H was unduly limiting because, as discussed earlier, the \u201cNash testimony\u201d was relevant not only to the matter of motive, but to the killer\u2019s identity and state of mind, and also provided corroboration of other testimony that suggested defendant had been associated with Eddie Nash.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Special instruction No. 1 properly allowed the jury to consider the \u201cNash testimony\u201d for any of the foregoing valid purposes.

First, defendant argued that there was sufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication to require that the jury be instructed on this subject. Second, even if there was insufficient direct evidence to warrant the giving of this instruction, other evidence establishing defendant\u2019s habitual cocaine usage supported an inference that, because defendant freebased cocaine during the morning shortly <em>after </em>the Bautistas were killed, he would have been ffeebasing cocaine during the evening (or early morning) when these crimes were committed. In response, the prosecution argued that the evidence was insufficient to justify the giving of defendant\u2019s proffered special instruction, and that the instruction was inconsistent with the third-party-culpability defense presented by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court rejected special instruction G on the basis that \u201cthere is not sufficient evidence regarding voluntary intoxication at the time of the alleged homicide. For the jury to be instructed on that aspect, it would be inviting the jury to speculate and the Court deems that to be inappropriate.\u201d The trial court further ruled that defense counsel would not be permitted to argue to the jury that defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication at the time of the killings could negate the mental state required to establish first degree murder. The trial court, indicating it would allow argument as to whether defendant\u2019s cocaine usage had a bearing upon whether defendant did in fact act with premeditation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>deliberation, stated that defense counsel could argue \u201cthe cumulative effect of using cocaine over a period of time[,] should the jury consider whether that had any bearing on [defendant\u2019s] conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On appeal, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the giving of special instruction G. Defendant cites the testimony of witnesses who described his prodigious use of cocaine. He also links the testimony of Harlyn Codd, who stated that defendant would become paranoid when engaged in freebasing cocaine, with the testimony of Larry Tom Whittington, who stated that defendant appeared to be exhibiting signs of paranoia when Whittington visited defendant at Patricia Shepard\u2019s apartment on the night of the killings. Defendant also links Susan Rambo\u2019s testimony that defendant was \u201chyper\u201d when he freebased cocaine, with her testimony that defendant was \u201cvery nervous, hyper, very excited\u201d when he sped into her backyard in September of 1984 and confessed the killings to her. According to defendant, the collective testimony of Codd, Whittington, and Susan Rambo establishes an inference that defendant must have been using cocaine at or shortly before the time of the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s characterization of the evidence. There was no evidence introduced at trial that defendant had ingested cocaine at or shortly before the time of the killings. Moreover, Susan Rambo and Larry Tom Whittington each testified that defendant often went several days without consuming cocaine, thereby refuting defendant\u2019s argument that his cocaine usage had been so habitual as to warrant an inference he had ingested cocaine at a time relevant to the Bautista killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">On this record, the trial court was not obligated to instruct the jury in the manner requested by defendant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1158, 1178-1181 [270 Cal.Rptr. 286, 791 P.2d 965]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1115-1117 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588].) Evidence that a defendant has ingested a drug at some point in time does not equate to usage at the time of the killings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1127, 1143 [245 Cal.Rptr. 635, 751 P.2d 901].) Nor does such evidence suggest that defendant suffered impairment related to previous ingestion of cocaine. The paranoia exhibited by defendant concerning \u201csnitches,\u201d at the time Larry Tom Whittington visited him at Patricia Shepard\u2019s apartment, did not establish that defendant then was ingesting cocaine; the record suggests that defendant was obsessed with \u201csnitches,\u201d without regard to whether he was suffering the effects of cocaine intoxication. That defendant may have been \u201chyper\u201d on the morning he sped into the Rambos\u2019 yard, and may have freebased cocaine after his arrival there, similarly does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>not establish that he had ingested cocaine shortly before the killings (which could have occurred several hours earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct. Evidence of defendant\u2019s alleged voluntary intoxication was \u201c \u2018too insubstantial to require submission of the defense to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 1143 [citing the cases].)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">6. <em>Cumulative error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Defendant contends that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors committed by the trial court during the guilt phase requires reversal of his conviction. Having reviewed these alleged errors, we conclude that they were few and generally trivial, and that the only error of significance was the trial court\u2019s instruction of the jury pursuant to special instruction No. 3, which, as we have discussed, improperly allowed the jury to consider evidence of defendant\u2019s other crimes for the purpose of ascertaining defendant\u2019s character. Even when viewed cumulatively, the errors committed fall far below the showing required to warrant reversal based upon cumulative error. Defendant\u2019s contention as to cumulative error therefore is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">III. Penalty Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">A. <em>Unadjudicated criminal activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">At the penalty phase, the prosecution introduced evidence in aggravation pertaining to defendant\u2019s 1982 arrest for the kidnapping of Diane Sems (\u00a7 207) and possession of an explosive device (\u00a7 12303.2), as well as evidence pertaining to his 1981 arrest for possession of a machine gun (\u00a7 12220, subd. (a)) and for being an ex-felon in possession of concealable firearms (former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)). (\u00a7 190.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\"> Defendant contends that the judgment of death must be reversed because the trial court permitted the prosecution to introduce evidence in aggravation pertaining to defendant\u2019s unadjudicated criminal activity.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> His challenge rests upon four distinct arguments, none of which has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">First, defendant challenges the admission of evidence involving dismissed charges stemming from his 1982 arrest for kidnapping and possession of an explosive device, and from his 1981 arrest for possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>machine gun and for being an ex-felon in possession of concealable firearms. Defendant argues that the introduction of such evidence violated his state and federal constitutional guaranties to a reliable sentence and to due process of law. He acknowledges that this court previously has rejected similar arguments in <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 204-205 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480], but requests that we reconsider our holding in that case. We decline to do so, observing that we repeatedly have rejected similar constitutional challenges to the admission of unadjudicated crimes. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Pinholster </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 973 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 824 P.2d 571]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1170, 1208 [264 Cal.Rptr. 852, 783 P.2d 211].)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Second, defendant contends that he should be \u201cdeemed acquitted\u201d of his 1981 offenses involving possession of a machine gun and of possession of an illegal weapon by an ex-felon. This contention is not supported by the record. Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a silencer; the other charges were dismissed without a judicial determination as to their truth or falsity. A bargained conviction or dismissal does not constitute an acquittal under section 190.3. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Heishman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 193; <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 713, 755 [244 Cal.Rptr. 867, 750 P.2d 741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Third, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the unadjudicated criminal activity that occurred in 1981 and 1982 was impermissibly \u201cstale\u201d at the time of defendant\u2019s trial in 1987. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 202 [\u00a7 190.3, factor (b), imposes no time limitation on introduction of defendant\u2019s prior violent criminality]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 468, 529-530 [268 Cal.Rptr. 126, 788 P.2d 640] [evidence of prior violent activity not stale even though it occurred more than seven years earlier]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heishman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 192 [introduction of evidence under \u00a7 190.3, factor (b), is not subject to exclusion on the ground that prosecution for the acts would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 334, 388 [279 Cal.Rptr. 780, 807 P.2d 1009] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Fourth, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that introduction of evidence pertaining to his 1981 crimes was barred by the constitutional guarantee against being placed twice in jeopardy. This guarantee is inapplicable where evidence of prior criminal activity is introduced in a subsequent trial as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>aggravating factor for consideration by a penalty phase jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 754-755; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 719, 742-743 [276 Cal.Rptr. 391, 801 P.2d 1142]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 718, 728-729 [274 Cal.Rptr. 372, 798 P.2d 1215]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 528-529.) We decline defendant\u2019s request to reconsider the applicability of our recent decisions in <em>Melton, </em>and its progeny, to the sentencing phase of a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">B. <em>Other criminal activity and victim-impact evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Defendant contends that the judgment of death must be reversed because the trial court, over defendant\u2019s objection, admitted the testimony of Diane Sems, who, as described above, related to the penalty phase jury that in 1982 she had been forced into a pickup truck by an acquaintance named Terry Fabricant, blindfolded, and driven by another man to a house she did not recognize. After a few hours, she escaped and contacted the police. The following day, she identified the driver in a photo lineup. At trial, she recalled making a photo identification and, when asked on direct examination whether defendant appeared to be the same man who had driven the pickup truck, she replied, \u201cI think so.\u201d On cross-examination, however, she acknowledged she was unsure who had driven the truck. Her identification of defendant (on direct examination) subsequently was corroborated by Philip Quartararol, the police detective employed by the City of Los Angeles who had shown her the photo lineup, and who testified at trial that Sems had selected defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Relying upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29 [222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423], defendant argues that insufficient evidence supported the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting Sems\u2019s testimony. Defendant also argues that Sems\u2019s testimony was irrelevant and inflammatory. (See <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529]; see also <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 805 [104 L.Ed.2d 876, 109 S.Ct. 2207].) We reject each of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">1. <em>The trial court\u2019s ruling was supported by substantial evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Prior to the admission of Diane Sems\u2019s testimony, at defendant\u2019s request the trial court conducted a preliminary inquiry outside the presence of the jury to ascertain whether there was substantial evidence to establish that defendant had kidnapped Sems. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 29, 72-73, fn. 25.) Defendant argued that Sems\u2019s inability at trial to identify defendant positively as the driver of the pickup truck, and the prosecution's reliance on a prior, out-of-court photo identification, rendered her testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>legally insufficient, because the evidence did not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant\u2019s involvement in the alleged kidnapping. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection and, on appeal, defendant reiterates his challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Notwithstanding Diane Sems\u2019s uncertain identification of defendant at trial, her prior photo identification of defendant, made one day after the alleged kidnapping, constituted sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s ruling that the prior incident properly could be considered by the jury. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucky </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 259, 287-290 [247 Cal.Rptr. 1, 753 P.2d 1052].) The trial court correctly ruled that Sems\u2019s photo identification of defendant was admissible under the prior identification exception to the hearsay rule, codified in Evidence Code section 1238.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the admissibility of evidence pertaining to the alleged kidnapping did not turn upon whether the prosecution could establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the driver of the pickup truck. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 635, 648 [244 Cal.Rptr. 181, 749 P.2d 836].) Rather, the question whether defendant\u2019s other criminal activity (including the Sems incident) was proved beyond a reasonable doubt presented a question of fact for the jury. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 312; <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, 41 </em>Cal.3d at p. 72, fn. 25.)  At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the trial- court correctly instructed the jury that, before it could consider defendant\u2019s other criminal activity, the jury had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did, in fact, commit such activity.  The trial court\u2019s ruling as to Sems\u2019s testimony was correct, and the evidence properly was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">2. <em>Sems\u2019s testimony constituted admissible victim-impact evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s admission of Diane Sems\u2019s testimony on the ground that her testimony constituted impermissible victim-impact evidence is misplaced. We previously have rejected the argument that <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>482 U.S. 496, and <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers, supra, </em>490 U.S. 805, bar the introduction of evidence relating to \u201cthe nature and circumstances of other criminal activity involving the use or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>threat of force or violence or the effect of such criminal activity on the victims . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 754, 797 [276 Cal.Rptr. 827, 802 P.2d 330]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 832-837 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436].) The prosecution was entitled to present testimonial evidence of defendant\u2019s violent \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 744, 808-809 [248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310].) Moreover, the proscription against the use of victim-impact evidence at the sentencing stage largely has been overruled. <em>(Payne </em>v. <em>Tennessee </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 808 [115 L.Ed.2d 720, 734-734, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2608-2611]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 489, 535.) We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting Sems\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">C. <em>Weapons evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As part of her testimony pertaining to the kidnapping, Diane Sems stated she observed various weapons at the residence where she had been held captive. In corroboration, the prosecution introduced the testimony of Philip Quartararol, the City of Los Angeles police detective who participated in a police search of the residence shortly after Sems escaped and reported the kidnapping. Quartararol testified that, during his search of the residence, he found two semiautomatic weapons, two shotguns, and \u201cseveral thousand rounds of ammunition.\u201d On cross-examination, Quartararol acknowledged that, under the law in effect at the time he conducted the search in 1982, it was not illegal for an ex-felon to possess the weapons discovered during the search.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The prosecution also presented the testimony of Douglas Gerst, a City of Los Angeles police officer, who participated in two police searches of defendant\u2019s residence in 1981. Gerst testified that, during these searches, he seized a Mac Ten machine gun (together with a silencer and ammunition he found nearby), six revolvers, two automatic pistols, six rifles, and twelve shotguns. Gerst also testified that \u201cthere were thousands of rounds of ammunition throughout the residence.\u201d He found mail and utility receipts addressed to defendant at the residence.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">On appeal, defendant contends that the judgment of death must be reversed because the trial court admitted the foregoing evidence involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>weapons. Defendant argues that this evidence should not have been admitted, because: (1) the trial court had rejected defendant\u2019s request to conduct a hearing pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 29, 72-73, footnote 25, to ascertain whether defendant\u2019s possession of the weapons constituted a crime; (2) the evidence did not constitute a proper aggravating factor under section 190.3; and (3) introduction of this evidence was highly prejudicial. We reject each of these contentions for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">1. <em>Defendant failed to preserve the issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The record does not support defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court denied his request for a hearing under <em>Phillips, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 29. Rather, defendant requested such a hearing only on the kidnapping issue, discussed <em>ante, </em>and on the charge that at the time of his 1982 arrest in connection with the Sems incident, he was found to have been in possession of an explosive device. (\u00a7 12303.2.) Defendant\u2019s challenge to the weapons evidence was based upon its alleged staleness and the prior dismissal of the weapons charges. Defendant did not request a hearing on the question whether the weapons discovered by law enforcement officers during their searches of his residence constituted criminal activity. Thus, defendant has failed to preserve this issue for review. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickle </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 140, 186 [284 Cal.Rptr. 511, 814 P.2d 290]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27-34 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">2. <em>The weapons evidence properly was admitted</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Even if defendant had preserved the foregoing issue, our rejection of defendant\u2019s argument on the merits would be warranted for two distinct reasons. First, we have held that a hearing under <em>Phillips, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 29, may be unnecessary where, as was the case here, substantial evidence establishes each element of the alleged prior offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 334, 388-389.) Second, the police searches in this case uncovered a machine gun, a silencer beside it, and concealable handguns; defendant\u2019s possession of these firearms was illegal. (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a) [possession of a firearm by an ex-felon]; \u00a7 12220, subd. (a) [possession of a machine gun].) His possession of such an arsenal clearly involved \u201cthe implied threat to use force or violence.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (b); see generally, <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 1186-1187 [possession of concealed knife at California Youth Authority facility]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 829, 849-851 [248 Cal.Rptr. 444, 755 P.2d 894] [inmate\u2019s possession of prison-made shank].) Defendant\u2019s possession of a silencer found next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>to the machine gun strengthens this conclusion and itself constitutes a felony. (\u00a7 12520.)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">3. <em>No prejudice appears</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Contrary tb defendant\u2019s assertion, the introduction of the weapons testimony was not unduly prejudicial. During the guilt phase, the jury had heard that defendant possessed firearms. Susan Rambo had testified that defendant always was armed with a gun. At the penalty phase, the jury properly was advised of defendant\u2019s felony conviction for possession of a silencer. Having heard these facts, and already having found defendant guilty of killing Maureen and Telesforo Bautista, the jury was' unlikely to have been swayed by the penalty phase testimony of Diane Sems, Douglas Gerst, and Philip Quartararol linking defendant to the possession of various firearms. Any possibility that the jury might have been unduly influenced by this evidence was precluded by the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">D. <em>Alleged prosecutorial misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly argued several issues to the jury. As explained below, we find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">1. <em>Future dangerousness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In his opening statement to the jury at the penalty phase, defense counsel stated that defendant\u2019s prison history indicated that defendant was \u201cwhat you might call a model prisoner.\u201d Counsel also introduced into evidence a document summarizing defendant\u2019s successful adjustment to prison life. In response, the prosecutor suggested in closing argument that defendant presented a future danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">On appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s argument pertaining to defendant\u2019s future dangerousness was unsupported by the evidence, and therefore violative of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process of law and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant also contends that the prosecutor\u2019s argument mirrored an argument that we have held impermissibly urged the jury to view the absence of mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>evidence as a factor in aggravation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 288-290 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861].)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We reject these contentions. Defendant\u2019s failure to interpose an objection during the prosecutor\u2019s argument constituted a waiver of his present claims of error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>(1991) 53 Cal. 3d 955, 976-977 [281 Cal.Rptr. 273, 810 P.2d 131]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 27-34.) Even if defendant properly had preserved the issue, his arguments would fail. The prosecutor\u2019s argument did not invite the jury to speculate concerning defendant\u2019s future dangerousness as a factor in aggravation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 31 [252 Cal.Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249] [and cases cited therein].) Rather, the argument permissibly was aimed at persuading the jury not to accord significant weight to the defense evidence, proffered in mitigation, that defendant had been (and, presumably, would continue to be) a model prisoner. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 535-536.) Nor did the prosecutor convert mitigating evidence into aggravating evidence. His statement that there was no evidence suggesting defendant could be rehabilitated, and that defendant posed a threat of violence, constituted fair comments upon defendant\u2019s violent criminal past and therefore did not run afoul of Davenport\u2019s proscription against arguing the absence of mitigating factors as a factor in aggravation. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 502, 548-550 [262 Cal.Rptr. 1, 778 P.2d 129] [comment on future dangerousness is permissible if based upon evidence or inferences drawn from that evidence].) We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding defendant\u2019s future dangerousness constituted \u201cthe sort of vigorous argument a prosecutor is entitled to make.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 125; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">2. <em>Circumstances of the crime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider the circumstances of the Bautista killings, and to imagine those crimes from the victims\u2019 perspective.  On appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s argument relied upon speculative inferences, was unsupported by the evidence, and injected constitutionally irrelevant considerations, such as the victims\u2019 personal characteristics. Defendant further contends that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were designed to inflame and prejudice the jury by focusing the jury\u2019s attention upon Telesforo Bautista\u2019s diminutive stature and emotional attachment to defendant. In defendant\u2019s view, the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding Telesforo\u2019s physical and emotional vulnerability constituted improper \u201cvictim-impact\u201d evidence under <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>482 U.S. 496, and <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers, supra, </em>490 U.S. 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>We reject defendant\u2019s contentions. His failure to object below bars appellate review of the issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duncan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 976-977; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at pp. 27-34.) Even if defendant properly had preserved the issue, rejection of defendant\u2019s position would be warranted. The prosecutor\u2019s comments properly reminded the jury of the \u201ccircumstances of the crime.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a).) The references to Telesforo Bautista\u2019s vulnerability reminded the jury that the boy was not one who reasonably could have defended himself, or his mother, against an angry, knife-wielding assailant bent on silencing them both. Thus, Telesforo\u2019s slight build, his witnessing of his mother\u2019s slaying, and his emotional attachment to her (and to defendant) all served to remind the jury of the cruel and brutal manner of the killings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carrera </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 291, 336-337 [261 Cal.Rptr. 348, 777 P.2d 121] [likelihood that stabbing victims did not resist attack bore directly upon the manner of the murders and therefore was a circumstance of the crimes].) Nor was it improper for the prosecutor to ask the jury to imagine the crimes from the victims\u2019 perspective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 283-284 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892].) The prosecution\u2019s request that the jury give consideration to the terror that the victims experienced did not call for speculation or violate <em>Booth </em>and <em>Gathers, </em>but rather was based upon reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 907, 929 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 536-537.) Finally, the prosecutor reminded the jury that he did not seek a verdict based upon passion, but instead urged \u201ca rational verdict based on the law and the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">3. <em>Military service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor briefly referred to defendant\u2019s military service.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>\n                   On appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor mentioned defendant\u2019s military service in Vietnam in an impermissible manner, attempting to convert mitigating evidence into aggravating evidence. We disagree. Not only did defendant waive this issue by failing to object at trial, but his argument is deficient because it is unsupported by the record. The prosecutor did not argue that defendant\u2019s military service was an aggravating factor; rather, the prosecutor argued it was not mitigating. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1271-1273 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>P.2d 251] [prosecutor\u2019s argument regarding defendant\u2019s military service did not convert mitigating evidence into aggravating evidence, but simply illustrated that defendant\u2019s actions after leaving the military demonstrated that he had the ability to choose between good and evil, and that he had selected evil].) Moreover, the jury specifically was instructed that it could consider defendant\u2019s military service as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">4. <em>Sympathy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor briefly referred to the jury\u2019s opportunity to consider sympathy for the defendant.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>\n                   On appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s argument improperly suggested to the jury that it was precluded from considering, as a factor in mitigation, its sympathy for defendant. We disagree. Not only has defendant failed to preserve this issue, but his contention is unsupported by the record. The prosecutor informed the jury that it could consider sympathy, mercy, and sentiment for the defendant. That the prosecutor suggested defense counsel \u201cno doubt must urge you\u201d to consider sympathy does not imply that defense counsel was only \u201cdoing his duty,\u201d or that there was no legitimate basis for showing mercy or sympathy to defendant. Defendant\u2019s contention is hyper-technical and misconstrues the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">E. <em>Miscellaneous contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Defendant submits four claims of constitutional error that in recent years have been rejected by this court. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">(1) that the 1978 death penalty statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, due to its lack of procedural safeguards <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 742, 809-810 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192], and cases cited therein);</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">(2) that the trial court erred in instructing the jury pursuant to a modified version of CALJIC No. 8.84.2 (1986 rev.) (the <em>\u201cBrown\u201d </em>instruction [cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 538-544 [220 Cal.Rptr. 637, 709 P.2d 440]), informing them that in order \u201c[t]o return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating evidence or circumstances are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of life without parole\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 933-935; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 281-282);</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">(3) that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury pursuant to a special instruction (withdrawn by defense counsel) that would have informed them that a mitigating circumstance need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but that the jury was required to find the existence of a mitigating circumstance if there was any substantial evidence to support it <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonillas </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 757, 789-790 [257 Cal.Rptr. 895, 771 P.2d 844]);</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">(4) that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury pursuant to a special instruction (withdrawn by defense counsel) that would have informed them that other-crimes evidence could not be considered as evidence in aggravation unless the jury agreed unanimously that the other crime had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 879, 899 [258 Cal.Rptr. 208, 771 P.2d 1294]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 134, 185 [266 Cal.Rptr. 309, 785 P.2d 857]).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Defendant fails to persuade us that there is any reason for us to reconsider these recent rulings, and we therefore decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">F. <em>Cumulative impact of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Defendant contends that the cumulative impact of error at the guilt and penalty phases of his trial undermined the reliability of the sentencing process, mandating that his death sentence be set aside. We reject this contention. The few errors committed at defendant\u2019s trial fail to \u201craise a reasonable possibility that the jury might have reached a more favorable result had such error or errors not occurred.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 285.)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">The judgment is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Lucas, C.

The evidence suggested that Rambo had been killed in a shed in the town of Parkfield, located in the southwest comer of Monterey County. Prior to the trial in the present case, defendant was tried separately in Monterey County for the Rambo killing, convicted of murder, and sentenced to serve a state prison term of 33 years to life. In June 1987, while the present case was in trial, the Court of Appeal affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction for the Rambo murder (but reversed defendant\u2019s additional convictions for conspiracy and methamphetamine manufacturing) in an unpublished opinion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garceau </em>(June 3, 1987) H001539.) His conviction for the murder of Rambo is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Prior to defendant\u2019s trial for the Bautista murders, defense counsel informed the prosecution and the trial court that he intended to use the Rambo killing to reinforce the defense theory that one or more of defendant\u2019s acquaintances had a motive to murder the Bautistas and Greg Rambo. Thus, the defense had no objection to the prosecutor introducing facts of the Rambo murder in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. In his opening statement, defense counsel informed the jury that Rambo had been \u201cmurdered.\u201d During the trial, the jury heard testimony suggesting that defendant had murdered Rambo, but never was apprised that defendant had been convicted of that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">On cross-examination, Larry Tom Whittington acknowledged that his participation in the Shandon drug operation occurred while he was on bail, pending the appeal of a 1982 conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">At the time of defendant\u2019s trial in 1987, Whittington\u2014his appeal having been unsuccessful\u2014was serving a prison sentence stemming from this 1982 conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Eddie Nash also was known as Edel Nasralla.

Codd also admitted that when law enforcement personnel initially asked him whether he knew anything about Greg Rambo\u2019s murder, he had lied, denying any such knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Throughout this opinion, we shall discuss the merits of particular claims, such as this one, even though they are procedurally barred, when we conclude that such discussion may be helpful in evaluating future claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.

The responses of the three prospective jurors, Maria Kinde, Richard Rodriguez, and Jerry Shipman, suggest, at most, the views of persons inclined to impose the death penalty for deliberate killings, but able to set aside such personal beliefs in favor of a careful review of the evidence, guided by the trial court\u2019s instructions. Kinde stated during voir dire that she believed the death penalty should be imposed for deliberate and premeditated killings, but also stated that she could be convinced by mitigating evidence to spare a defendant\u2019s life. Similarly, although Rodriguez stated that he supported the death penalty as a means of punishment, he also stated that whether or not a death verdict should be imposed would depend upon the circumstances of the case. Finally, although Shipman stated that he favored the death penalty, he also stated that he would consider the evidence and would not hesitate to follow the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Defense counsel had objected on the grounds of relevancy and Evidence Code section 352 prior to the prosecution\u2019s direct examination of Tony Sylvester.

It impermissibly allowed the jury to use the evidence in question to infer that defendant was possessed of a bad character or had a disposition or propensity to commit unlawful acts, and that he conducted himself accordingly with respect to the charged murders. It should not have done so. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 625 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376] [impliedly approving an instruction that \u201cwarned the, jury <em>not </em>to consider the other-crimes evidence to prove that [the] defendant was a person of bad character or had a disposition to commit crimes\u201d (italics in original)]; cf. Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a) [providing that, as a general matter, \u201cevidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of his or her character (whether in the form of an opinion, evidence of reputation, or evidence of specific instances of his or her conduct) is inadmissible when offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion\u201d].) It goes without saying that a charge of this sort should never again be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">I shall assume that the \u201cother crimes\u201d instruction was also erroneous under the United States Constitution. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof [by the state] beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged\u201d <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 364 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375, 90 S.Ct. 1068]), including, of course, identity. If an instruction lightens the state\u2019s burden, it violates due process. (See, e.g., <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 510, 520-524 [61 L.Ed.2d 39, 48-51, 99 S.Ct. 2450].) It is argued that the instruction here effectively did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">On the assumption that it offends the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the \u201cother crimes\u201d instruction would be subject to harmless-error analysis under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]. \u201cThe <em>Chapman </em>test is whether it appears \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 391, 402-403 [114 L.Ed.2d 432, 448, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 1892].) \u201cTo say that an error did not contribute to the verdict is . . .to find that error unimportant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question . . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 403 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 449, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Turning to the case at bar, I conclude that the \u201cother crimes\u201d instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">To be sure, in the general case an instruction allowing the jury to use \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence to infer that the defendant is possessed of a bad character or has a disposition or propensity to commit unlawful acts, and that he conducted himself accordingly with respect to the charged offenses, poses a \u201c \u2018grave danger of prejudice\u2019 to [the] accused . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 303, 317 [165 Cal.Rptr. 289, 611 P.2d 883].)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">This, however, is <em>not </em>the general case. On several occasions and to several persons, defendant confessed that he committed the charged murders. By evidence both physical and testimonial, his confessions were corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">It has been stated that a confession may have an \u201cindelible impact\u201d on the jury, inducing it \u201cto rest its decision on that evidence alone, without . . . consideration of\u2019 the rest. <em>(Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279, 313 [113 L.Ed.2d 302, 333, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1266] (conc. opn. of Kennedy, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">If even a single confession may have such an \u201cindelible impact,\u201d several confessions\u2014as in this case\u2014must practically compel the jury to return a guilty verdict no matter what the other evidence says or does not say.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Hence, to my mind, the \u201cother crimes\u201d instruction proved to be \u201cunimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question . . . .\u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, </em>supra, 500 U.S. at p. 403 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 449, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1893].)

Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13) and articulated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 83 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 636 [205 Cal.Rptr. 775, 685 P.2d 1126]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dominguez </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 481, 501 [175 Cal.Rptr. 445]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moran </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 724, 729 [109 Cal.Rptr. 287].) Defendant urges this court to depart from this consistent practice of applying the state harmless error standard and to apply instead the federal standard as described in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065], and further explained in <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 391 [114 L.Ed.2d 432, 111 S.Ct. 1884]. Defendant maintains that the federal standard is required because the error denied him the due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Defendant cites no holding under the federal Constitution prohibiting jury consideration of uncharged crimes to prove criminal propensity. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court just two years ago declined to express an opinion \u201con whether a state law would violate the Due Process Clause if it permitted the use of \u2018prior crimes\u2019 evidence to show propensity to commit a charged crime.\u201d <em>(Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1991) 502 U.S. _, _, fn. 5 [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 401, 112 S.Ct. 475, 484, fn. 5].) Nevertheless, defendant argues that the instruction in this case denied him due process of law by permitting the jury to consider irrelevant evidence and by lightening the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. I find neither argument sufficiently persuasive to justify use of the federal test, at least until this court receives more explicit guidance from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Whether an instruction permitting jury consideration of irrelevant evidence would violate a criminal defendant\u2019s right of due process under the federal Constitution is at present unclear. (Compare <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, supra, </em>502 U.S. _ [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 397-398, 112 S.Ct. 475, 481] [\u201c. . . we need not explore further the apparent assumption of the Court of Appeals that it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be received in a criminal trial\u201d], with <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 837, 844-845 [37 L.Ed.2d 380, 386-387, 93 S.Ct. 2357] [\u201cCommon-law inferences, like their statutory counterparts, must satisfy due process standards in light of present-day experience.\u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301, 313 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111] (plur. opn.).) For present purposes, I will assume, without deciding, that the federal Constitution prohibits any state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>rule that would permit a criminal conviction to be based in whole or in part on irrelevant considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Even so, defendant\u2019s argument is defective because propensity evidence is not, as defendant maintains, irrelevant to guilt in a criminal prosecution. Although courts and commentators have given various explanations for the rule excluding propensity evidence, they agree that the evidence has probative value to establish guilt. (See, e.g., <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>(1948) 335 U.S. 469, 476 [93 L.Ed. 168, 174, 69 S.Ct. 213]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smallwood </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 415, 428 [228 Cal.Rptr. 913, 722 P.2d 197]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 604, 630-631; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1980).27 Cal.3d 303, 317 [165 Cal.Rptr. 289, 611 P.2d 883]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schader </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 761, 772 [80 Cal.Rptr. 1, 457 P.2d 841]; IA Wigmore on Evidence (Tillers rev. ed. 1983) \u00a7 58.1, p. 1211; 1 McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992) \u00a7 190, pp. 797-798.) Because propensity evidence is relevant to guilt, its consideration by the jury cannot violate the federal Constitution\u2019s implied proscription (assuming there is one) against jury consideration of irrelevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The decisions of the United States Supreme Court do not establish that errors of the kind at issue here\u2014that is, violations of state rules barring jury consideration of evidence that is relevant but unduly prejudicial\u2014contravene the federal Constitution by lightening the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. It is true of course that <em>any </em>trial error that has <em>any </em>potential for prejudicing the defendant makes conviction marginally more likely and in this sense lightens the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. But it cannot be that every such error thereby becomes one of federal constitutional significance. On the contrary, the United States Supreme Court has, in its own words, \u201c \u2018defined the category of infractions that violate \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d very narrowly.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, supra, </em>502 U.S. _[116 L.Ed.2d 385, 398-399, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482], quoting <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 342, 352 [107 L.Ed.2d 708, 720, 110 S.Ct. 668].)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The error here did not influence the jury\u2019s understanding of either the elements of the charged offenses or the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. Therefore, I am not persuaded that the error lightened the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof in a manner constituting a federal constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Having concluded that the argument for federal constitutional error is insubstantial, I would continue to apply our state harmless error standard, under which a judgment will be reversed for error only when, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the reviewing court is of the opinion that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the defendant would have been reached in the absence of the error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836.) Applying this standard here, I find the error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The majority reasons that the error was not prejudicial because the prosecution presented \u201coverwhelming evidence establishing defendant\u2019s guilt of the charged offenses[.]\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 187.) But, as defendant points out, the strength of the prosecution\u2019s evidence in this case depended upon the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses who testified to defendant\u2019s confessions and admissions. Each of these witnesses participated to some extent in the drug operation, and exposure of the drug operation thus threatened each of them, just as it threatened defendant. The charged murders occurred in the apartment of one of these witnesses (Patricia Shepard) and the victims\u2019 bodies were buried at the residence of another witness (Susan Rambo). A third witness (Larry Tom Whittington) admittedly participated in moving the bodies and concealing evidence of the murders. None of the witnesses came forward until long after the murders had occurred, and all had ample time to prepare and coordinate a story placing the blame on defendant. Evidence that depends on the credibility of such witnesses can hardly be deemed overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Nevertheless, I am satisfied that defendant was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s instruction permitting the jury to consider the Rambo murder as propensity evidence. The instruction could prejudice defendant only if the jury first determined that it was defendant who had killed Rambo, then inferred from this killing that defendant was a violent person capable of murder, and finally used this inference about defendant\u2019s character to conclude that defendant committed the charged offenses. But the evidence identifying defendant as Rambo\u2019s killer, like the evidence identifying defendant as the perpetrator of the charged murders, consisted primarily of the testimony of other members of the drug ring, with little or no physical evidence tying defendant to the crime. To conclude that defendant had killed Rambo, the jury would have had to find the prosecution\u2019s witnesses credible. If the jury believed them as to Rambo\u2019s murder, it would almost inevitably believe them as to the charged murders as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">This analysis is consistent with the defense strategy. The defense recognized that the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses was the key issue\u2014 virtually the only issue\u2014in the case. The defense did not oppose admission of the Rambo murder evidence because it viewed that evidence as less credible than the evidence of the charged murders. Thus, the defense was counting on the jury to disbelieve the prosecution\u2019s witnesses as to the Rambo murder, and by this means to undermine their credibility as to the charged murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Given the nature of the credibility contest presented to the jury, it is highly unlikely that the jury in reaching its guilt verdicts relied to any: significant degree on inferences about defendant\u2019s character drawn from the Rambo murder. For this reason, it is not reasonably probable that the jury would have returned a verdict more favorable to defendant had the trial court not given the erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied January 26, 1994.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
