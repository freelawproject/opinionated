Brown Act (Stats. 1953, ch. 1588, \u00a7 1, p. 3269, codified as Gov. Code, \u00a7 54950 et seq. [hereafter the Brown Act or the Act])<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that all meetings of \u201cthe legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public,\u201d except as otherwise provided in the Act. (\u00a7 54953.) At all times relevant to this case the Act contained four separate definitions of \u201clegislative body.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted review to determine whether the Operations Committee of the Retirement Board of Orange County Employees Retirement System (hereafter Board) is a \u201clegislative body\u201d within the meaning of the Brown Act and, therefore, subject to the Act\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>open meeting requirements. Because the Operations Committee is an advisory committee composed solely of Board members numbering less than a quorum of the Board, we hold that the committee is not a \u201clegislative body\u201d pursuant to the provisions of section 54952.3 and is thereby excluded from the open meeting requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The Orange County Employees Retirement System is governed by a nine-member Board. Five members of the Board constitute a quorum. The Board is a \u201clocal agency\u201d and a \u201clegislative body\u201d under sections 54951 and 54952 respectively. The Board is therefore subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act. The chairman of the Board has created five advisory<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> committees\u2014operations, benefit, investment, real estate, and liaison\u2014each composed of four members of the Board. Some members serve on more than one committee. The committees\u2019 function is to review various matters related to the business of the Board and to make recommendations to the full Board for action. The Board considers the committees\u2019 recommendations in public meetings, at which time there is an opportunity for full public discussion and debate. The committees do not have any decisionmaking authority and act only in an \u201cadvisory\u201d capacity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">On June 18, 1991, the Operations Committee met to formulate a list of recommended changes to the Board\u2019s travel policy. Freedom Newspapers sought to attend the meeting but the committee denied permission on the ground that it was not subject to the open meeting requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Brown Act. The next day, June 19, the full Board met in a public session at which the chairman of the Operations Committee read and explained the committee\u2019s recommendations. The press was in attendance, and there was public discussion among the Board\u2019s members about the recommendations. The Board ultimately voted eight to one in public session to accept the recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">On the same day, Freedom Newspapers petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate alleging that the Operations Committee is subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act. The trial court denied the petition and entered judgment in favor of the Board. Freedom Newspapers appealed from that judgment, and the Court of Appeal reversed. We granted the Board\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The Brown Act was adopted to ensure the public\u2019s right to attend the meetings of public agencies. (\u00a7 54950.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act provides that \u201c[a]ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 54953.) As already noted, \u201clegislative body\u201d is defined in four sections of the Act, two of which pertain to the case before us. (\u00a7\u00a7 54952, 54952.3.) Section 54952 provides that any committee or body on which officers of a local agency serve in their official capacity and which is supported by its appointing local agency is a \u201clegislative body.\u201d (\u00a7 54952.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 54952.3 more specifically addresses \u201cadvisory\u201d bodies: \u201cAs used in this chapter[,] \u2018legislative body\u2019 also includes any advisory commission, advisory committee or advisory body of a local agency, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or by any similar formal action of a legislative body or member of a legislative body of a local agency. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] <em>\u2018Legislative body\u2019 as defined in this section does not include a committee composed solely of members of the governing body of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number><em>a local agency which are less than a quorum of such governing body.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 54952.3,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The parties in this case disagree over the meaning of the explicit less-than-a-quorum exception contained in section 54952.3. The Board and its amici curiae, including the Attorney General, argue that an advisory committee that is excluded from the definition of \u201clegislative body\u201d under the exception is completely exempt from the open meeting requirements of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">In opposition, Freedom Newspapers and its amici curiae contend that the less-than-a-quorum exception in section 54952.3 merely exempts less-than-a-quorum committees from the special, relaxed procedural requirements of section 54952.3. According to Freedom, such committees remain subject to the stricter open meeting requirements that are generally applicable to \u201clegislative bodies\u201d under section 54952.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">When interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].) In doing so we turn first to the statutory language, since the words the Legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent. <em>(Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 826 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Each party asserts that the language of section 54952.3 supports its view. Freedom reasons that, had the Legislature intended to exempt less-than-a-quorum advisory committees from the Act\u2019s open meeting requirements, it would have used language such as this: \u201c \u2018legislative bodies\u2019 as defined in <em>this chapter </em>shall not include a committee composed solely of members of the governing body of a local agency which are less than a quorum of such governing body.\u201d Because the Legislature used the words \u201cin this section,\u201d instead of \u201cin this chapter,\u201d the effect of the less-than-a-quorum exception, according to Freedom, is simply to exclude less-than-a-quorum committees from the terms of section 54952.3 rather than from other definitions of \u201clegislative body\u201d within the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In contrast, the Board argues that, because section 54952.3 specifically refers to \u201cany . . . advisory committee,\u201d that section alone governs advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>committees for the purposes of the Act. To support its interpretation the Board' relies, in part, on the traditional rules of statutory construction that specific statutes govern general statutes <em>(San Francisco Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 577 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 828 P.2d 147]; see also <em>Yoffie </em>v. <em>Marin Hospital Dist. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 743, 750-753 [238 Cal.Rptr. 502]; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>City of Ukiah </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 545, 552 [138 Cal.Rptr. 207]) and that, to the extent a specific statute is inconsistent with a general statute potentially covering the same subject matter, the specific statute must be read as an exception to the more general statute <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 443 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, <em>111 </em>P.2d 610]; <em>Yoffie </em>v. <em>Marin Hospital Dist., supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d at p. 751). According to the Board, an advisory committee that is excluded from the definition of \u201clegislative body\u201d contained in section 54952.3 is not subject to the Act\u2019s open meeting requirements, even if it might otherwise satisfy the more general definition of \u201clegislative body\u201d contained in section 54952.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The Board also argues that Freedom\u2019s interpretation of section 54952 would deprive sections 54952.2 and 54952.5, as well as the less-than-a-quorum exception in 54952.3, of meaning. To explain, sections 54952.2 and 54952.5 purport to include only certain bodies within the definition of \u201clegislative body.\u201d For the Legislature to have enacted those statutes would have made no sense if the governmental bodies described therein had already been included in the more general definition of \u201clegislative body\u201d contained in section 54952.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">To be sure, one could argue that section 54952.3 might still have some meaning under Freedom\u2019s interpretation. Because section 54952.3 gives certain advisory bodies the benefit of procedural requirements that are less stringent than the requirements applicable to \u201clegislative bodies\u201d under section 54952, under Freedom\u2019s interpretation the exception contained in section 54952.3 for less-than-a-quorum advisory committees would have the effect of subjecting such committees to the stricter, generally applicable procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">But Freedom\u2019s interpretation of section 54952.3 would also result in absurdity. If we construed section 54952.3 merely as exempting less-than-a-quorum advisory committees from the less rigid procedural requirements in that section, even a temporary, ad hoc advisory committee composed solely of less than a quorum of the governing body would be subject to all of the Brown Act\u2019s generally applicable procedural requirements, including the requirement that committees hold \u201cregular\u201d meetings. (\u00a7 54954.) Yet a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>temporary, ad hoc committee, by definition, does not hold \u201cregular\u201d meetings. We will not give a statute an absurd interpretation. <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal. 3d 208, 245 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]; <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 794, 800 [147 P.2d 387]; <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 94, 114 [210 Cal.Rptr. 335].)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Freedom attempts to avoid the absurdity by characterizing the Operations Committee as a standing committee. However, neither section 54952 nor section 54952.3 distinguishes between ad hoc advisory committees and standing advisory committees. We will not add to a statute a distinction that has been omitted. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858; see, e.g., <em>Security Pacific National Bank </em>v. <em>Wozab </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 991, 998 [275 Cal.Rptr. 201, 800 P.2d 557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">When a statute is ambiguous, as in this case, we typically consider evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent beyond the words of the statute <em>(DynaMed, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323]) and look both to the legislative history of the statute and to the wider historical circumstances of its enactment <em>(ibid.). </em>An examination of the history of the Brown Act, both prior to and after the enactment of section 54952.3, shows that committees comprised of less than a quorum of the legislative body have generally been considered exempt from the Act\u2019s open meeting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In 1958 the Attorney General, interpreting the original version of section 54952,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> concluded that \u201cmeetings of committees of local agencies where such committees consist of less than a quorum of the legislative body are not covered by the act.\u201d <em>(Secret Meeting Law, </em>32 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 240, 242 (1958).) The Attorney General reasoned that, \u201c[i]n those cases the findings of such a committee have not been deliberated upon by a quorum of the legislative body and the necessity, as well as the opportunity, for full public deliberation by the legislative body still remains.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Successive Attorneys General have consistently adhered to the view stated in the 1958 opinion. In 1968 the Attorney General wrote that \u201c[w]e have consistently concluded that committees composed of less than a quorum of the legislative body creating them and not established on a permanent basis for a continuing function are not subject to the open meeting requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>that Act. In view of the lack of any pronouncements on the parts of either the courts or the Legislature which would compel a different conclusion, our opinion remains unchanged.\u201d (Cal. Atty. Gen., Indexed Letter No. IL 68-106 (Apr. 29, 1968).)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">More specifically, since the enactment of section 54952.3 the Attorney General has continuously recognized that advisory committees falling within the express less-than-a-quorum exception in section 54952.3 are not \u201clegislative bodies\u201d within the meaning of the Brown Act. (See, e.g., Cal. Atty. Gen., Indexed Letter No. IL 69-131 (June 30, 1969); Secret Meetings Laws Applicable to Public Agencies (Cal.Atty.Gen., 1972) pp. 6-8; <em>Closed Meetings, </em>63 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 820, 823 (1980); <em>Open Meeting Requirements, </em>64 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 856, 857 (1981).) The Attorney General\u2019s brief in this case supports the long-standing view of his office.  While the Attorney General\u2019s views do not bind us <em>(Unger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 681, 688 [162 Cal.Rptr. 611]), they are entitled to considerable weight <em>(Meyer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 420, 431 [15 Cal.Rptr. 717]).  This is especially true here since the Attorney General regularly advises many local agencies about the meaning of the Brown Act and publishes a manual designed to assist local governmental agencies in complying with the Act\u2019s open meeting requirements. (See, e.g., Open Meeting Laws (Cal.Atty.Gen., 1989).)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In 1961 the Legislature amended the Brown Act, not in response to the Attorney General\u2019s recognition of an implicit less-than-a-quorum exception, but in response to a judicial opinion that essentially eviscerated the Act by restrictively defining the terms \u201cmeeting\u201d and \u201clegislative body.\u201d The court in <em>Adler </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 763 [7 Cal.Rptr. 805] <em>(Adler) </em>held that a city\u2019s planning commission did not violate the Brown Act when all but one of its members attended a dinner given a few days before the host\u2019s application to the commission for an amendment to the zoning law. The court held that \u201cthe Brown Act was not directed at anything less than a formal meeting of a city council or one of the city\u2019s subordinate agencies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 770.) Misconstruing the Attorney General\u2019s 1958 opinion <em>(Secret Meeting Law, supra, </em>32 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 240), which addressed committees composed of less than a quorum of the governing body, the court also held that the Act did not apply to any committee of an advisory nature, whether or not composed of a quorum of the governing body. <em>(Adler, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.2d at p. 771.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">In response to the <em>Adler </em>decision, the Legislature broadened the scope of the Brown Act the very next year. (Stats. 1961, ch. 1671, \u00a7 1, p. 3637, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>amending \u00a7\u00a7 54952 and 54957, and adding \u00a7\u00a7 54952.5, 54952.6, and 54960.) Shortly after the 1961 amendments took effect, the Attorney General construed them as disapproving <em>Adler </em>on several points. <em>(Secret Meeting Law, </em>42 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 61 (1963).) Specifically, the Attorney General concluded that the 1961 amendments \u201cdisapproved <em>Adler\u2019s </em>restrictive interpretation of the word \u2018meeting\u2019 by recognizing that criminally prohibited legislative action may be taken at gatherings that fall far short of the \u2018 \u201cformal assemblages of the council sitting as a joint deliberative body\u201d \u2019 \u201d and \u201crepudiated that portion of the <em>Adler </em>decision which held that the act was not meant to apply to planning commissions or other bodies of an \u2018advisory\u2019 nature.\u201d <em>(Secret Meeting Law, supra, </em>42 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., at pp. 64-65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">In addition to the history set out above, the history of the Brown Act in the Legislature reflects a recognition of the implicit less-than-a-quorum exception and, after the consistent failure of proposals to abolish it, the codification of a limited version of that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">A 1963 bill would have abolished the exception by providing that \u201c[a]ll meetings of any committee or subcommittee of a legislative body, <em>whether or not composed of a quorum of the members of the legislative body, </em>shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of such committee or subcommittee, except during consideration of the matters set forth in Section 54957.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 2334 (1963 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 2, italics added.) The bill did not pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The legislative history of section 54952.3, the provision at issue in this case, reveals another unsuccessful attempt to abolish the implicit less-than-a-quorum exception. Section 54952.3, enacted in 1968 (Stats. 1968, ch. 1297, \u00a7 1, p. 2444), extended the coverage of the Brown Act to certain advisory committees that were not previously covered. However, at the same time the Legislature rejected an alternative bill that would have abolished the implicit less-than-a-quorum exception by making all advisory committees subject to the full procedural requirements applicable to governing bodies. (Sen. Bill No. 717 (1968 Reg. Sess.).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The bill that did pass (Assem. Bill No. 202 (1968 Reg. Sess.), codified as \u00a7 54952.3) thus appears to be a compromise, incorporating into the open meeting requirements of the Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Act advisory committees that were not previously included within the Act, but relaxing the procedural requirements applicable to those committees and codifying a limited version of the implicit less-than-a-quorum exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">To support its view that the committees excluded from the definition of \u201clegislative body\u201d in section 54952.3 were included in another definition of \u201clegislative body,\u201d Freedom Newspapers relies on a communication by Assemblyman Hayes to the members of the Assembly discussing his reasons for drafting the less-than-a-quorum exception. Assemblyman Hayes claimed that \u201c \u2018[t]he reason [for enacting the less-than-a-quorum exception in section 54952.3] was that such committees of the governing body of a local agency are covered by another section of the Ralph M. Brown Act, Government Code Sec. 54952.\u2019 \u201d (4 Assem. J. (1968 Reg. Sess.) p. 7163.) However, these comments offer little assistance in the interpretation of section 54952.3 because they do not necessarily reflect the views of other members of the assembly who voted for section 54952.3. (Cf. <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 801, fn. 12 [268 Cal.Rptr. 753, 789 P.2d 934]; see also <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 700-701 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 589-590 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Indeed, the Legislature\u2019s action in two respects since the 1968 enactment of section 54952.3 indicates its continuing understanding that advisory committees comprised solely of less than a quorum of the governing body are exempt from the open meeting requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">First, although legislative acquiescence is a weak indication of legislative intent <em>(People </em>v. <em>Escobar </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 751 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 837 P.2d 1100]), we note that the Legislature has allowed the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion in <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 875 [144 Cal.Rptr. 568] to govern meetings of less-than-a-quorum advisory committees for the past 14 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The <em>Henderson </em>court squarely addressed the issue of whether an advisory committee consisting solely of governing board members, constituting less than a quorum of the board, was exempt from the open meeting requirements of the Act. (78 Cal.App.3d at pp. 880-883.) In <em>Henderson, </em>ad hoc advisory committees had been created for the purpose of advising the board of education about the qualifications of candidates for appointment to a vacant position. Each of the advisory committees was composed solely of members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>of the governing body of the school district numbering less than a quorum of the governing body. The court considered whether the advisory committees had violated the Brown Act when they evaluated the candidates\u2019 qualifications and interviewed candidates in private sessions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 877.) Finding that section 54952.3 provided an express exemption from the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act for advisory committees comprised solely of less than a quorum of the governing body, the <em>Henderson </em>court held that the advisory committees in that case were not subject to the Act. (78 Cal.App.3d at pp. 880-881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Secondly, and more importantly, the Legislature in 1992 attempted to extend the coverage of the Brown Act by limiting the coverage of the express less-than-a-quorum exception in section 54952.3 to ad hoc advisory committees. This legislation is the strongest indication that the current version of section 54952.3 excludes less-than-a-quorum advisory committees from the Act\u2019s open meeting requirements, rather than merely from the less-stringent procedural requirements in section 54952.3. On August 31, 1992, the California Legislature passed and sent to the Governor a bill amending the explicit less-than-a-quorum exception as follows: \u201c \u2018Legislative body\u2019 as defined in this section does not include a <em>limited duration ad hoc committee </em>composed solely of members of the governing body of a local agency which are less than a quorum of the governing body <em>but does include any standing committee </em>of a governing body irrespective of its composition. For purposes of this section, \u2018standing committee\u2019 means a permanent body created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or by any similar formal action of a legislative body or member of a legislative body of a local agency and which holds regularly scheduled meetings.\u201d (Assem. Bill. No. 3476 (1991-92 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 3, italics added.) The Governor vetoed this bill, reasoning that its economic impact would be too great in view of the state\u2019s fiscal outlook. In his veto message the Governor stated: \u201cThis bill would make a number of changes in the Ralph M. Brown Act relating to open meetings. It would <em>expand the number of local agencies subject to the law, </em>and expand notice, recordation, and recordkeeping requirements. . . . [\u00b6] I cannot approve mandating expensive new requirements while we are unable to afford the ones on the books today.\u201d (Governor\u2019s veto message to Assem. on Assem. Bill No. 3476 (Sept. 20, 1992) Recess J. No. 24 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) p. 10271, italics added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The Legislature\u2019s adoption of subsequent, amending legislation that is ultimately vetoed may be considered as evidence of the Legislature\u2019s understanding of the unamended, existing statute. (See <em>Eu </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1976) 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Cal.3d 465, 470 [128 Cal.Rptr. 1, 546 P.2d 289]; see also <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>California Emp. Com. </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 570, 578 [165 P.2d 908].) The 1992 legislation reflects the Legislature\u2019s understanding that the current version of the explicit less-than-a-quorum exception in section 54952.3 excludes advisory committees, whether ad hoc or standing, composed solely of less than a quorum of the members of the governing body from the open meeting requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The 1992 legislation \u201cwould [have] exclude[d] a limited duration ad hoc committee from the definition of legislative body but would [have] included] any standing committee, as defined, of a governing body irrespective of its composition.\u201d (See Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 3476 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.).) Because the 1992 legislation retained the \u201cin this section\u201d language (\u00a7 54952.3) and made no amendment to the general language in section 54952, the legislation would only make sense if the Legislature gave the words \u201cin this section\u201d the same meaning that the Board attributes to them in the current statute. If the Legislature had intended \u201cin this section\u201d to be interpreted as narrowly as Freedom suggests, the 1992 legislation would have had this bizarre result: Limited duration, ad hoc, advisory committees would have been subject to the full set of procedural requirements applicable to governing bodies, including the requirement of holding \u201cregular meetings,\u201d but standing advisory committees would have received the benefit of the relaxed procedural requirements described in section 54952.3. This clearly could not have been the intended effect of the 1992 bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In view of these considerations, we find it more consistent with the legislative intent to construe the less-than-a-quorum exception contained in section 54952.3 as an exception to the definition of \u201clegislative body,\u201d and thus one of several exceptions to the Brown Act\u2019s open meeting requirements,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> rather than merely as an exception to the special procedural requirements of section 54952.3. This interpretation is consistent with the Act\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>purpose of ensuring that the \u201cactions [of public agencies] be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.\u201d (\u00a7 54950.) By definition, the exception applies only to an advisory committee that consists solely of members of the legislative body that created it but not enough members to constitute a quorum or, thus, to act as the legislative body. Accordingly, before any action can be taken on such a committee\u2019s recommendations the entire legislative body, which includes the members of the advisory committee, must conduct further, public deliberations. (\u00a7 54952.) In this way the Act reasonably accommodates the practical needs of governmental organizations while still protecting the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Since the Operations Committee is composed solely of members of the governing body of a local agency numbering less than a quorum of the governing body, the committee\u2019s meeting on June 18, 1991, was not subject to the open meeting requirements of the Brown Act. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Lucas, C.

Under the majority opinion, however, a legislative body is entirely free to conduct the public\u2019s business in private session, shielding its decisionmaking process from scrutiny by the press or public, simply by dividing itself into various \u201cstanding committees\u201d whose membership does not comprise a quorum of the full legislative body.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority reaches this result by interpreting the Brown Act to exempt such committees from compliance with <em>any </em>of the Act\u2019s requirements.

The Board administers $1.5 billion, consisting of moneys derived from the county\u2019s general fund as well as those contributed by employees. The \u201cOperations Committee\u201d is one of five standing committees that report to the full Board. The membership of the Operations Committee (and of each of the other standing committees) consists of four of the nine Board members\u2014one person less than a quorum of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The purpose of the June 18, 1991, meeting was to reevaluate the Board\u2019s travel policy\u2014a policy that had engendered substantial controversy after it was reported that some Board members had used public funds to tour Europe, assertedly in connection with Board investments. A reporter for the Orange County Register, a daily newspaper, tried to attend the meeting but was refused entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The next day, the newspaper\u2019s parent company, Freedom Newspapers, Inc., petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate, seeking access to future meetings of the Operations Committee. The superior court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>petition. The Court of Appeal reversed, however, concluding that the Operations Committee was a \u201clegislative body of a local agency\u201d whose meetings were consequently required by the Brown Act to be \u201copen and public.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 54953.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">This court granted the Board\u2019s petition for review and now reverses the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">As I shall explain, the Court of Appeal reached the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">In the preamble to the Brown Act, the Legislature expressed the intent underlying the Act: \u201c[T]he Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people\u2019s business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly, [\u00b6] The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.\u201d (\u00a7 54950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Consistent with this stated legislative intent, the Act requires that all meetings of legislative bodies of local agencies \u201cbe open and public\u201d and that all persons \u201cbe permitted to attend\u201d such meetings. (\u00a7 54953.) The Act does, however, permit legislative bodies to discuss in \u201cclosed session\u201d certain sensitive topics, such as pending litigation and personnel matters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">The Act also requires \u201clegislative bodies\u201d to conduct \u201cregular\u201d meetings (\u00a7 54954) and abide by certain rules pertaining to adjournment or continuance of such meetings (\u00a7\u00a7 54955, 54955.1). Additional requirements are posting the agenda of each regular meeting, acting only on items listed on the posted agenda (\u00a7 54954.2), and giving written notice one week before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>each regular meeting to anyone requesting such notice (\u00a7 54954.1). The Act does allow for special meetings, but only if they are preceded by a 24-hour written notice. (\u00a7 54956.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The Act defines \u201clegislative bodies\u201d broadly. The term includes \u201cthe governing board, commission, directors or body of a local agency, or any board or commission thereof\u2019 as well as \u201cany board, commission, committee, or other body on which officers of a local agency serve in their official capacity as members and which is supported in whole or in part by funds provided by such agency . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 54952.) The term also applies to \u201cany board, commission, committee, or similar multimember body which exercises any authority of a legislative body of a local agency\u201d (\u00a7 54952.2), as well as to \u201cplanning commissions, library boards, recreation commissions, and other permanent boards or commissions of a local agency\u201d (\u00a7 54952.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The \u201cOperations Committee\u201d of the Board of Directors of the Orange County Employees Retirement System, as a \u201ccommittee ... on which officers of a local agency serve in their official capacity as members and which is supported in whole or in part by funds provided by such agency,\u201d qualifies as a \u201clegislative body\u201d within the meaning of section 54952, thus making it subject to the Brown Act\u2019s \u201copen meeting\u201d requirements. The issue in this case is whether the Operations Committee is exempted by another, more specific, provision of the Act, section 54952.3, from holding meetings open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Section 54952.3 provides for less stringent notice requirements for meetings of \u201cany advisory commission, advisory committee or advisory body of a local agency, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or by any similar formal action of a legislative body or member of a legislative body of a local agency.\u201d Under this section, an advisory commission, committee or body is a \u201clegislative body\u201d for purposes of the <em>open meeting </em>requirements of the Act. Such a legislative body can, however,' elect between giving 24-hour written notice of its meetings or providing by rule or bylaw for its meetings to be held at a regular time; \u201c[n]o other notice of regular meetings is required.\u201d (\u00a7 54952.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Section 54952.3 further provides that a \u201c \u2018[legislative body\u2019 as defined in this section does not include a committee composed solely of members of the governing body of a local agency which are <em>less than a quorum </em>of such governing body.\u201d (Italics added.) It is on this italicized phrase that the majority rests its conclusion that advisory committees made up only of members of the full governing body but \u201cless than a quorum\u201d of that body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>are exempt from any of the requirements of the Brown Act. Thus, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the Operations Committee was free to conduct its business in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of section 54952.3\u2019s \u201cless-than-a-quorum\u201d provision. In my view, this provision by its express terms excludes those advisory committees composed solely of members of the full governing body of the local agency only from the \u201crelaxed\u201d notice requirements of section 54952.3, thereby making such advisory bodies subject to the more rigid requirements that govern legislative bodies generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">My interpretation of the \u201cless-than-a-quorum\u201d provision is compelled by the plain language of section 54952.3, which must be the starting point for this statutory interpretation. <em>(Adoption of Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 826 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216].) After specifying that advisory commissions or committees are \u201clegislative bodies\u201d for purposes of the Brown Act, section 54952.3 next describes the less stringent procedural requirements for the meetings of such advisory bodies. It then states that \u201c \u2018[legislative body\u2019 <em>as defined in this section </em>does not include a committee composed solely of members of the governing body of the local agency which are less than of quorum of such governing body.\u201d By the limiting language, \u201cas defined in this section,\u201d the provision carves out an exception from section 54952.3\u2019s definition of \u201clegislative body\u201d (and thus from the section\u2019s less stringent notice requirements) for an advisory committee composed solely of members of the governing body of the local agency who comprise less than a quorum of the local agency\u2019s full membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Therefore, in this case the Operations Committee of the Board of Directors of the Orange County Employees Retirement System, as an advisory committee composed solely of members of the full governing body of the local agency (the Board), is not a \u201clegislative body\u201d for purposes of the relaxed notice requirements of section 54952.3. Rather, as I explained earlier, the Operations Committee meets section 54952\u2019s definition of \u201clegislative body\u201d as being a \u201ccommittee ... on which officers of a local agency serve in their official capacity as members and which is supported in whole or in part by funds provided by such agency . . . .\u2019\u2019As such, the Operations Committee is subject to the full force of the Brown Act. Most important, the committee must conduct its business in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">To require an advisory committee that, as here, is comprised of individuals who are members of the governing body to which the committee reports to conduct public meetings would further the Legislature\u2019s stated intent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>\u201cthe people\u2019s business\u201d be conducted openly, and that both the \u201cactions\u201d and the \u201cdeliberations\u201d of government be open to the press and public. Even though the Operations Committee cannot itself bind the full Board by \u201cactions\u201d such as adopting a proposal or enacting a rule (which would require a majority vote of the full Board), it can and does \u201cdeliberate.\u201d \u201cDeliberation\u201d is defined as \u201cthe process ... of thoughtful and lengthy consideration\u201d or as \u201cformal discussion and debate on all sides of an issue.\u201d (American Heritage Diet, of the English Language (1980) p. 349.) Indeed, to best assure that government decisions follow thoughtful and lengthy consideration or debate of all sides of an issue, the Brown Act invites the public to witness that whole process.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">A standing committee\u2019s reconsideration of a significant policy that affects the public\u2019s trust and confidence in its government officials\u2014such as the Board\u2019s travel policy here\u2014necessarily involves deliberation. Yet, under the majority\u2019s interpretation of section 54952.3, this deliberation can take place in private session outside the scrutiny of the public. And when, as in this case, the makeup of the standing committee recommending a policy change is just one member short of a quorum of the full governing body, and only one additional vote is needed to make the recommended change, there may be little further debate or deliberation on the issue by the full Board. In that event, the public is deprived of its right to witness the deliberative processes of government. Indeed, under the majority\u2019s reading of section 54952.3, any local agency wishing to keep its deliberative processes from the public can effectively do so by referring controversial issues to standing committees comprised of one member less than a quorum.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of section 54952.3 rests first on its conclusion that construing section 54952.3 to exempt from the less stringent procedural requirements specified by that section <em>all </em>less-than-a-quorum advisory committees composed solely of members of the governing body would \u201cresult in absurdity\u201d by making even temporary, ad hoc advisory committees subject to the Brown Act\u2019s \u201cgenerally applicable procedural requirements,\u201d including that set out in section 54954 of holding \u201cregular\u201d meetings. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 827.) But to require a temporary, ad hoc advisory committee to conduct its meetings at a regular time seems far less absurd than to permit, as the majority does here, a local agency to use standing committees to shield discussion and deliberation on controversial issues from public scrutiny.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The majority relies also on opinions by the Attorney General (which the majority admits do not bind this court) and on a series of failed legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>efforts to amend the Brown Act. But we need not turn to unpassed or vetoed legislation to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent. The Legislature has made its intent plain in the preamble to the Brown Act, which expressly states that to ensure that Californians can remain informed and \u201cretain control\u201d over their own government, legislative deliberations must be conducted openly. \u201cVital\u201d to the functioning of any democratic society is \u201can informed citizenry.\u201d <em>(John Doe Agency </em>v. <em>John Doe Corp. </em>(1989) 493 U.S. 146, 152 [107 L.Ed.2d 462, 110 S.Ct. 471].) Consistent with our Legislature\u2019s intent, I would affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment directing that the Board allow members of the press and the public to attend \u201cits regular committee meetings,\u201d including those of its Operations Committee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-9\">This law, which is codified in Government Code section 54950 et seq., is also known as the Ralph M.
