J.</author>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">By information filed in San Mateo County Superior Court, defendant L\u00e1veme Johnson was charged with two counts of murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187; all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated), and one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7451, subd. (b)). The information alleged the murders constituted a special circumstance of multiple murder (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The jury found defendant guilty on all three counts, finding true the special circumstance allegation. The jury subsequently returned a death verdict, and the trial court sentenced defendant to death. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) We note that on April 15, 1993, defendant filed a habeas corpus petition with this court. We denied the petition on September 15, without issuing an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">As will appear, we reject defendant\u2019s claims of prejudicial error and affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">On January 15, 1986, police officers and firefighters were summoned to a house fire in Daly City. Inside the house, the officers found the bodies of Maria Victoria Holmes, aged 52, and her daughter, Luisa Anna Castro, 32. The evidence indicated that two fires (one upstairs, and one downstairs) had been intentionally set, probably through the use of some flammable liquid. Victim Holmes evidently had been severely beaten and kicked. Her body showed extensive contusions and abrasions; her face was swollen and bloody. An autopsy indicated she died from 12 or more blows to her head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>and face. Victim Castro\u2019s body was burned beyond recognition; a large knife was found nearby. An autopsy determined, however, that she had died from strangulation; a wire was found wrapped tightly around her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Further investigation revealed the following facts: Victim Holmes was a hotel manager who wore expensive jewelry and possessed an extensive collection of gold jewelry from Central America. She shared her home with her daughter, victim Castro, a nightclub security guard, who was currently dating defendant, a customer of the club. Castro also had a collection of gold jewelry and frequently boasted of it. On the night of the murders, Castro had prepared dinner for defendant at her home after they had driven her children to a babysitter. Later that evening, someone murdered the two women, stole their jewelry, and set fire to their home in an apparent attempt to cover up the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Defendant was arrested after a girlfriend, Roshaun Fuller, told police that he had admitted assaulting the women and taking their jewelry. According to Fuller, defendant stated he \u201cknocked out\u201d Castro and, when victim Holmes came upstairs to investigate, he knocked her down and kicked her in the head. Defendant had been seen wearing, and later pawning, some gold jewelry, although it could not positively be traced to the victims. Defendant also admitted to the investigating officers some facts regarding his relationship with Castro, including sharing dinner with her at her home on or about the night of the murders. According to defendant, he left the house after Castro had become intoxicated and fallen asleep. Although defendant denied killing the women, at one point he told the interrogating officer that, \u201cI probably did do it, but you are not going to get me to say I did do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The defense offered an alibi (defendant was seen engaging in a bar fight on the day in question) and evidence to cast doubts on Fuller\u2019s testimony, which was frequently contradictory and inconsistent. According to a defense investigator, Fuller admitted lying to police regarding defendant\u2019s admission that he assaulted both women.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">At the penalty phase, the People admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s prior crimes, including four prior felony convictions for robbery, burglary, disorderly conduct (transmitting a false alarm), and theft, and numerous unadjudicated offenses including rapes, oral copulation, robberies, batteries and assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The defense relied primarily on background and character evidence, including testimony regarding defendant\u2019s troubled childhood, his lack of parental guidance, and the likelihood he would succeed in a supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>prison setting. Defendant personally testified regarding some of the foregoing matters, and attempted to mitigate some of the \u201cprior crimes\u201d evidence by explaining the extenuating circumstances surrounding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">A defense psychologist, Dr. Fricke, testified regarding defendant\u2019s sociopathic personality. On rebuttal, a prosecution psychiatrist stressed defendant\u2019s antisocial and manipulative personality, and his potential dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Guilt Phase Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">A. <em>Discharge of Juror Solano</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Defendant first contends the court erred in discharging Juror William Solano after trial had commenced. In a related contention, defendant asserts he was wrongfully excluded from the in camera hearing held to determine whether Solano should be excused. We conclude neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Near the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, the court called for an in-chambers conference and revealed the following facts and observations: Juror Solano did not appear to be paying attention to the witnesses; instead, he was either watching the judge or defendant, or was \u201cdoodling\u201d in his notebook. Solano \u201cconsistently smiled\u201d at defendant, \u201cto the extent that the teeth are showing.\u201d On many occasions, defendant smiled or nodded back at Solano. In addition, the court noted that Solano had been late in arriving at the courtroom at least three times, and that he tended to close his eyes and possibly \u201cnod off\u201d during court proceedings. The court further indicated that police records revealed Solano had been arrested for possessing narcotics, contrary to his jury questionnaire response that his only arrest was \u201cfor being out late while under age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The court questioned the two courtroom deputies, who confirmed that Solano appeared to be paying no attention to the proceedings. Deputy Kutch read from his logbook, which indicated Solano had \u201cnodded off\u201d three times, had doodled for fifteen minutes on one occasion, and had nodded or smiled at defendant seven times during the trial. Deputy Steiner confirmed that Solano had closed his eyes for a short time on several occasions, and had frequently smiled at or greeted defendant before lunch breaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The prosecutor asked that Solano be examined regarding his fitness to remain on the jury. The prosecutor observed that on one occasion he noticed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>that Solano\u2019s eyes were closed and his chin was resting on his chest. As Solano began to fall forward, he opened his eyes in a startled manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Defense counsel objected to the hearing, noting that several other jurors had also either closed their eyes during testimony or smiled at defendant. Counsel also requested that defendant be present at any further hearing on Solano\u2019s status as a juror. The court denied this request on the basis that the hearing was not part of the trial, did not involve defendant\u2019s guilt, and bore no reasonable relation to defendant\u2019s opportunity to defend himself. Additionally, according to the court, defendant\u2019s presence might intimidate Solano and make it more difficult to extract accurate responses from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Defense counsel indicated that, in order to avoid alienating Solano, he too would not attend the hearing. The prosecutor likewise elected not to attend. The court thereupon questioned Solano in his chambers on a variety of subjects. When asked about his response to the questionnaire inquiry regarding prior arrests, Solano acknowledged he had been arrested when cocaine had been discovered nearby, and had also been arrested for public intoxication. When asked why he had failed to reveal that information, he replied that \u201cI was just trying to get through with this questionnaire as soon as possible. It just didn\u2019t seem that important to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Solano also acknowledged he had closed his eyes occasionally during trial, and had nodded or smiled at defendant from time to time. According to Solano, these gestures and smiles were \u201cjust a reaction [to] someone smiling at me . . . .1 smile back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The court ruled that Solano should be excused because of his concealment of his prior arrests, and because of his sleeping during the course of the trial. The court replaced Solano with one of the alternate jurors, Samuel Ybarra.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">1. <em>Defendant\u2019s absence from hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Before examining the propriety of discharging Solano, we must determine whether the court erred in refusing to allow defendant personally to attend the in-chambers hearing regarding possible discharge of the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">The defendant has a constitutional (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15) and statutory (\u00a7\u00a7 977, subd. (b), 1043, subd. (a)) right to be personally present at his trial. (See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 522, 526 [84 L.Ed.2d 486, 490, 105 S.Ct. 1482], and cases cited [defendant has federal due process right to attend court proceedings if his presence has a reasonably substantial relation to his ability to defend himself].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Under section 977, subdivision (b), the defendant \u201cshall\u201d be present at certain proceedings (arraignment, plea, preliminary examination, sentencing, and \u201cthose portions of the trial when evidence is taken before the trier of fact\u201d), and \u201cshall\u201d also attend \u201call other proceedings,\u201d unless he or she files a written waiver of the right to be present at such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Although the broad language of the foregoing section appears to grant the defendant an unqualified right to attend all in-chambers conferences, we have held that the defendant\u2019s absence from various court proceedings, <em>\u201ceven without waiver, </em>may be declared nonprejudicial in situations where his presence does not bear a \u2018reasonably substantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 746, 782 [254 Cal.Rptr. 257, 765 P.2d 419], quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 333, 359-360 [233 Cal.Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802], italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 177-178 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781] [absence from portion of voir dire and some in-chambers discussions]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 602-603 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290] [absence from various in-chambers proceedings]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 902-903 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282] [absence from in-chambers conferences and in-court reading of testimony]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 468, 517-518 [268 Cal.Rptr. 126, 788 P.2d 640] [absence from reading of testimony]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1025-1028 [264 Cal.Rptr. 386, 782 P.2d 627] [absence from jury view of murder scene, from conference regarding jury request for clarification, and from reading of testimony]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1079-1080 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659] [absence from various hearings and conferences]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 18, 59-62 [255 Cal.Rptr. 631, 767 P.2d 1109] [absence from penalty-reduction hearing and sentencing]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 585-586 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776] [absence from reading of testimony].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We initially reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the Solano hearing was one involving the presentation of evidence to \u201cthe trier of fact\" within the meaning of section 977, subdivision (b), thereby compelling his presence under the terms of that section. It seems clear the foregoing \u201cevidence presentation\u201d provision has no application to in-chambers hearings on collateral matters held outside the jury\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Accordingly, under the foregoing cases, in determining whether defendant was prejudiced by being excluded from the Solano hearing, we must inquire whether defendant\u2019s presence bore a \u201creasonably substantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charges\u201d against him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Defendant fails to explain in what manner his presence at the in-chambers hearing could have enhanced his opportunity to defend against the charges. He suggests that had he been allowed to attend the hearing at issue, he might have helped his counsel in questioning Juror Solano. The point seems unduly speculative, especially in light of defense counsel\u2019s own decision, previously discussed, to absent himself from the hearing rather than risk alienating the juror. (See <em>Medina, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 903; <em>Hovey, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In situations similar to the present case, although occurring prior to the enactment of section 977, subdivision (b), we have indicated that the defendant would have no right to attend such hearings. <em>(In re Lessard </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 497, 506 [42 Cal.Rptr. 583, 399 P.2d 39] [absence from private conference with juror asking to be excused]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Abbott </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 362, 372 [303 P.2d 730] [absence from hearing regarding juror\u2019s qualifications]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>470 U.S. at p. 527 [84 L.Ed.2d at pp. 490-491] [absence from hearing to determine juror\u2019s impartiality].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Defendant relies on various federal and sister-state cases which indicate a criminal defendant has a right to attend in-chambers conferences regarding a juror\u2019s impartiality, qualifications or possible misconduct. (E.g., <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Lockhart </em>(8th Cir. 1988) 852 F.2d 379, 381-382; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gay </em>(9th Cir. 1975) 522 F.2d 429, 435; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medcoff( </em>1955) 344 Mich. 108 [73 N.W.2d 537, 543].) Respondent cites other cases which find no prejudicial error in excluding the defendant from such conferences. (E.g., <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 819 F.2d 1495,1507, and cases cited; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lustig </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 555 F.2d 737, 745-746 [46 A.L.R.Fed. 714], cert, den. (1978) 434 U.S. 1045 [54 L.Ed.2d 795, 98 S.Ct. 889].).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">As respondent observes, many of defendant\u2019s cited cases preceded the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>470 U.S. at pages 526-527 [84 L.Ed.2d at pages 490-491], wherein the high court made it clear that due process principles do not entitle the defendant to appear at every encounter between judge and jurors. As <em>Gagnon </em>explains, the central inquiry in such situations is whether the defendant\u2019s presence at the hearing reasonably could have assisted his defense of the charges against him. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">As we have discussed, defendant fails to convince us that his presence could have assisted his defense in any way. Thus, we conclude that, although defendant may have had a statutory right to attend the Solano hearing, his exclusion therefrom did not amount to prejudicial error because it is unlikely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>his presence would have enhanced his opportunity to defend against the charges. Moreover, several cases have observed that if, as a result of the hearing in question, the affected juror is discharged and an alternate juror is picked to replace him, prejudice to the defendant will not be presumed. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lustig, supra, 555 </em>F.2d 737, 746; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dell </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 248, 256-257 [283 Cal.Rptr. 3610] [court excused sick jurors without hearing]; <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska Ct.App. 1986) 723 P.2d 638, 640 [defendant excluded from inquiry into juror misconduct].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dell, supra, </em>\u201cappellant does not claim she was actually prejudiced from the substitution of jurors nor does it appear she could reasonably make such an argument. Alternates are selected from the same source, in the same manner, with the same qualifications and are subject to the same challenges. Alternates have an equal opportunity to observe the entire proceedings and take the same oath as regular jurors. [Citation.] In this case, appellant had ample opportunity to voir dire the alternates and use her allotted peremptory challenges. [Citation.] Nor is there any allegation the alternates were either incompetent or biased.\" (232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 256-257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The foregoing authorities seem apposite here. Accordingly, we conclude that no prejudicial error occurred by reason of defendant\u2019s exclusion from the Solano hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">2. <em>Defense counsel\u2019s absence from hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Defendant next contends that his counsel\u2019s absence from the Solano hearing deprived him of the right to counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings. The contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">As previously discussed, defense counsel made a tactical decision not to attend the hearing. Counsel indicated he wished to avoid alienating Solano should he remain a juror in the case. Although defendant argues that such a decision required his personal consent, our decisions indicate that trial counsel has discretion to make \u201can informed decision as to the necessity of attending\u201d in-chambers proceedings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>51 Cal. 3d at p. 904 [counsel absent from reading of testimony to jury]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 314 315 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149] [counsel authorized to make tactical decisions and control court proceedings without first obtaining personal waiver from defendant].) Defendant\u2019s suggestion that counsel\u2019s decision to forgo the hearing reflected his <em>incompetence </em>cannot be sustained in light of the reasonable tactical consideration which, according to counsel, induced that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Accordingly, we need not reach the question whether a defendant has a constitutional right to his\" counsel\u2019s presence at conferences called for the purpose of determining whether particular jurors should be discharged and alternates selected. We note, however, that one recent case has held that \u201cthere is no constitutional violation when alternate jurors are substituted in the absence of counsel.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dell, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at p. 257; see also <em>In re Mendes </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 847, 852 [153 Cal.Rptr. 831, 592 P.2d 318].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">3. <em>Solano was properly discharged</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Defendant next contends the court erred in discharging Juror Solano. As previously noted, the court discharged Solano for two reasons, namely, (1) his sleeping during the trial, and (2) his untruthful or incomplete responses to the jury questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Defendant contends there was no evidence that Solano was actually sleeping. He cites cases indicating that jury verdicts will not be overturned in the absence of \u201cconvincing proof\" that a juror actually slept during trial. (E.g., <em>Hasson </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 388, 411 [185 Cal.Rptr. 654, 650 P.2d 1171].) Defendant observes that the court failed to inquire of Solano whether in fact he had fallen asleep, or had missed any testimony. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Roselle </em>(1912) 20 Cal.App. 420, 424 [129 P. 477].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The present case does not involve a claim of juror misconduct sufficient to overturn a verdict. Instead, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in discharging one juror and substituting an alternate.  Under section 1089, the court, upon \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d may discharge any juror \u201cfound to be unable to perform his duty\u201d at any time during the trial. (See also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 233.) The determination of \u201cgood cause\u201d rests in the sound discretion of the court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Abbott, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at p. 371; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dell, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at p. 256), and the court\u2019s finding thereof will be upheld if substantial evidence supports it <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 505, 520 [224 Cal.Rptr. 112, 714 P.2d 1251]). We have also stated, however, that a juror\u2019s inability to perform as a juror must \u201cappear in the record as a demonstrable reality.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Compton </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 55, 60 [98 Cal.Rptr. 217, 490 P.2d 537], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Here, there was ample evidence indicating that on one or more occasions Solano had actually fallen asleep during trial. The court, its two deputies, and the prosecutor each stated on the record that they had observed defendant exhibiting various physical indicia of sleep, including eye closures, head nodding, and slumping in his chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>As for Solano\u2019s incomplete questionnaire responses, the court found he had failed to disclose two prior arrests. Concealment of prior criminal charges constitutes good cause for discharge of a juror under section 1089. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 399-401 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610] [concealment of prior conviction and dismissed assault charge]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farris </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 376, 386-387 [136 Cal.Rptr. 45] [concealment of misdemeanor prosecution and arrest record].) Defendant argues Solano\u2019s prior arrests were in legal effect mere detentions, because no accusatory pleadings were ever filed. (See \u00a7 849.5.) Assuming Solano was entitled to rely on this provision in completing his questionnaire (see <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 194, 200 [85 Cal.Rptr. 782]), he could not simply ignore these incidents for he was also asked if he had ever been \u201caccused\u201d of a crime. His \u201cno\u201d response was incomplete and misleading. In any event, as we have discussed, the court\u2019s ruling excusing Solano can be sustained solely on the basis of its finding that Solano had fallen asleep during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">In a related contention, defendant suggests he was denied due process by the discharge of Juror Solano without a showing of \u201clegal necessity.\u201d He suggests he had a constitutional right to be tried by the first jury impaneled to try his case. None of the cases cited by defendant in support of this argument indicates that due process principles would forbid substitution of an alternate juror under the circumstances presented here. (See, e.g., <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Bates </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 917 F.2d 388, 392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Defendant also argues he was denied due process by the trial court\u2019s \u201cex parte\u201d manner of investigating Juror Solano\u2019s suitability as a juror. In defendant\u2019s view, the court \u201cabandoned its role as a neutral arbiter\u201d by secretly observing Solano, recording his conduct, and examining his questionnaire responses and arrest record, before announcing to the parties the court\u2019s doubts as to his suitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Defendant cites no cases suggesting the trial court, in the course of investigating whether good cause exists to replace a juror suspected of misconduct or inattentiveness, must reveal its concerns to the defendant or his counsel before conducting further investigation. It is doubtful that such a limitation on the court\u2019s discretion under section 1089 is necessary to protect any of the defendant\u2019s legitimate interests. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Keenan </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 533 [250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 758 P.2d 1081] [recognizing court\u2019s power to conduct \u201cdiscreet and properly limited investigation\u201d of possible jury misconduct], 539 [recognizing court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion as to the mode of investigation\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We conclude the court properly discharged Juror Solano.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>B. <em>Substitution of Juror Ybarra</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Alternate Juror Samuel Ybarra was chosen to replace Juror Solano. Although defendant had not previously objected to the selection of Ybarra as an alternate, nonetheless, once he was substituted as a juror to replace Solano, defense counsel moved for a mistrial. Counsel represented that Ybarra was unacceptable to defendant and would have been challenged earlier had defendant been allowed to exercise another peremptory challenge. (The court had allowed both sides only one challenge \u201cper seat\u201d for the four alternate jurors, and defendant had previously used his challenge for the seat ultimately given to Ybarra.) The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Defendant now argues he should have been given \u201ca number of peremptory challenges equal to the number of alternates selected and unencumbered by any restriction to any particular seat.\u201d The objection to the court\u2019s allocation of peremptory challenges comes too late. Objections to the jury selection process must be made when the selection occurs. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Caro </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1035, 1047 [251 Cal.Rptr. 757, 761 P.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">C. <em>Admissibility of Defendant\u2019s Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Defendant contends the court erred in admitting certain statements he made to police officers on March 28 and April 3, 1986. We conclude the statements were properly admitted and, in any event, any <em>Miranda </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">1. <em>March 28 interview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">On March 28, 1986, defendant was interviewed by Officers McCarthy and Keate concerning the murders of Castro and Holmes. Officer McCarthy told defendant the purpose of the interview, and defendant replied, \u201cfine.\u201d When McCarthy brought out a tape recorder, defendant objected, stating \u201cNo tape recording, I don\u2019t want to incriminate myself.\u201d The recorder was not used.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Officer McCarthy thereupon read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights (see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 444-445 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706-707, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]), and defendant confirmed that he understood those rights and wished to talk with the officers. Defendant was also informed he could terminate the interview at any time. The ensuing interview lasted around two and one-half hours. During its course, McCarthy explained that defendant would be charged with the two murders, and defendant (1) bragged that his mother would hire a \u201chigh price lawyer out of New York\u201d to defend him, (2) inquired of possible penalties for the murders, and (3) initiated the possibility of a plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>When informed that he might be charged with offenses carrying the death penalty, defendant stated, \u201cMaybe I ought to talk to a lawyer, you might be bluffing, you might not have enough to charge murder.\u201d Officer McCarthy thereupon asked defendant if he wanted to talk to a lawyer at that point, and defendant made no direct reply except to repeat that he thought McCarthy was \u201cbluffing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Defendant, stating \u201cThis is off the record,\u201d next asked Officer McCarthy if a 10-year sentence was possible for the murder charges. McCarthy replied that the matter of sentence was up to the district attorney, the court and defendant\u2019s counsel. Defendant acknowledged he was worried about receiving a death sentence. (As explained below, the foregoing \u201coff the record\u201d discussion about sentencing was ruled inadmissible.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Defendant next asked Officer McCarthy to \u201cTell me what you have and I might make you a proposition.\u201d McCarthy replied that he customarily did not disclose evidentiary details. Defendant indicated that he would not \u201csay\u201d anything \u201cwithout some kind of arrangement.\u201d He also declared that \u201cI probably did do it, but you are not going to get me to say I did do it.\u201d Defendant then asked McCarthy to approach the district attorney and negotiate a 10-year sentence for the murder charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">2. <em>April 3 interview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">On April 2, Officer Quinn received a phone call from a person identifying himself as \u201cAntonin.\u201d (Defendant was also known as Antonin Capriano.) Antonin indicated he was confined at the San Mateo County jail and wished to speak to the officer. Officers Quinn and McCarthy visited defendant and again read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant again confirmed he understood\" these rights and wished to talk with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">At one point in the interview, the officers asked defendant to tell what happened in regard to Castro and Holmes. Defendant insisted the discussion be \u201coff the record,\u201d stating that he was not going to incriminate himself by telling what happened. He added that he would plead guilty to manslaughter \u201cfor two years.\u201d After terminating the interview (\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything else\u201d), he called the officers back and told them to see if the district attorney would \u201cgo for twenty straight years for the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">According to the Attorney General, and not disputed by defendant\u2019s appellate counsel, <em>none </em>of defendant\u2019s statements at the April 3 interview was introduced at trial. Accordingly, it is apparent that defendant could not have been prejudiced by any asserted <em>Miranda </em>errors occurring during that interview, and we do not discuss defendant\u2019s claims in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>3. <em>Trial court\u2019s rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Defendant moved the trial court to suppress his statements, asserting that the interviews continued after he had invoked his rights to remain silent and to consult with an attorney. The court disagreed, finding that defendant had voluntarily waived those rights, and did not reinvoke them. The court also ruled, however, that in light of defendant\u2019s \u201coff the record\u201d assertions during the course of both interviews, any statements immediately following these assertions would be inadmissible. The affected statements related to possible plea bargains or potential sentences for the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">4. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyer </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 247, 263 [256 Cal.Rptr. 96, 768 P.2d 610], reviewing a similar claimed <em>Miranda </em>violation, \u201cThe scope of our review of constitutional claims of this nature is well established. We must accept the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts and inferences, and its evaluations of credibility, if they are substantially supported. [Citations.] However, we must independently determine from the undisputed facts, and those properly found by the trial court, whether the challenged statement was illegally obtained. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">a. <em>\u201cNo tape recorder\u201d remark</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Defendant contends he invoked his right to remain silent at the outset of the March 28 interview by remarking: \u201cNo tape recorder. I don\u2019t want to incriminate myself.\u201d The trial court found that this remark was ambiguous and did not necessarily disclose an intent to \u201ccut off\u2019 all questions, as opposed to merely expressing an objection to the use of a tape recorder to memorialize defendant\u2019s responses. In the trial court\u2019s view, defendant\u2019s remarks indicated only a \u201cpartial restriction\u201d on his willingness to speak to the officers. Accordingly, they were entitled to continue the interrogation once they clarified the situation by giving <em>Miranda </em>advisements and obtaining defendant\u2019s express consent to be interviewed. We agree. As indicated previously, the advisements, and defendant\u2019s agreement to talk, occurred immediately following his \u201cno tape recorder\u201d remark and clearly confirmed his general willingness to speak to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Defendant asserts his remarks showed he was unwilling to \u201cfreely and completely\u201d discuss his case with the police. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 375, 382 [99 Cal.Rptr. 1, 491 P.2d 793]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Randall </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 948, 956 [83 Cal.Rptr. 658, 464 P.2d 114].) We find the foregoing cases inapposite. They recite the familiar rule that police interrogation must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>cease once the defendant, by words or conduct, demonstrates a desire to invoke his right to remain silent, or to consult with an attorney. Neither case, however, stands for the proposition that a defendant automatically invokes those rights by imposing conditions (such as \u201cno tape recorder\u201d) governing the conduct of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Defendant contends that prior cases have held a suspect\u2019s refusal to permit a tape-recorded interview constitutes an invocation of his right to remain silent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hinds </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 222, 235-236 [201 Cal.Rptr. 104]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nicholas </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 249, 268 [169 Cal.Rptr. 497].) In both these cases, however, the suspect\u2019s refusal to permit a recording was accompanied by other facts disclosing his clear intent to speak <em>privately </em>and in confidence with the officers. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Braeseke </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 691, 702-703 [159 Cal.Rptr. 684, 602 P.2d 384] [defendant\u2019s request for \u201coff the record\u201d discussion invoked his self-incrimination privilege].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In the present case, by contrast, the trial court found no such clear intent on defendant\u2019s part. Although defendant asked that the proceedings go \u201coff the record\u201d at various points during the interviews, he expressed no general expectation of privacy covering the entire interview. (We discuss in a subsequent part of this opinion defendant\u2019s separate contention that his requests for \u201coff-the-record\u201d treatment required the officers to terminate further questioning.) As another recent case observes, \u201cit was for the trial court to determine whether [the defendant\u2019s] refusal to . . .be recorded was in fact an invocation of his right to silence. The court found [the defendant] in fact had understood his rights and waived them, and his conversations with the officers were therefore voluntary. Such a conclusion was reasonable, and we will not disturb it on this appeal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Maier </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1670, 1678 [277 Cal.Rptr. 667].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Defendant observes that he linked the \u201cno tape recorder\u201d remark with the explanation that \u201cI don\u2019t want to incriminate myself,\u201d a statement defendant deems an explicit invocation of his self-incrimination privilege. But the trial court reasonably could find that the remark, being linked to defendant\u2019s insistence on \u201cno tape recorder,\u201d merely expressed his assumption that only recorded statements could incriminate him at trial. Immediately after defendant made this remark, the officers read defendant the <em>Miranda </em>advisements, and asked defendant if he wished to talk to them. These advisements included the unqualified admonition that <em>anything </em>defendant said to the officers could be used against him in a court of law. The trial court reasonably could find that this admonition cleared up any possible misconception defendant previously may have entertained regarding the admissibility of his <em>unrecorded </em>statements to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Several California cases have indicated that if a defendant expresses ambiguous remarks falling short of a clear waiver or invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the officers may continue talking with him for the limited purpose of clarifying whether he is waiving or invoking those rights. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carey </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 99, 103 [227 Cal.Rptr. 813], and cases cited; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bestelmeyer </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 520, 526-527 [212 Cal.Rptr. 605]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Russo </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 1172, 1177 [196 Cal.Rptr. 466].) We approve the rule of these cases and find it applicable here.  Giving defendant full <em>Miranda </em>warnings and obtaining his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was a legitimate method of clarifying any ambiguities inherent in defendant\u2019s \u201cno tape recorder\" remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">b. <em>Defendant\u2019s references to securing a lawyer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Midway during the March 28 interview, Officer McCarthy indicated (as he had already done several times during the interview) that murder charges would be brought against defendant. He replied that \u201cMy mother will put out money for a high price lawyer out of New York.\u201d McCarthy asked for the name of defendant\u2019s lawyer, but he refused to furnish it, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t want you talking to my lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Thereafter, following a discussion (initiated by defendant) of the possible penalties that might be imposed for the murders, including death or life without possibility of parole, defendant stated, \u201cGive me a minute, I might tell you something you want to hear.\u201d After a few moments of silence, defendant then said, \u201cMaybe I ought to talk to my lawyer, you might be bluffing, you might not have enough to charge murder.\u201d Officer McCarthy immediately asked defendant if he wanted to talk to a lawyer before answering more questions, and defendant simply repeated that he thought McCarthy was bluffing. He made no further mention of lawyers during this interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Defendant contends that each of the foregoing references to lawyers invoked his right to counsel and should have induced the officers to terminate the interview.  The trial court ruled that defendant\u2019s initial remark regarding his mother securing a \u201chigh price\" lawyer was \u201cnot an expression of an intent to terminate the interview at that time, but instead related to a future trial and not to present questioning.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The cases hold that if a defendant indicates <em>in any manner </em>that he wishes to consult with an attorney, the interrogation must cease. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at pp. 444-445 [16 L.Ed.2d at pp. 706-707]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyer, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 271.) The California courts have found invocations of the right to counsel in such varying statements or inquiries as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201c I don\u2019t know if I should have a lawyer here or what\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Russo, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 1177), \u201c \u2018Do you think we need an attorney?\u2019 \u201d and \u201c T guess we need a lawyer\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Zolnay) </em>(hereafter <em>Zolnay) </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 729, 735-736 [125 Cal.Rptr. 798, 542 P.2d 1390]), \u201c \u2018Well, maybe I should talk to my attorney, Mr. Corbin\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Munoz </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 993, 995 [148 Cal.Rptr. 165]), and \u201c \u2018Tell me the truth, wouldn\u2019t it be best if I had an attorney with me?\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hinds, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.3d at p. 234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Yet we have found no case suggesting that a suspect\u2019s statement concerning the possible retention of a lawyer for <em>future </em>proceedings would require termination of a police interrogation. (See <em>Zolnay, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 736 [suspect\u2019s expressed need for attorney was \u201cimmediate,\u201d not merely \u201cin the future\u201d (italics omitted)].) In our view, the trial court properly deemed defendant\u2019s statement mere bragging about his ability to secure high priced legal representation for future proceedings, and not a request to consult with an attorney during the present interrogation. This interpretation of defendant\u2019s remarks is reinforced by his refusal or inability to give Officer McCarthy the name of his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Defendant\u2019s second remark, \u201cMaybe I ought to talk to a lawyer,\u201d is considerably more troublesome. The trial court ruled that the word \u201cmaybe\u201d rendered the statement equivocal, and that in context the reference to a lawyer was not intended as an invocation of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. Defendant\u2019s intent to continue the interview was confirmed by his failure to respond to McCarthy\u2019s immediate inquiry as to whether defendant wanted an attorney, and by defendant\u2019s subsequent request of McCarthy to \u201cTell me what you have and I might make you a proposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As previously indicated, the courts have found <em>Miranda </em>violations despite considerable equivocation by the defendant. We briefly review the apposite decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In <em>Zolnay, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at page 735, we observed that the suspect\u2019s question, \u201c \u2018Do you think we [referring to himself and a codefendant] need an attorney?\u2019\u201d and his statement, \u201cT guess we need a lawyer,\u2019\u201d were \u201ca direct result of the interrogation. The record discloses that the query interrupted the interrogation at a point when defendants\u2019 choice seemed all but limited to confession or silence. Moreover, defendants\u2019 subsequent specific request that the deputies recommend an attorney indicates both their continuing concern and their specific and pointed desire to consult counsel. We think the record discloses sufficient invocation of their right to remain silent.\u201d We stressed in <em>Zolnay (id. </em>at p. 736) that \u201c \u2018no particular form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>words or conduct is necessary\u2019 \u201d to invoke the self-incrimination privilege. (Quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Randall, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 955.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The present case is factually distinguishable from <em>Zolnay, supra, </em>in several respects. Initially, on this record it is highly unlikely that defendant\u2019s reference to an attorney disclosed his confusion or uncertainty about continuing the interview. A reading of Officer McCarthy\u2019s notes of the interrogation reveals that from start to finish defendant maintained a confident, \u201ccocky\u201d attitude, verbally sparring with the officer, expressing doubts about the strength or admissibility of the evidence against him, negotiating with McCarthy for a possible reduced sentence, and bragging about his good looks, his various girlfriends, his ability to produce an alibi for \u201cany date you want,\u201d and his mother\u2019s ability to hire an expensive lawyer. As McCarthy noted, defendant appeared to \u201calmost relish[] his role as the focus of our attention . . . .\u201d Unlike the situation in <em>Zolnay, supra, </em>defendant never asked the deputies to recommend an attorney, and he declined to respond to McCarthy\u2019s attempts to learn his lawyer\u2019s name or to determine whether he in fact truly wanted to speak to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Munoz, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d 993, the officers took a robbery suspect to an interview room and began to interrogate him. As soon as the interrogating officer introduced himself, the suspect stated, \u201cWell, maybe I should talk to my attorney, Mr. Corbin.\u201d Rather than terminate the interview, the officer agreed that the suspect could talk to his attorney, but first the officer wanted to explain what information he had, and what he needed to learn. Eventually, the suspect confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The <em>Munoz </em>court, citing our <em>Zolnay </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 729, held that the continued interrogation was improper. The court noted that although the suspect\u2019s remark was \u201cambiguous,\u201d it could be construed \u201cas an invocation of his right to speak to an attorney before questioning.\u201d (83 Cal.App.3d at p. 996.) The court also relied on the fact that the suspect had mentioned his attorney <em>by name, </em>indicating he already had retained counsel. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hinds, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.3d 222, a murder suspect was arrested and interrogated after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The suspect asked the officer, \u201c \u2018Tell me the truth, wouldn\u2019t it be best if I had an attorney with me?\u2019 \u201d Rather than stop the interrogation, the officer indicated to the suspect that although this matter was for him to decide, the attorney \u201cwould not be the one going to jail, possibly facing \u2018first degree murder, special circumstances and the death penalty. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 231.) Eventually, the suspect admitted the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The <em>Hinds </em>court, explaining that \u201c \u2018Ambiguous statements are to be construed as invocations . . . ,\u2019\u201d found that the suspect\u2019s initial inquiry was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>sufficient to invoke his right to counsel. (154 Cal.App.3d at p. 235, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Duran </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 485, 492 [189 Cal.Rptr. 595].) <em>Hinds </em>likewise is factually distinguishable, however, for the interrogating officer in that case, rather than attempt to clarify the suspect\u2019s ambiguous remark, improperly tried to dissuade him from terminating the interview. (See 154 Cal.App.3d at p. 235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Bestelmeyer, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d 520, 527-528, seems more closely on point. There, after the suspect was arrested for molesting his stepdaughter, the arresting officer gave <em>Miranda </em>warnings and commenced an interview. At the outset, after being told he could terminate the interview at any time, the suspect was asked by one officer what he was thinking. The suspect replied, \u201c T was just thinkin\u2019, maybe I shouldn\u2019t say anything without a lawyer and then I thinkin\u2019 ahh.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 524.) The officer continued explaining to the suspect that he could waive his rights, agree to talk to the officers, and then reinvoke his rights and stop talking to them. The suspect made no further references to an attorney, and eventually he made incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The <em>Bestelmeyer </em>court found that the suspect\u2019s initial remark was too ambiguous to amount to an invocation of his right to the presence of counsel, and that substantial evidence supported the lower court\u2019s finding that the suspect knowingly waived that right. (166 Cal.App.3d at pp. 527-528.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Turning to the present case, we think that in light of the whole record, including defendant\u2019s overall conduct and demeanor during the interrogation, the ambiguous and tentative nature of his reference to an attorney, Officer McCarthy\u2019s immediate attempt to clarify defendant\u2019s remark, and defendant\u2019s refusal to respond thereto, there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant did not invoke his right to counsel. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to determine whether the asserted <em>Miranda </em>error was prejudicial. (See pt. III. C.4.d., <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">c. <em>The \u201coff-the-record\u201d request</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">As noted above, at one point in the March 28 interview, after Officer McCarthy had assured defendant that he was not \u201cbluffing\" about charging defendant with murder, defendant abruptly stated, \u201cThis is off the record.\u201d McCarthy replied, \u201cYou\u2019re doing all the talking, don\u2019t let me stop you, go ahead.\u201d Defendant thereupon asked McCarthy, \u201cCan you get me 10 years?\u201d The ensuing discussion concerned possible penalties that might be imposed. (All of these \u201csentencing\u201d discussions were excluded at trial.) Soon thereafter, defendant asked McCarthy, \u201cTell me what you have and I might make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>you a proposition.\u201d After McCarthy falsely told defendant that McCarthy knew that defendant had pawned some of the victims\u2019 jewelry, and that victim Holmes had identified defendant before she died, defendant stated that his name was not on any pawn slip, that it would be his word against the pawnshop owner, and that a dying declaration from victim Holmes \u201cwould convict me of killing her . . . but not [victim Castro], but it\u2019s close in time, but I am not saying I did it. [\u00b6] . . .1 probably did do it, but you are not going to get me to say I did do it.\u201d (This latter statement was introduced at trial.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Immediately thereafter, defendant again said, \u201cThis is off the record,\u201d and McCarthy told him to go ahead. Defendant then directed McCarthy to go to the district attorney and \u201cget me ten straight. . . years, and I will give you something you want.\u201d The remaining discussion concerned possible arrangements for reduced sentences in return for defendant\u2019s statement about the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The trial court found that defendant\u2019s \u201coff the record\u201d requests pertained only to the sentencing and plea bargain discussions which immediately followed those requests, and that accordingly any statements not pertaining to sentencing were admissible. The court ruled that only the sentencing discussions would be inadmissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Defendant contends that all statements following his initial \u201coff-the-record\u201d request should have been suppressed, because McCarthy never informed him that the interview was no longer \u201coff the record.\u201d He cites no cases imposing such a rigid requirement, and we have found none so holding. The main inquiry should be whether defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent. Here, the trial court found the waiver remained valid as to discussions not involving sentencing. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 604, 629-630 [247 Cal.Rptr. 573, 754 P.2d 1070] [suspect\u2019s refusal to discuss certain subjects not conclusive indication of intent to terminate interrogation]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 780, 784-786 [214 Cal.Rptr. 652, 699 P.2d 1259] [defendant\u2019s expressed reluctance to discuss \u201cdetails\u201d of confession did not invoke <em>Miranda </em>right to silence]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 814-817 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436] [\u201coff-the-record\u201d request does not render volunteered statements inadmissible].) We find the record amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding. It seems unlikely defendant would have repeated his \u201coff-the-record\u201d request if he had intended or assumed the proceedings remained off the record following his initial request.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">It could be argued that defendant\u2019s request that the interview proceed \u201coff the record\u201d disclosed his confusion about the admissibility of his statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>to the officers, thereby vitiating the <em>Miranda </em>waiver. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Braeseke, supra, 25 </em>Cal.3d at pages 702-703, we held that a defendant\u2019s \u201coff-the-record\u201d request, acceded to by the officers, was inconsistent with a knowing waiver of self-incrimination rights. As we stated in that case, \u201cdefendant\u2019s request revealed a marked lack of understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. [Citation and fn. omitted.].\u201d (See also <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1969) 419 F.2d 1161, 1168-1169 [136 App.D.C. 180] [officers\u2019 obligation to clarify the defendant\u2019s misconception regarding admissibility of oral admissions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>Braeseke, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 691, is distinguishable, however, because there the trial court permitted admission of the defendant\u2019s statements despite his request for \u201coff-the-record treatment.\u201d In the present case,' as we have indicated, the trial court <em>excluded </em>those statements regarding possible sentencing to which the off-the-record request was directed. Moreover, it is arguable that an \u201coff-the-record\u201d request no longer necessarily demonstrates confusion on the defendant\u2019s part because, following <em>Braeseke, </em>such a request effectively insulates the affected portion of the interview from subsequent courtroom use. As with defendant\u2019s statement that \u201cmaybe I ought to talk to a lawyer,\u201d because we find no <em>Miranda </em>violation in connection with defendant\u2019s \u201coff the record\u201d remark, it is unnecessary to determine the prejudicial effect of such error. Nonetheless, because it seems apparent that no prejudice resulted from any such violation, we address that subject briefly, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">d. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The principal inculpatory statement made by defendant after he indicated he \u201cmaybe\u201d needed counsel and requested \u201coff-the-record\u201d treatment was his statement that \u201cI probably did do it [kill victim Castro], but you are not going to get me to say I did do it.\u201d The prosecutor emphasized this statement in his closing argument to the jury. The statement, though somewhat softened by the word \u201cprobably,\u201d nonetheless reasonably could be viewed as a confession or admission of guilt. We note, however, that (as disclosed to the jury) during the same interview defendant repeatedly denied his guilt of either murder. In context, the jury could have viewed defendant\u2019s \u201cprobably guilty\u201d remark as more of a taunt to the interrogating officer than an outright admission of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Under federal law, the test of prejudice for admitting a <em>coerced </em>confession is the <em>Chapman </em>test, requiring reversal unless the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279, 309 [113 L.Ed.2d 302, 331-332, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1265]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) Presumably, the federal courts would apply the same test to a confession adduced in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Similarly, under state law, we recently rejected a per se reversible error standard for coerced confessions, concluding that a conviction may be affirmed despite the erroneous admission of an involuntary confession, when the record shows that the admission of the confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 509-510 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037].)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Was any <em>Miranda </em>error in this case harmless beyond a reasonable doubt? On this record, we believe it was. Defendant, before suggesting that he \u201cmaybe\u201d should see his lawyer, and before asking to go \u201coff the record,\u201d admitted to Officer McCarthy that he knew Castro and had visited her on or about the night of the murders. According to defendant, on the last such visit, he drove Castro\u2019s children to a babysitter, ate dinner with her, had \u201csex\u201d with her and drank with her until she became intoxicated and fell asleep. Her mother, victim Holmes, called from downstairs to inquire of Castro, and defendant told her Castro was asleep. All this evidence of defendant\u2019s involvement with the two victims on or about the night they were murdered was seemingly untainted by defendant\u2019s subsequent claimed invocations of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In addition, defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Roshaun Fuller, testified at trial that defendant had admitted to her that he \u201cknocked out\u201d victim Castro, \u201chit\u201d victim Holmes on the back of her head, and thereafter stole $200 and a ziploc bag of heavy gold jewelry from them. Other witnesses placed defendant with Castro on or about the night of the murders, and later observed him wearing expensive gold jewelry and new clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Significantly, other than pointing to flaws and inconsistencies in witness Fuller\u2019s testimony, the defense failed to rebut the foregoing evidence or to raise any credible defenses to the murder charges. In light of the strong incriminating evidence that was properly admitted at trial, we conclude that admission of defendant\u2019s equivocal statement that he \u201cprobably did it\u201d was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">D. <em>Testimony of Denise Lancaster</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Defendant contends the court erred in allowing witness Denise Lancaster to testify at the guilt phase that defendant had threatened to kill her and had told her he had killed before. At an <em>in limine </em>hearing, Lancaster testified she had picked up defendant in March 1986 while he was hitchhiking. (The charged murders occurred in January 1986.) He raped her, threatened to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>her, and told her he had killed before. The court ruled that Lancaster could not testify concerning the rape, but could relate the other statements. At trial, she did so, referring to the rape as a \u201cphysical confrontation\u201d with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Defendant asserts Lancaster\u2019s testimony that he had killed before was irrelevant because the statement was not linked to the charged murders. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 408, 417, 428 [221 Cal.Rptr. 902, 710 P.2d 981] [defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cYeah, [I\u2019ve had my fun,] and I\u2019ll kill a lot more, too, and you may be first on my list,\u201d held admissible because in context it \u201crequired no speculation to connect it to the [pending murder charges]\u201d.) Defendant suggests that admissions of prior criminal conduct unrelated to the charged offense are inadmissible at the guilt phase, being essentially character evidence barred by Evidence Code section 1102, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We think that defendant\u2019s admission of a prior killing or killings, made soon after the charged murders were committed, was relevant to the ultimate question of defendant\u2019s guilt. The. jury was entitled to infer that defendant was referring to the killing of Castro and Holmes. The fact that he could have been referring to an unrelated killing goes more to the weight of his statement than to its admissibility. Moreover, in light of the other evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, outlined above, any error in admitting Lancaster\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s admission of a prior killing was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We note that defendant does not argue the inadmissibility of Lancaster\u2019s recital of defendant\u2019s threat to kill her. Although this evidence seemingly would have little relevance to the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt, it is at least arguable the threat confirmed defendant\u2019s intent or state of mind to kill those who opposed him. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lang, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 1013-1016.) In any event, any error in admitting the statement was undoubtedly harmless in light of the remaining evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">E. <em>Ineffective Counsel Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">As previously noted, victim Castro was strangled with a wire wrapped around her neck. The wire was examined by a prosecution expert, Mario Soto, who testified at trial the wire was a telephone cord that had been cut, rather than tom, from the wall. According to Soto, prior to forming the foregoing conclusion, he purchased some telephone wire and tried cutting and breaking it to duplicate the ends of the wire found around Castro\u2019s neck. The cut wire more closely resembled the wire found at the scene. Defense counsel made no objection to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Defendant now contends counsel was ineffective in failing to object to Soto\u2019s testimony on the ground that no proper foundation was laid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>support his out-of-court \u201cexperiment\" with the wire. Defendant asserts that the People failed to establish the wire used by Soto was sufficiently similar to the wire found wrapped around Castro\u2019s neck. (See <em>DiRosario </em>v. <em>Havens </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1224, 1231 [242 Cal.Rptr. 423] [experiment results inadmissible unless conditions substantially identical to prior event]; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Barker Brothers Corp. </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 530, 537 [73 Cal.Rptr. 284] [same].) Defendant suggests the omission was prejudicial because Soto\u2019s testimony helped establish the People\u2019s theory of intentional, premeditated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On the present record, we find no basis for concluding that counsel\u2019s failure to object reflected his incompetence. As a general rule, failure to object to specific items of evidence \u201cinvolves tactical decisions on counsel\u2019s part and seldom establishes counsel\u2019s incompetence. [Citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 292.) In the present case, it is possible that counsel deemed it tactically unwise to object to Soto\u2019s testimony. Indeed, it is conceivable that counsel investigated the matter and learned that Soto indeed used similar wire in his experiment. Accordingly, we need not resolve the question whether counsel\u2019s omission prejudiced defendant in light of the other evidence of his premeditation. Under such circumstances, the incompetence claim must be denied. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425-426 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">F. <em>Evidence and Instructions Relating to Burglary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">As previously indicated, the jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first degree murder. The murder charges against defendant alleged both premeditated murder and felony murder. To establish the latter, the People attempted to prove defendant committed an underlying burglary (\u00a7 459), based in part on his possession of jewelry recently stolen from the victims. (The People also attempted to prove an underlying rape was committed [\u00a7 261], as discussed <em>post, </em>pt. III. G.) Objecting to any instructions on the offense of burglary, the defense noted the absence of evidence indicating defendant entered the victim\u2019s home with the intent to steal the jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The trial court nonetheless instructed the jury regarding the crime of burglary, and additionally instructed, based on CALJIC No. 2.15 (5th ed. 1988), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u201cConscious possession of recently stolen property is not in and of itself sufficient to permit an inference that the defendant committed the crime of burglary. Before guilt may be inferred, there must be corroborating evidence tending to prove defendant\u2019s guilt. However, this evidence need only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>slight, and need not in and of itself be sufficient to warrant an inference of guilt. [\u00b6] As corroboration you may consider the attributes of possession\u2014 time, place and manner, that the defendant had an opportunity to commit the crime charged, the defendant\u2019s conduct, his false or contradictory statements, if any, or other statements he may have made with reference to the property, and any other evidence which tends to connect the defendant with the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Defendant now raises a variety of claims of error arising from giving the foregoing instruction. We find no merit in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">1. <em>Evidence of burglary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">First, defendant asserts the instruction was improper because there was insufficient evidence a burglary had in fact occurred. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 40 [249 Cal-Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843] [improper to give unqualified CALJIC No. 2.15 instruction where evidence relating to defendant\u2019s possession of stolen property is unclear].) He contends evidence was lacking regarding his intent to steal at the time he entered the victims\u2019 home. (See \u00a7 459.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Examination of the record indicates there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of a burglary, and of defendant\u2019s intent to steal the victims\u2019 jewelry when he entered the victims\u2019 home. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Earl </em>(1973) 29 Cal.App.3d 894, 896-898 [105 Cal.Rptr. 831] [circumstantial evidence routinely used to establish intent to steal].) Defendant admitted to the officers he was aware the victims possessed gold jewelry, and also that he was present at their home on or about the date of the murders. Substantial amounts of gold jewelry were missing from the premises. Defendant was later seen wearing gold rings, bracelets and necklaces, and was also seen pawning some gold jewelry (although this jewelry could not be positively traced to the victims). He told Roshaun Fuller that he assaulted and \u201crobbed\u201d both victims after ransacking their rooms and taking their jewelry. He also told Fuller that he made his living by taking property from women. Additionally, he told an acquaintance, Constance Smith, prior to the murders that he was not romantically interested in victim Castro, but simply looked on her as someone from whom he could obtain money.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We conclude that, in light of the foregoing record, there was sufficient evidence of a burglary, including a preexisting intent to steal. Accordingly, the court did not err in giving CALJIC No. 2.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">2. <em>Evidence of possession of stolen jewelry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">As previously noted, under <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>46 Cal. 3d at page 40, an unqualified instruction based on CALJIC No. 2.15 should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>given if the defendant\u2019s possession of the stolen property is unclear or in dispute. (See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bamberger </em>(3d Cir. 1972) 456 F.2d 1119, 1134.) Defendant asserts that the prosecution introduced no evidence establishing that he possessed any of the victims\u2019 jewelry. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Several witnesses described in detail various items of the victims\u2019 missing jewelry, including a large \u201ccoin-type\u201d medallion worn by victim Holmes. Witness Constance Smith testified that this medallion could have been the same one she saw defendant wearing following the murders. As previously noted, defendant was seen wearing gold rings, bracelets and necklaces, and was also seen pawning some gold jewelry. He told Roshaun Fuller that he assaulted and \u201crobbed\u201d both victims after ransacking their rooms and taking their jewelry. We conclude the record contains sufficient evidence of possession of stolen property to justify the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">3. <em>Presumption of burglary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Defendant asserts that CALJIC No. 2.15 created ah improper <em>presumption </em>of burglary arising from the mere fact of possession of stolen property. But the instruction does not so state. Indeed, it relates a contrary proposition: a burglary may not be presumed from mere possession unless the commission of the offense is corroborated. (Defendant suggests the instruction allows corroboration merely by evidence of the charged offense of <em>murder, </em>but we think it clear that, read in context, the instruction requires corroboration of the underlying burglary, and not the murder itself.) Moreover, as the People observe, the ultimate question whether or not a burglary \"occurred, and the subsidiary question whether defendant possessed the requisite preexisting intent to steal, were left to the jury through the usual instructions regarding the elements of that offense. Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s assumption, CALJIC No. 2.15 did not remove the issue of intent from the jury\u2019s consideration. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Figueroa </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 714, 725-727 [224 Cal.Rptr. 719, 715 P.2d 680]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 414, 422, 426-431 [258 Cal.Rptr. 482] [upholding validity of CALJIC No. 2.15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Defendant nonetheless contends that CALJIC No. 2.15 is a \u201cpermissive presumption\u201d of a kind justified only if the evidence is \u201csufficient for a rational juror to find the inferred fact beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\u201d <em>(Barnes </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 837, 843 [37 L.Ed.2d 380, 386, 93 S.Ct. 2357].) Defendant further notes that constitutional principles require a rational connection between the proved facts and the presumed fact. (E.g., <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 140, 157 [60 L.Ed.2d <em>111, </em>792, 99 S.Ct. 2213]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Roder </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 491, 497-499 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>[189 Cal.Rptr. 501, 658 P.2d 1302].) Assuming the challenged instruction amounts to a presumption of burglary based on defendant\u2019s possession of recently stolen property, we think the evidence summarized above (see pt. F.l. and F.2., <em>ante) </em>amply meets the standard set forth in <em>Barnes </em>and <em>Ulster. </em>Similarly, for the reasons above set forth, we must reject defendant\u2019s related contention that his murder convictions must be reversed on the ground of insufficient evidence of burglary as the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Having concluded that the court did not err in giving CALJIC No. 2.15, we need not address defendant\u2019s further contentions that the purported error was reversible per se, and that the error cannot be rendered harmless by reliance on the prosecution\u2019s alternative theories of premeditated murder or rape/murder (see <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1991) 502 U.S._[116 L.Ed.2d 371, 382-383, 112 S.Ct. 466, 474]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116, 1129-1130 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45]).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">G. <em>Evidence of Rape</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">As previously indicated, the People, in attempting to prove that defendant committed first degree murder as to both victims, relied on both a premeditated-murder theory and a felony-murder theory. The latter theory was based on defendant\u2019s commission of the underlying offenses of burglary (previously discussed, <em>ante, </em>pt. III. F.) and rape or attempted rape.  Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence of rape or attempted rape to support a felony-murder finding as to victim Holmes. Consistent with our prior holdings, we agree. We also conclude, however, that the insufficiency as to the rape/murder theory was harmless in light of the valid alternative theories of premeditated murder and burglary/murder that were presented to the jury with respect to both victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">To determine sufficiency of the evidence, we must inquire whether a rational trier of fact could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In this process we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and presume in favor of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. To be sufficient, evidence of each of the essential elements of the crime must be substantial and we must resolve the question of sufficiency in light of the record as a whole. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576-578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255]; see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573, 99 S.Ct. 2781].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The People relied on the following evidence to support a felony-murder (rape or attempted rape) theory as to victim Holmes:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Defendant admitted to police that on or about the night of the murders, he visited the home of victims Holmes and Castro, encouraged Castro to drink to the state of intoxication, and then had \u201csex\u201d with her. During police interrogation, although the officers had not accused defendant of raping either victim, and indeed had not even mentioned that offense, defendant, in the course of evaluating the evidence against him, made the observation that \u201crape is hard to prove because it [the inquiry] is if she gave up the pussy or didn\u2019t she.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Some physical evidence indicated that victim Holmes may have been sexually assaulted in the course of her murder. Her body was dressed only in a sweatshirt and bra; she was wearing nothing from the waist down. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 334, 367 [279 Cal.Rptr. 780, 807 P.2d 1009] [corpus delicti of rape inferred from evidence of murder in remote locale coupled with unclothed condition of body].) The officers found a pair of pantyhose on the floor of her room. Holmes had been beaten severely; blood was found on the floor, sofa cushions and loveseat in that room. This evidence supported the prosecution\u2019s theory that any sexual activity was nonconsensual. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Defendant correctly observes that no evidence was introduced to indicate any sexual trauma, seminal traces or other evidence of penetration, forced or otherwise, as to victim Holmes. The People argue, however, that a felony-murder charge could be sustained on a finding of <em>attempted </em>rape, and the jury was so instructed. (See \u00a7 189; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hillery </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 692, 704-705 [44 Cal.Rptr. 30, 401 P.2d 382] [evidence of trauma to genitals unnecessary to establish attempted rape]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 367, 405 [276 Cal.Rptr. 731, 802 P.2d 221] [lack of evidence of penetration not fatal to felony-murder/rape special-circumstance finding sustainable on proof of attempted rape].)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">But other than the inference that defendant may have raped victim <em>Castro, </em>the only evidence of his rape or attempted rape of victim <em>Holmes </em>was \u2018her partly unclothed body. Defendant cites prior cases of this court to support his position that the unclothed or partly clothed condition of the victim\u2019s body is insufficient to establish an actual or attempted sex offense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15, 34-36 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942] [insufficient evidence of intent to commit lewd act under \u00a7 288]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Craig </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 313, 318-319 [316 P.2d 947] [insufficient evidence of specific intent to commit rape or attempted rape]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Granados </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 490, 497 [319 P.2d 346] [victim found in bloodstained room with skirt pulled up and genitals exposed, but no evidence of spermatozoa or genital trauma\u2014held insufficient to establish felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>murder based on commission of lewd act].) These cases are indeed close on point, though factually distinguishable in some respects. Inexplicably, the Attorney General fails to address, or even cite, these cases in his respondent\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In <em>Craig, </em>the defendant, earlier in the evening, had expressed his general desire to \u201chave a little loving,\u201d and he subsequently quarrelled with a woman in a bar (not the victim) who refused to dance with him. Later that night, he attacked and killed the victim by strangling her and by beating her 20 to 80 times. The victim\u2019s body was found in a service station, lying beneath a jacked-up automobile. She had apparently been dragged across the ground about 25 feet, and 2 nearby cars were spattered with blood. She was wearing a raincoat over a nightgown and panties. Her raincoat had been ripped open, and her nightgown and panties were likewise tom so that the \u201cfront part of the body was exposed.\u201d (49 Cal.2d at p. 316.) Her panties were torn open and were \u201cunder her.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>She was found lying on her back with her legs slightly spread, and had suffered multiple contusions and lacerations of her face, breasts, neck and lower abdomen. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>A </em>divided court (four to three; maj. opn. by Carter, J.; dis. opn. by Spence, J.) held that because of the lack of evidence of the defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit rape, such as blood on the fly qf his trousers or any other evidence that a sexual act or attempt took place, felony-murder-rape charges could not be sustained and, accordingly, the court modified the judgment to second degree murder. (The court had also found the evidence insufficient to show a premeditated murder.) The majority stressed that although the defendant\u2019s clothing was generally spattered with blood, no blood was found on the front of his trousers, fly or undershorts, making it unlikely a sex act was accomplished or even attempted. The open position of the victim\u2019s legs \u201closes significance when it is recalled that the body had been dragged some 20 to 25 feet.\u201d (49 Cal.2d at p. 319.) The <em>Craig </em>dissent would have found substantial evidence that the murder was committed in an attempt to commit rape. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 321-322 (dis. opn. of Spence, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 15, the defendant had repeatedly stabbed the 10-year-old female victim. More than 60 wounds were inflicted, extending over her entire body, including vaginal lacerations. No evidence of spermatozoa was found. The victim\u2019s naked body was found under a pile of boxes and blankets; her bloodstained and shredded dress was found under her bed. The crotch had been ripped out of her blood-soaked panties. Only defendant\u2019s socks and shorts were bloodstained, suggesting he was only partly clothed during the attack. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 20-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Craig, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 313, a divided court (four to three; maj. opn. by Tobriner, J.; dis. opns. by Burke and Sullivan, JJ.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>modified a first degree murder judgment to second degree murder, holding that the foregoing evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding of the defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit a lewd act under section 288, as required to invoke the felony-murder doctrine. (70 Cal.2d at pp. 34-36.) The <em>Anderson </em>majority concluded that insufficient evidence was introduced to show the defendant\u2019s sexual intent; the location of the victim\u2019s wounds bore little relevance to that issue. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 35.) The court also found the evidence was insufficient to establish premeditated murder. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 24-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We have cited both <em>Craig, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 313, and <em>Anderson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 15, with apparent approval in subsequent cases determining the sufficiency of the evidence of sexual offenses underlying a felony-murder charge. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 526-527 [7 Cal.Rptr. 2d 199, 828 P.2d 101] [citing, but distinguishing, <em>Craig]', People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 315, 347 [253 Cal.Rptr. 199, 763 P.2d 1289] [citing, but distinguishing, both <em>Craig </em>and <em>Anderson].) </em>Assuming that <em>Craig </em>and <em>Anderson </em>correctly state the law (and the Attorney General does not contend otherwise), they would appear to be controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">There are, of course, some factual distinctions between those cases and the present one. Here, unlike <em>Craig, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 313, we are not faced with any circumstances (such as the lack of blood on defendant Craig\u2019s trousers) inconsistent with a finding that defendant raped, or attempted to rape, victim Holmes. Nor can her partly clothed state be attributed to being dragged from place to place, as in <em>Craig. </em>Moreover, unlike the situation in <em>Anderson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 15, defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit rape possibly could be inferred from the fact he earlier had sex with Holmes\u2019s daughter, Castro.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">But <em>Anderson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 15, appears to hold that the victim\u2019s lack of clothing, even when coupled with evidence indicating the defendant was nearly naked during the attack, is insufficient to establish specific sexual intent. We have found no cases holding otherwise. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at page 367, cited by the People herein, we held that the corpus delicti of rape could be inferred from the fact that the young female victim\u2019s body was found unclothed in a remote location. We stressed, however, that the corpus delicti requirement could be satisfied by only a \u201c \u2018slight or prima facie\u2019 showing. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 368.) As we explained above, more than a mere \u201cprima facie\u201d showing is required to sustain a finding of rape or attempted rape on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Other than victim Holmes\u2019s partly clothed body, there was no evidence of a sexual assault on her. We conclude that, under <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Craig, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>evidence was insufficient to support a finding of first degree murder based on rape or attempted rape of victim Holmes. Does the insufficiency of evidence require reversal of the judgment? As we explained in part III. F., <em>ante, </em>the prosecution\u2019s felony-murder theory soundly rested on proof that both murders occurred during the course of a <em>burglary. </em>Moreover, defendant has not challenged the legal or evidentiary support for the prosecution\u2019s <em>premeditated </em>murder theory. Finally, the record shows that in closing argument the prosecutor conceded to the jury that \u201cThis [Holmes\u2019s murder] was probably not a felony murder during the course of a rape,\u201d but instead was premeditated murder. Defense counsel gratefully exploited the concession in his own closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Accordingly, we may apply the rule that if one of the prosecution\u2019s alternative theories of criminal liability is found unsupported by the evidence, the judgment of conviction may rest on any legally sufficient theory unaffected by the error, unless the record affirmatively demonstrates that the jury relied on the unsupported ground. (See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>502 U.S. _ [116 L.Ed.2d 371, 372-373, 112 S.Ct. 466, 474]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 1129-1130.) Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the insufficiency of evidence supporting a rape/ murder theory as to victim Holmes was harmless under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">H. <em>Sua Sponte Instruction on Provocation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Defendant next contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct sua sponte, based on CALJIC No. 8.73, that the jury, in deciding whether defendant could be found guilty of second degree murder of victim Castro, could consider evidence of any provocation that played a part in inducing the homicide, even if that evidence was insufficient to reduce the offense to manslaughter. The record discloses that the court instructed the jurors generally on the subject of second degree murder, telling them that such a finding would be appropriate if the killing was intentional, and was committed with malice aforethought, but was neither premeditated nor deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">At counsel\u2019s request, the court also instructed that provocation could reduce the offense involving victim Castro to <em>voluntary manslaughter. </em>(The court found no substantial evidence of provocation as to victim Holmes, and declined to so instruct as to her death.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">As defendant observes, a sua sponte instruction on provocation and second degree murder must be given \u201cwhere the evidence of provocation would justify a jury determination that the accused had formed the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>kill as a direct response to the provocation and had acted immediately\u201d to carry it out. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 329 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311].) <em>Wickersham </em>noted that \u201cthe fact that heated words were exchanged or a physical struggle took place between the victim and the accused before the fatality may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt\u201d as to premeditation. <em>(Ibid.) </em> Defendant argues that because the trial court apparently found sufficient evidence to justify giving a provocation/ manslaughter instruction, then a fortiori there must have been enough evidence to instruct on second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The problem with defendant\u2019s analysis is that there was insufficient evidence of provocation to justify <em>any instructions </em>on that subject. Thus, the trial court\u2019s instruction on manslaughter was inappropriate and unnecessary, though obviously not prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Defendant introduced no evidence whatever to support a defense of provocation, or to indicate he was relying on one. Instead, he attempted to mount an <em>alibi </em>defense, to cast suspicion on another acquaintance of Castro, and to impeach witness Fuller\u2019s incriminating testimony. A provocation defense would have been inconsistent with the foregoing denial of guilt. Under such circumstances, no sua sponte instruction was required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 329; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 716 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Defendant observes, however, that at an in-chambers conference with the court at close of trial, his counsel indicated he would also rely on a provocation defense, a defense that the jury might accept despite rejecting the alibi defense. Counsel cited the testimony of interrogating officer McCarthy that, according to defendant, Castro first became intoxicated and then became emotional and upset, complaining about being mistreated by men, \u201chollering\u201d at defendant, and \u201cknocking things over,\u201d before finally going to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Significantly, nothing in the portion of defendant\u2019s statement that was summarized by the testifying officer indicated <em>any </em>relevant effect on defendant\u2019s state of mind resulting from Castro\u2019s words or actions. Indeed, according to his statement, defendant was <em>not </em>provoked into killing Castro. Thus, the foregoing evidence would have given the jury no basis whatever for concluding that defendant \u201cformed the intent to kill as a direct response\u201d to Castro\u2019s conduct as required by <em>Wickersham, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at page 329. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 211, and fn. 12 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949] [no evidentiary basis for believing jury might have found adequate provocation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The trial court likewise expressed its doubt that defendant\u2019s provocation evidence was \u201csubstantial\u201d enough to justify a provocation/manslaughter instruction but nonetheless indicated it would give the instruction (only as to Castro) to avoid possible reversal on appeal. The court cited a reference in prosecution witness Fuller\u2019s testimony to the effect that defendant told her he had become \u201cupset\u201d with Castro. In fact, Fuller testified that, according to defendant, Castro became intoxicated and <em>depressed, </em>and that defendant became \u201csick and tired of her . . . being depressed, so he hit her and knocked her out.\u201d We conclude that such meager evidence, suggesting passive conduct by Castro, and being contrary to defendant\u2019s own statement to the officers, would not be a sufficient basis for concluding that Castro actively provoked defendant into killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Defendant contends that because the trial court instructed on provocation/ manslaughter, there must have been evidence to support a provocation/ second degree murder theory. We have previously rejected similar contentions. (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Payton </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th <em>1050, 1061 [13 </em>Cal.Rptr.2d 526, 839 P.2d 1035]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pensinger </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1210, 1242 [278 Cal.Rptr. 640, 805 P.2d 899]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 157 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We conclude the trial court did not err in failing to instruct sua sponte on a provocation/second degree murder defense. In light of our conclusion, we need not consider whether defendant was prejudiced by the failure to instruct. We observe, however, that the evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding that both murders were premeditated, deliberate, and Unprovoked, being committed to facilitate a burglary of the victims\u2019 home, and to prevent them from identifying defendant as the burglar. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 247-248 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643] [finding evidence of premeditation based partly on victims\u2019 multiple stab wounds].)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">I. <em>Intent to Kill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862], we held that intent to kill was a necessary element of the felony-murder special circumstance, and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669] we extended the <em>Carlos </em>holding to the multiple-murder special circumstance. We overruled both <em>Carlos </em>and <em>Turner </em>in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306]. As to offenses committed after <em>Carlos </em>but before <em>Anderson, </em>however, due process and ex post facto principles demand that the intent-to-kill requirement apply to any felony-murder special circumstance charged in connection with such offenses. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fierro </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 227 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 955, 973, fn. 4 [281 Cal.Rptr. 273, 810 P.2d 131]; <em>In re Baert </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 514, 516-522 [252 Cal.Rptr. 418].) The offenses involved here occurred in January 1986, during the foregoing \u201cwindow period\u201d between <em>Carlos </em>and <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Presumably, the foregoing constitutional concerns would likewise apply to the multiple-murder special circumstance alleged here. The Attorney General does not contend otherwise.  Indeed, the People concede that <em>Carlos </em>error occurred here, and they contend that such error was harmless. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1100 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Odle </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 386, 414-415 [247 Cal.Rptr. 137, 754 P.2d 184].) <em>Odle </em>concluded that a harmless error analysis pursuant to <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at page 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pages 710-711], is appropriate and constitutionally permissible in cases involving failure to instruct on an element of a special circumstance. <em>Odle </em>reasoned that there is no constitutional right to a jury trial on the issue of a defendant\u2019s eligibility for the death penalty, an issue which, but for the mandate of a state statute, would be a sentencing issue. (45 Cal.3d at pp. 411-412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Although defendant asserts that <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 386, was incorrectly decided, we have repeatedly declined to reexamine our holding in that case. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1267 [275 Cal.Rptr. 729, 800 P.2d 1159]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 1100; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1302, and fn. 45, 1313-1314 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1] [acknowledging <em>Odle\u2019s </em>distinction between failure to instruct on element of an offense, and failure to instruct on element of a special circumstance allegation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Our review of the record confirms that the court indeed failed to instruct the jury that an intent to kill was a prerequisite to finding true the multiple-murder special circumstance. Moreover, we cannot necessarily infer such a finding from the jury\u2019s verdict or findings based on the court\u2019s other instructions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Duncan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 955, 973-974.) Although the jurors were instructed regarding premeditated murder and its intent element, they were also instructed on felony murder. Thus, although the issue of intent was not <em>entirely </em>removed from the jury\u2019s consideration (cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 986 F.2d 1267), its finding of first degree murder did not necessarily include a determination that defendant intended to kill both of his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">But as we explain, the evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to kill both victims was overwhelming, and the jury could have had no reasonable doubt on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>matter. As in <em>People </em>v. <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at page 416, \u201cthis is a case in which the facts overwhelmingly demonstrate that the instructional error was harmless.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 1100 [failure to instruct on intent to kill harmless where evidence of such intent overwhelming].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The dissent herein relies on <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 391 [114 L.Ed.2d 432, 111 S.Ct. 1884], disapproving language in an earlier case <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570, 579 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 471, 106 S.Ct. 3101]), relied on in part by <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pages 413 through 414. But <em>Yates\u2019 </em>s criticism of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>was made in the context of determining the proper harmless error standard for <em>rebuttable presumptions. </em>(See 500 U.S. at pp. 402-403, fit. 8 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 448].) <em>Yates </em>concerned the applicable harmless error test where the jury has been improperly instructed that an element of the offense (malice) could be <em>presumed </em>from certain facts (intentional commission of unlawful act, or use of a deadly weapon). Thus, if an intent to kill were an element of the offenses charged herein (rather than pertaining to the special circumstance finding), and if the jurors herein had been told that the defendant\u2019s intent to kill was <em>presumed </em>by reason of certain facts in the case, <em>Yates </em>would require the following showing in order to find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. 710-711]:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u201c[T]he issue under <em>Chapman </em>is whether the jury actually rested its verdict on evidence establishing the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt, independently of the presumption. Since that enquiry cannot be a subjective one into the jurors\u2019 minds, a court must approach it by asking whether the force of the evidence presumably considered by the jury in accordance with the instructions <em>is so overwhelming as to leave it beyond a reasonable doubt that the verdict resting on that evidence would have been the same in the absence of the presumption.\" </em>(500 U.S. at pp. 404-405 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 449, 111 S.Ct. at pp. 1893-1894], italics added; see also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1993) _ U.S. _ [124 L.Ed.2d 182, 188-189, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2081] <em>[Chapman </em>test requires finding jury\u2019s guilty verdict \u201csurely unattributable\u201d to error; faulty instructions on reasonable doubt deemed reversible per se].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In the present case, the jurors were not told to apply any improper presumptions as to the intent-to-kill issue. Accordingly, the test of <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>seemingly would be inapplicable here. But, as will appear, even were we to apply that test, we would conclude that the evidence before the jury was so overwhelming as to leave it beyond a reasonable doubt the verdict would have been the same had the jury been instructed regarding the necessity of finding an intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>We briefly review the evidence as it bore on the intent issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">1. <em>Victim Castro\u2019s murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Defendant strangled Castro to death with a telephone wire and set her room, and probably her body, afire. The method of execution itself precludes any inference the murder was accidental or unintentional. As we have repeatedly held, \u201cthis method of killing [strangulation] is indicative of at least a deliberate intent to kill. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 349.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The jury\u2019s first degree murder finding reflected the jury\u2019s determination that Castro\u2019s murder was either (1) premeditated, (2) committed in the course of a burglary, requiring a preexisting specific intent to steal, and/or (3) committed in the course of a rape. On this record, the only reasonable conclusion one can draw from the evidence and the jury\u2019s findings is that defendant intentionally murdered Castro to facilitate his escape and preclude his apprehension after raping her and/or stealing her jewelry. Defendant, relying on an alibi defense, introduced <em>no evidence </em>which would have justified a finding of unintentional homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">2. <em>Victim Holmes\u2019s murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">As for Holmes, defendant admitted that she became aware of his presence in the house with Castro on the night of the murders. According to witness Fuller, defendant admitted \u201chitting\u201d Holmes after she came upstairs to inquire about Castro, who was already unconscious from defendant\u2019s assault on her. The evidence shows that defendant stole Holmes\u2019s jewelry and beat her to death by kicking her 10 to 12 times in her face and head. As we have explained, there was no substantial evidence that Holmes provoked the assault. Once again, the methodical method of execution would preclude any inference the killing was accidental or unintentional. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 247 [multiple stab wounds consistent with finding of premeditated murder]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 350 [\u201ccalculated\u201d rather than \u201crandom\u201d method of killing may be indicative of premeditated murder]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at p. 27 [\u201cexacting\u201d manner of killing indicative of premeditated murder].) Again, the only reasonable conclusion the jury could have drawn was that defendant, after killing Castro, then killed Holmes to facilitate his escape and preclude his apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">We conclude that the error in failing to instruct on intent to kill with respect to Castro and Holmes was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Penalty Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">A. <em>Instruction on Witness\u2019s False Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">At the penalty phase, the court instructed the jury, based on CALJIC No. 2.21 (4th ed. 1979), that the testimony of a witness who makes a willfully false statement on a material point could be disregarded in its entirety, unless \u201cthe probability of truth favors his testimony in other particulars.\u201d Defendant contends such instruction, commonly used at the guilt phase to assist the jury in its fact-finding function (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Allison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 879, 895 [258 Cal.Rptr. 208, 771 P.2d 1294]), is inappropriate at the penalty phase because of the subjective, nonfactual nature of the jury\u2019s \u201cnormative\u201d penalty decision. Defendant notes the instruction refers to \u201cmaterial\u201d testimony, a description he suggests is inappropriate to much penalty phase testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Although we have found no cases expressly approving the use of the foregoing instruction at the penalty phase, one case implicitly recognizes that the instruction would be appropriate at both phases of a capital trial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1168, 1209 [240 Cal.Rptr. 666, 743 P.2d 301] [observing that witness credibility instructions, such as CALJIC No. 2.21, by their very terms are not specifically limited to the issue of guilt or innocence].) Such a conclusion seems reasonable, given the admissibility of penalty phase testimony on a variety of factual matters, including \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. (See \u00a7 190.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In the present case, the People presented an array of penalty-phase witnesses attesting to various prior violent acts by defendant. The defense likewise called witnesses to testify to factual matters, including additional facts to rebut the prosecution\u2019s \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, and testimony concerning defendant\u2019s childhood and background. We see no reason why an instruction based on CALJIC No. 2.21 should not be given to assist the jury in appraising the credibility of penalty phase testimony, where appropriate under the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">B. <em>Failure to Instruct on Elements of Other Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">At the penalty phase, the prosecutor introduced evidence of numerous prior unadjudicated offenses by defendant. (See \u00a7 190.3, subd. (b).) The record indicates that defense counsel joined the prosecutor in stipulating that, for tactical reasons, it was unnecessary to instruct the jury regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>elements of these various offenses. Defendant now claims the trial court nonetheless erred, under both federal and state law, in failing to so instruct sua sponte. The point is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">First, on this record, any error in failing to instruct regarding the elements of defendant\u2019s prior crimes would be deemed invited error. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 827-831 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865].) We reject defendant\u2019s related assertions that counsel\u2019s tactical decision to forgo detailed \u201cother crimes\u201d instructions (1) required defendant\u2019s personal waiver, or (2) amounted to incompetent representation. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 827-828 [no personal waiver required], 831-832 [counsel\u2019s waiver not incompetence]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Tuilaepa </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 569, 592 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 382, 842 P.2d 1142].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Second, we have held that, because defense counsel might not want the jury to place undue emphasis on the defendant\u2019s prior offenses, the court is not required to give such instructions sua sponte. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 72-73, fn. 25 [222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423].) Although defendant asks us to reconsider <em>Phillips, </em>we have frequently relied on its holding and see no reason for reconsideration. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Tuilaepa, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 592; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 206-207; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pensinger, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 1267; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 583, 627 [268 Cal.Rptr. 399, 789 P.2d 127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">C. <em>Failure to Instruct Sua Sponte on Use of \u201cOther Crimes\u201d Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Defendant contends the court erred in failing to instruct sua sponte (based on CALJIC No. 2.50) that the penalty phase jury should not use the \u201cinference of criminal propensity drawn from proof of one incident of unadjudicated conduct as proof of the truth of the allegations of another such incident.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 303, 317 [165 Cal.Rptr. 289, 611 P.2d 883]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a).) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Generally, the court owes no obligation to instruct on the limited purposes for which evidence of prior crimes is admissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Collie </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 43, 64 [177 Cal.Rptr. 458, 634 P.2d 534, 23 A.L.R.4th 776].) Defendant acknowledges the general rule, but argues that it should be inapplicable at the penalty phase of a capital case. In light of the instructions that were given here, we fail to discern a need for such a sua sponte instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">In the present case, the jury was told that (1) evidence of various specified criminal acts had been presented, (2) before the jury could use evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>any such offense as an aggravating circumstance, it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that such offense occurred, and (3) except for such offenses, the jury \u201cmay not consider any evidence of any other criminal acts as an aggravating circumstance.\u201d We think the foregoing instructions sufficed to inform the jury of its responsibility to differentiate between the various offenses. Under these instructions, no reasonable juror would have concluded that proof of one offense could assist in proving another offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We also reject defendant\u2019s related contention that counsel\u2019s failure to request a limiting instruction on the prior offenses reflected his incompetence. As previously indicated, counsel may have deemed it tactically unwise to call further attention to defendant\u2019s prior offenses .by requesting special instructions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 73, fn. 25; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pensinger, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 1267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">D. <em>Failure to Instruct Sua Sponte on Meaning of \u201cAggravating\" and \u201cMitigating\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Defendant asserts the court erred in failing to define the terms \u201caggravating\u201d and \u201cmitigating\u201d to assist the jury in determining penalty. We have held that the court need not give such instructions, even on defendant\u2019s request. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 55 [252 Cal.Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249].) It follows that no sua sponte instructions were required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">E. <em>Failure to Give Timely Notice of Aggravating Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Defendant contends the prosecutor delayed unduly in presenting the defense with the required notice of aggravating evidence the People intended to rely on during the penalty phase. (See \u00a7 190.3.) The record shows that the prosecutor initially filed such a notice on December 22, 1986. Defendant observes that this notice referred to nine prior unadjudicated offenses and four prior felony convictions. Thereafter, on June 2, 1987, after the case was assigned for trial but before jury selection, the People filed an \u201caddendum,\u201d adding 10 more incidents of prior criminal activity. On September 23, 1987, one week prior to commencement of jury selection, the People filed an \u201camended notice,\u201d adding 20 additional unadjudicated incidents, but referring to only 3 prior felony convictions. Finally, on September 25, the People submitted its \u201csecond amended notice,\u201d adding a reference to the fourth criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">According to defendant, the three notices filed after March 5, 1987, when the case was assigned from the master criminal calendar for trial, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>untimely. In addition, the People allegedly never gave notice of one incident presented at the penalty phase, namely, defendant\u2019s assault on an inmate, James Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The People are required to notify defendant of the intended penalty phase evidence \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time as determined by the trial court, prior to trial.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3.) We have held that the phrase \u201cprior to trial\u201d should be construed as \u201cbefore the cause is called for trial.\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 879 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].) <em>Daniels, </em>however, did not explain precisely when a case may be deemed \u201ccalled\" for trial. Although the Attorney General has not raised the point, it is arguable that a master calendar assignment should not be deemed \u201ccalling\u201d a case for trial. Here, all of the notices were filed prior to the commencement of jury selection, and defendant failed to request a continuance, thereby indicating that the timing of the notices was not prejudicial to the defense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 842; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 605, 637 [253 Cal.Rptr. 863, 765 P.2d 70].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In any event, the People observe that defendant failed to object to any of the notices at issue, or to object to any penalty phase evidence on the ground of untimeliness of the notice thereof, omissions which bar appellate consideration of the issue. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickey </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 685 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 842.) Defendant\u2019s suggestion that his counsel\u2019s failure to raise such objection or request a continuance reflected his incompetence is meritless in light of the possible tactical considerations involved in such a decision. Counsel may well have concluded that such an objection or request for continuance could only serve to alienate the trial court or jury without necessarily securing any advantage for his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">F. <em>Admission of Evidence Underlying Prior Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Defendant contends the court erred in allowing the admission of evidence regarding defendant\u2019s prior offenses (see \u00a7 190.3), including (1) evidence underlying a prior robbery conviction, and (2) evidence of two unadjudicated offenses on which the statute of limitations had run. Defendant realizes we have repeatedly rejected similar contentions (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 388 [barred offenses admissible at penalty phase]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 826, 877 [268 Cal.Rptr. 802, 789 P.2d 983] [evidence underlying prior conviction admissible at penalty phase]), and he offers no convincing reasons for reconsidering those rulings. Defendant\u2019s assertion that equal protection principles may preclude reliance on the foregoing evidence (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343 [243 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150]) is likewise without merit. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Danielson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 691, 719-720 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 838 P.2d 729]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 103, 136 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 335, 820 P.2d 559], on remand (1992) _ U.S. _ [121 L.Ed.2d 5, 113 S.Ct. 32].)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">G. <em>Failure to Instruct on Sentencing Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Defendant contends the court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole even if it found no mitigating evidence whatever. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Duncan, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 979 [jury may determine \u201ceven in the absence of mitigating evidence\u201d that the aggravating evidence is insubstantial].) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The jury was instructed that it should consider, take into account, and be guided by the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors; that the weighing process does not mean \u201ca mere mechanical counting of factors on each side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignment of weights to any of them\u201d; and that the jury is \u201cfree to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors . . . .\u201d The jury was further told to \u201cdetermine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the totality of the aggravating circumstances with the mitigating circumstances. ... To return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating circumstances are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it <em>[sic] </em>warrants death instead of life without parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">First, defendant does not suggest the foregoing instructions were incorrect, but only that they were inadequate. Yet defendant failed to request clarifying instructions, an omission which bars appellate review of the issue. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 153; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sully </em>(1991) 53 Cal.Sd 1195, 1218 [283 Cal.Rptr. 144, 812 P.2d 163].)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In any event, we believe the foregoing instruction adequately advised the jury of its sentencing responsibilities. No reasonable juror would assume he or she was required to impose death despite insubstantial aggravating circumstances, merely because no mitigating circumstances were found to exist. Indeed, it seems unlikely the jury would conclude that mitigating circumstances were entirely lacking in this case: the defense introduced substantial evidence in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">H. <em>Death Penalty Statute Not Unconstitutional</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Defendant asserts the 1978 death penalty law is unconstitutional in a number of respects. We have repeatedly rejected each of the arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>raised by defendant, and we need not discuss them here. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Tuilaepa, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 594-595; <em>People </em>v. <em>Danielson, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 691, 730-731, and cases cited; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 475 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">I. <em>Consideration of Additional \u201cOther Crimes\u201d Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">During the penalty phase, evidence was introduced, without objection by defendant, regarding certain prior criminal activity that did not qualify as aggravating evidence under section 190.3, subdivision (b). For example, mitigating \u201cbackground\u201d testimony by defendant and his relatives was rebutted on cross-examination by eliciting from these witnesses the fact that defendant had committed numerous burglaries before reaching age 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Because the foregoing evidence of defendant\u2019s juvenile burglaries was not admissible under section 190.3, the trial court instructed th\u00e9 jury that this evidence could be considered only in rebuttal of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence \u201cor as evidence of the absence of mitigating or extenuating circumstances raised by the defendant . . . .You may not consider evidence of such other criminal acts for any other purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Defendant first contends the foregoing instruction was too broad, permitting the jury to consider defendant\u2019s nonviolent misconduct even though it did not truly \u201crebut\u201d evidence of defendant\u2019s troubled childhood. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 792, fn. 24 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113] [scope of rebuttal must be specific; evidence must relate to particular incident or character trait relied on by defendant].) But the instruction correctly limited the jury\u2019s consideration to rebuttal evidence, leaving it to the jury (guided perhaps by counsel\u2019s closing arguments) to decide whether the proffered evidence indeed rebutted any evidence elicited by defendant. If defendant believed the instruction was unclear or incomplete, he had the obligation to request clarifying language. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sully, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1195, 1218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Next, defendant contends the instruction improperly allowed the jury to consider his juvenile burglaries as evidence of the absence of mitigating evidence, contrary to the rule in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 288-290 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861], <em>Davenport, </em>however, dealt with a different problem, namely, the impropriety of prosecutorial argument characterizing as an aggravating factor the absence of particular mitigating factors, such as the defendant\u2019s mental defect or disease. By its terms, the challenged instruction did not permit the jury to treat defendant\u2019s juvenile burglaries as a negative mitigating factor. Properly construed, thq challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>instruction simply would allow consideration of any evidence of defendant\u2019s prior criminal conduct that called in question the existence of a mitigating circumstance \u201craised by the defendant.\u201d Once again, defendant had the obligation to request any appropriate clarifying language. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sully, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In the present case, defendant does not suggest the prosecutor either committed <em>Davenport </em>error or urged the jury to use defendant\u2019s juvenile burglaries for any improper purpose. We conclude the court did not err in giving the challenged instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">J. <em>Ruling Denying Modification of Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">After the jury returned its death verdict, defendant moved the court to modify the sentence to life imprisonment without parole. The court denied the motion, stating in part that defendant\u2019s purported mitigating background and character evidence did not extenuate the gravity of the crime, and that \u201cany sympathetic or other aspect of defendant\u2019s character could not in any way be considered a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct, or serve as a basis for a sentence of less than death.\u201d The court also found that \u201cthere were no factors in mitigation,\u201d and that \u201cthe absence of these factors weighs against a finding the offense is . . . less serious than normal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Defendant contends the court\u2019s foregoing remarks indicate it erroneously (1) believed defendant had introduced no mitigating evidence in the case, and (2) failed to <em>consider </em>defendant\u2019s proffered mitigating evidence in ruling on the motion to modify sentence. We disagree. The court carefully outlined its obligation to consider all the evidence submitted to the jury, and expressly acknowledged that defendant had introduced \u201cbackground\u201d evidence intended to mitigate the offense, including the fact he was raised in a poor and culturally deprived environment. But the court determined that such evidence failed to extenuate or mitigate the sentence. Read in context, the court\u2019s words merely reflect its view that no <em>significant </em>mitigating evidence had been adduced, and that such evidence was insufficient to extenuate defendant\u2019s crime or justify a life sentence. We have frequently rejected claims of error based on similar remarks by trial courts in denying motions to modify sentence. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Stansbury </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 1017, 1070-1071 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 174, 846 P.2d 756]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 892-893; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaurish </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 648, 716-718 [276 Cal.Rptr. 788, 802 P.2d 278]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitt </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 620, 659-660 [274 Cal.Rptr. 252, 798 P.2d 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The judgment is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Panelli, J., Kennard, J., Arabian, J., Baxter, J., and George, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b89-6\">MOSK, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"ACS\">I concur in the affirmance of the judgment of guilt as to the murder of Luisa Anna Castro and Maria Victoria Holmes and the arson of their residence.

Or in still other words, the inquiry is \u201cwhether the . . . verdict [or finding] actually rendered in [the] trial was surely unattributable to the error.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">As a consequence, the focus under <em>Chapman </em>is <em>not </em>what a reviewing court might itself decide if it looked to the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">First, the reviewing court is not the proper decisionmaker. <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra,_U.S. at pp._-_[124 L.Ed.2d at pp. 188-190, 113 S.Ct. at pp. 2081-2082].) The <em>Yates </em>court disapproved as \u201cnot.. correct\u201d the \u201cstatement\u201d in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570, 579 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 471, 106 S.Ct. 3101] (sometimes hereafter <em>Clark), </em>that an error is harmless \u201c \u2018[w]here a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 402-403, fn. 8 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 448, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1892], quoting <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>478 U.S. at p. 579 [92 L.Ed.2d at p. 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-18\">Second, the reviewing court is not automatically entitled to consider the entire record. The <em>Yates </em>court rejected the broad \u201cassumption\u201d in various decisions, including <em>Clark </em>(which, however, it did not expressly cite on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>point), that the \u201charmlessness of an error is to be judged after a review of the entire record\u201d\u2014unless, that is, the \u201cjurors, as reasonable persons, would have considered the entire . . . record\" in spite of the error. <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 405-406 [114 L.Ed.2d at pp. 449-450, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1894].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">By its very terms, of course, <em>Chapman </em>precludes a court from finding harmlessness based simply \u201cupon [its own] view of \u2018overwhelming evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 23 [17 L.Ed.2d at p. 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Neither is the focus under <em>Chapman </em>what a reviewing court might conjecture the jury would have decided in the absence of the error. The \u201chypothetical inquiry\u201d whether, if the jury had not been exposed to the error, it would have made the decision it did \u201cis inconsistent with the harmless-error standard announced in <em>Chapman </em>.... While such a hypothetical inquiry ensures that the State has, in fact, proved [the fact in question] beyond a reasonable doubt, it does not ensure that it has proved [it] beyond a reasonable doubt <em>to the satisfaction of a jury.\u201d (Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 414 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 455, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1898], italics in original (conc. opn. of Scalia, J.); accord, <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra,_U.S. at pp._-_ [124 L.Ed.2d at pp. 188-190, 113 S.Ct. at pp. 2081-2082].) \u201cThe inquiry, in other words, is not whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict [or adverse finding] would surely have been rendered . . . .\u201d <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra,_U.S. at p._[124 L.Ed.2d at p. 189, 113 S.Ct. at p. 2081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Lastly, the focus under <em>Chapman </em>is <em>not </em>what a reviewing court might speculate concerning \u201cwhat effect the . . . error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury . . . <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra,_U.S. at p--[124 L.Ed.2d at p. 189, 113 S.Ct. at p. 2081].) \u201c[M]ore [is required] than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury\u2019s action . . .' .\" <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [124 L.Ed.2d at p. 190, 113 S.Ct. at p. 2082].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">In determining whether the trial court\u2019s omission of an instruction on intent to kill as an element of the multiple-murder special circumstance was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman, </em>we may look with profit to <em>Yates </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">The error reviewed therein involved an instruction incorporating a mandatory rebuttable presumption of malice for the crime of murder: \u201cMalice is . . . presumed\u201d both \u201cfrom the willful, deliberate, and intentional doing of an unlawful act without any just cause or excuse\u201d and \u201cfrom the use of a deadly weapon\"; but \u201cthat presumption is rebuttable, that is, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>conclusive . . . , but it is rebuttable by the rest of the evidence.\" (Quoted in <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 397 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 444, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1889].)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The <em>Yates </em>court established the following analysis for an erroneous instruction incorporating a mandatory rebuttable presumption of a necessary fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u201c[T]o say that an instruction to apply [such a] presumption did not contribute to the verdict is to make a judgment about the significance of the presumption to reasonable jurors, when measured against the other evidence considered by those jurors independently of the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201cBefore reaching such a judgment, a court must take two quite distinct steps. First, it must ask what evidence the jury actually considered in reaching its verdict. . . . Did the jury look at only the predicate facts, or did it consider other evidence bearing on the fact subject to the presumption?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u201cOnce a court has made the first enquiry into the evidence considered by the jury, it must then weigh the probative force of that evidence as against the probative force of the presumption standing alone. To satisfy <em>Chapman\u2019s </em>reasonable doubt standard, it will not be enough that the jury considered evidence from which it could have come to the verdict without reliance on the presumption. Rather, the issue under <em>Chapman </em>is whether the jury actually rested its verdict on evidence establishing the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt, independently of the presumption.\u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 404 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 449, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The <em>Yates </em>court went on to suggest an even more \u201crestrictive\u201d analysis for an erroneous instruction incorporating a mandatory <em>irrebuttable </em>or \u201cconclusive\u201d presumption of a necessary fact. <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 406, fn. 10 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 450, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1894].) Review of this sort, which the court expressly derived from Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 263 [105 L.Ed.2d 218, 109 S.Ct. 2419], \u201cwould focus only on the predicate facts to be relied on under the presumption and would require a court to determine whether they \u2018are so closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed that no rational jury could find those facts without also finding that ultimate fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 406, fn. 10 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 450, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1894], quoting <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 271 [105 L.Ed.2d at pp. 225-226] (conc. opn. of Scalia, J.).) This \u201cnarrow focus\u201d is appropriate \u201cbecause the terms of a conclusive presumption tend to deter a jury from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>considering any evidence for the presumed fact beyond the predicate evidence; indeed, to do so would be a waste of the jury\u2019s time and contrary to its instructions.\" <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 406, fn. 10 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 450, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1894].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">It follows that an analysis more restrictive still would be required for an erroneous instruction <em>omitting a necessary fact altogether.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Such an instruction removes the \u201cultimate fact\u201d from the jury\u2019s consideration without leaving behind any \u201cpredicate facts\u201d to be found. If a mandatory irrebuttable presumption \u201ctend[s] to deter a jury from considering any evidence for the presumed fact beyond the predicate evidence\u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 406, fn. 10 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 450, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1894]), an omission, by definition, withdraws the omitted fact entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u201cTherefore,\u201d reasoned the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 997 F.2d 1267, 1272 (sometimes hereafter Gaudin), rehearing en banc granted, 5 F.3d 374, \u201cit is apparent that when [a necessary fact] has been completely removed from the jury\u2019s determination, there can be no inquiry into what evidence the jury considered to establish that [fact], because the jury was precluded from considering the [fact] at all. The fact that evidence existed, which the jury <em>could have considered </em>on the issue .... had the issue been submitted to the jury under an appropriate instruction, is of no moment . . . .\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">In a situation in which the necessary fact that is omitted is an element, prejudice appears as a matter of law: \u201c[U]nder <em>Yates,\u201d </em>held the <em>Gaudin </em>court, \u201cwhen an element... is removed from jury consideration, that error cannot be harmless.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin, supra, </em>997 F.2d at p. 1272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Turning now to the case at bar, I am compelled to conclude that the trial court\u2019s omission of an instruction on intent to kill as an element of the multiple-murder special circumstance was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman. </em>The rule stated above controls the result: the instructional omission of an element, like that here, cannot be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">In arriving at my conclusion, I do not overlook the strong evidence of intent to kill. The majority view that evidence as \u201coverwhelming.\" (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 45, 46.) I tend to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">But generally, as explained above, the presence of \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d is insufficient. The majority seek to avail themselves of an exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>that apparently operates when an element is not omitted but is merely undermined by an improper rebuttable presumption. That condition, however, is not satisfied on this record. The intent-to-kill element of the multiple-murder special circumstance was in fact omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Moreover, in the specific situation here disclosed, the presence of \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d is completely immaterial. \u201cUnder the guidance of <em>Yates, </em>we may no longer consider the strength of the evidence and determine whether it is so clear that the jury <em>would have </em>found the element to exist had it been properly instructed . . . .\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin, supra, </em>997 F.2d at p. 1272, italics in original.) This is because \u201cwhen an element ... is removed from jury consideration, that error cannot be harmless.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Contrary to the majority\u2019s implication, it matters not that the intent-to-kill element of the offense of first degree willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder\u2014which is not at issue\u2014was not removed. The fact is, the intent-to-kill element of the multiple-murder special circumstance\u2014which <em>is </em>at issue <em>\u2014was.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">I recognize that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal. 3d 386\u2014on which the majority\u2019s discussion depends\u2014this court relied on and reiterated the statement in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>478 U.S. 570, 579 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 471], that an error is harmless \u201c[w]here a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 413, 414, 416.) But, as noted, the <em>Yates </em>court disapproved this \u201cstatement\u201d as \u201cnot . . . correct.\u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 402-403, fn. 8 [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 448, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1892].) Hence, on this point <em>Odle </em>is no longer good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">I also recognize that in <em>Odle </em>this court accepted and applied the broad \u201cassumption\u201d in <em>Clark, </em>among other decisions, that the \u201charmlessness of an error is to be judged after a review of the entire record.\u201d <em>(Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 405 [114 L.Ed.2d at pp. 449-450, 111 S.Ct. at p. 1894].) But, as noted, the <em>Yates </em>court rejected this \u201cassumption.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Hence, on this point too, <em>Odle </em>is no longer good law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the judgment as to the multiple-murder special-circumstance finding and the dependent sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied January 12, 1994. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\">In passing, I state my view that there was no <em>Miranda (Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]) violation by the police during their interview of defendant on March 28,1986. Defendant did <em>not </em>invoke his right to counsel when he stated, \u201cMaybe I ought to talk to my lawyer, you might be bluffing, you might not have enough to charge murder.\" In context, it is plain that he was simply playing for time as he probed his interrogators in preparation for an attempt at \u201cplea bargaining.\u201d The cases he cites on appeal are factually distinguishable. Similarly, he did <em>not </em>invoke his right to silence when he expressed his desire, on two occasions, to go \u201coff the record.\u201d In context, it is plain that he was simply attempting to open, and then continue, \u201cplea bargaining.\u201d Here too, the cases he cites on appeal are factually distinguishable. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Braeseke </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 691, 702-703 [159 Cal.Rptr. 684, 602 P.2d 384], judgment vacated and case remanded <em>sub nomine California </em>v. <em>Braeseke </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 932 [64 L.Ed.2d 784, 100 S.Ct. 2147], reiterated in its entirety (1980) 28 Cal.3d 86 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P. 2d 149]; we stated: \u201cA request to speak \u2018off the record\u2019 cannot constitute a knowing and intelligent waiver of rights which include the advisement that \u2018anything [a suspect] says can be used against him in a court of law.\u2019 [Citations.] Indeed, [Braeseke\u2019s] request revealed a marked lack of understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d In this case, by contrast, defendant\u2019s twice-expressed desire to go \u201coff the record\u201d did not even purport to constitute a waiver; he had already effected one. Neither did it reveal any lack of understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings on his part; rather, it disclosed an effort to change his role in the interview from that of \u201csubject\u201d to \u201cnegotiator.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\"> It might perhaps be argued that the rule that the instructional omission of an element cannot be harmless allows of one or more of the following \u201cexceptions\u201d: (1) the element pertained only to a charge rejected by the jury; (2) the element was admitted by the defendant; and (3) the element was necessarily found by the jury under other, proper instructions. Support for such a position may be found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539, 554-555 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826], as well as in Justice Blackmun\u2019s earlier plurality opinion in <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 73, 87 [74 L.Ed.2d 823, 834-835, 103 S.Ct. 969], and in Justice Scalia\u2019s later concurring opinion in <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>491 U.S. 263, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>270-271 [105 L.Ed.2d 218, 224-225], The point need not be resolved here.
