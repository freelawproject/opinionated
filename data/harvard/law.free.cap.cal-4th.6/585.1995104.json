(Pen. Code, \u00a7187; all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated); it found that defendant used a deadly weapon to commit the murder (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) and that defendant committed the murder while engaged in the commission of robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i)) and burglary (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(vii)). The jury also convicted defendant of one count each of robbery (\u00a7 211) with the use of a deadly weapon (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) and burglary of an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 462, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The jury fixed the penalty for the murder at death. The trial court denied the automatic motion to modify this penalty verdict (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)), stayed the pronouncement of sentence on the noncapital counts, and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We conclude that the judgment should be affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">A. <em>Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">On March 21, 1986, Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies found the body of Amelia P. in the master bedroom of her home in the desert community of Littlerock, in the County of Los Angeles. The body was face down on the floor, with the hands tied together behind the victim\u2019s back, the ankles tied together, and the hands tied to the ankles. These bindings were made with neckties belonging to the victim\u2019s husband, Ubaldo P. A piece of cloth was found in the victim\u2019s mouth, secured by a necktie tied around the victim\u2019s head and upper neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">The body was clothed only in a robe. On the floor near the body were the victim\u2019s underwear, socks, and running shoes, as well as a bloodstained hammer and the broken tip of a fireplace poker. The cause of death was multiple blows to the back and sides of the head, fracturing the skull and lacerating the brain. Semen was present on the victim\u2019s right inner thigh and genital area, but there were no indications of traumatic sexual assault. Based on the temperature of the liver when the body was found, death was estimated to have occurred between 8:10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. that day. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>victim\u2019s blood tested negative for alcohol and an array of illegal drugs, including cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Kevin P., the youngest of the victim\u2019s sons, was five years old on the day of his mother\u2019s death, and seven years old when he testified at trial. According to that testimony, a Black man Kevin had never seen before entered the house with a knife in his hand. The man had no facial hair and no tattoos on his arms. It was before lunch, and Kevin was under a table in the living room watching television. The man, who was wearing a sleeveless blue top and dark blue cut-off pants, put the knife to the victim\u2019s neck and demanded money. As Kevin described it, the knife was black with a \u201clittle round silver ball around it, and it was a survival knife.\u201d At the man\u2019s direction, Kevin retrieved the keys to the family van from the kitchen and gave them to the man. The man tried to start the van but was unable to do so. The man then took the victim to the master bedroom, where the man tied up the victim. From the closet in the master bedroom, the man removed two guns belonging to Kevin\u2019s father. Kevin went into his own bedroom and stayed there for a long time. Some days later, Kevin attended a lineup but did not identify anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">tibaldo P. testified that he had left the house that morning between midnight and 1 a.m. to go to work 77 miles away in the City of Commerce. When he returned at 5 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s deputies were already there. Missing from the house were an M-l carbine, a 30.06 rifle, and an army duffel bag. The victim\u2019s jewelry case, usually kept in the bedroom, was in the family van. The hammer found on the bedroom floor was normally kept in a toolbox in the garage. The fireplace poker was in its usual place, but there were bloodstains on the shaft and the tip had been broken off. The victim was very neat and normally did not leave her clothing on the floor. He had no reason to suspect that she was abusing drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Investigating officers found the keys to the van outside the victim\u2019s house, about 30 feet from the rear garage door. Nearby, the officers found a single set of shoe prints leading away from the house. It had rained the previous day, making a crusty surface. The officers followed the tracks for about a third of a mile, at intervals observing marks consistent with an object such as a rifle dragging on the ground. The tracks led to a camper, from which the victim\u2019s house was easily visible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The officers ordered the occupants to leave the camper. Defendant and his brother Gregory emerged from the camper and were taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Inside the camper, the officers found a pair of MacGregor athletic shoes that could have made the shoe prints. The officers found an identical pair of athletic shoes behind the front seat of an automobile belonging to defendant\u2019s mother, Maxine Cudjo. Unlike the shoes found in the camper, the shoes found in the automobile were \u201cvery wet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In addition to the shoes, the officers found a black survival knife and a pair of cut-off blue jeans in the Cudjo camper. When shown these articles at trial, Kevin testified that the knife was different from the knife wielded by the man who had assaulted his mother, and that the cut-off pants the assailant had worn were similar to, but shorter than, the ones found in the Cudjo camper. No firearms were found in the camper or in Maxine Cudjo\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Maxine Cudjo testified that on the day of the murder she was living in the camper. Defendant and Gregory had slept in the camper the previous night, as they occasionally did. She spent most of that morning in the house next door, doing housework for the man who owned the land under the camper. Returning to the camper at 11 a.m., she found defendant and Gregory, both wearing their MacGregor athletic shoes. The three of them went in Maxine\u2019s car to the post office and then to the residence of Julia Watson, one of Maxine Cudjo\u2019s daughters. Maxine returned to the camper; a little while later, at about 1:30 p.m., she departed again in her car to visit friends, leaving defendant and Gregory in the camper. On her next return to the camper, at approximately 4 p.m., sheriff\u2019s deputies had taken her sons into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Julia Watson testified that her mother had visited her house that day with defendant and Gregory at approximately 1 or 2 p.m. Defendant was wearing cut-off jeans and work boots; Gregory wore shorts and tennis shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Gregory Cudjo did not testify at trial, but the prosecution introduced evidence of the testimony he had given at defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing and statements he had made to investigating officers during a tape-recorded interview the morning of the day after the murder of Amelia P. In these prior statements, Gregory maintained that he had remained in the camper throughout the morning of the murder until his mother returned at approximately 11 a.m. During this time, he alternately slept and listened to a professional baseball game on the radio. He said defendant was gone from the camper for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>about two hours, leaving at about the time the baseball game started and returning at the same time as Maxine. During the taped interview, Gregory said that later that afternoon defendant had washed off his MacGregor athletic shoes when they were at Julia Watson\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Analysis of semen found on the victim\u2019s external genital area and right inner thigh revealed that it could have come from defendant but could not have come from Gregory Cudjo or from Ubaldo P.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">2. <em>Defense evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. He admitted that he knew Amelia P., that he had been in her house on the morning of her death, and that he had had sexual relations with her, but he denied that he had killed her. He said he had seen Amelia P. on three occasions before the day of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Defendant explained that he and a woman named Iris Thomas had worked together selling cocaine, and that he had derived most of his income from this illicit trade. On two occasions, he had seen Amelia P. purchase cocaine. One of these transactions had occurred in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Quartz Hill. The other transaction had occurred on March 4 or 5, 1986, at a house belonging to Thomas\u2019s mother. According to defendant, Amelia P. had announced at the door that she had come \u201cto see Miss Thomas about some coke.\u201d Defendant had invited Amelia inside. Amelia had asked Thomas\u2019s mother to \u201cfront her an eight track of cocaine.\u201d (Defendant testified that an \u201ceight track\u201d is one-eighth of an ounce.) After some discussion of arrangements for payment, Thomas\u2019s mother had given cocaine to Amelia. On a later date, defendant had seen Amelia P. at a market and they had waved to each other but had not conversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">On the morning of March 21, defendant was driving his mother\u2019s car to a friend\u2019s house when he noticed Amelia P. standing in the front yard of her residence. She was wearing a housecoat or robe. It was about 9 a.m. When he blew the horn, she came to the car and asked how he had been and if he knew anybody who had any cocaine. Defendant said he had some. She asked if she could have it on credit as a favor. He said that it would depend on whether she would do him a favor. They agreed to talk about it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Defendant drove to the camper, retrieved some cocaine, and returned to the victim\u2019s residence. Amelia P. invited him into the house. He sold her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>some cocaine on credit for $50. (Sheriff\u2019s officers did not find rock cocaine at the victim\u2019s residence, but they did find an empty \u201cbaggie\u201d in the garage. Just two and one-half inches square, the baggie was smaller than the ones normally sold in supermarkets; it was a convenient size for $50 worth of rock cocaine. The officers did not take possession of the baggie.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Defendant smoked some cocaine, then asked Amelia P. when she could pay him. After further conversation, Amelia agreed to have sex with defendant in lieu of cash payment. They engaged in sexual intercourse on the living room couch; defendant left five minutes later. Defendant did not see anyone else in the house. He went back to the camper and told Gregory he had had sex with Amelia P. in exchange for cocaine. Defendant then went jogging. He did not wear the MacGregor shoes, which had cleats, but athletic shoes with smooth soles. When he returned to the camper, Gregory was there and their mother arrived about five minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Defendant changed to work boots. Gregory and defendant went with their mother to the post office, and then to Julia Watson\u2019s house. Defendant sat in the front passenger seat of his mother\u2019s automobile during this excursion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">At that time, defendant had tattoos on both biceps, on his right shoulder, and on his lower left arm. Defendant denied owning the cut-offs found in the camper and denied knowing to whom they belonged, although he admitted he had seen them in the camper. Defendant admitted owning the survival knife found in the camper. Gregory is two years younger than defendant and had no facial hair on the day of the murder. (Apparently, a photograph in evidence, taken on the day of the murder after defendant\u2019s arrest, showed that defendant had a goatee and/or a mustache.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">To establish Gregory\u2019s knowledge of the details of the murder, the defense introduced the complete tape recordings of Gregory\u2019s two interviews with investigating officers. During these interviews, Gregory said that when defendant saw the officers following his tracks to the camper, he admitted to Gregory that it appeared the officers were following his (i.e., defendant\u2019s) tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">According to Gregory, defendant gave this description of what he had done: Defendant had hidden and the woman had walked up with a basket of clothes. The woman was wearing a housecoat, which came open. Defendant rushed up, grabbed her, put a knife to her throat, and said he wanted only money. The woman had no money and no jewelry, but defendant took a couple of shotguns, one of which looked like a rifle. The woman started to make a lot of noise, so defendant put a sock in her mouth. There was a little boy, and there was a boa constrictor in an aquarium. (Kevin kept a pet snake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>in his bedroom.) The little boy had shown defendant where to find the keys to a van. Defendant had started the van but was unable to drive it out of the garage because the garage door was padlocked on the outside. Defendant had \u201chogtied\u201d the woman with some neckties that were in the closet \u201cnext to a . . . jacket with all kinds of medals on it\u2014something like a Ranger jacket or something.\u201d (Ubaldo P. testified he had been an Airborne Ranger in the United States Army, and his green full-dress uniform had been hanging in the closet.) Defendant became \u201creal nervous\u201d because the woman had said her husband would come home at noon and it was then 11:25 a.m. He had tied her up to give himself enough time to get away. He did not rape the woman. According to Gregory, defendant said nothing about hitting the woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">By stipulation, the defense established, first, that Kevin had told investigating officers on the day of the murder that he had been watching a certain television program when the intruder entered his house; second, that this program had been broadcast that day from 10:30 to 11:00 a.m.; and, third, that the professional baseball game that was broadcast that morning began at 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">An expert in drug dependency testified that it is frequently impossible to determine from an individual\u2019s appearance and behavior whether that individual has been using cocaine. He also testified that it is not uncommon for the spouse of a cocaine addict to profess ignorance of the addict\u2019s use of cocaine. This may indicate genuine ignorance or the psychological state of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">A defense investigator testified that he had driven the route that defendant said in his testimony that he had jogged on the morning of the murder and that the distance was three miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">3. <em>Rebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">On rebuttal, Deputy Sheriff Robert Flores testified that on March 21, 1986, the time from the landing of the sheriff\u2019s helicopter at the victim\u2019s residence to the officers\u2019 arrival at the Cudjo camper was at least one hour and thirty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The prosecution presented no evidence at the penalty phase. The only defense evidence was the testimony of defendant. Asked but a single question, defendant again denied killing Amelia P. There was no cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>II. Guilt Phase Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">A. <em>Exclusion of Evidence of Gregory Cudjo\u2019s Confession</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in excluding evidence that Gregory had confessed to the murder of Amelia P. We agree that the ruling was erroneous, but we conclude that defendant was not thereby prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">1. <em>Proceedings in the trial court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The prosecution had intended to call Gregory Cudjo as a witness during its case-in-chief, but the trial court determined that Gregory was unavailable as a witness (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 240) after Gregory asserted his privilege against self-incrimination during a nonjury hearing. The prosecution then introduced the testimony Gregory had given at defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">During the defense case, defense counsel represented to the trial court that John Lee Culver was prepared to testify that Gregory Cudjo had admitted responsibility for the murder of Amelia P. while Culver and Gregory were incarcerated together at the Antelope Valley sheriff\u2019s substation. The prosecutor remarked that the trial court would have to rule on the admissibility of the proposed testimony both as a statement against penal interest and under Evidence Code section 352.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To permit the trial court to make the necessary determinations of preliminary fact (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 402), Culver then testified out of the jury\u2019s presence, to the following effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">When not incarcerated, Culver lived in Littlerock. He had known defendant for approximately 15 to 20 years. He also knew defendant\u2019s mother, his sisters, and his brother Gregory. In March 1986, Culver was in custody at the Antelope Valley sheriff\u2019s substation, where he shared a cell with Gregory Cudjo. Because of Gregory\u2019s restless pacing, Culver asked what was wrong. Gregory answered, \u201cMan, they got me in here for a murder\u201d and \u201cI need [to] talk to somebody.\u201d As Culver put it, Gregory then \u201cstarted talking about why he\u2019d done it and what he\u2019d done . . . .\u201d According to Culver, Gregory said, \u201cI went over to rob, burglarize this lady\u2019s house and she seen me and then that\u2019s when all the stuff went down and that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">Gregory then explained, in Culver\u2019s words, that he \u201cwent in the house and this woman supposed to have been washing clothes, and she caught him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>coming in the house .... When the woman seen him he just started beating the woman up and then she started screaming, so he knocked her out and went and done it again, kept hitting her, kept hitting her .... He kept banging her around in the head.\u201d Gregory reportedly said that the woman started screaming as soon as she saw him, that he \u201cknocked her out,\u201d that she \u201ccame back to,\" and that he \u201cstarted hitting her and hitting her with a hammer or whatever he hit her with.\u201d Gregory also said, reportedly, that he had found jewelry and guns in the house, and that he knew the lady because they had \u201csmoked dope together.\u201d Gregory did not mention raping the woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Culver if Gregory had mentioned anyone besides the woman being present in the house. Culver answered that at the time Gregory had not mentioned anyone else, but that Culver had talked to Gregory shortly before Culver\u2019s testimony and that through this conversation Culver had learned that there \u201cprobably was a little boy or somebody in the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">According to Culver, Gregory had been taken from the cell he shared with Culver. When Gregory returned, he told Culver that detectives had interviewed him about the murder. Asked whether Gregory had admitted inculpating defendant for the murder, Culver at first said that Gregory had done so, but he immediately changed his testimony, stating that he merely inferred that Gregory had blamed defendant because Gregory was released shortly thereafter and because defendant\u2019s criminal record was worse than Gregory\u2019s.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Culver testified that he first became aware of defendant\u2019s presence at the substation two days after his conversation with Gregory, when Culver was being taken to court. At that time, Culver told defendant nothing about Gregory\u2019s confession, even after defendant said he was incarcerated for murder. Culver said he first spoke of the confession approximately three months before his testimony, when he was contacted and interviewed by a defense investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Following Culver\u2019s testimony, the trial court invited argument. The prosecutor asserted that Culver\u2019s demeanor, background, and relationship to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>defendant, as well as the content of his testimony, made him unworthy of belief. The prosecutor framed the question as \u201cwhether or not we should allow a liar to testify in front of the jury just for the purpose of propping up a straw man.\u201d The prosecutor urged the court to exclude Culver\u2019s testimony under Evidence Code section 352 as inherently incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The court inquired whether it would then be \u201cmaking a judgment as trier of fact and taking it away from the jury.\u201d The prosecutor said that Evidence Code section 352 required this on some occasions. The court agreed it must \u201cresolve\u201d issues such as Culver\u2019s friendship with defendant and the fact that Culver waited so long to come forward; \u201c[t]hese are the things that I consider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Defense counsel maintained that the evidence was admissible as a declaration against penal interest under Evidence Code section 1230. The trial court agreed with defense counsel that Gregory was unavailable as a witness because he had exercised his privilege against self-incrimination and that the statements attributed to him by Culver were against his penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">However, the court found that \u201cto allow this testimony would be a travesty of justice . . . .\u201d Concluding that the evidence lacked \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d the court ruled that it was not admissible as a declaration against interest. In support of the ruling, the court cited Evidence Code section 1230 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 148, 162 [197 Cal.Rptr. 655],</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Later that day, after another defense witness had testified before the jury, the trial court added that \u201cin interpreting section 1230 of the Evidence Code\u201d it had also relied upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 872, 878-881 [123 Cal.Rptr. 862], Later still, during a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the court stated \u201cfor the record\u201d that it had found Culver\u2019s testimony \u201cunreliable and untrustworthy\u201d and had concluded that the probative value of the evidence \u201cwas outweighed by prejudice under section 352 of the Evidence Code within the meaning of <em>People </em>versus <em>Green, </em>27 Cal.3d 1 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">2. <em>Evidence Code section 1230</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Under one of the statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule, a party may introduce in evidence, for the truth of the matter stated, an out-of-court statement by a declarant who is unavailable as a witness at trial if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>statement, when made, was against the declarant\u2019s penal, pecuniary, proprietary, or social interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   A party who maintains that an out-of-court statement is admissible under this exception as a declaration against <em>penal </em>interest must show that the declarant is unavailable, that the declaration was against the declarant\u2019s penal interest, and that the declaration was sufficiently reliable to warrant admission despite its hearsay character. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 730, 745 [280 Cal.Rptr. 440, 808 P.2d 1197].) To determine whether the declaration passes the required threshold of trustworthiness, a trial court \u201cmay take into account not just the words but the circumstances under which they were uttered, the possible motivation of the declarant, and the declarant\u2019s relationship to the defendant.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>On appeal, the trial court\u2019s determination on this issue is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Here, Gregory Cudjo was unavailable as a witness because he had chosen to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 419, 438 [124 Cal.Rptr. 752, 541 P.2d 296].) It is likewise not disputed or reasonably disputable that a statement confessing to a killing during the course of a burglary and robbery, as attributed to Gregory in Culver\u2019s testimony, subjects the declarant to a risk of criminal liability and therefore on its face is against the alleged declarant\u2019s penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Moreover, given the circumstances of Gregory\u2019s alleged statement, the trial court had discretion to conclude that it was admissible despite its hearsay character because, if made as claimed, it was probably true. By Culver\u2019s account, Gregory made his statement spontaneously, while alone with an acquaintance, within hours after a murder for which Gregory, who had no alibi, was in custody as a prime suspect. Gregory tended to fit Kevin P.\u2019s description of the assailant, and much of the other evidence, in particular the incriminating shoe prints, was as consistent with Gregory\u2019s guilt as with defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">It is true, as the People suggest, that the alleged statement was inconsistent to some extent with the physical evidence, most notably the evidence that the victim was hog-tied before she was beaten to death. However, such discrepancies might be attributable to Gregory\u2019s agitation or Culver\u2019s misunderstanding of what he was told. They did not negate all possibility that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Gregory claimed to be the murderer, he was telling the truth. Hence, the court could properly have found that \u201ca reasonable [person] in [Gregory\u2019s] position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">But the trial court did not focus exclusively, or even primarily, on whether Gregory\u2019s <em>hearsay statement </em>might be false. Instead, the court apparently accepted the prosecution\u2019s contention that <em>Culver </em>was probably a liar who should therefore be excluded as a <em>live witness. </em>In so doing, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The People argue that in considering the admissibility of evidence offered under the hearsay exception for declarations against interest, the trial court could properly consider the credibility of the in-court witness, Culver. We disagree. The credibility of the in-court witness is not a proper consideration in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Hearsay is generally excluded because the out-of-court declarant is not under oath and cannot be cross-examined to test perception, memory, clarity of expression, and veracity, and because the jury (or other trier of fact) is unable to observe the declarant\u2019s demeanor. (See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 284, 298 [35 L.Ed.2d 297, 310-311, 93 S.Ct. 1038]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bob </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 321, 325 [175 P.2d 12].) Because the rule excluding hearsay is based on these particular difficulties in assessing the credibility of statements made outside the jury\u2019s presence, the focus of the rule\u2019s several exceptions is also on the reliability of the out-of-court declaration. Thus, the various hearsay exceptions generally reflect situations in which circumstances affording some assurance of trustworthiness compensate for the absence of the oath, cross-examination, and jury observation, <em>(Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra, </em>410 U.S. at pp. 298-299 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 310-311].) Neither the hearsay rule nor its exceptions are concerned with the credibility of witnesses who testify directly to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">When evidence is offered under one of the hearsay exceptions, the trial court must determine, as preliminary facts, both that the out-of-court declarant made the statement as represented, and that the statement meets certain standards of trustworthiness. (See legis. committee com., 29B West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1966 ed.) \u00a7 403, p. 268.) The first determination\u2014whether the declaration was made as represented\u2014is governed by the substantial evidence rule. The trial court is to determine only whether there is evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that the statement was made. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As with other facts, the direct testimony of a single witness is sufficient to support a finding unless the testimony is physically impossible or its falsity is apparent \u201cwithout resorting to inferences or deductions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huston </em>(1943) 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Cal.2d 690, 693 [134 P.2d 758]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314-316 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 754 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267].) Except in these rare instances of demonstrable falsity, doubts about the credibility of the in-court witness should be left for the jury\u2019s resolution; such doubts do not afford a ground for refusing to admit evidence under the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Seeley </em>(1st Cir. 1989) 892 F.2d 1, 3; Comment, <em>Statements Against Penal Interest </em>(1978) 66 Cal.L.Rev. 1189, 1205, fn. 99; Note, <em>Declarations Against Penal Interest </em>(1976) 56 B.U.L. Rev. 148, 178-179; 2 McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992) \u00a7 318, p. 342, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">3. <em>Evidence Code section 352</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">When an objection to evidence is raised under Evidence Code section 352, the trial court is required to weigh the evidence\u2019s probative value against the dangers of prejudice, confusion, and undue time consumption. Unless these dangers \u201csubstantially outweigh\u201d probative value, the objection must be overruled. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 660, 688 [248 Cal.Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253].) On appeal, the ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, 973 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Here, no claim is made that permitting Culver to testify would have taken an undue amount of time. Culver\u2019s testimony out of the jury\u2019s presence, including a thorough cross-examination, did not take long, and the prosecutor did not represent that rebuttal witnesses would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Nor is there any apparent danger of confusion of the issues. Culver\u2019s testimony would not even have introduced the issue of Gregory\u2019s possible culpability for the murder of Amelia P. The issue was already there, as defense counsel had made clear from the outset of trial; Gregory\u2019s culpability constituted the primary defense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McAlpin </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1289, 1310, fn. 15 [283 Cal.Rptr. 382, 812 P.2d 563].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The evidence had substantial probative value.  To withstand a challenge under Evidence Code section 352, evidence of a third party\u2019s culpability \u201cneed only be capable of raising a reasonable doubt of [the] defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 833 [283 Cal.Rptr. 382, 812 P.2d 563].)  Here, Culver would testify that Gregory, the other prime suspect in the case, had confessed to the murder within hours after the crime was committed and under circumstances providing substantial assurances that the confession was trustworthy. The issue of Gregory\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>guilt was highly material: given Kevin P.\u2019s testimony describing a single intruder, and given also the single set of shoe prints leading away from the victim\u2019s residence, proof of Gregory\u2019s guilt would exonerate defendant. Thus, Culver\u2019s testimony raised the requisite reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Finally, the evidence was highly necessary: although there was other evidence tending to cast suspicion on Gregory, there was no comparable direct evidence of Gregory\u2019s guilt. Gregory\u2019s decision to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination precluded the defense from calling Gregory as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Nor was there any danger of \u201cundue prejudice\u201d to the prosecution. The evidence was not likely \u201cto arouse the emotions of the jurors\u201d or \u201cto be used in some manner unrelated to the issue on which it was admissible.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1016 [254 Cal.Rptr. 586, 766 P.2d 1]; see also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 888, 912 [254 Cal.Rptr. 508, 765 P.2d 940]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Karis </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 638 [250 Cal.Rptr. 659, 758 P.2d 1189].)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">As noted, the trial court apparently concluded that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative because Culver was not a credible witness. However, such doubts, however legitimate, do not constitute \u201cprejudice\u201d under Evidence Code section 352. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 742, 791 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 842 P.2d 1192].) We have warned trial courts to avoid hasty conclusions that third-party-culpability evidence is \u201cincredible\u201d; this determination, we have affirmed, \u201cis properly the province of the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 834.) Unlike other cases in which similar evidence was excluded for lack of credibility (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Blankenship </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 840, 849 [213 Cal.Rptr. 666]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d 148, 162; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 872, 878), nothing in the record indicates that Culver\u2019s testimony was motivated by threats or bribery or expectation of personal advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We conclude that doubts about Culver\u2019s credibility, though reasonable and legitimate, did not provide a sufficient basis to exclude his testimony. In sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection to this evidence, the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">4. <em>Constitutional claims; standard of prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Defendant urges that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Culver\u2019s testimony usurped his federal due process and fair trial rights. In essence, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>complains he was unconstitutionally deprived of the right to present a defense. Hence, he reasons, the prejudicial effect of the error must be measured under the constitutional standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065] (reversal required unless error harmless beyond reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We find no constitutional violation. \u201cAs a general matter, the ordinary rules of evidence do not impermissibly infringe on the accused\u2019s [constitutional] right to present a defense. Courts retain ... a traditional and intrinsic power to exercise discretion to control the admission of evidence in the interests of orderly procedure and the avoidance of prejudice. [Citations.] . . . [T]his principle applies perforce to evidence of third-party culpability . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 826, 834-835.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">It follows, for the most part, that the mere erroneous exercise of discretion under such \u201cnormal\u201d rules does not implicate the federal Constitution. Even in capital cases, we have consistently assumed that when. a trial court misapplies Evidence Code section 352 to exclude defense evidence, including third-party-culpability evidence, the applicable standard of prejudice is that for state law error, as set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243] (error harmless if it does not appear reasonably probable verdict was affected). (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 742, 791; <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 660, 688; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 836; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 576, 585-586 [217 Cal.Rptr. 212, 703 P.2d 1106].)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Justice Kennard, in her dissent, urges that by barring a crucial defense witness as \u201cincredible,\u201d the trial court unconstitutionally invaded the jury\u2019s function and denied defendant his right, under the compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment, to present witnesses in his behalf. The United States Supreme Court has held that the constitutional right to present and confront material witnesses may be infringed by <em>general rules </em>of evidence or procedure which preclude material testimony or pertinent cross-examination for arbitrary reasons, such as unwarranted and overbroad assumptions of untrustworthiness. However, the high court has never suggested that a trial court commits constitutional error whenever it individually assesses and rejects a material defense witness as incredible. (See, e.g., <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 145 [114 L.Ed.2d 205, 111 S.Ct. 1743] [preclusive effect of statutory notice-of-evidence requirement in rape case]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1988) 484 U.S. 400 [98 L.Ed.2d 798, 108 S.Ct. 646] [sanction of preclusion for defense violation of discovery rules]; <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 44 [97 L.Ed.2d 37, 107 S.Ct. 2704] [exclusion of accused\u2019s own testimony under state rule disallowing all hypnotically refreshed evidence]; <em>Green </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>Georgia </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 95 [60 L.Ed.2d 738, 99 S.Ct. 2150] [absolute state failure to recognize hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest]; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 308 [39 L.Ed.2d 347, 94 S.Ct. 1105] [denial of cross-examination for bias based on state rule making evidence of juvenile proceedings inadmissible in adult court]; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra, </em>410 U.S. 284 [state rule precluding cross-examination of party\u2019s own witness]; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 14 [18 L.Ed.2d 1019, 87 S.Ct. 1920] [state rule precluding accomplice from testifying for defense]; but cf. <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 673 [89 L.Ed.2d 674, 106 S.Ct. 1431] [preclusion of cross-examination for bias, based upon individual assessment of probative value against prejudice, violated confrontation clause].)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We reiterate that in general under California law, the credibility of individual witnesses \u201cis properly the province of the jury.\u201d <em>(Hall, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 834.) Nonetheless, absent clearer guidance from above, we will not lightly assume that a trial court invites federal constitutional scrutiny each and every time it decides, on the basis of the particular circumstances, to exclude a defense witness as unworthy of credit. We decline to extend the federal decisions in the manner proposed by defendant and in Justice Kennard\u2019s dissent. We conclude that the <em>Watson </em>standard of prejudice applies to the trial court\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">5. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Applying the <em>Watson </em>standard, we conclude that exclusion of Culver\u2019s testimony, though erroneous, was harmless because it is not reasonably probable that admission of the testimony would have affected the outcome. We recognize that Gregory was the other prime suspect in the murder, and he disclosed accurate crime-scene details, which he told the police defendant had revealed to him. Moreover, Kevin P., the only eyewitness, never identified the assailant and gave a description which more closely resembled Gregory than defendant. Some other evidence was consistent with Gregory\u2019s guilt as well as defendant\u2019s. Yet the inference that defendant, not Gregory, was the murderer was extremely strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Trapped by a semen sample that included defendant but excluded all other known potential donors, including Gregory, defendant was forced to admit that he was present at the crime scene on the morning of the murder, and that he had sex with the victim. The physical evidence, in particular the shoe prints leading to and from the victim\u2019s home, strongly suggested there had been only one visitor during that morning. Just as important, Kevin described only one \u00e9ntry, by the man who robbed his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>By contrast, defendant\u2019s uncorroborated effort to provide an innocent explanation for his presence in the victim\u2019s house was not convincing. Defendant testified he had encountered the victim purchasing cocaine on two prior occasions, and that she traded cocaine for sex on the day of the murder. However, these claims contravened all other evidence about the victim\u2019s life-style and values.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The victim\u2019s husband testified that she never exhibited signs of drug use during a 13-year marriage, and there was no cocaine in her blood at the time of her death. Moreover, the victim\u2019s family was on a tight budget and managed its money carefully; the victim\u2019s husband noticed no unusual withdrawals from the family account.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">It also seems unlikely that the victim, a housewife and mother, would have engaged in casual sex and drug activity in her living room with a near stranger while her five-year-old son was at home. Defendant\u2019s version of events failed to mention or explain Kevin\u2019s presence during the alleged sex-for-drugs encounter. The implausibility of defendant\u2019s account enhanced the inference that he was involved in the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Finally, as the trial court surmised, both Culver\u2019s testimony and the hearsay confession it recounted had obvious indicia of unreliability. Though he knew the entire Cudjo family, Culver was a particular friend of defendant and thus had a motive to lie. Moreover, Gregory\u2019s purported jailhouse confession contravened both the physical evidence and all other accounts Gregory had given, including his testimony under oath at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">According to Culver, Gregory said that as he was entering the victim\u2019s home to burglarize it, the victim came upon him by surprise, whereupon he \u201ctripped\u201d and immediately began beating her with a hammer. As previously noted, however, the crime-scene evidence made clear that the victim was carefully hog-tied in her bedroom before she was beaten and killed. When asked whether Gregory had mentioned anybody else in the house, Culver admitted that Gregory had originally failed to account for this crucial detail. However, Culver claimed that in a courthouse conversation just minutes before Culver took the stand, Gregory belatedly mentioned that there \u201cprobably was a little boy or somebody . . . .\u201d This claim is suspect. It strains common sense that Gregory willingly provided additional details to Culver at a moment when he must have known Culver was about to give incriminating testimony against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In all his other known statements and sworn testimony, Gregory insisted he had no involvement in the homicide. Moreover, after observing Culver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>demeanor and hearing his testimony, the trial court concluded that Culver was a patently incredible witness. Under all these circumstances, the chance that a competent jury would have given Culver\u2019s testimony substantial weight seems remote. Accordingly, it is not reasonably probable that admission of his testimony would have affected the outcome. No basis for reversal appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">B. <em>Admission of Gregory Cudjo\u2019s Preliminary Hearing Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The prosecution had intended to call Gregory Cudjo as a witness during the case-in-chief. Because Gregory was a potential suspect in the murder of Amelia P., the trial court appointed counsel to advise him. After conferring with counsel, Gregory decided to assert his privilege against self-incrimination (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15) and to refuse to answer any questions relating to the murder. The prosecution then announced its intention to offer in evidence, under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule (see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1200, 1291), the testimony Gregory had given at the preliminary hearing. After Gregory had asserted his privilege against self-incrimination during a nonjury hearing, the trial court found that Gregory was unavailable as a witness <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 240), and it overruled the defense objection to Gregory\u2019s former testimony. When proceedings with the jury resumed, the transcript of Gregory\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was read aloud.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Here is what the transcript revealed:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Called as a prosecution witness at the preliminary hearing, Gregory had at first testified that on the morning of Amelia P.\u2019s murder, and throughout that day, defendant had worn long pants and boots; that defendant had remained in the camper with Gregory from the time Gregory awoke, between 9:30 and 10 a.m., until their mother arrived and the three of them went together to the house of Julia Watson; and that Gregory had not seen defendant washing his tennis shoes at Watson\u2019s house. Under further questioning, including references to his previous interviews with sheriff\u2019s investigators, Gregory had testified that he could not be sure that defendant had remained in the camper during the late morning hours because he (Gregory) had fallen asleep again for most of this time, and that defendant had later told Gregory he had been jogging that morning. But Gregory denied that he had ever told sheriff\u2019s investigators that he had seen defendant leave the camper that morning, that defendant had been wearing cut-off jeans and tennis shoes, or that defendant had later washed his shoes at Watson\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Without objection, the prosecutor at the preliminary hearing had then played part of a tape recording of two sheriff\u2019s investigators interviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Gregory on the day following the murder. During the portion of the taped interview that was played, Gregory had said that defendant had been gone from the camper for two hours on the morning of the murder, that defendant had worn cut-off jeans and white tennis shoes that morning, that at Watson\u2019s house defendant had taken off his tennis shoes and washed them, and that defendant had later changed into long pants and boots. After the tape had been played, Gregory had testified that he remembered the conversation with the sheriff\u2019s investigators, that hearing the tape had refreshed his recollection, that he had not lied to the investigators and had told them what he knew, and that he did not disagree with any of the things he had told the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Defendant now contends: (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object at the preliminary hearing to the playing of the tape recording of the interview; (2) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction that Gregory\u2019s taped statements could not be considered for the truth of the matters asserted; (3) the trial court erred in finding Gregory unavailable as a witness; (4) admission of Gregory\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony denied defendant his right of confrontation; (5) the prosecutor\u2019s failure to grant immunity to Gregory violated various constitutional rights of defendant; and (6) the trial court should have told the jurors why Gregory was not appearing before them to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">1. <em>Ineffective assistance at preliminary hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel (U.S. Const., 6th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., aft. I, \u00a7 15). This right to counsel extends to every critical stage of the proceeding, including the preliminary hearing. <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 1, 9-10 [26 L.Ed.2d 387, 396-397, 90 S.Ct. 1999] (lead opn. of Brennan, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 11 [26 L.Ed.2d at pp. 397-398] (conc. opn. of Black, J.).) The right comprehends more than just the formality of representation by a lawyer; it entitles the defendant to competent and effective legal assistance. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cronic </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 648, 654-655 [80 L.Ed.2d 657, 664-666, 104 S.Ct. 2039]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 215 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is evaluated by well-established standards. A defendant seeking relief on the basis of ineffective assistance must show both that trial counsel failed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates, and that it is reasonably probable a more favorable determination would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 584 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144]; see also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-696 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-699, 104 S.Ct. 2052].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Here, defendant has failed to show that a reasonably competent attorney, acting as a diligent advocate, would have objected at the preliminary hearing to introduction of evidence of the taped interview with Gregory. Although hearsay (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200), the evidence was admissible under the hearsay rule exceptions for inconsistent statements <em>(id.., </em>\u00a7 1235) and past recollection recorded <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1237). Because there was no sound legal basis for objection, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the evidence cannot establish ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance at trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Defendant faults his trial counsel for not asking the trial court to instruct the jury that Gregory\u2019s taped statements could not be considered for the truth of the matters asserted. He relies on the Law Revision Commission\u2019s comment to Evidence Code section 1202, stating that although Evidence Code section 1235 permits a finder of fact to consider a <em>trial witness\u2019s </em>inconsistent statement for the truth of the matter stated, no similar hearsay exception applies to the inconsistent statements of a <em>hearsay declarant. </em>(Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1979 ed.) \u00a7 1202, p. 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">What defendant\u2019s argument overlooks is that after his taped statements were played at the preliminary hearing, Gregory testified that the tape had refreshed his recollection, that he had not lied to the investigators and had told them what he knew, and that he did not disagree with any of the things he had told the officers. Because Gregory in this way adopted and reaffirmed the substance of his statements to the officers, the jury was entitled to consider those statements for their truth under Evidence Code section 1291 as part of Gregory\u2019s former testimony. An instruction correctly explaining this situation to the jury would not have benefited the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">3. <em>Gregory\u2019s unavailability as a witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">A person is unavailable as a witness if the person is \u201c[e]xempted or precluded on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the matter to which his or her statement is relevant.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (a)(1).) One such privilege, the exercise of which makes a person unavailable as a witness, is the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1223, 1251 [270 Cal.Rptr. 451, 792 P.2d 251].) To be found unavailable on this ground, a witness must not only intend to assert the privilege, but also be entitled to assert it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 431, 440-441 [247 Cal.Rptr. 121, 754 P.2d 168, 76 A.L.R.4th 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Here, Gregory demonstrated his intention to assert the privilege when he was called to testify during a foundational hearing out of the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>presence. After Gregory was sworn, the prosecutor asked whether Gregory intended to answer any questions about the murder of Amelia P., and whether he had conversed with defendant about a crime defendant had committed near the Cudjo camper on the day of the murder. Gregory refused to answer each question, expressly grounding his refusal on the privilege against self-incrimination. Defense counsel then stipulated that Gregory would assert the privilege \u201cas to any testimony he may give in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Defendant argues that even though Gregory intended to assert the privilege, Gregory did not sufficiently establish that he was entitled to do so. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">To invoke the privilege, a witness need not be guilty of any offense; rather, the privilege is properly invoked whenever the witness\u2019s answers \u201cwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute\u201d the witness for a criminal offense. <em>(Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1951) 341 U.S. 479, 486 [95 L.Ed. 1118, 1123-1124, 71 S.Ct. 814]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 441 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388].) To satisfy this standard, \u201cit need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>(Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at pp. 486-487 [95 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1123-1124].) Consistent with these principles, our Evidence Code provides that when a witness grounds a refusal to testify on the privilege against self-incrimination, a trial court may compel the witness to answer only if it \u201cclearly appears to the court\u201d that the proposed testimony \u201ccannot possibly have a tendency to incriminate the person claiming the privilege.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Here, it did not \u201cclearly appear\u201d that Gregory\u2019s proposed testimony could not have tended to incriminate him for the murder of Amelia P. Gregory had been taken into custody as a suspect in that offense. Indeed, defendant has argued, both at trial and on this appeal, that the evidence is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that Gregory, rather than defendant, killed Amelia P. Answers to the prosecution\u2019s questions about Gregory\u2019s observations on the day of the murder, and Gregory\u2019s conversations with defendant relating to the murder, could have developed evidence tending to establish Gregory\u2019s own complicity in the victim\u2019s death. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sipress </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 98, 102 [123 Cal.Rptr. 884]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Traylor </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 323, 330 [100 Cal.Rptr. 116].) Moreover, because Gregory had testified at the preliminary hearing, he could properly invoke the privilege to avoid exposing himself to a charge of perjury in that proceeding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Maxwell </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 562, 570-571 [156 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 630].) The trial court did not err in finding Gregory unavailable as a witness on the ground of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">4. <em>The right of confrontation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Both the state and federal Constitutions guarantee criminal defendants the right to confront the witnesses against them. (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.) The right of confrontation is not absolute, however; in particular, it does not preclude the prosecution from proving its case through the prior testimony of a witness who is unavailable at trial, so long as the defendant had the right and the opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the earlier proceeding at which the witness gave this testimony. (B<em>arber </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 719, 722 [20 L.Ed.2d 255, 258-259, 88 S.Ct. 1318]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 742, 784-785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Here, defendant maintains that his right of confrontation was denied by the prosecution\u2019s use of Gregory\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony. Although his attorney did cross-examine Gregory at the preliminary hearing, defendant maintains that he did not have a fair opportunity to cross-examine because Gregory\u2019s ability to think and respond coherently had been impaired by the ingestion of some drug or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The record before us does not support defendant\u2019s contention. During the preliminary hearing, Gregory\u2019s competence as a witness was not challenged. Gregory was not asked at the preliminary hearing whether he had taken drugs, and no evidence on that subject was introduced at the preliminary hearing. Although at trial defense counsel voiced his opinion that Gregory had been under the influence of drugs at the time of his preliminary hearing, he provided no evidence to support the claim. Even if we assume that Gregory had ingested some drug, moreover, it does not appear that Gregory\u2019s mental functioning was so impaired as to preclude meaningful cross-examination. Gregory\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing was lucid and responsive to the questions asked. Although his testimony was internally inconsistent, this does not appear to have been the result of inability on his part to comprehend the questions or to understand his duty as a witness to tell the truth. Rather, it appears that Gregory was reluctant to give evidence damaging to defendant and did so only under the pressure of the prosecutor\u2019s examination and after listening to the tape recording of his prior interview. The failure of defense counsel to cross-examine more vigorously may be explained as a tactical decision. Gregory had already impeached himself by giving contradictory testimony, and further probing could have resulted in testimony more damaging to defendant. The trial court did not err, therefore, in concluding that defendant had a fair opportunity to cross-examine Gregory at the preliminary hearing. Defendant has not established a violation of his right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>5. <em>Failure to grant immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Defendant contends that by not granting immunity to Gregory, and thereby removing the self-incrimination barrier to Gregory\u2019s testimony at defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecution violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation and denied him due process of law. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">At no time during proceedings in the trial court did the defense request immunity for Gregory, nor did the defense make an offer of proof as to Gregory\u2019s testimony. Because the issue of immunity was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for review on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sutter </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 806, 813 [184 Cal.Rptr. 829]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sipress, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.3d 98, 102.) Moreover, there is no authority in this state for the proposition that a prosecutor must request or the trial court must grant immunity to a witness on the ground that the witness\u2019s testimony could be favorable to the defense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hunter </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 957, 973 [264 Cal.Rptr. 367, 782 P.2d 608]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 694, 700 [224 Cal.Rptr. 37]; <em>People </em>v. <em>DeFreitas </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 835, 841 [189 Cal.Rptr. 814].) In <em>Hunter, supra, </em>we assumed without deciding that in appropriate circumstances judicially conferred use immunity might be necessary \u201cto vindicate a criminal defendant\u2019s rights to compulsory process and a fair trial[.]\u201d <em>(Hunter, supra, </em>at p. 974.) But we also said that such immunity would be required only if the witness\u2019s testimony was both clearly exculpatory and essential to an effective defense, and if no strong governmental interest weighed against the grant of immunity. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, defendant has not demonstrated that Gregory\u2019s testimony would have been clearly exculpatory or that it would have differed from his preliminary hearing testimony. And, because the issue was never raised at trial, the record is inadequate to determine whether a strong governmental interest would have weighed against a grant of immunity. Thus, defendant has failed to demonstrate the existence of circumstances in which a trial court might be required to confer use immunity to ensure a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">6. <em>Failure to inform the jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court should have either informed the jury of Gregory\u2019s refusal to testify or compelled Gregory to claim the privilege against self-incrimination in the jury\u2019s presence. We reject this contention. As we have explained in previous opinions, permitting the jury to learn that a witness has invoked the privilege against self-incrimination serves no legitimate purpose and may cause the jury to draw an improper inference of the witness\u2019s guilt or complicity in the charged offense. <em>(People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>v. <em>Hill </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 959, 992 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 839 P.2d 984]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mincey, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th 408, 441; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 730, 743.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">C. <em>Failure to Grant Immunity to Defense Witness Mitchell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The defense had James Mitchell, a state prison inmate, brought to court to testify in defendant\u2019s trial. At defense counsel\u2019s suggestion, the court appointed an attorney to advise Mitchell. After conferring with counsel, Mitchell decided not to testify and, instead, to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination, unless he received immunity. Mitchell\u2019s counsel conveyed this decision to the prosecutor. At a hearing held outside the jury\u2019s presence, the prosecutor announced that he would not request immunity for Mitchell, noting that he did not even know the subject of Mitchell\u2019s proposed testimony. Defense counsel offered to provide this information, but the prosecutor said it would make no difference to his decision. The trial court stated that it could not compel the prosecutor to request immunity. Defense counsel then said there was no point in calling Mitchell to the stand, even out of the jury\u2019s presence, when it was apparent that he would refuse to testify. The defense did not ask the court to grant immunity, nor did the defense make an offer of proof as to the testimony Mitchell would have given had he received immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Based on these facts, defendant contends: (1) the prosecutor improperly failed to request immunity for Mitchell; (2) the trial court erred in failing to grant Mitchell judicial immunity; (3) the trial court erred in failing to require that Mitchell assert under oath the privilege against self-incrimination; and (4) defense counsel\u2019s failure to call Mitchell to the stand constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">As we have previously explained, no court in this state has ever decided that granting a defense witness immunity from prosecution for his or her testimony was essential \u201cto vindicate a criminal defendant\u2019s rights to compulsory process and a fair trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunter, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 957, 974.) This court has explained that if immunity for a defense witness is ever constitutionally compelled, it is so compelled only when the witness\u2019s testimony is both clearly exculpatory and essential to an effective defense, and when no strong governmental interest weighs against the grant of immunity. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Because the defense made no offer of proof as to Mitchell\u2019s testimony, the record before us on this appeal provides no basis for determining that his testimony was either clearly exculpatory or essential to an effective defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Therefore, defendant has not shown that failure to grant Mitchell immunity resulted in the denial of defendant\u2019s rights to compulsory process and a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Also unavailing are defendant\u2019s related contentions, that the trial court on its own initiative should have compelled Mitchell to assert under oath his privilege against self-incrimination, and that defense counsel\u2019s failure to call Mitchell to the stand constituted ineffective assistance. After talking with both Mitchell and his counsel, defense counsel announced on the record that he saw no reason \u201cto even call him to the stand.\u201d Because Mitchell was a defense witness, this decision was properly for defense counsel, not the trial court. The record provides no basis for concluding that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to require Mitchell to assert the privilege under oath was one that would not have been made by a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent advocate, or that it is reasonably probable a more favorable determination would have resulted had counsel acted differently. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 572, 584; <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-696 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">D. <em>Testimonial Competence of Kevin P.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The victim\u2019s youngest son, Kevin P., testified at trial as a prosecution witness. When he gave this testimony, Kevin was seven years old. Defense counsel did not challenge Kevin\u2019s competency as a witness, and neither counsel nor the trial court questioned Kevin on voir dire. Defendant advances these contentions on the subject of Kevin\u2019s testimony: (1) the trial court erred in not raising the issue of competency on its own motion; (2) admission of the testimony violated defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution; (3) admission of the testimony violated defendant\u2019s right to a reliable verdict under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution; (4) the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on its own motion to view the testimony with caution; and (5) defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Kevin\u2019s testimonial competence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">1. <em>Trial court determination of competence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Except as provided by statute, \u201cevery person, irrespective of age, is qualified to be a witness.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 700; see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1321.) The primary statutory grounds for disqualification are inability to express oneself comprehensibly on the subject of the testimony and inability to understand the obligation to tell the truth. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 701.)  A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>party who claims that a witness lacks either or both of these basic qualifications bears the burden at trial of proving disqualification. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mincey, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 408, 444.) Moreover, to preserve for appeal a claim that a witness lacked testimonial competence, a party must object on this ground in the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Singh </em>(1920) 182 Cal. 457, 484 [188 P. 987]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scaggs </em>(1957) 153 Cal.App.2d 339, 353-354 [314 P.2d 793].) Defendant may not circumvent this objection requirement by claiming that the trial court should have inquired into the witness\u2019s qualifications on its own.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">2. <em>Right of confrontation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution gives an accused the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him [or her].\u201d (See also Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15; Pen. Code, \u00a7 686.) Although the right of confrontation requires that an accused receive \u201can adequate opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(1988) 484 U.S. 554, 557 [98 L.Ed.2d 951, 956-957, 108 S.Ct. 838]), it does not protect against testimony that is \u201c \u2018marred by forgetfulness, confusion, or evasion\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 558 [98 L.Ed.2d at p. 957], quoting <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer </em>(1985) 474 U.S. 15, 21 [88 L.Ed.2d 15, 20-21, 106 S.Ct. 292]).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We have carefully reviewed the testimony of Kevin P., and, in particular, his testimony on cross-examination. Not surprisingly, the testimony contains some inconsistencies, and the witness did not demonstrate total recall of the events on the day his mother died. But the witness\u2019s answers on the whole were lucid and responsive, and nothing in his testimony reveals either an inability to distinguish truth from falsehood (or perception from imagination) or a failure to appreciate his obligation as a witness to tell the truth. We are satisfied that the process of examination and cross-examination gave the jury an adequate basis on which to evaluate the truth of the witness\u2019s testimony. The Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause requires no more. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Owens, supra, </em>484 U.S. 554, 559 [98 L.Ed.2d 951, 957-958].)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>3. <em>Right to a reliable verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Also without merit is defendant\u2019s challenge under the federal Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment, which forbids infliction of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d Although the Eighth Amendment imposes heightened reliability standards for both guilt and penalty determinations in capital cases (see <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 625, 638 [65 L.Ed.2d 392, 403, 100 S.Ct. 2382]), defendant gives us no reason to conclude that those standards were not met here. As this court remarked in rejecting essentially the same contention, defendant \u201cwas given an opportunity to be heard and to cross-examine in a judicial forum.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mincey, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 408, 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">4. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">As we have seen, a defendant seeking relief on the basis of ineffective assistance must show both that trial counsel failed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates, and that it is reasonably probable a more favorable determination would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 572, 584; see also <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-696 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-699].) If the record contains an explanation for the challenged aspect of counsel\u2019s representation, the reviewing court must determine \u201cwhether the explanation demonstrates that counsel was reasonably competent and acting as a conscientious, diligent advocate.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].) On the other hand, if the record contains no explanation for the challenged behavior, an appellate court will reject the claim of ineffective assistance \u201cunless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Here, the record contains no explanation for defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge Kevin P.\u2019s testimony, nor does it show that counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, nor, finally, is this a situation in which there could be no satisfactory explanation for counsel\u2019s conduct. Acting as a reasonably competent defense attorney, counsel may have declined to challenge the competence of the child witness because, in counsel\u2019s judgment, the challenge would have been futile or because counsel believed that the child\u2019s testimony would on balance be helpful to the defense. Under the rule set forth above, we therefore reject the claim of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">5. <em>Jury instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">We also reject defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should have instructed the jury on its own initiative to view Kevin P.\u2019s testimony with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>caution. Section 1127f requires the trial court, \u201cupon the request of a party,\u201d to instruct the jury on evaluation of the testimony of a witness who is 10 years of age or younger.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Absent a request, however, the trial court is not required to give either the statutory instruction or some other form of cautionary instruction. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mincey, </em>supra, 2 Cal.4th 408, 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">E. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct in Jury Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor twice committed misconduct during closing argument to the jury at the guilt phase. According to defendant, the misconduct consisted in raising the issue of defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation and in appealing to racial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">1. <em>Potential for rehabilitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Defendant cites as misconduct this portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument: \u201cYou see, one of the things that\u2019s interesting is [defendant] has to portray himself in this case as the big wheeler dealer, [\u00b6] \u2018Boy, before I went to jail for grand theft person, I was making eight hundred to $1,200 a week cash.\u2019 That\u2019s not after taxes, ladies and gentlemen\u2014or that is after taxes, because he doesn\u2019t pay taxes. [\u00b6] Imagine, 40 to $60,000 a week in your pocket\u2014a week, I\u2019m sorry, a year in your pocket. I wonder when the last time you were able to tuck a $100 cash in your pocket and just go your way. If I understand what\u2019s going on in our society properly, most of us are not in that fortunate position, and then of course when he gets out of jail he\u2019s back making hundreds of dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Because the defense did not object to these statements at trial, the claim of misconduct is not reviewable on appeal unless the statement was so prejudicial that an admonition by the trial court could not have cured the harm. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 895 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282].) Here, we conclude that the argument was not prejudicial at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Defendant maintains that in the statements quoted above the prosecutor \u201cargued without evidentiary support that [defendant] would not be rehabilitated by prison, thus improperly inviting the jury to convict him for what he might do in the future rather than for what he had allegedly done in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Defendant misapprehends the argument. He evidently thinks that the final words of the quoted passage\u2014\u201c. . . when he gets out of jail he\u2019s back making hundreds of dollars\u201d\u2014constitute a prediction of future events. To the contrary, a reasonable juror would understand them as a description of past events as related in defendant\u2019s testimony. Defendant had testified that he had earned substantial profits, both before and after an incarceration for grand theft from the person, by selling rock cocaine, the evident purpose of this testimony being to show that defendant would have no need to commit a robbery and that he could afford to trade cocaine for sex. The prosecutor was merely describing this testimony, before proceeding to challenge it. In the immediately following portion of the argument, not cited by defendant, the prosecutor maintained that defendant had testified inconsistently both about the amount of his earnings and about the location of the profits remaining at the time of his arrest, and that defendant \u201cis not a wheeler dealer.\u201d No reasonable juror would understand the argument as an adverse comment on defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">2. <em>Appeal to racial prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">To persuade the jury to reject defendant\u2019s testimony that the victim had consented to sexual intercourse, the prosecutor made this argument: \u201cAnd what [defendant] wants you to believe, and what I believe to be perhaps the most telling thing in this whole case, is that this woman who, from all appearances is a happily married mother of three trying to make ends meet living out there where they can have a house they can afford, taking in sewing to help meet the family budget, keeping that kind of a house, that this woman is going to have intercourse with a strange man\u2014 frankly any man\u2014a black man, on her living room couch with her five year old in the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Prosecutorial argument that includes racial references appealing to or likely to incite racial prejudice violates the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(D.C.

Because racial prejudice can strongly compromise a juror\u2019s impartiality <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>State ofN.C., supra, </em>at p. 706; <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>McKendrick, supra, </em>at p. 157; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bain </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 839, 849 [97 Cal.Rptr. 684, 489 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>564]), even neutral, nonderogatory references to race are improper absent compelling justification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(US. </em>v. <em>Doe, supra, </em>at p. 25, fn. 63; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>at pp. 416-417, 419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Although we do not find compelling justification for the prosecutor\u2019s racial reference in this case, neither do we find prejudice to defendant. The reference to race occurred in the course of an argument listing factors that undermined the credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony that the victim had consented to sexual intercourse. The racial reference added little to the force of the argument, which relied primarily on the implausibility of the victim engaging in intercourse with a virtual stranger in the presence of her five-year-old child. The racial reference was a brief and isolated remark; there was no continued effort by the prosecutor to call attention to defendant\u2019s race or to prejudice the jury against him on account of race. We are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s racial reference in argument did not affect the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">F. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel for Failure to Object to Evidence of Prior Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Defendant contends that evidence of his prior conviction for grand theft from the person (\u00a7 487, subd. 2) was not admissible to impeach his credibility as a witness. From this premise, defendant argues that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to solicit a ruling on the use of this prior conviction for impeachment, and by eliciting testimony from defendant on direct examination admitting the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, his prior conviction for grand theft was admissible for purposes of impeachment. Grand theft necessarily involves both moral turpitude and dishonesty <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 297 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938]), it is dissimilar from and substantially less inflammatory than the charged offense of capital murder, and defendant\u2019s conviction for this offense had occurred just three years before defendant\u2019s testimony. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111].) Because the prosecution could and undoubtedly would have used the prior conviction to impeach defendant, defendant\u2019s attorney made a reasonable and common tactical decision to put the prior conviction before the jury promptly at the outset of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>direct examination. Defendant has not demonstrated that this action constituted ineffective assistance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">G. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel for Failure to Move to Suppress Evidence Seized From Camper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Defendant contends that investigating officers violated the constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches (U.S. Const., 4th Amend.) when they searched the Cudjo camper following defendant\u2019s arrest; that certain prosecution exhibits at trial (defendant\u2019s survival knife, one pair of MacGregor athletic shoes, and a pair of cut-off jeans) were the tainted fruit of this illegal search; and that he was denied his constitutional right to eff\u00e9ctive assistance of counsel (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.) by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to bring a motion to suppress this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The record before us does not support defendant\u2019s contention. Because the legality of the search was never challenged or litigated, facts necessary to a determination of that issue are lacking. For example, defendant assumes that the officers did not have a warrant authorizing the search, but he provides no citation to the record to establish that fact. Also, as the Attorney General notes, Maxine Cudjo testified at the preliminary hearing that she consented to the search of the camper, and the search might be upheld on this basis. Defendant suggests in response that the consent may be invalid, but this is just speculation. Because defendant has not proven that the search was unlawful, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be rejected. (See <em>Kimmelman </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1986) <em>All </em>U.S. 365, 375 [91 L.Ed.2d 305, 319, 106 S.Ct. 2574]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 576 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290].)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">H. <em>Waiver of Sequestered Hovey Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Before jury selection, the trial court showed the parties a proposed questionnaire to be completed by each prospective juror. Of the 56 proposed questions, 3 dealt with the prospective juror\u2019s views on the death penalty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After minor changes, the parties approved the questionnaire. While the parties were discussing the questionnaire and related jury selection procedures, the trial court suggested that the parties by stipulation dispense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the procedure mandated by <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1, 80 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301], under which the death-qualification portion of the voir dire is conducted with each prospective juror individually and in sequestration. The prosecutor and defense counsel so stipulated and defendant personally waived the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedure with the understanding that sequestered voir dire of individual prospective jurors would be available based on responses to the questionnaires and answers given in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in soliciting and accepting the parties\u2019 stipulation and defendant\u2019s personal waiver of the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedure. Defendant further contends that in agreeing to dispense with the <em>Hovey </em>procedure, defendant\u2019s trial counsel violated defendant\u2019s rights under the federal and state Constitutions to the effective assistance of counsel (U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">No statute requires the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedure, nor has any court held it to be mandated by the Constitution of this state or of the United States. Rather, this court invoked its \u201csupervisory authority over California criminal procedure\u201d to declare that henceforth the death-qualification voir dire should be conducted with each juror individually and in sequestration. <em>(Hovey, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 1, 80.) When this court adopted the rule, we cited evidence that prolonged discussion of penalty phase procedures during voir dire fosters a perception that the penalty phase will occur, and thereby conditions jurors to anticipate that they will find the defendant guilty. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 70-80.) Also, prospective jurors who see other jurors excused for cause after expressing reluctance or unwillingness to return a death verdict may conclude that the law disapproves of such attitudes and \u201cmay in consequence feel less willing to express or rely on such attitudes in their consideration of penalty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 74, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">As a general rule, a person is free to waive the advantage of any law or rule intended primarily or exclusively for that person\u2019s own benefit. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3513.) This court adopted the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedure to benefit defendants in capital cases <em>(People </em>v. <em>Visciotti </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1, 51 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 495, 825 P.2d 388] [\u201cthe sequestered voir dire is for the benefit of the defendant\u201d]), and defendant offers no persuasive reason for depriving defendants in capital cases of the freedom to waive <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedures. We conclude that capital defendants may waive the <em>Hovey </em>procedure and that defendant validly waived it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We reject also defendant\u2019s contention that his trial counsel\u2019s stipulation to dispense with the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedure constituted ineffective assistance. The record contains no explanation for counsel\u2019s decision to dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>with <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedures. In this situation, as we have seen, an appellate court will reject a claim of ineffective assistance \u201cunless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation[.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 412, 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Defendant maintains that there could be no satisfactory explanation for a decision to waive a procedure that is clearly advantageous to the defense, but the argument is based on a false premise. Defendant assumes that by stipulating to dispense with the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedure defense counsel exposed defendant to the risks of collective voir dire mentioned in <em>Hovey, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 1. But the procedure used in this case was far different from the <em>pre-Hovey </em>collective voir dire; competent counsel might well conclude that it protected defendant\u2019s interests as well as, or better than, the <em>Hovey </em>procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The record reveals that the death-qualification voir dire in this case occurred primarily through the juror questionnaires rather than through voir dire in open court. Because the prospective jurors answered the questionnaires individually and in isolation from each other, defendant received the primary advantage of <em>Hovey </em>voir dire\u2014minimizing each prospective juror\u2019s exposure to the death-qualification voir dire of others <em>(Hovey, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 1, 81). By including the death-qualification questions among a much larger group of questions, the questionnaire avoided one of the main drawbacks of the <em>Hovey </em>voir dire procedure\u2014giving special emphasis to the death-qualification aspect of voir dire. Moreover, the stipulation did not waive the <em>Hovey </em>procedure entirely; defendant retained the right to obtain sequestered voir dire of individual jurors. Although some death-qualification questioning did occur during general voir dire, competent counsel might well conclude that a slight exposure of prospective jurors to the death-qualification of others was a small price to pay for the additional \u201creduction in the pretrial emphasis on penalty\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 80) obtained by conducting death-qualification voir dire primarily through the questionnaires. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 289-290 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892] [defense counsel\u2019s stipulation limiting death-qualification voir dire to four standard questions does not establish incompetence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">I. <em>Failure to Instruct on Intent to Kill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">In <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131, 153-154 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862], this court held that the felony-murder special circumstance (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) requires proof and an express jury finding of intent to kill. Although we overruled this holding in <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306], it continues to control cases like this one in which the crime was committed after <em>Carlos </em>and before <em>Anderson. (People </em>v. <em>Fierro </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 227 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Here, the trial court did not instruct the jury that intent to kill was an essential element of either the robbery-murder or the burglary-murder special circumstance, and the jury made no finding on this issue. Error in failing to instruct on an element of a special circumstance is subject to harmless error analysis under the standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pensinger </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1210, 1254 [278 Cal.Rptr. 640, 805 P.2d 899]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Odie </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 386, 414, 415 [247 Cal.Rptr. 137, 754 P.2d 184].)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">As in the recent case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673], \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion one can draw from the evidence and the jury\u2019s findings is that defendant intentionally murdered [the victim].\u201d (At p. 47.) The victim\u2019s son testified that an intruder generally matching defendant\u2019s description bound and gagged the victim in a manner making either self-defense or provocation impossible. The body was found in that same condition. The victim had died from multiple blows to the back and sides of the head, fracturing the skull and lacerating the brain. The systematic and prolonged assault with manifestly deadly force on the helpless victim is consistent only with an intent to kill. The evidence to this effect stands uncontroverted. Relying on an alibi defense, defendant presented no evidence that the killing was other than intentional. Therefore, we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s error in not instructing on intent to kill as an element of the felony-murder special circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">J. <em>Cumulative Impact of Guilt Phase Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Defendant maintains that the cumulative impact of the guilt phase errors mandates reversal. We conclude that the errors that occurred, whether considered separately or together, were inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">III. Penalty Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Avj\">A. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">1. <em>Argument about pardon and appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">During argument to the jury at the penalty phase, defense counsel made these references to the right of appeal and the possibility of pardon or commutation of sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cYou can vote for an option of death, and you know what that is, it\u2019s a termination of life. Will it be carried out immediately? No. It\u2019ll be some time before the sentence will be imposed\u2014pardon me, carried out, not imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cOn the other hand, you have something called life without possibility of parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cIn the beginning of this case we talked about it, you were assured by the defense and also by Mr. Ogden [the prosecutor], and by the bench definitely that life without possibility of parole as it\u2019s presently understood and defined, it means exactly that period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201cIt leaves open the possibility of perhaps two other things which are somewhat\u2014if not extraordinary, at least rare events. One may be gubernatorial pardon. That is not given on whimsy. The other may be granting of an appeal which results in some other course.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">After noting that defendant continued to protest his innocence, defense counsel continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">\u201cYou have the opportunity to balance the scale, if you wish, impose a sentence of death. Ultimately that sentence may be carried out. You should assume for your purposes that if you do, it will be carried out, whether it is in 1990 or 1998 or 2061. At some point, that sentence will be carried out under the current state of the law, barring the one thing that I indicated earlier and that would be a gubernatorial pardon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Defense counsel then alluded to a television drama, apparently based on fact, in which an individual convicted of murder was shown to be innocent by evidence produced many years after the conviction. Counsel then proceeded with his argument this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">\u201cI would hope that you\u2019ll reconsider some of the evidence. We would hope that you may go back over the mechanics of this event as the People have sought to prove them to you, and that you\u2019ll come back with a determination of life without possibility of parole may be the appropriate sanction in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">\u201cYou will have done your job. Mr. Cudjo cannot look forward to early parole or benefit or credit for performing well while in prison, because those are not criteria that would set aside that kind of a result. He can then continue to exhaust what rights he may have, something may be done that brings to light perhaps a way that you folks would not or could not see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Defendant contends that the references to appeal and pardon constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136, 150-159 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d 430], we held that a defendant was denied due process of law under the state Constitution when the court instructed the jury at the penalty phase of a capital case that the governor could commute a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. We concluded that the instruction was misleading because it failed to note that the power of commutation extended to a sentence of death as well as to a sentence of life without parole. In addition, the instruction could cause jurors to speculate on future events or to impose a death verdict on the impermissible basis that the defendant might otherwise eventually be released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In a footnote, we observed that it was a \u201cclose question\u201d whether the subject of commutation should be addressed at all in jury instructions. We stated that if the jury inquired about the subject, or if the defense requested an instruction, the court should make a brief statement explaining that the power of commutation extended to both a sentence of death and a sentence of life without possibility of parole, but emphasizing that \u201cit would be a violation of the juror\u2019s duty to consider the possibility of such commutation in determining the appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>37 Cal. 3d 136, 159, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The defense argument in this case posed little risk of prejudice. Defense counsel referred to the power of pardon as extending to both the sentence of death and the sentence of life without possibility of parole, counsel characterized commutation of sentence and reversal of sentence on appeal as \u201crare events,\u201d and counsel noted that a sentence of life without possibility of parole \u201cmeans exactly that period.\u201d Nothing in counsel\u2019s argument carried the improper suggestion that the jury could take its sentencing responsibility lightly because an erroneous death sentence would be subject to correction by appeal or by commutation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fierro, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 173, 245; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1106 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659].) On the contrary, defense counsel admonished the jury to assume that a sentence of death would eventually be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Finally, we do not agree that the argument lacked a sound tactical purpose. The defense at the penalty phase was lingering doubt. Counsel argued that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was not conclusive, that defendant continued to maintain his innocence, and that evidence establishing his innocence might later come to light. In referring to the governor\u2019s powers of pardon and commutation, defense counsel\u2019s main point appeared to be that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>these powers, though rarely exercised, exist because innocent men are sometimes convicted and innocence is sometimes demonstrated by evidence produced long after a conviction. The references to the governor\u2019s powers thus reinforced the lingering doubt argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">2. <em>Argument about burden of proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Defense counsel gave the jury this description of the process of determining penalty: \u201cThe law in the state of California allows for a death penalty if 12 people like you <em>feel </em>that it is appropriate and fix it as the ultimate penalty to be handed out in any given sentence or case.\u201d (Italics added.) Later, defense counsel added: \u201c[T]he standard of proof now is less than it was before, so if you simply want to balance the ledger you could flip a coin. It would be inappropriate, but you could determine it that way, and I don\u2019t mean by flipping a coin, but you can in your own mind say, \u2018Well, we have two choices, which shall it be.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Defendant contends that by these words defense counsel mischaracterized and trivialized the burden of proof and the penalty determination process, and that there can be no justification for these statements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Preliminarily, we note that defense counsel\u2019s argument was followed by the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, and that these instructions resolved any ambiguities or misimpressions. On the subject of penalty determination, the court instructed in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201cAfter having heard all the evidence and after having heard and considered the arguments of counsel, you shall consider, take into account and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed, [\u00b6] The weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances does not mean a mere mechanical counting of factors on each side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignment of weights to any of them. You are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider. [\u00b6] In weighing the various circumstances, you simply determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the totality of the aggravating circumstances with the totality of the mitigating circumstances. [\u00b6] To return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating circumstances are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that they warrant death instead of life without parole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">The first challenged remark by defense counsel is a substantially correct description of the jury\u2019s role at the penalty phase of a capital case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>penalty jury\u2019s role is to determine, as defense counsel stated, which of the two alternative penalties\u2014death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole\u2014is appropriate. Because the determination of appropriateness is a reasoned moral decision, rather than an emotional response, the word \u201cfeel\u201d is somewhat inapt. But any confusion in this regard was dispelled by the court\u2019s instructions quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The second challenged remark by defense counsel is also substantially correct.  To return a death verdict the jury must be persuaded that aggravation so outweighs mitigation that such a verdict is appropriate, but \u201cneither [party] has the burden of proof on that issue\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 890 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 18, 58-59 [255 Cal.Rptr. 631, 767 P.2d 1109]), and the jury need not be persuaded of its sentencing decision beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 502, 553 [262 Cal.Rptr. 1, 778 P.2d 129]).  The point of counsel\u2019s remark was merely that the two penalty options were equally available, that there was no \u201cthumb\u201d\u2014in the form of a presumption, burden of proof, or other legal rule\u2014on either side of the scale, and that the jurors should therefore enter the penalty deliberations with their minds open to both potential verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">3. <em>Failure to present mitigating evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The only defense evidence at the penalty phase was defendant\u2019s testimony, in which he once again denied killing Amelia P. Defendant contends that his trial counsel failed to effectively present a lingering doubt defense to penalty, and failed to present any other evidence that would have provided a basis for a sentence less than death.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The appellate record does not disclose what mitigating evidence was available that was not presented, or what reasons defense counsel may have had for not presenting it. \u201cOn a silent record, as we have here, we will not assume that the defense counsel\u2019s failure to present mitigating evidence rendered his assistance ineffective. Any assertion that counsel was inadequate in this regard must be raised on habeas corpus.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Diaz </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 495, 566 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 353, 834 P.2d 1171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">4. <em>Perfunctory closing argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Defendant characterizes his counsel\u2019s penalty phase argument as brief (eight pages of transcript), perfunctory, unfocussed, and generally a \u201cdismal performance.\u201d The effectiveness of an advocate\u2019s oral presentation is difficult to judge accurately from a written transcript, and the length of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>argument is not a sound measure of its quality. Although defense counsel\u2019s argument in this case appears to have been somewhat lacking in clarity, not to mention eloquence, we are not persuaded that it fell below the standard of reasonably competent representation or that there is a reasonable probability that a better presentation would have resulted in a more favorable penalty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">B. <em>Ineffective Assistance for Failure to Renew Request to Admit Evidence of Confession by Defendant\u2019s Brother</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Defendant contends that his trial counsel should have renewed at the penalty phase his effort to admit the testimony of John Culver to the effect that Gregory Cudjo had confessed to the murder of Amelia P. He argues that in the penalty setting the trial court might have been persuaded to reconsider its earlier ruling excluding the evidence. Had the court admitted the evidence, it would have strengthened the lingering doubt penalty defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We have previously concluded that Culver\u2019s testimony was erroneously excluded at the guilt phase, but that the error was not prejudicial. Because the same evidentiary rules govern admissibility of evidence at the guilt and penalty phases, we question whether defense counsel demonstrates incompetence by failing to press at the penalty phase for admission of evidence excluded at the guilt phase. But we need not decide whether reasonably competent counsel would have again sought admission of Culver\u2019s testimony. For the reasons already stated, we are persuaded that Culver\u2019s testimony was lacking in credibility and could not have affected the outcome at either the guilt or penalty phases of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">C. <em>Instructions Regarding Special Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court should have instructed the jury on its own initiative not to treat the robbery and burglary special circumstances as separate circumstances in aggravation. We have previously rejected the same contention. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 471, 528-529 [273 Cal.Rptr. 537, 797 P.2d 561].) Defendant offers no new argument on this point, conceding that he raises the issue only to preserve it for federal review.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">D. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Review of Probation Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Before ruling on the automatic motion to modify penalty, the trial court announced that it had read and considered the probation report. Defendant argues that this was improper because the trial court is to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>only the evidence before the jury when ruling on the motion. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 262, 287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We conclude that any error was harmless. The trial court did not refer to any material in the probation report when giving its reasons for denying the modification motion. Therefore, we must assume that the court was not improperly influenced by the report. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Raley </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 870, 922-923 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 678, 830 P.2d 712]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fauber </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 792, 866-867 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 24, 831 P.2d 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">E. <em>Denial of Automatic Modification Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">In stating its reasons for denying the automatic motion to modify the death penalty, the trial court recited its own findings that the murder of Amelia P. was intentional, premeditated, deliberate, willful, and committed with malice aforethought, and that the murder was committed in the course of a rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Defendant contends that it was improper for the trial court to base its denial of the modification motion upon findings of intentional murder and rape that the jury never made. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">In ruling on the automatic motion for modification, the trial judge \u201cshall review the evidence, consider, take into account, and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circumstances referred to in Section 190.3, and shall make a determination as to whether the jury\u2019s findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented.\u201d (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e).) Among the aggravating circumstances specified in section 190.3 is the \u201ccircumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a)). Here, the trial judge did no more than to evaluate the circumstances of defendant\u2019s capital crime. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 668, 716-717 [268 Cal.Rptr. 706, 789 P.2d 887].) In this regard, the absence of express jury findings is not significant. The jury never made express findings on rape or intentional murder because these issues were never submitted to the jury, not because it resolved these issues in defendant\u2019s favor. In the absence of any express jury findings on these issues, the trial judge was permitted, and indeed required, to make whatever findings he deemed necessary to properly evaluate the circumstances of the offense in order to independently determine whether the weight of the evidence supported the verdict of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">F. <em>Ineffective Assistance for Failure to Make Posttrial Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">Defendant contends that his representation by trial counsel during posttrial proceedings was inadequate because counsel failed to present available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>grounds for granting a new trial and failed to provide appropriate evidence and written authorities. We reject the contention. Defendant has failed to show there were any meritorious claims to present by way of posttrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">G. <em>Cumulative Effect of Guilt and Penalty Phase Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Defendant contends that the cumulative effect of guilt and penalty phase errors requires reversal of at least the penalty verdict. We disagree. Whether considered separately or in combination, the few errors that occurred during the guilt and penalty phases of defendant\u2019s trial were inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">H. <em>Constitutionality of 1978 Death Penalty Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Defendant challenges the constitutionality of the 1978 death penalty law on a variety of grounds. We have previously rejected these contentions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Livaditis </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 759, 786 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 831 P.2d 297]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Visciotti, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 1, 78-79.) In particular, we have rejected the contention that certain aggravating factors, including the circumstances of the crime (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a)), other violent criminal activity by the defendant (\u00a7 190.3, factor (b)), and the age of the defendant (\u00a7 190.3, factor (i)), are impermissibly vague under the Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Noguera </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 599, 648-649 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 842 P.2d 1160]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tuilaepa </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 569, 594-595 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 382, 842 P.2d 1142]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawthorne </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 43, 77-79 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 133, 841 P.2d 118].)

In a criminal prosecution, the defendant\u2019s right to be heard includes the right to summon and examine witnesses whose testimony is expected to support the defense case. Indeed, \u201c[f]ew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his [or her] own defense.\u201d <em>(Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 284, 302 [35 L.Ed.2d 297, 312-313, 93 S.Ct. 1038].) The right to summon and examine defense witnesses is guaranteed by both the state and federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees to persons against whom the state brings criminal proceedings \u201cthe right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in [their] favor.\u201d The California Constitution contains a similar provision. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Because the right to compel witnesses to appear in court would be hollow and useless if the government was free to prevent those witnesses from testifying, the compulsory process guarantee encompasses a substantive right to have defense witnesses testify before the trial jury. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1988) 484 U.S. 400, 407-409 [98 L.Ed.2d 798, 809-811, 108 S.Ct. 646]; <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 39, 56 [94 L.Ed.2d 40, 56-57, 107 S.Ct. 989]; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 14, 23 [18 L.Ed.2d 1019, 1025-1026, 87 S.Ct. 1920]; see <em>In re Martin </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 1, 29 [241 Cal.Rptr. 263, 74 P.2d 374].) The Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of compulsory process, which includes the right to have the testimony of defense witnesses received in evidence, is made applicable to state criminal trials- by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>at pp. 17-19 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1022-1023]; <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52 [97 L.Ed.2d 37, 46]; <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>at p. 45, fn. 5 [94 L.Ed.2d at pp. 49-50].)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Of course, the right to present defense witnesses at trial is not absolute. Although \u201ca trial court may not ignore the fundamental character of the defendant\u2019s right to offer the testimony of witnesses in his [or her] favor,\u201d it is also true that \u201cthe mere invocation of that right cannot automatically and invariably outweigh countervailing public interests.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U.S. 400, 414 [98 L.Ed.2d 798, 813-814].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Restrictions on the right to present defense evidence are constitutionally permissible if they \u201c \u2018accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process\u2019 \u201d and are not \u201carbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u201d <em>(Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>483 U.S. 44, 55-56 [97 L.Ed.2d 37, 48-49], quoting <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra, </em>410 U.S. 284, 295 [35 L.Ed.2d 297, 308-309]; accord, <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 145 [114 L.Ed.2d 205, 211-213, 111 S.Ct. 1743, 1746-1747].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In this case, excluding the testimony of defendant\u2019s witness, John Culver, was not reasonably necessary to further any legitimate governmental interest. Indeed, the majority effectively concedes as much when it concludes that no rule of evidence justified the exclusion, and that the trial court\u2019s ruling was therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In particular, the ruling was not justified by the trial court\u2019s apparent belief that the proposed testimony would be untruthful. The decisions of the United States Supreme Court under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s compulsory process clause establish that, as one commentator has phrased it, the testimony of a defense witness may not be excluded because of doubts about the witness\u2019s credibility if the testimony is \u201ccapable of being rationally evaluated by a properly instructed jury for its probative value and weight.\u201d (Westen, <em>Confrontation and Compulsory Process: A Unified Theory of Evidence for Criminal Cases </em>(1978) 91 Harv.L.Rev. 567, 627, fn. 167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The high court first addressed this issue in 1967, in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>388 U.S. 14. In that case, a defendant\u2019s attempt to offer exculpatory eyewitness testimony was frustrated by a state rule of evidence that barred a defendant from presenting the testimony of anyone who had been charged with the same crime. The court began its analysis with a look at the historical origins of the federal compulsory process clause:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">\u201cJoseph Story, in his famous Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, observed that the right to compulsory process was included in the Bill of Rights in reaction to the notorious common-law rule that in cases of treason or felony the accused was not allowed to introduce witnesses in his defense at all. Although the absolute prohibition of witnesses for the defense had been abolished in England by statute before 1787, the Framers of the Constitution felt it necessary specifically to provide that defendants in criminal cases should be provided the means of obtaining witnesses so that their own evidence, as well as the prosecution\u2019s, might be evaluated by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">\u201cDespite the abolition of the rule generally disqualifying defense witnesses, the common law retained a number of restrictions on witnesses who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>were physically and mentally capable of testifying. To the extent that they were applicable, they had the same effect of suppressing the truth that the general proscription had had. Defendants and codefendants were among the large class of witnesses disqualified from testifying on the ground of interest. A party to a civil or criminal case was not allowed to testify on his own behalf for fear that he might be tempted to lie. Although originally the disqualification of a codefendant appears to have been based only on his status as a party to the action, and in some jurisdictions co-indictees were allowed to testify for or against each other if granted separate trials, other jurisdictions came to the view that accomplices or co-indictees were incompetent to testify at least in favor of each other even at separate trials, and in spite of statutes making a defendant competent to testify in his own behalf. It was thought that if two persons charged with the same crime were allowed to testify on behalf of each other, \u2018each would try to swear the other out of the charge.\u2019 This rule, as well as the other disqualifications for interest, rested on the unstated premises that the right to present witnesses was subordinate to the court\u2019s interest in preventing perjury, and that erroneous decisions were best avoided by preventing the jury from hearing any testimony that might be perjured, even if it were the only testimony available on a crucial issue.\u201d <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19-21 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1023-1024], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Having thus concluded that the compulsory process clause was introduced into the federal Constitution at least in part to preclude the. operation of exclusionary rules based on fear of perjured testimony, the high court recalled language in one of its earlier decisions, <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1918) 245 U.S. 467, 471 [62 L.Ed. 406, 409, 38 S.Ct. 148], referring to \u201c \u2018the conviction of our time that the truth is more likely to be arrived at by hearing the testimony of all persons of competent understanding who may seem to have knowledge of the facts involved in a case, leaving the credit and weight of such testimony to be determined by the jury or by the court ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>388 U.S. 14, 22 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1024-1025].) The court immediately noted that although the decision in <em>Rosen </em>\u201crested on nonconstitutional grounds, we believe that its reasoning was required by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d (388 U.S. at p. 22 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1024-1025].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Applying this same reasoning to the issue before it, the court concluded that the defendant had been \u201cdenied [the] right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor because the State arbitrarily denied him the right to put on the stand a witness who was physically and mentally capable of testifying to events that he had personally observed, and whose testimony would have been relevant and material to the defense.\u201d <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>388 U.S. 14, 23 [18 L.Ed.2d 1019, 1025-1026].)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has subsequently reaffirmed this view of the right of compulsory process<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a case concerning a state rule of evidence restricting a defendant\u2019s ability to testify. Referring to the common law rule that barred an accused from testifying, the court said: \u201cThere is no justification today for a rule that denies an accused the opportunity to offer his [or her] own testimony. <em>Like the truthfulness of other witnesses, </em>the defendant\u2019s veracity, which was the concern behind the original common-law rule, can be tested adequately by cross-examination. See generally Westen, The Compulsory Process Clause, 73 Mich. L. Rev. 71, 119-120 (1974).\u201d <em>(Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52 [97 L.Ed.2d 37, 46, 107 S.Ct. 2704], italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">From these decisions of the high court, I conclude that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s compulsory process guarantee requires that defense witnesses be permitted to testify to the jury, regardless of the trial court\u2019s apparent distrust of the proposed testimony, if the credibility question is one that the jury is reasonably well equipped to deal with. Here, the reasons for the trial court\u2019s apparent distrust of the defense witness\u2014his prior friendship with defendant, inconsistencies both within his testimony and between his testimony and other evidence in the case\u2014were reasons that the trial jury was competent to assess.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Finally, I reject the majority\u2019s suggestion that there was no constitutional violation in this case because the defendant\u2019s witness was barred from testifying, not by a state statute or rule of evidence, but as a result of the trial court\u2019s erroneous application of state law. The suggestion amounts to an odd distortion of the nature and purpose of the constitutional guarantee. What the state and federal Constitutions secure for the accused is the right to present a defense, not merely the right to be free of unduly restrictive state laws of evidence and procedure. When, in this case, a crucial defense witness was not permitted to testify, defendant was denied that fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Violation of the Constitutional Right to Present a Defense Requires Application of the Federal Harmless Error Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Once a reviewing court determines that exclusion of defense evidence has violated the defendant\u2019s right of compulsory process, the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>violation on the validity of the resulting conviction is determined by harmless error analysis <em>(Crane </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 683, 691 [90 L.Ed.2d 636, 645-646, 106 S.Ct. 2142]) using the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard (see <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 673, 684 [89 L.Ed.2d 674, 686-687, 106 S.Ct. 1431]).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Under this test, the appropriate inquiry is \u201cnot whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in <em>this </em>trial was surely unattributable to the error.\u201d <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1993) 508 U.S._,_ [124 L.Ed.2d 182, 189, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2081], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Application of the Federal Harmless Error Standard Compels Reversal of the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The determination of prejudice begins with an examination of the defense presented at trial, which was that defendant had consensual sexual relations with Amelia P. but did not murder her, and that his brother Gregory was the killer. The success of this defense depended in large measure on providing the jury with sufficient reasons to credit defendant\u2019s explanation and to doubt the contrary version presented through Gregory\u2019s previous statements inculpating defendant. By erroneously excluding evidence that Gregory had confessed to the killing, the trial court\u2019s ruling eviscerated this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The prosecution\u2019s case was far from compelling. The murder victim\u2019s young son, Kevin, could not identify defendant, nor did he recognize the survival knife or the cut-off jeans found in the Cudjo camper. Defendant\u2019s fingerprints were not found at the victim\u2019s home, and no bloodstains were detected on any of defendant\u2019s clothing, on any articles seized from the Cudjo camper, or on the shoes seized from defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s automobile. No articles taken from the victim\u2019s residence were found in defendant\u2019s possession, nor did any witness testify to such possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">The police inferred from their interviews with Kevin and from the shoe tracks that the murder was the work of one man. Because much of the evidence pointed as strongly to Gregory as to defendant, law enforcement suspicion initially focused equally on defendant and Gregory. Both Gregory and defendant were present in the camper to which the shoe tracks led, and both Gregory and defendant owned shoes that could have made the tracks. The cut-off jeans and the knife found in the camper were equally accessible to defendant and to Gregory.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Some of the evidence pointed more strongly to Gregory as the intruder that Kevin described. Kevin testified that the intruder, who wore a sleeveless top, did not have tattoos on his arms or any facial hair such as a mustache or beard. Defendant had tattoos on both arms, and he testified without contradiction that he had obtained them before the murder. Defendant also had facial hair on the day of the murder. Gregory, on the other hand, had neither tattoos nor facial hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Although the semen found on the murdered woman could not have come from Gregory, the murderer need not have been the person who was the source of the semen. The victim\u2019s body bore no signs of traumatic sexual assault, Kevin\u2019s testimony did not mention a sexual assault, and the physical evidence was consistent with defendant\u2019s account of consensual sexual relations with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Gregory\u2019s previous statements to sheriff\u2019s investigators, which closely tracked Kevin\u2019s description of the intruder\u2019s conduct and provided details about the interior of the murder victim\u2019s home, were perhaps the strongest evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt presented by the prosecution, yet this evidence too was equally if not more consistent with Gregory\u2019s guilt. Because Gregory did not testify at trial, the jury was never given an opportunity to judge his credibility by observing his demeanor under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Because the trial court excluded Culver\u2019s testimony, defendant\u2019s testimony was essentially uncorroborated. Evidence that Gregory had confessed to the murder would have filled a major gap in the defense case, and would have greatly increased the likelihood of the jury\u2019s entertaining a reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt. Under the circumstances, it is not possible to conclude that the guilty verdict in defendant\u2019s trial \u201cwas surely unattributable to the error.\u201d <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>508 U.S. _, _ [124 L.Ed.2d 182, 189, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Exclusion of the testimony of defense witness John Culver was error of constitutional dimension that may not be excused as harmless. I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied Feburary 9, 1994, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Mosk, J., and Kennard, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Another fundamental right deserves mention in this context. As Justice Brennan has noted, \u201cPrecluding a witness based solely on a judge\u2019s belief that the witness lacks credibility might also implicate the constitutional right to a jury trial in that it usurps the jury\u2019s central function of assessing the credibility of witnesses. The constitutional right to a jury trial would mean little if a judge could exclude any defense witness whose testimony he or she did not credit.\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U.S. 400, 430, fn. 5 [98 L.Ed.2d 798, 824] (dis. opn. of Brennan, J.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
