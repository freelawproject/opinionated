J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A4u\">Defendant appeals from an order entered on March 12, 1976 denying his motion for transfer to a drug program. <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to three counts of forgery, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:109-1, and on February 7, 1975, pursuant to a plea agreement, was sentenced to three concurrent terms of five to seven years in State Prison. While his appeal was pending defendant moved <em>pro se </em>on April 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>1975 for reduction of sentence pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:21-10(a). The trial judge denied the motion because the case was then pending before this court. <em>R. </em>2:9-l (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">On August 29, 1975 defendant filed a second motion <em>pro se </em>to reduce his sentence under <em>R. </em>3:21-10(a), which was regarded as a motion for transfer to a drug treatment program under <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b) (1). On October 16, 1975, after a hearing in which defendant was represented by counsel, the motion was denied without prejudice, because defendant had not complied with the documentation requirements of subsection (c). On November 6, 1975 this court affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">On January 16, 1976 defendant filed a third motion <em>pro se </em>to reduce sentence pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:21-10(a), which again was considered to be a motion for transfer under subsection (b). The motion was denied on March 12, 1976. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>140 <em>N. J. Super. </em>459 (Law Div. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The trial judge noted that although the present motion was barred by the 20-day limitation under <em>R. </em>3:21-10(a), it was \u201cobviously within the \u2018at any time\u2019 language of <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b), if \u2018at any time\u2019 is to be read literally.\u201d 140 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 464. However, the judge found that a literal construction would seriously impair the stability of \u201cthe whole penal structure\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">* * <em>r </em>Trial courts would be free to tinker with validly imposed sentences at any time during the continuation of the custodial portion thereof. Finality, the public policy of an end to court concern with a particular case, would be meaningless. Motions to change a sentence could be brought years after the judgment of conviction. Theoretically, a motion would be tenable even after denial of parole release. Attempts to \u201cjudge shop\u201d in a post-conviction sense would be fostered. Endless filing of groundless motions would be encouraged. [at 468-469]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">He found that expanding the 60-day period would constitute \u201can attempt through the rule-making power to change substantive law \u2014 a procedure condemned in <em>Winberry v. Salis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>bury,\u201d and would infringe upon the executive\u2019s authority to pardon. At 469-470.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">He concluded that in order to avoid the unconstitutional and undesirable results noted above, the rule should be interpreted as \u201cappl[ying] to the exceptional case of the addict, but it [the motion] must be made \u2018at any time\u2019 within the fundamental 60-day period of limitation.\u201d At 472-473. Since defendant had not filed his motion within 60 days of the original sentence or within 20 days of this court\u2019s affirmance of the sentence, the trial judge denied the motion as being out of time. At 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">This appeal followed, and because of the importance of the question presented we have granted leave to the Attorney General to appear and file a brief, <em>amicus curiae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Defendant and the Attorney General argue that the trial judge erred in that (1) the words \u201cat any time\u201d in <em>R. </em>3 :21-10(b) were meant to apply literally; (2) such a construction does not unconstitutionally extend the jurisdiction of sentencing courts, but rather creates an appropriate procedure for the exorcise of the inherent jurisdiction conferred upon the Superior Court by <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a7111, par. 2; (3) a literal interpretation would also not unconstitutionally infringe upon the executive\u2019s authority to pardon since, although some functions of the judiciary and the executive must overlap to a certain degree, the act of reducing a sentence is part of the judicial function of rendering a judgment and is, therefore, distinguishable from the executive\u2019s power of clemency which abridges the enforcement of the judgment, and (4) a literal reading of the rule would not lead to the instability of the whole penal structure since the procedural requirements set forth in <em>B. </em>3:21-10(c) and the criteria set forth in <em>State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>69, 86 (1975), adequately insure against that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Under the common law the authority of a trial judge to modify a criminal sentence terminated with the expiration of the court term in which the sentence was originally imposed. <em>State v. Kowalczyk, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>231, 233 (1949). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>principle was first embodied in <em>L. </em>1898, c. 237, \u00a755, which provided that a court would have the power to modify a sentence \u201cat any time during the term in which the judgment is entered.\u201d However, due to the difficulties which resulted in implementing that rule, see <em>State v. </em>Kowalczyk, 3 <em>N. J. </em>at 233, the Legislature enacted <em>L. </em>1921, c. 236, \u00a71, which provided for a standardized period of six months from the date of judgment within which sentence modification could be made. Subsequently, the Legislature enacted <em>L. </em>1928, c. 231, which restricted the period of modification to 30 days from the date of judgment. <em>R. S. </em>2:190-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Following the adoption of the 1947 Constitution <em>R. </em>2:7\u201413 was promulgated extending the time limitation for modification of sentence from 30 to 60 days. <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a711, par. 3. The trial judge indicated that this was a proper exercise of the judicial rule-making power only because \u201c60 days would be well within the concept of \u2018before the end of the term\u2019 of the common law and the maximum of six months established at one time by the Legislature.\u201d 140 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 467. In 1967, <em>R. </em>3:7-13 (a) was amended. While the 60-day limitation period for filing was retained, it provided that an order changing a custodial sentence to permit transfer to a narcotic treatment center could be made \u201cat any time.\u201d As part of the 1969 revision, subsections 13(a) and (b) were redesignated as <em>R. </em>3:21-10 without significant changes. In 1975, however, the rule was again amended, removing the exception for drug transfer from subsection 10(a) and placing it in subsection 10(b) with two new exceptions for illness and joint application. Subsection 10(c) was also added, which now provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">A motion filed pursuant to paragraph (b) hereof shall be accompanied by supporting affidavits and such other documents and papers as set forth the basis for the relief sought. A hearing need not be conducted on a motion filed under paragraph (b) hereof unless the court, after review of the material submitted with the motion papers, concludes that a hearing is required in the interest of justice. \u2756 $ *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>There can be no question as to whether the phrase \u201cat anytime\u201d was meant to be interpreted literally. The report of the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Criminal Practice, 98 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>321 (1975), states in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">* * * The Committee determined that while the judiciary has not exercised the power in the past, the courts have the inherent power, subject to any specific limitations set down by tbe Supreme Court, to reduce or change a sentence at any time. <em>Accordingly, the Supreme Court can amend the court rule to extend the time limitation for reduction or change of sentence without limit. </em>[98 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>at 43; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Moreover, in two recent cases it has been indicated that a literal interpretation of the language is to be employed. See <em>e. g., State v. Tumminello, </em>70 <em>N. J. </em>187, 192, n.1 (1976); <em>State v. Williams, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>290, 301 (App. Div. 1976), certif. granted 70 <em>N. J. 524 </em>(1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In concluding that the power to modify a sentence is jurisdictional and therefore a matter of substantive law, the trial judge relied on a number of cases in the federal sector where applications for changes in sentence have been made under <em>Fed. R. of Crim. Proc. </em>35 (which provides for a time limitation period of 120 days) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">* * * Under the federal system once the specified time period after imposition of sentence has run, the court has lost jurisdiction over the subject matter and cannot entertain the application. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>457 <em>F. </em>2d 1319 (3 Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Gorman, </em>431 <em>F. </em>2d 632 (5 Cir. 1970); <em>United States v. Ellenbogen, </em>390 <em>F. </em>2d 537 (2 Cir. 1968), <em>cert. </em>den. 393 <em>U. S. </em>918, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>241, 21 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 206 (1968). [140 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 469].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">However, these cases are inapposite because, unlike the situation in the federal sphere, both our Supreme Court and the Superior Court obtain jurisdiction directly from the Constitution. <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a71, par. 1. Moreover, as noted previously, our Supreme Court has explicit constitutional authorization to make rules governing practice and procedure. <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a7TI, par. 3. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Accordingly, since the Law Division has inherent jurisdiction to hear criminal matters, <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a7111, pars. 2 and 3, <em>R. </em>3 :21-10(b) merely provides an appropriate procedure for sentencing in the exercise of that jurisdiction. See <em>Winberry v. </em>Salisbury, 5 <em>N. J. </em>240, 247-48 (1950), <em>cert. </em>den. 340 <em>U. S. </em>877, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>638 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The fact that <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b) may have an impact upon the substantive result makes it no less of a rule of procedure on that account. <em>Busik v. </em>Levine, 63 <em>N. J. </em>351, 364, 367 (1973) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">The constitutional grant of rule-making power as to practice and procedure is simply a grant of power; it would be a mistake to find in that grant restrictions upon judicial techniques for the exercise of that power, and a still larger mistake to suppose that the grant of that power impliedly deprives the judiciary of flexibility in the area called \u201csubstantive\u201d law. [63 <em>N. J. </em>at 363]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In <em>State v. Haines, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>550, 558-559 (1955), the court rejected the claim that then <em>B. B. </em>3:3-10, which extended the term of a grand jury beyond that date it would ordinarily cease to function, was an attempt to make rules governing substantive matters, finding that the subject matter was clearly procedural within the rule-making power of the Supreme Court pursuant to <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. VI, \u00a711, par. 3. <em>Cf. New Shrewsbury v. Block </em>115, <em>Lot </em>4, 74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1, 8-9 (App. Div. 1962), finding that the rule providing for the time period within which to make a motion to reopen judgments is procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Nor do we find the rule to- constitute an infringement on the executive\u2019s power to pardon, since that power is clearly distinguishable from the judiciary\u2019s power to modify sentences. As was noted in <em>United States v. </em>Benz, 282 <em>U. S. </em>304 (1930) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">To render judgment is a judicial function. To carry the judgment into effect is an executive function. To cut short a sentence by an act of clemency is an exercise of executive power which abridges the <em>enforcement </em>of the judgment, but does not alter it qua judgment. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>reduce a sentence by amendment alters the terms of the judgment itself and is a judicial act as much as the imposition of the sentence in the first instance. [282 <em>U. S. </em>at 311, 51 S. <em>Ct. </em>at 1151</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">See also, <em>United States v. Ellenbogen, </em>390 <em>F. </em>2d 537, 540 (2 Cir. 1968); Report of Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Criminal Practice, 98 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We find the trial judge\u2019s concern with respect to the risk the rule presents in impairing the stability of the whole penal structure also to be unfounded. <em>R. </em>3:21\u201410 (c) requires the submission of supporting documentation and review before a trial judge need consider granting a hearing on the motion. Trial judges are required to be particularly circumspect in their consideration of such applications in this regard. <em>State v. McKinney, </em>140 <em>N. J. Super. </em>160 (App. Div. 1976) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Although <em>R. </em>3:21-10(b) evidences a policy to facilitate rehabilitation of drug addicts in the hope that they may be restored to good health and become useful citizens in the community, <em>State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>69, 84-85 (1975), such a policy competes with the policy to protect our citizens against all violators, whether they are repeating violators or not. The welfare of our citizens should be first and foremost. This therefore calls upon trial judges to be particularly circumspect in their consideration of such applications. As stated in <em>State v. Davis, supra </em>at 86: \u201cThe ultimate issue for determination is whether the purposes for which the custodial sentence * * * might reasonably be continued outweigh the interests sought to be served by transfer to a narcotics treatment center.\u201d [at 163]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In addition, a judge to whom such an application is made must consider whether there is present addiction, and whether the purposes for continued custody outweigh the interests sought to be served by transfer to a drug treatment facility. <em>State v. Davis, </em>above, 68 <em>N. J. </em>at 86; <em>State v. Williams, </em>above, 139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 299-300; <em>State v. McKinney, </em>above, 140 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The order of the Law Division is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
