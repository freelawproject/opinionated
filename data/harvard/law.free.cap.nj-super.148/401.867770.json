The question presented is whether the federal income tax liability of decedent\u2019s widow on the proceeds of a pension provided by decedent\u2019s employer may be applied in reduction of the pension\u2019s \"clear market value\u201d within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:34-5. The plan under which the pension is to be paid is a noncontributory, \"qualified\u201d plan, the benefits of which are exempt from federal estate taxation under \u00a7 2039(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>The claimed reduction was disallowed by the Division of Taxation for the reason that the \u201cdecedent was not liable for the income tax on the pension plan for the taxable period in which his death occurred.\u201d As the Transfer Inheritance Tax Bureau indicated, the proceeds of the pension do not \u201crepresent income which was includable in the decedent\u2019s Federal Income Tax Return for the taxable period in which his death occurred under the pre-1.942 Internal Revenue Code.\u201d Had it been includable, allowance for the federal income tax liability thereon would have been made in the valuation of decedent\u2019s annuity policy included in his estate pursuant to <em>N. J. A. C. </em>18:26-8.10(d), since repealed. This regulation provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">Where an asset reported in an estate or a taxable transfer to a beneficiary subjects tbe estate or beneficiary to an income tax liability by reason of income at death which under the pre-1912 Internal Revenue Code required that there be included in tbe income of a decedent for the taxable period in which his death occurred all the income accrued up to the date of his death, but which under the 1942 amendments to the Internal Revenue Code were not properly includible in computing the decedent\u2019s taxable income for the taxable year ending with tile date of bis death or for a previous taxable year under the method of accounting employed by the decedent, allowance may be made for the income tax liability less the proportionate amount of the Federal estate tax, if any, in determining the value of the asset or transfer. The claim for reduction must be accompanied by a statement showing the computation of the reduction claimed as pertaining to the; income at death item. However, income at death which is determined to be \u201cIncome In Respect Of A Decedent\u201d merely because it is \u201cattributable\u201d t.o the decedent\u2019s activities shall not be considered in the valuation of such an asset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Under tills regulation such tax liability is treated as a debt of decedent and the reduction is allowed on that basis. Although the taxpayer is not seeking a \u201cdeduction\u201d as snch, in applying the concept of \u201cclear market value\u201d it is relevant to note that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:34-5 allows only \u201cthe following deductions and no others\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>a. Debts of the decedent owing at the date of death * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">b. Funeral and last illness expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">c. Administration expenses; fees of executors and attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">d. Proportion of State, County and local taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">e. Transfer taxes paid or payable to other states or territories or the District of Columbia or foreign countries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The regulation was therefore fully consistent with the legislative policy expressed by the statute. Obviously, the income taxes which the decedent\u2019s widow will be required to pay on the annuity as it is received cannot be treated as a debt of decedent any more than can income taxes chargeable to any recipient of income from property of which he is the transferee by inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The taxpayer\u2019s argument that the regulation is deficient on equal protection grounds does not prevail. It was obviously adopted to allow for cases arising under \u00a7 691 of the Internal Revenue Code, 1954, pursuant to which all items of income in respect of a decedent which are not properly includable in a return for a period up to the date of death is included in the gross income for the taxable year when received, of the person who acquires the right to receive the amount. In differentiating, for purposes of allowing a reduction in market value, between the income tax liability of decedent and that of the beneficiary the classifications rest upon a rational basis. We perceive no invidious discrimination. See <em>Taxpayer\u2019s Ass\u2019n of Weymouth Tp. v. Weymouth </em>Tp., 71 <em>N. J. </em>249, 280-283, 364 <em>A. </em>2d 1016 (1976); <em>Kenny v. </em>Byrne, 144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>243, 257-258, 365 <em>A. </em>2d 211 (App. Div. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that <em>N. J. A. C. </em>18:26-8.10 (d) is \u201cconstitutionally void for vagueness\u201d is clearly without merit. <em>B. </em>2:11-3(e) (1) (E). Although it might have been more clearly articulated, it is expressed with sufficient clarity to withstand attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
