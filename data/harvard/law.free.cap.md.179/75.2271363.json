One, a demurrer prayer, the other, contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">About one-thirty o\u2019clock on the morning of January 22nd, 1939, John Henry Hafele was struck by an automobile owned and driven by Louis S. Sugar, the defendant, appellant, at or near the intersection of North and Collington Avenues in Baltimore City. The defendant was the only eyewitness who saw everything, but others were soon on the scene and one of them helped the victim of the accident into the defendant\u2019s automobile, wherein he was driven to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, where he died February 14th, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>John H. Hafele lived alone on the second floor of a building No. 2140 E. North Avenue, at the northwest corner of North Avenue and Collington Avenue, the entrance to his apartment being on Collington Avenue about 20 to 25 feet north of North Avenue. He was a paper hanger by trade. Between 1:15 and 1:30 he went into the Keystone Tavern, located at the southwest corner of North and Collington Avenues, where he bought a half pint of whiskey and two lemons. Thomas E. Collins, who waited on him, said he had one glass of beer; about 2 to 2:15 o\u2019clock Hafele left for his home across North Avenue, taking the bottle of liquor and lemons with him. He did not deny saying in a statement given four days after the accident that Hafele \u201cdrank some liquor and beer.\u201d He said Hafele \u201cwas perfectly sober.\u201d Andrew R. Edie, an employee of the tavern, \u201cdid not notice whether he was drunk or sober.\u201d ^</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">J. L. Slaysman, walking west on the south side of North Avenue, had just crossed Collington Avenue, when he heard \u201ca crash like a thud,\u201d looked around and saw something \u201cflying around in the air that looked like a piece of cardboard and it hit the ground, and it was a man, and I went over there and helped the man put him in the car. When I saw the automobile, it was in the intersection on the northwest corner of North Avenue near the curb. It was going west on North Avenue\u201d; when he first saw it, \u201cit was right in the intersection, right at the corner of the store, in front of the store. Right in the middle of the intersection where people are supposed to walk across the street. Then the car drifted down a little bit. * * * There was a very strong smell of liquor around. The alcohol was in the air, you could smell freely. * * * It was like alcohol had been spilled.\u201d He was \u201cpretty sure the headlights were lit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Louis S. Sugar, the defendant, testified that, as he came to the second tree past Collington Avenue \u201cit seems as though there was some one that stumbled from the tree, had been holding onto the tree, or stumbled out. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the center of the street, and I applied my brakes.\u00a1and tried to swerve to keep from hitting him, yet it struck the right side of my car. My car was practically stopped when I struck it. He stumbled out from the north curb.\u201d He said there was no one \u201cin sight and then I shouted and a tall fellow helped me put Mr. Hafele in the car.\u201d He denied that Slaysman was at the scene of the accident or helped him. Slaysman had testified that \u201canother man got on the other side and helped pull him in the seat.\u201d He came about five minutes after the accideht. Neither he nor the defendant knows who he was. The defendant said his car did not stop in the intersection, but \u201cprobably forty to fifty feet past (west) of the intersection.\u201d He said at the trial, \u201cMr. Hafele had been drinking.\u201d On cross-examination he . said, \u201cHe seemed to be in right much pain when I put him in. the automobile. I think he was dazed.\u201d In his report to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, he was \u201capproaching close to Collington Avenue, when suddenly a man stepped, out in front of my car and I struck him. I immediately stopped my car and on my way to the-hospital, I picked up .Officer Royce Batte, of the. N. E. District. We continued on to the hospital and the man was- so intoxicated that we had difficulty in finding out his name.\u201d Officer Batte said \u201che had been drinking.\u201d .The officer also said, \u201cI helped to carry him and he was in much. pain; I examined Mr. Hafele\u2019s clothes. His right pocket was sopping, wet. There was glass in it. There was whiskey in the pocket.\u201d The evidence is that the bottle had not b\u00e9en -opened; the top and seal had not been broken, The defendant further testified that .when he \u201cfirst saw Mr. Hafele * \u25a0* * I sounded my horn and applied brakes, at th\u00e9 same time.\u201d He said his right front fender hit Hafele.on the right.side, so that he was facing, north, with his home directly in front of him. He gave 'the \u25a0speed of- his car at ,15-to 18 miles;.an hour. The;X-ray disclosed fractures \u00f3f five ribs.and three in. his leg,;all on the . right sid\u00e9, and a- laceration. of the scalp. : The physician, who saw-him. first.rat.\u00a1the'hospital said, - \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>smelled liquor, but that is all I can say. I noticed it in the accident room when I walked in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Charles Kohlman, a friend of Hafele\u2019s who resided in the next block, was called about two o\u2019clock and went to the hospital, was in the operating room, where he said he \u201csmelled odor of alcohol only on his clothes. His clothes were saturated with it.\u201d He went back from the hospital to the scene of the accident and found the \u201csmashed\u201d remains of his eye glasses about two doors west of the store in the corner building; each building in that block is eleven feet wide. About daybreak he went back and found the lenses all broken into small pieces, \u201cabout a foot west of that tree.\u201d There are two small trees, according to the plat, on or about the dividing line between the store and adjoining house, and one between the 4th and 5th houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">K. N. Speight, who has the grocery store in the corner building, over which Hafele lived, was in the rear of his store, heard brakes screech, and as soon as he had finished, he came out front and saw a man being loaded into a car, which drove on; he did not then know who it was. He found a hat, which later turned out to be Hafele\u2019s, about 6 feet west of the first tree, which would be about 17 feet from the building line on Collington Avenue. Speight also said that about three o\u2019clock, the same morning, the defendant had returned to the scene of the accident. \u201cHe told me he seen the gentleman coming across the street and he blowed his horn. That is all he told me. He told me he was coming across from the Keystone Saloon and saw him and sounded his horn. He did not tell me anything else.\u201d The defendant denied Kohlman\u2019s statement that he saw Hafele crossing the street, but didn\u2019t deny Speight\u2019s, merely saying he did not recall seeing him that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">This is substantially all of the evidence upon which both parties rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The appellant\u2019s contentions are that there is no legally sufficient evidence of his negligence, or, assuming the defendant was negligent, the contributory negligence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s decedent was uncontradicted and so patent as to justify the granting of his \u201cB\u201d prayer. The defendant\u2019s \u201cA\u201d prayer, which had been offered and refused at the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case, was again offered at the end of the case without modification. It read: \u201cThe jury are instructed that the plaintiff has offered no evidence legally sufficient,\u201d etc. The court\u2019s ruling on this prayer was proper, as the court cannot rule on the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence alone, after the defendant\u2019s evidence also is in. <em>Commercial Casualty Ins. Co. v. Zajic, </em>175 Md. 368, 373, 1 A. 2nd 903, and cases there cited. We are of the opinion, however, that, even if the prayer as resubmitted had been in proper form, it should have been refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The contentions of both parties are centered in the respective rights of way of the defendant and the deceased, each claiming that the other had encroached on the other\u2019s superior right at the instant of the accident. The rule of the road with respect to vehicles and predestrians is contained in section 209, article 56 of the Code, Act of 1929, ch. 224, as follows: \u201cAll pedestrians shall have the right of way at street crossings in the towns and cities of this state, except where traffic is controlled * * * by traffic officers. Between street crossings in such towns and cities, vehicles shall have the right of way.\u201d Their respective duties are further defined in <em>Merrifield v. Hoffberger Co., </em>147 Md. 134, 142, 127 A. 500, 503, quoting <em>Berry on Automobiles, </em>(4th Ed.)p. 328, sec. 330, where it is said: \u201cWhen two or more persons moving in different directions approach a crossing at the same time or in such manner that if both or all continue their respective courses there is danger of collision, then the one having the preference [under the la.w] is entitled to the first use of such crossing, and it is the duty of others to give him reasonable opportunity to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The defendant, who is the only one testifying to the collision from the instant of impact, seems to assume that no one else could have testified. Slaysman said he heard a thud, looked and saw an object in the air, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>turned out to be a man, and he says the man was hit while in the pedestrian\u2019s crossing. The statement, together with the nature of the man\u2019s injuries, and the way his hat and glasses were scattered, is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s statement that his car was \u201cpractically stopped\u201d when it struck the pedestrian. The defendant seems to rely on intoxication as a defense, but in that he is contradicted. Collins, who saw him while he was in and leaving the saloon, said he was \u201cperfectly sober.\u201d Officer Batte said he had been drinking. Kohl-man said he \u201csmelled the odor of alcohol only on his clothes.\u201d Dr. Aungst said, \u201cI smelled liquor, but that is all I can say.\u201d It is easily accounted for; his clothing had absorbed the half pint of liquor he had just bought. The defendant said he was \u201cdazed,\u201d which coupled with the smell of his whiskey-wet clothing, could easily have created the impresi\u00f3n of intoxication. The evidence on that point was so contradictory as to be for the jury, though the mere fact of intoxication or sobriety is not necessarily evidence of negligence or exculpation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The defendant\u2019s story on the witness stand is that the man stumbled in front of his car, from the north sidewalk on North Avenue at a point about thirty-five to forty feet west of the intersection. If he did this, he backed into the path of the car, as he was facing north and all of his injuries were on the right side of his body. Then it conflicts with the statement made by defendant in his report to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles that the man had suddenly stepped in front of his car. The decedent resided in a house at the corner of North and Collington Avenues, and the direct route from the saloon was over the pedestrian\u2019s cross-walk, which was the projection of the Collington Avenue sidewalk across North Avenue. He was going in the direction of his home, with defendant approaching from his right. The circumstances are all in conflict with the probabilities of the defendant\u2019s story as to where and how the accident happened. Then Slaysman put the place as the pedestrian\u2019s eross-walk. With all of these contradictions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>to material facts, the trial court could not say as a matter of law that the defendant was not negligent, or that the decedent, with the statutory right of way in his favor, was guilty of contributory negligence. In such a situation and under such circumstances, \u201cit was incumbent upon the driver of the defendant\u2019s automobile to be continuously watchful for the possible presence of persons on the crossing, and to have the speed of the car so reduced and controlled that it could be readily stopped or diverted in time to avoid collision with pedestrians who might be exposed to such danger.\u201d <em>Sheer v. Rathje, </em>174 Md. 79, 83, 197 A. 613, 614. This case is another illustration of the hazard of driving an automobile at night even on lighted streets. The only visibility is a short and narrow lane in front bounded by the range of headlights. When a pedestrian comes into view from either side, he often seems to come suddenly from nowhere. Instead of excusing a driver, it only adds to the degree of care required. The other point raised by the defendant is on the refusal of his third prayer, which was a follows: \u201cThe jury are instructed that if they believe from the evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent could have avoided the accident complained of by the use of ordinary care on his part, then their verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">This prayer should have been granted; it is almost a copy of the defendant\u2019s second prayer which had been rejected in <em>Northern Cent. Ry. Co. v. State, use of Geis, </em>31 Md. 357, of which this court, said, \u201cit ought to have been granted. It states a proposition that is sustained by all the cases upon the subject.\u201d And recently we said in <em>Chasanow v. Smouse, </em>168 Md. 629, 178 A. 846, 847, \u201cthe advantage or preference which the pedestrian has at a street crossing does not absolve him from the duty to observe the rule of due care and caution to avoid injury; he catinot invoke the protection of the statute or rule of the road if he blindly crosses without looking for approaching traffic.\u201d But the plaintiff argues that the rejection of the prayer, even if erroneous, was harmless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>because covered by two other prayers of the defendant which were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The complaint of the defendant would not be without merit, if not covered by any other instruction. <em>Washington, B. &amp; A. Elec. Ry. Co. v. State, use of Kolish, </em>153 Md. 119, 127, 137 A. 484; <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Held, </em>157 Md. 551, 558, 146 A. 755; <em>Salisbury Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Lowe, </em>176 Md. 230, 244, 4 A. 2nd 440; <em>Caledonian Ins. Co. v. Traub, </em>86 Md. 86, 99, 37 A. 782. All that the prayer does is to define an act or omission of a plaintiff, which, if true, would amount to negligence on his part contributing to his injury. The plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer and the defendant\u2019s second in effect embodied the same proposition, the defendant\u2019s fifth prayer saying that, \u201cthe jury must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the accident was caused solely by some act of negligence on the part of the defendant and without any negligence on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent contributing thereto in any way.\u201d We, therefore, are of the opinion that no harm was done the defendant by the refusal of his third prayer, and the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
