The purpose of the provisions is to secure the determination of causes according to their real merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">\u2022 To accomplish such purpose it has been the practice of this Court to allow any amendment to the process, pleadings or pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>ceedings that did not involve the change of parties or work an injury to the opposing party, no matter whether it went to form or substance. Such being the law and the practice in this as well as in other states, it is not necessary to cite authorities to sustain it, but the following Delaware cases may be mentioned: <em>Benjamin v. Boyce, 2 Harr. </em>316; <em>Townsend v. Townsend, 2 Harr. </em>277; <em>McColley v. Collins, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>391; <em>Waples v. Adkins, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>381; <em>Hughes v. Diamond Match Co., </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>140, 39 <em>A. </em>772; <em>Harmon v. Collins, 2 Penn. </em>36, 45 <em>A. </em>541; <em>Bellah v. Hilles, 2 Penn. </em>34, 43 <em>A. </em>89; <em>Lapham v. P. B. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 4 Penn. </em>421, 56 <em>A. </em>366; <em>Gatta v. P. B. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>1 <em>Boyce, </em>293, 76 <em>A. </em>56; <em>Beveridge v. Shipley, </em>7 <em>Boyce, </em>579, 110 A. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In the case of <em>Bellah v. Hilles </em>the Court permitted the process, in foreign attachment, to be amended. It is, therefore, particularly in point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
