nevertheless, the said defendant then and there, by its said servant, so carelessly and improperly drove, governed and directed its motor truck aforesaid, that by and through the carelessness, negligence and improper conduct of the said defendant, by its said servant in that behalf, the said automobile of the plaintiff was not given the right of way, and the said motor truck of the said defendant then and there struck with great force and violence the said automobile of the plaintiff. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">While the language of the second and third counts differs from that of the first count, it is practically the same with respect to the position of the cars at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The plaintiff contends that under the laws of this State, he was entitled to the right of way over the operator or driver of a vehicle approaching the intersection from the left, and that he is not compelled to negative contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The statute upon which the plaintiff relies, being <em>chapter </em>13, of <em>volume </em>33, of the <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">\u201cThe operator or driver of a vehicle upon any street, road or alley within this State shall have the right of way over the operator or driver of another vehicle which is approaching from the left on an intersecting street, road or alley; and shall give the right of way to an operator or driver of a vehicle approaching from the right on an interesecting street, road or alley.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">A declaration is defined by Chitty to be \u201ca specification in a methodical and legal form of the circumstances'which constitute the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d He further sets forth that such circumstances consist of the statement of a legal right and of an injury to such right. 1 <em>Chitty on Pleading, page </em>240.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In the declaration which now demands our consideration, the plaintiff sets forth his right at the intersection over the defendant who was approaching said intersection from the left, and his injury to said right brought about by the defendant colliding with his automobile. Under the generally recognized rules of pleading, is he required to do more? The following quotation from Chitty seems to have direct bearing on the question now before the Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cAlthough any particular fact may be'the gist of a party\u2019s case, and the statement of it is indispensable, it is still a most important principle of the law of pleading that in alleging the fact it is unnecessary to state such circumstances as merely tend to prove the truth of it. The dry allegation of the fact, without detailing a variety of minute circumstances which constitute the evidence of it, will suffice. The object of the pleadings is to arrive at a specific issue upon a given and material fact, and this is attained, although the evidence of such fact, to be laid before the jury, be not specifically developed in the pleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The plaintiff simply alleges that while his automobile was being driven in a northerly direction on the State Highway, it was run into and damaged by the defendant\u2019s motor truck which was being driven in an easterly direction, on a road intersecting the State Highway approaching his automobile from the left, and his superior right to that of the defendant at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The relative positions of the two motor vehicles with respect to the intersection, prior to the accident, may be material evidence, to go to the jury under the pleadings upon which issue is finally joined, in considering whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, but the plaintiff is not bound to allege it in his declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The language used by the Court in the case of <em>Grant v. Marshall, </em>2 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(32 <em>Del.) </em>239, 121 <em>A. </em>664, was in its charge to the jury after it had heard all of the evidence produced at the trial relative to the accident, and could not have been intended to apply to the pleadings in similar cases. Likewise, the other cases cited by counsel for the defendant are distinguishable from the case now before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The demurrer is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
