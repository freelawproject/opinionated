Rogers against the Edwin Bell Company and/or Charles H. Rogers, the American Mutual Liability Insurance Company of Boston not being a party to the proceeding. Said insurance company was represented at the hearing by counsel, and was interested in the result of the proceeding, but that did not operate to make it a party to the proceeding as originally brought before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The Court is, therefore, of the opinion that the insurance company had not the right to take the appeal from the decision of the Board, and the same is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
