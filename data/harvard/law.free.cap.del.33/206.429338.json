Palmer, a witness produced by the plaintiff, after testifying that he had been in the life insurance business for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>great many years and was familiar with the standard mortality tables of life insurance companies, was then asked on direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">What is the expectancy of life of a boy of thirteen years of age?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Huxley, attorney for defendant, objected on the ground that while the question would be admissible if Braderman had been killed, it was not admissible as he was merely injured.</p>\n<author id=\"b223-8\">Harrington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ant\">It has appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were permanent; we, therefore, overrule the objection. See <em>Chamberlayne\u2019s Hand Book on Ev., </em>\u00a7 369, note; <em>Coons v. Pritchard, </em>69 <em>Fla. </em>362, 68 So. 225, <em>L. R. A. </em>1915F, \u00a7 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Milton Braderman, the infant plaintiff, after testifying that he climbed up on the bumpers of the train blocking the crossing, was then asked in direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Will you tell the Court and jury whether or not you knew it was dangerous to do that?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Huxley, attorney for defendant, objected on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s mental capacity to appreciate danger could not be proved in this manner.</p>\n<author id=\"b223-14\">Harrington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac0\">We sustain the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\"> The same witness, in direct examination, was also asked the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">Before the train gave the jerk that caught your foot, was any signal by bell, whistle, or in any other manner given by it, to warn you that it was about to start?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">Huxley, attorney for defendant, objected on the ground that it had appeared that Braderman was a trespasser and defendant company was, therefore, under no obligation whatever to give him any warning unless it knew that he was on the train or by the exercise of due care and caution should have known that he was there. He cited <em>Cherry v. St. L. &amp; S. F. R. R. Co., </em>163 <em>Mo. App. </em>53, 145 S. <em>W. </em>837; <em>Clev., etc., R. Co. v. Tartt, 64 F. </em>823, 12 <em>C. C. A. </em>618; <em>Kirtley v.

Co., </em>252 <em>Pa. </em>107, 97 A. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Morford, attorney for plaintiff, cited <em>McCoy v. P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., 5 Houst. </em>599, and <em>Tully\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., </em>3 <em>Penn. </em>455, 464, 50 A. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Huxley, attorney for defendant, contended that neither of these cases supported the contention of the plaintiff; the McCoy case had no similarity whatever, as, in that case, the plaintiff\u2019s horse was frightened by a box car left standing in part on a railroad siding, and in part projecting over a street crossing. He further contended that while the Tully Case involved the rights of a trespasser on a railroad car, there was evidence to show that two of the defendant\u2019s employees, connected with the operation of its train, knew, or by the exercise of due care, should have known of the presence of the Tully boy in a position of danger, and yet failed to warn him.</p>\n<author id=\"b224-8\">Harrington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aax-dedup-0\">The objection is sustained. There is nothing in the evidence to show that the servants of the defendant company knew, or should have known, when they started the train at the time of the accident, that the plaintiff was then between any of the cars in a position of danger; there was, therefore, no duty resting on the defendant to give notice by bell, whistle or otherwise that the train was about to start. See cases above cited by defendant. See, also, <em>Patterson v. P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., </em>4 <em>Houst. </em>103, <em>109, 110; Tully\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. P. W. &amp; B. R. R.

Co., </em>2 <em>Houst. </em>287.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\"> At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, Huxley, attorney for the defendant, moved for a nonsuit:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>First, because it had not been proved that the defendant violated any duty which it owned to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Second, the declaration alleged negligence on the part of the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad Company, but there was no proof whatever that that company operated the train that injured the plaintiff, or that it operated any other trains on the tracks that crossed the Eleventh Street crossing.</p>\n<author id=\"b225-5\">Harrington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuXP\">The motion for a nonsuit is granted on both grounds relied on by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The attorney for the plaintiff refused to accept the nonsuit, whereupon the jury was directed to return a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
