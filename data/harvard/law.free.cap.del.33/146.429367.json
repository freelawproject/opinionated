It shall not be necessary to describe the same by metes and bounds, or courses and distances. Nor shall it be necessary in any case to follow the description of the property in the writ of execution under which it is sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The question before us is whether the advertisements of the sale in question, posted in various places of the county, and also advertised in the county newspapers, sufficiently described the property to be sold so that it could be readily identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">It is true that <em>Chapter </em>478 <em>of Volume </em>15, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>passed in 1877, specifically provided that the \u201cprincipal improvements\u201d should be specified in advertisements of sheriff\u2019s sales. This act was repealed, however, in 1879 <em>by Chapter </em>143, <em>Volume </em>16, <em>Laws of Delaware. </em>Both <em>Karsner v. Bailey, </em>5 <em>Houst. </em>405, and <em>Oldham v. Hossenger, </em>5 <em>Houst. </em>434, were decided while this provision of the statute was in force, and, therefore, have no application to the present statute. See, also, <em>Thompson v. King, 2 Marv. </em>358, 43 <em>A. </em>168.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">The notices of sale provided for by <em>Section </em>4361 are for the purpose of apprising the public, as well as parties in interest, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>eluding owners and lien creditors, of the time and place of sale and what property will be offered for sale by a sheriff under a writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>or <em>levari facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Under the present statute there, undoubtedly, are cases where it is not necessary to refer to the improvements in order to properly identify property to be sold, but there are also cases where such improvements constitute essential identifying features. That in such cases a description by metes and bounds and courses and distances, as well as by roads a\u00a1nd adjoining owners, is not sufficient is clear; and this would be true, even though the description in the mortgage be of that character. This principle would seem to apply with special force to apple orchards in bearing covering practically the whole or, at least, a sustantial part of the property to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"> With respect to persons not living within the immediate neighborhood of such property, it is conceivable that an appropriate reference to the orchards thereon would identify and call attention to such property as no other description wotild.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">But though a failure to refer to the apple orchards did constitute an irregularity in the advertisements of such sale, that does not necessarily settle the question before us. The principle controlling petitions to set aside sheriff\u2019s sales is well stated in <em>Miles v. Wilson, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>382. Such petitions are \u201cusually granted for some defect or irregularity in the process, or mode of conducting the sale, or for neglect of duty or misconduct on the part of the sheriff, or some other sufficient matter, and proceed merely from the exercise of that control or authority over its own process, which the court would exert in any other case, for the correction ' of abuses or the prevention of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">While the power to set aside sales, in accordance with the above principles, is broad, its exercise appears to be within the sound discretion of the court out of which the process issued. Woolley on <em>Delaware Practice, </em>\u00a7 1108. See, also, <em>Prior v. Prior, </em>41 <em>Hun </em>(N. <em>Y.) </em>613; 38 <em>Cyc. </em>38.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The petitioner is a judgment creditor who does not contend that the property bound by his lien did not bring its full value at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the sale. That being true, that he was in no way injured by the failure of the advertisements to clearly identify the property is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">It is true that because of irregularities in either posting or delivering advertisements, in accordance with the provisions of the statute, sheriff\u2019s sales have frequently been set aside, not only on the application of the defendant in the writ, but also on the application of a terre-tenant <em>(Burton v. Wolfe, 4 Harr. </em>221; <em>Underwood v. Jeans, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>201; <em>Roger v. Ocheltree, </em>4 <em>Houst. </em>452; <em>Lewis v. Woodall, </em>4 <em>Houst. </em>543; <em>In re Long, </em>3 <em>Boyce </em>[26 <em>Del.] </em>447, 84 <em>Atl. </em>1030; <em>Hawthorne v. Sayers, 2 Marv. </em>177, 42 A. 478; see, also, In <em>re Adair, </em>6 <em>Boyce </em>[29 <em>Del.] </em>245, 99 A. 45) as well as on the application of a judgment creditor <em>(Cochran </em>v. <em>Deakyne, 2 Marv. </em>367, 43 A. 170), and even in cases where the report does not show who made the application <em>(Clements v. Williamson, </em>5 <em>Houst. </em>225).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The underlying principles were not discussed in many of the above cases, but after all they are merely applications of the exercise of the discretionary power of the court to set aside sales on execution process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">While the advertisements in this case should have referred to the orchards on the property to be sold in some appropriate manner, as the petitioner was in no way prejudiced by their failure to do so, the sale will not be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The same general principle was applied in <em>In re Roach, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(33 <em>Del.) </em>89, 130 A. 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">For reasons above given, the prayer of the petitioner is refused and the sale in question is approved and confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Note. \u2014 The early rule in this state required some proof in support of a petition alleging that the statutory notice of a sale had not been given; slight evidence to that \"effect was, however, sufficient. <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Jeans, 4 Harr. </em>201. The present rule on such a petition requires the sheriff to show that he complied with the statute without any preliminary proof being presented by the petitioner. <em>Burton v. Wolfe, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>221; <em>Roger v. Ocheltree, </em>4 <em>Houst. </em>452.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
