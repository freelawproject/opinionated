It was still his duty to look and listen for an approaching train if conditions were such that he could see or hear the train in time to avoid collision. As already said, it is the duty of the traveller, before attempting to cross railroad tracks, to use his senses as best he can for the avoidance of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">This court, in the case of <em>Welch v. B. &amp; O. R. Co., </em>7 <em>Penn. </em>140, 76 <em>A. </em>50, in principle stated: While a railroad company is under no original obligation to place a signal bell, gong or blinker light at a public crossing, yet if it has done so and has maintained the same for a long time, travellers over such crossing have a right to presume if upon approaching said crossing the bell or gong is not ringing, or the blinker light shining, that they may pass over the crossing safely if in the exercise of due care and caution nothing appears to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">But the failure of the company to ring a signal bell at the crossing or to have the blinker lights shining, or to give other due and proper warning of the approaching train would not excuse the deceased, when approaching the crossing and before going over the track, from exercising reasonable care 'and caution, such as an ordinarily prudent and careful man would exercise under similar circumstances.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
