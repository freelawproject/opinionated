Constr., </em>\u00a7 405, 36 <em>Cyc. </em>1152; <em>State ex rel., etc., v. Board, </em>170 <em>Ind. </em>595, 85 <em>N. E. </em>513; <em>Postal Telegraph Co. v. Southern Ry Co. </em>(C. C.), 89 <em>F. </em>190; <em>In re Woods\u2019 Est., </em>31 <em>Ch. Div. </em>(1886) 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">That being true at the time <em>Section </em>8 <em>of Chapter </em>250, <em>Vol. </em>29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Laws of Delaware, was passed, it must have been construed as though the provisions of <em>Section </em>4035 of the <em>Revised, Code of </em>1915 had been written into and composed an integral part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">While always a question of intention, in the absence of anything to indicate a contrary legislative intent, it is likewise true that provisions so adopted and read into other statutes will not ordinarily be affected by the repeal of the adopted statute <em>(Phoenix Assur. Co. v. Fire Dept., </em>117 <em>Ala. </em>631, 23 <em>So. </em>843, 42 <em>L. R. A. </em>468; <em>In re Heath, </em>144 <em>U. S. 92, </em>12 S. <em>Ct. </em>615, 36 <em>L. Ed. </em>358; <em>Crohn v. Kansas City, etc., Telephone Co., </em>131 <em>Mo. App. </em>313, 109 S. <em>W. </em>1068; <em>Flanders v. Town of M., </em>48 <em>Wis. </em>567, 4 <em>N. W. </em>741; <em>Lewis\u2019 Sutherland on Stat. Constr., </em>\u00a7 405; 36 <em>Cyc. </em>1152. See, also, <em>State v. Fahey, 2 W. W. Harr. </em>[32 <em>Del.] </em>504, 126 <em>A. </em>730, 734; <em>Iova v. State, 2 W. W. Harr. </em>[32 <em>Del.] </em>516, 126 A. 627), or by any subsequent changes by way of additions, modification or otherwise in the adopted statute. <em>Kendall v. U. S., </em>12 <em>Pet. </em>524, 9 <em>L. Ed. </em>1181; <em>Culver v. People, </em>161 <em>Ill. </em>89, 43 <em>N. E. </em>812; <em>Postal Telegraph Co. v. Southern Ry. Co. (C. C.), </em>89 <em>F. </em>195; <em>State ex rel. v. Board, etc., </em>170 <em>Ind. </em>595, 85 <em>N. E. </em>513; <em>Furbish v. County Conn., </em>93 <em>Me. </em>117, 44 A. 364; <em>Lewis\u2019 Southerland on Stat. Constr., </em>\u00a7 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The general rule, with respect to this question, is well expressed in <em>Lewis\u2019 Southerland on Stat. Constr., </em>\u00a7 405, <em>supra, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anm-dedup-0\">\u201cWhere one statute adopts the provisions of another by a special and descriptive reference to the statute or provision adopted, the effect is the same as though the statute or provision adopted had been incorporated bodily into the adopting statute. * * * Such adoption takes the statute as it exists at the time of adoption and does not include subsequent additions or modifications of the statute so taken, except it does so by express intent. Nor will the repeal of the statute so adopted affect its operation as part of the statute adopting it.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The change made in the form of the bond required in an appeal from a justice of the peace after the enactment of <em>Section </em>8 of <em>Chapter </em>250, <em>Vol. 29, </em>Laws of Delaware, cannot, therefore, in any way affect the form of the bond required in an appeal from the court of commqn pleas to this court, unless there is something to indicate such a legislative intent; an inspection of the statute above seemed to show that there is not only nothing to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>such an intent, but that <em>Section </em>8 expressly provides for a right of appeal from the court of common pleas to the superior court of New Castle county in the same manner \u201cas is now provided by law as to causes tried before justices of the peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is, therefore, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
