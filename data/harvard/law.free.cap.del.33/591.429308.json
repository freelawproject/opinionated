St. </em>1912, <em>c. </em>38), and, therefore, void; said section being as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">.. \u201cWhoever contracts to have or give to himself or another the option to sell or buy, at a future time, any grain, or other commodity, stock of any railroad or other company, or gold, or forestalls the market by spreading false rumors to influence the price of commodities therein, or comers the market, or attempts to do so in relation to any of such commodities, shall be fined not less than $10 nor more than $1,000, or confined in the county jail not exceeding one year, or both; and all contracts made in violation of this section shall be considered gambling contracts, and shall be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">This plea was demurred to by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\"> <em>Schneider v. Turner, </em>130 <em>Ill. </em>28, 22 <em>N. E. </em>497, 6 <em>L. R. A. </em>164, one of the early cases in which this statute was 'construed by the Illinois courts, and in which the contract was similar to the one in question, held that such contracts were gambling contracts within the meaning of the Criminal Code, and, therefore, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">While this case has never been expressly overruled by the Illinois Court, the later-cases have held that similar contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>were not gambling contracts within the meaning of the Criminal Code. <em>Pratt &amp; Co. v. Ashmore, </em>224 <em>Ill. </em>587, 79 <em>N. E. </em>952; <em>First National Bank v. Miller, </em>235 <em>Ill. </em>135, 85 <em>N. E. </em>312; <em>Bawden v. Taylor, </em>254 <em>Ill. </em>464, 98 <em>N. E. </em>941.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In <em>Stewart v. Dodson, </em>282 <em>Ill. </em>192, 118 <em>N. E. </em>405, 1 <em>A. L. R. </em>1544, which seems to be the latest case decided by the Illinois court on the subject, the court held that a contract very much like the one in question was not a gambling contract, and this seems to be the construction which the courts of that state place upon the statute today.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">This Court feels that the decision of the Illinois courts are binding upon it, and consequently sustain the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
