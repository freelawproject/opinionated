The statute is in effect in the state of Delaware and nowhere else. Native fruits are native with reference to the place to which the statute relates. <em>Commonwealth v. Petranich, </em>183 <em>Mass. </em>217, 66 <em>N. E. </em>807.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>As stated before, the defendant contends that he has not violated the statute, by reason of the fact that he made wine from native fruits for his own domestic consumption, and that he possessed it for that purpose. This is the defense set up by the defendant, and it is the defendant\u2019s duty to prove such defense to your satisfaction. <em>Wharton\u2019s Crim. Ev., </em>\u00a7 128; <em>State v. Rosasco, </em>103 <em>Or. </em>343, 205 <em>P. </em>290.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">If you should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did have in his possession, on or about the date alleged in the indictment, more than one quart of spirituous liquor, and that said liquor was not manufactured from native fruits, or was not possessed by the defendant for his own domestic consumption, your verdict should be guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">But if you are not so satisfied, your verdict should be not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Verdict not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Note. When an exception in a statute must be negatived in the indictment and, therefore, proved by the state, see <em>State v. Witsil, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(33 <em>Del.) </em>30, 129 A. 862.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
