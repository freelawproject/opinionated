The Board evidently treated the operation as the \u201cinjury\" which would incapacitate the claimant, but even upon this basis, the operation not having been performed, there is nothing to indicate the length of time of the incapacity from earning full wages or whether there would be any incapacity at all, and therefore there can be no basis for an order of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The order of the Board must, therefore, be reversed and the matter remanded to said Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
