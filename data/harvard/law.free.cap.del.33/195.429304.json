Timmons, </em>2 Harr. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">While it is not perfectly clear what offenses were included in this class, that felonies were included is apparent from the above citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Subject to certain qualifications that need not be considered here, this disability was, however, removed at common law by a full pardon. <em>Wigmore on Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 377, 378; <em>Chamberlayne\u2019s Hand-Bk. on Ev., </em>\u00a7 1156; <em>State v. Timmons, </em>2 <em>Harr. </em>529. In both England and in most of the states of this country the common law disability, above referred to, has been removed by statute. <em>Wigmore on Ev., </em>\u00a7 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The statute of this state, governing this question, is embodied in <em>Section </em>4214, <em>Revised Code </em>1915, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\"No person shall be excluded from testifying as a witness by reason of his having been convicted of a felony, but evidence of the fact may be given to affect his credibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The credit of a witness may ordinarily be attacked either on cross-examination or by the evidence of other witnesses. <em>Chamberlayne\u2019s Hand-Bk. on Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1181, 1182, 1184, 1185; <em>Chamberlayne on Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3742. See, also, <em>State v. Rash, </em>2 <em>Boyce </em>77, 78 <em>A. </em>405; <em>State v. Quinn, 2 Penn., </em>339, 45 <em>A. </em>544; <em>State v. Primrose, </em>2 <em>Boyce </em>165, 77 <em>A. </em>717; <em>State v. Wright, </em>2 <em>Penn., </em>228, 45 <em>A. </em>395; <em>State v. Windsor, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>526; and <em>Lord v. Horsey, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>317.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">While the court record is the best evidence of the conviction of a crime <em>(State v. Duhammel, </em>2 <em>Harr. </em>532; <em>State v. Fisher, </em>1 <em>Penn., </em>305, 41 <em>A. </em>208), applying the above principle, a witness may, nevertheless, be asked in this state on cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>whether he has ever been convicted, of a felony. <em>State v. Durham, </em>5 <em>Penn., </em>105, 58 <em>A. </em>1024; <em>Clemens v. Conrad, </em>19 <em>Mich. </em>170; <em>State v. Knowles, </em>98 <em>Me. </em>429, 57 <em>A. </em>588. See, also, <em>Wigmore on Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 980, 1270; <em>Jones' Blue-Bk. on Ev., </em>\u00a7 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">If he admits that he has been so convicted, the production of the record at a later stage of the trial is usually considered unnecessary; though this is probably within the discretion of the cross-examining attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">It is true that a majority of the court in <em>State v. Fisher, </em>1 <em>Penn., </em>305, 41 A. 208, reached a different conclusion and held a witness could not be asked, on cross-examination, whether he had ever been convicted qf a felony, intimating, however, that the rule might be different if he had been convicted in another county.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">While I find no reported case expressly overruling the Fisher Case, and there is a conflict in the authorities on the question (30 <em>L. R. A. [N. </em>S.] 846; 13 <em>Ann. Cas. </em>643; <em>Jones' Blue-Bk. on Ev., </em>\u00a7 839; <em>Chamberlayne on Ev., </em>\u00a7 3749; <em>Greenleaf on Ev., </em>\u00a7 457) it certainly does not represent the rule now applied almost daily in our courts. Nor does it represent the rale applied in the early stages of the common law. <em>Rex v. Edwards, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>440 (100 <em>Eng. Reprint, </em>1108). See <em>Wigmore on Ev., </em>\u00a7 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The state admits the genuineness of the pardon produced by the defendant, and that it cdyer's all felonies of which he has been convicted. The question before us must, therefore, be considered as though such pardon had been admitted in evidence, on behalf of the defendant, before the question objected to had been asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">It is true, as claimed by the defendant, that a pardon takes away many of the results and personal disabilities arising from a conviction of a felony and, to a certain extent, makes the person pardoned a new man. 29 <em>Cyc. </em>1557. Among other things, it removes the disfranchisement of the person so convicted, but, though this defendant has been pardoned, the fact remains that he has been convicted of a felony. The rule with respect to this question is aptly stated in <em>Curtis v. Cochran, </em>50 <em>N. H. </em>242, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cA pardon is not presumed to be granted on the ground of innocence or total reformation. * * * It removes the disability, but does not change the common-law principle that the conviction of an infamous offense is evidence of bad character for truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">See, also, to the same effect, <em>Wigmore on Ev., </em>\u00a7 908; <em>Chamberlayne\u2019s Hand-Bk. on Ev., </em>\u00a7 1183; <em>Greenleaf on Ev., </em>\u00a7 377; <em>Stephen\u2019s Digest on Ev., </em>273; 20 <em>R. C. L. </em>567, \u00a7 55; <em>U. S. v. Jones, </em>2 <em>Wheeler, Cr. Cas. </em>451, <em>Fed. Cas. No. </em>15,493; <em>Bennett v. State, </em>24 <em>Tex. App. </em>3, 5 S. <em>W. </em>527, 5 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>875; <em>Diehl v. Rodgers, </em>169 <em>Pa. </em>316, 32 <em>A. </em>424, 47 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>908.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Notwithstanding the pardon, for the purpose of affecting the credit of the defendant, the fact of the conviction may, therefore, be brought out either on cross-examination or in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">That being true, the objection of the defendant is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Note. The rule permitting prior convictions of other offenses to be brought out on cross-examination or shown in rebuttal for the purpose of affecting the credibility of the witness is confined in this State to felonies. <em>State v. Burton, </em>2 <em>Marv. </em>446, 43 <em>A. </em>254; <em>State v. Powell, </em>5 <em>Penn., </em>24, 61 <em>A. </em>966.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">In <em>Burton v. Natural Gas &amp; Petroleum Corporation, 4 W. W. Harr. </em>(34 <em>Del.) </em>\u2014, the Court held that statements showing hostility or ill feeling could not be shown unless grounds were laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The right to question a witness concerning matters that will incriminate or disgrace him has also been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>568, it was held that a question with respect to a matter that tended to incriminate the defendant might be asked, but that it was his privilege to refuse to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">In <em>Knowles v. Knowles, 2 Houst. </em>133, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\">\u201cThe rule of law is well settled that no witness is bound to incriminate himself, that is to say, to answer a question which may have the effect to subject him to a criminal prosecution; and it is also well settled that he cannot be excused from answering a question, because his answer may render him liable to a civil suit. But whether he is obliged to answer, when his answer may have a tendency to degrade him, or disparage him in the esteem of his fellow men, is not so well settled and has long been a matter of more controversy and discussion. The better opinions and decisions, however, appear to be, that when the question is directly pertinent and material to the matter in issue, he cannot be excused from answering it, merely on the ground that his answer will have the tendency, or effect to degrade him or to diminish his standing and respectability in the community; but where it is irrelevant, or only collateral to the matter in issue, he cannot be compelled to answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">See, <em>State v. Burton, 2 Marv. </em>446, 43 <em>A. </em>254. See, however, <em>Wigmore on Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 984-987; <em>Jones Blue-Bk. on Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 830, 831; <em>Chamberlayne on Ev., </em>\u00a7 3734; 1 <em>Amer. Law Rep. Annot. </em>1402; <em>Bove v. State, </em>3 <em>W. W. </em>Harr. (33 <em>Del.) </em>229, 134 <em>Atl. </em>630.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>In <em>State v. Carter, Houst. Cr. Cas. </em>412, the state was not permitted to show by what other names the defendants had been known, on the ground that the question tended to put character in issue before that issue had been raised by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">See <em>State v. Casper, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(33 <em>Del.) </em>432, <em>138 Atl. </em>633; <em>Bove v. State, 3 W. W.
