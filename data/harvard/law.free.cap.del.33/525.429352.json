Butterworth, </em>5 <em>Penn. </em>151, 58 <em>A. </em>1041, and <em>Slivka v. Mroczka, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(33 <em>Del.)</em>\u2014, 132 <em>A.. </em>862.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">In <em>Brown v. Butterworth, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-16\">\u201cThe record says the service was verified according to law. We do not think that it is necessary that it should be upon the back of the writ. There is nothing to show that it was not verified according to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>And in <em>Slivka v. Mroczka, </em>the court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cThe usual presumption that the summons was issued on the day of its date cannot, therefore, apply in view of the express statement in the transcript that such summons was issued to the constable December 19,1924.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Counsel for the plaintiff in error, however, requests that he be allowed to show by evidence <em>aliunde </em>the record that there was no affidavit in writing, and as authority cites the case of <em>Houston v. Jester\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 2 Harr. </em>300. The Houston Case was overruled many years ago, and as stated in <em>Woolley on Delaware Practice, </em>\u00a7 898:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cThe rule and practice of the court for forty years has been to confine the review of <em>certiorari </em>to the record as set up in obedience to the writ.\u201d <em>Billingsley, d. b., v. Wilckens, Staats </em>&amp; <em>Co., Inc., </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>60, 74 <em>A. </em>366.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"any-dedup-1\">, [3] Taking up exceptions 2 and 3, <em>section </em>4008 <em>of the'Revised Code of </em>1915, in part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">\u2022 \u201cA summons shall be served by producing the warrant to the defendant and stating the substance of it, or by leaving a copy of it at his usual place of abode in the presence of some person, at least four days before the day of appearance. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">\u201cThe service and the manner of service shall be stated in the [writ] thus, \u2018Served personally\u2019 or \u2018Served by leaving a copy at the defendant\u2019s usual place of abode in the presence of A. B.,\u2019 with the date of such service; and a judgment by default shall not be rendered until this [writ] is verified by the constable's affidavit in writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">The plaintiff, above, contends that under the terms of the statute, the copy must be left with an occupant of defendant\u2019s usual place of abode, and as authority refers to the case of <em>Gibbons v. Mason, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>452. The only thing this case decided was that the service was invalid because it was made at an office, a place where the family did not usually reside. In the decision, the court employed the language of the statute, as it then existed, but the wording of the statute was later changed from \u201cin the presence of one or more members of the family or neighbors\u201d to read \"in the presence of some person\u201d as it now appears in the Revised Code of 1915. The statute in its original form certainly did not require the copy of the summons to be left in the presence of an occupant of the home of the. defendant because by its very terms it included the words \u201cin the presence of one or more neighbors.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The language of the present statute is more general in character and broader in meaning and I believe it will not reasonably bear the construction as contended by the plaintiff here. It may also be stated that a construction of the statute in accordance with the contention of the plaintiff would be to disturb the present practice in such cases of leaving a copy in the presence of another person, such other person not necessarily being an occupant of defendant\u2019s abode, which practice has been followed- for a great many years..</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The fourth exception is directed to the variance between the name \u201cBernhard\u201d in the summons and the name \u201cBernhand\u201d in the judgment. The defendant in <em>certiorari </em>contends that the names are <em>idem sonans </em>and the court agrees with this contention. It is doubtful if there is any general rule which may be applied in all cases to determine whether names spelled differently are <em>idem sonans. </em>However, in <em>Ward v. State, </em>28 <em>Ala. </em>53, the court stated the true rule to be \u201cif the names may be sounded alike, without doing violence to the powers of the letters found in the variant orthography, then the variance is immaterial,\u201d and also in <em>Robson v. Thomas, 55 Mo. </em>581, it was said, \u201cTwo names are * * * <em>idem'sonans </em>* * * ' if the attentive ear finds-difficulty in distinguishing them when pronounced. * * * \u201d Applying these two rules as a test in the present case, the court is of the opinion that the names \u201cBernhard\u201d and \u201cBernhand\u201d are <em>idem'sonans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The fifth exception goes to the variance in entering-the judgment in favor of William T. Ennis and John Ennis trading as Ennis Garage, when the defendant was summoned to answer Wm. T. Ennis and John R. Ennis. It is not argued that William T. Ennis and John Ennis, named in the judgment, are different persons from those named in the summons, the only objection being to the addition of the words \u201ctrading as Ennis. Garage\u201d in the judgment record. These words may be regarded as words of description or perhaps as mere surplusage and, therefore, as immaterial so far as the validity of the judgment is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The sixth exception is clearly without merit as the record before the court includes the summons issued by the justice of the. peace to the constable and it appears that the summons was issfied on.the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>12th day of July directing the defendant to appear -on the 19th day of July, and on the writ the service is indorsed as made on the 12th day of July, which is clearly more than four days before the date of appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">For the reasons stated, the exceptions are overruled and the judgment below affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
