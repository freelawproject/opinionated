Approximately sixteen months previously, the trial court, after accepting Patterson\u2019s guilty pleas to two of three counts in the indictment against her, had convicted her of falsification and election falsification in violation of R.C. 2921.13(A) and R.C. 3599.36, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The state, at the hearing on the application, first raised an objection to the sealing of Patterson\u2019s record, contending that she was not a \u201cfirst offender\u201d as defined by R.C. 2953.31(A) because the offenses for which she was convicted occurred seven months apart. (The state filed no written objection to the application as plainly required by R.C. 2953.32[B], However, the Ohio Supreme Court has \u201cinterpreted\u201d the plain language of the statute to be optional only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) After a hearing, the trial court granted Patterson\u2019s application, determining that the convictions arose from the same set of facts. The state now contends, in its sole assignment of error, that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting Patterson\u2019s application. It argues that because Patterson\u2019s convictions were for two separate offenses, which were committed on two separate dates, she does not meet the statutory definition of a first offender. Patterson contends that because her convictions were connected with the same act, she was a first offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Only a first offender can apply to a sentencing court to seal the record of her conviction. R.C. 2953.32(A) defines a first offender, in part, as \u201canyone who has been convicted of an offense in this state * * * and who previously or subsequently has not been convicted of the same or a different offense in this state* * *. When two or more convictions <em>result from or are connected with the same act, </em>or result from offenses committed at the same time, they shall be counted as one conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Whether one is a first offender is a question of law to be determined <em>de novo </em>by a reviewing court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But whether the facts in any case meet the definition of \u201cfirst offender\u201d is, in many cases, a question of fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Obviously, the facts of each case must be considered in order to determine whether two convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u201cresult from or are connected with the same act.\u201d The trial judge must make this determination based on the particular facts of each case. Only then may a reviewing court determine whether the trial judge\u2019s decision comports with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"> Further, we must always be cognizant that the statute allowing for the sealing of a first offender\u2019s record is remedial in nature.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, it should be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose, which is \u201cto facilitate the prompt transition of [first offenders] into meaningful and productive roles.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, when construing a statute, we must give effect to the words used, and neither delete nor insert words into the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The state, based on its erroneous assumption that offenses occurring on separate dates can <em>never </em>constitute one conviction as defined by R.C. 2953.31(A), argued below that the facts of the underlying convictions were not relevant. Consequently, the record before us is devoid of a description of the underlying facts concerning the crimes Patterson committed. The only part of the record we have before us that alludes to any facts is Patterson\u2019s indictment. The indictment alleged, in part, that on July 5, 1995, Patterson made a material false statement under oath or affirmation to the grand jury investigating election falsification \u201cas to the Committee To Defeat Merger\u201d and that on December 1, 1994, Patterson, in a \u201cPolitical Action Committee Finance Report\u201d did \u201cpurposely state a falsehood as to a material matter relating to an election or in a matter in relation to which an oath or statement under penalty of election falsification is authorized by law.\u201d (While Patterson pleaded guilty to falsification and election falsification, the indictment charged her with perjury and election falsification.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Patterson argues that she is a first offender because her two convictions under the indictment \u201care connected with the same act.\u201d \u201cConnected with\u201d has been defined as \u201cbeing linked together logically.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial judge, being familiar with the facts of the case, as indicated by his comments at the expungement hearing, made the factual determination that the facts merged the convictions into one for the purpose of sealing Patterson\u2019s record. The state, as appellant, has the burden of demonstrating error by reference to matters in the record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Where that burden is not met, \u201call reasonable presumptions consistent with the record will be indulged in favor of the validity of the judgment or decision under review and of the regularity and legality of the proceeding below.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Based on the record before us and the presumption of regularity afforded to the trial court\u2019s decision, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AbR\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Auy\">Gorman, P.J., and Shannon, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AS0\">Raymond E.
