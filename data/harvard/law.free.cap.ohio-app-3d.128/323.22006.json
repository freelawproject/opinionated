Chumbley, appeals from her conviction of sale of liquor to an underage person. Chumbley was the bartender at \u201cOscar\u2019s,\u201d a bar located in downtown Cincinnati. Oscar\u2019s used a hand-stamp system to identify whether its patrons were of legal age to purchase alcohol. A \u201clow\u201d stamp was placed upon the hand of an underage patron, and a \u201chigh\u201d stamp was placed upon the hand of a patron of legal age.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">Upon entering the bar on October 10, 1996, twenty-year-old Kevin Boehmer had his hand marked with a \u201clow\u201d stamp indicating that he was underage. Boehmer then purchased a can of beer from Chumbley without showing any type of identification. At some time after this purchase, Boehmer transferred a \u201chigh\u201d stamp onto his hand from another person who was of legal age. Boehmer then purchased a pitcher of beer and two \u201cshots\u201d of alcohol from Chumbley. Again, Boehmer did not present any form of identification. Cincinnati Police Officer Timothy Campbell observed the transactions. After the second transaction, an officer approached Boehmer and ascertained his age while another approached Chumbley. Officer Campbell testified that, at the scene, Chumbley indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>she did not recall serving Boehmer. Chumbley was charged under R.C. 4301.69(A) for Boehmer\u2019s second purchase of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">At trial, Chumbley testified on direct examination that Boehmer approached her twice to purchase alcohol. She stated that she \u201cassumed\u201d that Boehmer was of legal age because he initially approached the bar in the company of an employee of the bar. She stated that she did not see a stamp on Boehmer\u2019s hand at the time of his first purchase, but that she did see a \u201chigh\u201d stamp on his hand at the time of the second purchase. Chumbley stated that Boehmer did not provide any form of identification. She admitted that she had received alcohol-management training and was aware of the risk of selling alcohol to an underage person by not checking identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In her sole assignment of error, Chumbley argues that this court should reverse its previously held position that R.C. 4301.69(A) is a strict-liability offense. See <em>State v. Burke </em>(Dec. 19, 1979), Hamilton App. No. C-790028, unreported; <em>State v. Moran </em>(Nov. 4, 1992), Hamilton App. No. C-920279, unreported, 1992 WL 691953; <em>State v. McCall </em>(Sept. 29, 1995), Hamilton App. No. C-950045, unreported. We are not persuaded and affirm the judgment of the trial court for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In addition to the position held by this court, the overwhelming majority of courts that have visited this issue have found that R.C. 4301.69(A) is a strict-liability offense. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(1989), 57 Ohio App.3d 155, 567 N.E.2d 313; <em>State v. Cheraso </em>(1988), 43 Ohio App.3d 221, 540 N.E.2d 326; <em>Markho, Inc. v.

Won </em>(Dec. 31, 1986), Summit App. No. 12658, unreported, 1986 WL 15277. The only contrary authorities in this state are three municipal court cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Although R.C. 4301.69(A) is a strict-liability offense, R.C. 4301.639 provides an affirmative defense to a defendant who is charged with a violation, but who has, in good faith, accepted false identification. R.C. 4301.639 provides that one may not be found guilty if the court finds that all of the following occurred at the time of purchase: (1) the purchaser exhibited a driver\u2019s license or identification card that showed him to be of legal age to purchase intoxicating liquor; (2) the seller of the liquor made a bona fide effort to ascertain the true age of the purchaser by checking the identification at the time of purchase; and (3) the seller had reason to believe that the purchaser was of legal age. Eveh if Chumbley had claimed the affirmative defense, only the third requirement could have been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Chumbley argues that since there is no specified culpable mental state in R.C. 4301.69(A), the state must prove recklessness in order to sustain a conviction. As listed above, this court and all other appellate courts in this state have repeatedly declined to revisit this issue. Additionally, in light of the diligent, affirmative acts that must be demonstrated in order to establish an affirmative defense under R.C. 4301.639, the legislature could not have intended recklessness as the culpable mental state of R.C. 4301.69. Finally, the facts of the case at bar are distinguishable from those upon which the contrary municipal court decisions are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We, therefore, continue to hold that R.C. 4301.69(A) is an offense of strict liability and affirm the judgment of the trial court. We note, however, that even if this court were to apply recklessness as the requisite culpable mental state, Chumbley\u2019s testimony clearly established that she acted recklessly as defined in R.C. 2901.22(C) in committing the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-8\">Shannon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b360-9\">Painter, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b360-10\">Raymond E.

If there were strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>liability for shoplifting, a young mother whose child, without the mother\u2019s knowledge, slipped candy into her purse at the grocery could go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">I must first take issue with the majority\u2019s recitation of the facts. Chumbley was charged only with selling a pitcher of beer to Boehmer. During this transaction, Boehmer had a \u201chigh\u201d stamp, which Chumbley saw and relied on before pouring the beer. The majority mixes in facts from an earlier transaction, where Chumbley allegedly served Boehmer a can of beer before he replaced the \u201clow\u201d stamp on his hand with, a \u201chigh\u201d stamp. But Chumbley <em>was not charged </em>under R.C. 4301.69(A) for this earlier transaction. The same goes for the two shots of liquor that Boehmer purchased with the pitcher \u2014 they had been drunk before the police could confiscate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Disingenuously, the majority attempts to weave in Chumbley\u2019s conceivably reckless actions that are <em>not </em>the subject of this conviction to distinguish this case from the three published municipal court decisions, Parker,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Sleppy</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>McGhee,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which are directly on point. I believe the law still is that one may not be convicted of a crime unless charged. So I will confine my discussion to the facts of the actual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The trial court here found that Chumbley had relied on the red stamp on Boehmer\u2019s hand \u201cas she was trained to do, and she did it in good faith,\u201d and further stated a wish to be free to find the defendant not guilty. The trial judge had the right instinct \u2014 that justice requires a not-guilty finding in this case. Meting out criminal records to those acting \u201cin good faith\u201d is repugnant to our system of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In <em>Sleppy </em>and <em>Parker, </em>as a municipal court judge, I held that a recklessness standard must be applied to R.C. 4301.69(A) because the section does not specify the degree of culpability and does not plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority ignores this rule and also ignores R.C. 2901.04(A), which provides that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused. I stand by my former decisions. More recent case law has further persuaded me that they were rightly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Last year, in <em>State v. </em>McGee<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (not to be confused with <em>McGhee), </em>the Ohio Supreme Court determined that recklessness was an essential element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>crime of endangering children under R.C. 2919.22(A).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Though the statute begins with the ubiquitous \u201cNo person * * * shall\u201d language that many courts, such as those cited by the majority for support, use as evidence that the legislature intended to impose strict liability, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the child-endangering statute does not plainly indicate such an intent. Many courts \u2014 and this case provides the perfect example \u2014 have grossly overreached by finding that various statutes \u201cplainly\u201d indicate that the legislature intended to impose strict liability. As Judge Hoffman has astutely observed, \u201cI am unaware of any crime that does not contain the \u2018No person shall * * * \u2019 language.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Courts strain to find that statutes \u201cplainly\u201d indicate that the legislature intended to impose strict liability. But the more the strain, the less the legislature\u2019s intent is plain. If the legislature wishes to impose strict liability, it need only say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">I would not protest as loudly if jail time were not a possible penalty for a violation of R.C. 4301.69(A). Strict-liability offenses promulgated to mold behavior through the imposition of small fines have been accepted throughout this country.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But I believe that most offenses that carry the possibility of jail time as punishment should include a <em>mens rea </em>requirement, with a minimum requirement of criminal negligence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Certainly, courts should be much more reluctant to subject those of our citizens who do not have a \u201cguilty mind\u201d to jail time than to impose a fine. Because a violator of R.C. 4301.69(A) can receive jail time, this statute should not be a strict-liability crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The majority is indeed correct that precedent in this district favors its position. This district has been consistently wrong for many years, with untold hundreds of innocent and hard-working men and women suffering the consequences. While we could never make up for the decades of mistreatment of our citizens, we should now stop this egregious misapplication of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The majority decision today means in practice that anyone who works her way through college by working in an establishment that serves alcohol will likely incur a criminal record. This result would be bad enough if the law mandated it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>but the law requires exactly the opposite. Criminals enough we have, without creating them wholesale by statutory misinterpretation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\">. <em>State v.
