Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">This appeal, submitted on the accelerated docket, has been considered pursuant to App.R. 11.1(E) and Loc.R. 12. Pursuant to Loc.R. 12(5), we have elected to render decision by written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">Ronald Garris appeals from the judgment entered in the Bellefontaine Municipal Court, Logan County, convicting him of driving while under the influence of alcohol and/or a drug of abuse (\u201cOMVI\u201d) pursuant to Bellefontaine City Ordinance 333.01(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garris was sentenced to serve one year in the Logan County Jail and ordered to pay a fine of $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Garris raises two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in denying the defendant assigned counsel, thereby denying the defendant-appellant his right to a fair trial in violation of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment[s] to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201cII. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to try and convict the appellant .without a jury where the record does not include a written waiver of the appellant\u2019s right to a jury trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Though Garris\u2019s first and second assignment of error raise separate procedural and constitutional issues, right to counsel and right to a jury trial, the resolution of these assignments is contingent on the content of the information provided to Garris at his initial appearance before the municipal court on November 20, 1997. The assignments will therefore be discussed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The city of Bellefontaine (\u201cthe city\u201d) sought and was granted leave to supplement the record with Garris\u2019s initial appearance transcript. Therein, the city argues that it is apparent that Garris was fully advised of his right to counsel and his right to a jury trial. Accordingly, the city contends that when Garris appeared for trial on December 22, 1997 without counsel and without having filed a jury demand, he impliedly waived both. Parts of the initial appearance transcript provided to us, however, lead us to a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Garris was arrested for OMVI during the early morning hours of November 20, 1997. The record indicates that later the same morning, Garris appeared before the Bellefontaine Municipal Court on five traffic offenses, including the OMVI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The first portion of the record transcribed indicates that the judge, while addressing another person charged with persistent disorderly conduct, advised the courtroom audience to \u201cpay careful attention to this explanation of legal rights that I make to Mr. Wilt.\u201d The judge explained that because Wilt\u2019s charge carried a \u201cpotential jail sentence,\u201d \u201cin any case such as this, you have the right to a jury trial in this court if you desire one, and you have the right to be represented by an attorney. If you need additional time to speak to an attorney before you enter your plea today, then you have the right to a continuance of this hearing in order to talk to your attorney. And, finally, if you wish to be represented by an attorney but you don\u2019t have the funds to hire your own attorney, you have the right to have an attorney appointed to represent you by the Court if the Court is satisfied that you are indigent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The proceedings then continued with Wilt, but no transcription of those proceedings is part of the record before us. The transcript of proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>provided to us concerning Garris begins when Garris\u2019s name is called. The \u201cclerk\u201d read the charges to Garris, and the court then inquired of Garris:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cQ Sir, do you understand what you\u2019ve been charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201cQ Do you understand your legal rights as I explained them earlier today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">\u201cQ Are you prepared to enter a plea at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">\u201cQ What plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">\u201cA Not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">The above constitutes the entire dialogue between the judge and Garris prior to Garris\u2019s entering his plea. It is not clear from this record that Garris was present when the court advised Wilt of his rights. Garris\u2019s affirmative response that he did hear his \u201clegal rights\u201d as were stated earlier by the judge reveals nothing about what Garris thought he heard. The procedure implemented by the trial court may have expedited the process of initial appearance, but it failed to provide a record from which this reviewing court may determine that any person other than Wilt heard proper information about his rights in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">After Garris pleaded not guilty, the court did not inquire whether Garris wanted a court-appointed attorney to assist him in his defense. Rather, the court proceeded to set a trial date for December 22, 1997 and question Garris about his financial ability to make bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">It should be noted that when discussing bail with Garris, the.trial court noted that Garris was facing his fourteenth OMVI charge. This was even a factor cited by the trial court when deciding to set a high bond. Nevertheless, even though the trial judge appears to have been aware of Garris\u2019s prior offenses, he did not inform Garris of the possible punishment associated with his present OMVI offense, his third within six years. Specifically, the court did not advise Garris that if convicted of the OMVI charge, he could be incarcerated for a minimum of thirty days in jail or up to a maximum of one year, the punishment associated with a conviction of OMVI with two prior offenses within six years. Bellefontaine Ordinances 333.99(b)(3); see, also, R.C. 4511.99(A)(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">On the day of trial, Garris requested court-appointed counsel and a jury trial. The trial court denied both requests, conducted a bench trial without counsel, and found Garris guilty of OMVI, sentencing him to one year in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">At a defendant\u2019s initial appearance, the court \u201cshall inform the defendant: (1) Of the nature of the charge against him; * * * [and] (5) Of his right, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>appropriate, to jury trial and the necessity to make demand therefor in petty offense cases.\u201d Crim.R. 5(A). Furthermore, where as here, Garris was called upon to enter a plea at his initial appearance without the assistance of counsel, <em>\u201cthe judge or magistrate shall cause him to be informed </em>and shall determine that he understands\u201d certain enumerated rights. (Emphasis added.) Crim.R. 10(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Here, Garris was not fully informed of his rights as required by Crim.R. 5(A), 10(C), and 11(D). Generally, when one pleads not guilty at initial appearance, noncompliance with the initial appearance rules would appear nonprejudicial. See <em>State v. Davis </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 326, 349, 581 N.E.2d 1362, 1381. The reasoning is that an uninformed not guilty plea is far less harmful than an uninformed guilty or no contest plea. Where, however, as here, the trial court denied Garris\u2019s subsequent request for court-appointed counsel and a jury trial on the day of trial, the failure to comply with the initial appearance rules is prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">First, Crim.R. 5(A)(1) requires a defendant to be informed of the \u201cnature of the charge against him.\u201d This must be more that having a clerk read the charges aloud to the defendant at his initial appearance and asking the defendant whether he understood what the clerk said. At the very least, a court must also advise the defendant of the possible punishment associated with his charges. <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 323-324, 92 L.Ed. 309, 321 (where the United States Supreme Court stated that a waiver of counsel was valid only where, among other things, the defendant has knowledge of \u201cthe range of allowable punishments\u201d); see, also, <em>State v. Bayer </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 172, 179, 656 N.E.2d 1314, 1318, and <em>State v. Grimes </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 71, 72, 17 OBR 126, 127-128, 477 N.E.2d 1219, 1221. When an accused faces trial without the assistance of counsel and does not expressly waive his right to counsel on the record as required by Crim.R. 44(C), no reviewing court can infer that such right was waived when the defendant was not made fully aware of the \u201cdangers inherent in self-representation,\u201d for instance, the danger of losing the case and serving any time in jail. <em>State v. Ebersole </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 288, 294, 668 N.E.2d 934, 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Here, Garris was never advised that if convicted of OMVI he could spend one year in jail. This failure to comply with Crim.R. 5(A) prejudiced Garris, as he was unable to make an intelligent and informed decision as to the necessity for the assistance of counsel. <em>Bayer, </em>102 Ohio App.3d at 179, 656 N.E.2d at 1318; <em>State v. Orr </em>(1985), 26 Ohio App.3d 24, 25, 26 OBR 192, 193-194, 498 N.E.2d 181, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Crim.R. 5(A)(5) requires that the court advise a defendant upon initial appearance \u201c[o]f his right, where appropriate, to jury trial and the necessity to make demand therefor in petty offense cases.\u201d On the day Garris was arraigned, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>trial court did state to all attending defendants collectively that in any case that carries with it a \u201cpotential jail sentence\u201d that \u201cyou have the right to a jury trial in this court if you desire one.\u201d The court did not state, however, that it would be necessary for a defendant to \u201cmake a demand therefor\u201d prior to trial as required in Crim.R. 5(A)(5). Nevertheless, when Garris appeared for his trial and asked the court where the jury was, the court advised Garris, \u201cIf you wanted a jury, you\u2019ve got to put on a jury demand before the day of trial.\u201d Accordingly, the failure of the trial court to fully inform Garris of his responsibility to demand a jury trial prior to the date of trial violated Crim.R. 5(A)(5), and there is no evidence of Garris\u2019s knowledge shown by the record to serve as a foundation upon which an implied waiver of a jury trial might be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The trial court ultimately sentenced Garris to one year in jail, apparently because Garris had two prior OMVI convictions within six years of this case. However, any offense that carries with it a possible incarceration of over six months is no longer a \u201cpetty offense,\u201d but, rather, is a \u201cserious offense\u201d as defined in Crim.R. 2. <em>State v. Cheadle </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 253, 30 OBR 412, 507 N.E.2d 426. Therefore, because Garris was charged with a serious offense, his desire to have a jury trial is presumed unless expressly waived. See Crim.R. 23(A). Moreover, where a defendant has either exercised a demand for a jury trial or by the nature of the offense is presumed to desire a jury trial, the defendant may not be tried without a jury unless he expressly waives his right to a jury trial on the record as provided by R.C. 2945.05. Here, no such waiver is in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u201cA judgment of conviction is void if rendered by a court having no jurisdiction\u201d to enter the judgment. <em>State v. Brock </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 656, 666, 675 N.E.2d 18, 24. Where, as here, an accused faces a \u201cserious offense\u201d and is tried without counsel and without a jury, the failure of the trial court to obtain a waiver of counsel, or an express waiver of jury trial pursuant to R.C. 2945.05, divests the trial court of jurisdiction to conduct the trial. <em>State v. Harris </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 57, 64, 596 N.E.2d 563, 568 (no waiver of a jury trial). Therefore, as the trial court\u2019s judgment is void <em>ab initio, </em>no double jeopardy attaches, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded with instructions to proceed as if no plea had been entered. <em>Brock, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 666, 675 N.E.2d at 24; see, also, <em>United States v. DiFrancesco </em>(1980), 449 U.S. 117, 131, 101 S.Ct. 426, 434, 66 L.Ed.2d 328, 341-342. Garris\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-8\">Shaw, P.J., and Evans, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-17\">.
