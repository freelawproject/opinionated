Abele, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered by the Lawrence County Common Pleas Court after a jury trial. The jury awarded Russell G. Lewis and his wife, Minnie Lewis, plaintiffs below and appellees/cross-appellants herein, $650,000 from Alfa Laval Separation, Inc., defendant below and appellant/cross-appellee herein, for injuries he received as a result of an October 24, 1993 explosion of a centrifuge at Ashland Oil Company\u2019s South Point Ethanol Plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Appellant/cross-appellee (hereinafter \u201cappellant\u201d) assign the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-14\">\u201cFirst Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion in limine prohibiting defendant from introducing evidence of plaintiffs contributory negligence in failing to wear mandatory hearing protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-16\">\u201cSecond Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-17\">\u201cThe trial court erred in permitting plaintiffs to introduce evidence of a settlement of the claims of South Point Ethanol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201cThird Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in permitting plaintiffs to elicit expert testimony from their economist on the monetary value of plaintiffs loss of enjoyment of life\u2019s pleasurable activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cFourth Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury to limit its consideration of medical expenses incurred by the plaintiffs to those documented in plaintiffs medical exhibit binder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">Appellees/eross-appellants (hereinafter \u201cappellee\u201d) assign the following errors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\u201cFirst Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict on the plaintiffs punitive damages claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">\u201cSecond Assignment of Error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for prejudgment interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">On December 16, 1994, appellee filed the instant complaint. In the complaint, appellee alleged that while he was working at Ashland Oil Company\u2019s South Point Ethanol Plant on October 24, 1993, he suffered severe injuries, including permanent damage to his ear and auditory system. The injuries occurred when a Model D-7500 centrifuge manufactured and repaired by appellant exploded with such force that the extension portion of the centrifuge was thrown straight up through the roof of the plant and hot corn mash was forcibly blown into appellee\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">On January 24, 1995, appellant filed an answer which, <em>inter alia, </em>raised the affirmative defenses of comparative negligence and assumption of risk. On September 13, 1995, appellee amended the complaint by adding a claim for punitive damages. During the next year, the parties engaged in extensive discovery proceedings, including over thirty depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">On October 2, 1996, appellee filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting the trial court to prohibit appellant from introducing or referring to any evidence regarding hearing protection. On October 7, 1996, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>The trial court granted the motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">On October 21, 1996, the first day of the jury trial, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting the trial court to prohibit appellee from introducing any testimony regarding hedonic damages. When denying the motion, the trial court commented that the \u201ctestimony here goes to the credibility or weight to be given to the evidence of Dr. Brookshire.\u201d \u201e During the trial, Dr. Brookshire, an economist, testified that because our country values a life at $3,500,000, because that $3,500,000 amount minus the $900,000 worth of wages that an average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>American will earn is $2,600,000, because that $2,600,000 amount spread over appellee\u2019s life is $77,000 per year, and because another expert witness testified that appellee has lost approximately six percent to nine percent of his functioning, appellee has lost approximately $4,000 to $5,000 per year for the rest of his life due to his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">At the conclusion of appellee\u2019s case, appellant moved for a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">On October 25, 1996, the jury returned a $650,000 verdict in favor of appellee. On October 31, 1996, the trial court entered judgment in accordance with verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">On November 15, 1996, appellee filed a motion for prejudgment interest. Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest. On November 26, 1996, appellee filed a reply memorandum. On December 3, 1996, the trial court denied appellee\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. Appellee filed a timely notice of cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">In its first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>prohibiting appellant from introducing evidence of the fact that appellee failed to wear mandatory foam-style hearing protection at the time of the accident. Appellant contends that the evidence is relevant to the defenses of comparative negligence and assumption of risk. Appellant contends that appellee\u2019s otolaryngologist Dr. Wolfe, in his deposition, noted that it is possible that use of the mandatory hearing protection would have prevented appellee\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Appellee .argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting admission of the hearing protection evidence. Appellee notes that the hearing protection evidence was irrelevant and confusing. Appellee notes that Dr. Wolfe did not testify that the hearing protection would have saved appellee from injury; rather, Dr. Wolfe testified in his deposition that he did not know whether use of the hearing protection would have prevented the injury to appellee\u2019s ear. Appel-lee further argues that regardless of whether appellee failed to use mandatory hearing protection, because appellee did not voluntarily assume a known risk, the assumption of risk defense would fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Initially, we note that the admission or exclusion of relevant evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court. The trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude relevant evidence cannot be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Rigby v. Lake Cty. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 269, 271, 569 N.E.2d 1056, 1058; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>Leaman v. Coles </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 627, 629, 685 N.E.2d 1294, 1296; <em>Nielsen v. Meeker </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 448, 450, 679 N.E.2d 28, 30. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment. In <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 126-127, 482 N.E.2d 1248, 1252, the court wrote as follows that an abuse of discretion involves a result \u201cpalpably and grossly violative of fact and logic\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">\u201cThe term discretion itself involves the idea of choice, of an exercise of the will, of a determination made between competing considerations. In order to have an \u2018abuse\u2019 in reaching such determination, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Thus, an abuse of discretion will not be found when the reviewing court simply could maintain a different opinion were it deciding the issue <em>de novo. </em>Rather, an abuse of discretion indicates an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find no abuse of discretion with the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence that appellee failed to wear mandatory foam-style hearing protection. In his deposition, Dr. Wolfe testified in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201cQ. You mentioned hearing protection. Are you familiar with a hearing protection device that is a sponge-like insert that you squeeze and then place into your external canal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">\u201cQ. Are you aware of \u2014 of what these sort of hearing devices are designed and required to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">\u201cQ. And what is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">\u201cA. Protect the inner ear from excessive noise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">\u201cQ. Would they protect from explosions or traumas not involving noise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">\u201cA. They\u2019re not designed for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m going to ask you to assume that Mr. Lewis, at the time of the explosion, would have been wearing one of the sponge-like inserts that I just described to you, and I\u2019m going to ask you to assume further that the centrifuge exploded with a force such that it drilled the corn mash that you observed and imbedded the corn mash into \u2014 to his ear with a force that blew the machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>through the plant roof, okay? Would that sponge-plug have become jammed, at some point, in his ear or some part of his ear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201cA. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what would have happened. Certainly, those foam plugs are compressible. They are \u2014 their intent and purpose is not to protect somebody from an' explosion. Their intent and purpose is to protect somebody from harmful noise levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201cHow much that would have buffeted what went in his ear or whether that would have simply been blown in and it been blown [sic ] through the eardrum, I do not know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">ii * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201cQ. If I understood your testimony earlier today, I believe you said that you are unable to give any opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to what would have happened if Mr. Lewis had been wearing the foam-style hearing protection devices; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u201cA. That \u2014 \"that is correct. I can speculate, as I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">\u201cQ. But you could not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">\u201cA. (Interposing) But\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">\u201cQ. (Continuing) \u2014give me an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">\u201cA. (Interposing) But I cannot say for certain whether it would have blunted the force, whether it would have simply become another missile going into the inside of his ear.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Although Dr. Wolfe testified that it is possible that use of the foam-style ear inserts would have protected appellee from injury, he also testified that he did not know whether use of the inserts would have prevented or worsened appellee\u2019s injuries. Dr. Wolfe readily admitted the speculative nature of his testimony. Because appellant presented no evidence that use of the inserts would have prevented or lessened appellee\u2019s injuries, we find nothing unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable with the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence that appellee failed to wear the inserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">In its second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by permitting appellee to introduce evidence that South Point Ethanol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>settled its claims against appellant regarding the centrifuge explosion that injured appellee. Appellant objected during the following testimony at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cQ. Did South Point Ethanol hire an engineering firm to come in and try to find out why this, that unit failed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cA. Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201cQ. Based upon the engineer\u2019s findings, did South Point Ethanol file a lawsuit against the defendant alleging that the centrifuge was defective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cPOWELL: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">\u201cCOURT: Overruled. You may answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201cA. Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201cQ. Where was this lawsuit filed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">\u201cA. Here in Lawrence County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">\u201cQ. When was the trial scheduled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">\u201cA. Today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">\u201cQ. Is South Point Ethanol going to present any evidence at trial today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">\u201cA. No, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-17\">\u201cQ. Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-18\">\u201cA. <em>We have reached a settlement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-19\">\u201cQ. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-20\">Thus, the trial court permitted testimony of the fact that a settlement occurred in the lawsuit that South Point Ethanol brought against appellant. Appellant cites <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. BPS Co. </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 56, 23 OBR 101, 491 N.E.2d 365, for the proposition that Evid.R. 408 prohibits evidence concerning the settlement of claims between a party and a nonparty to the lawsuit in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">Appellee argues that Evid.R. 408 permits the introduction of evidence of the mere fact that a party has reached a settlement. Such evidence does not violate the rule\u2019s purpose, which is to prohibit evidence tending to demonstrate fault. Appellee further argues that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the evidence of the fact that appellant reached a settlement with South Point Ethanol explains why pieces of evidence were unavailable to appellant\u2019s expert Dr. McCarthy, explains why South Point Ethanol is not a party to the case, and explains South Point Ethanol\u2019s lack of motivation to be forthright concerning the investigation it conducted after the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Appellant replies to appellee\u2019s arguments by alleging that appellee used the settlement evidence at trial to bolster the credibility of his own witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Evid.R. 408 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cEvidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount. * * * This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The rule forbids evidence of a settlement when that evidence is presented \u201cto prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.\u201d The rule applies not only to evidence of a settlement between the parties, but also to evidence of a settlement between a party and a nonparty. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. BPS Co., </em>23 Ohio App.3d 56, 23 OBR 101, 491 N.E.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The rule, however, expressly permits evidence of a settlement when that evidence is presented for a purpose other than proving \u201cliability for or invalidity of the claim.\u201d In <em>Shimola v. Cleveland </em>(1992), 89 Ohio App.3d 505, 511, 625 N.E.2d 626, 630, the court permitted evidence of a mandamus action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant. The court reasoned that the mandamus action evidence outlined the history of the relocation of the house that was the subject of the action. In <em>Mark v. Mellott Mfg. Co. </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 571, 666 N.E.2d 631, we permitted evidence of an informal settlement agreement between the defendant and the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which evidence the plaintiff presented for the purpose of proving proximate cause. In <em>Scott v. Braun </em>(Nov. 22, 1995), Jefferson App. No. 94-J-13, unreported, 1995 WL 697836, after the appellant claimed that the appellee was the sole proximate cause of the accident, the court permitted the appellee to impeach the appellant with evidence that the appellant had filed a claim against a third party. In <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp. v. Am. Centennial Ins. Co. </em>(C.P.1995), 74 Ohio Misc.2d 272, 660 N.E.2d 828, after the plaintiff argued that \u201cit is well established in other jurisdictions that evidence of settlement between a party and one or more nonparties is admissible if necessary for the jury to understand why nonparties who would be expected to be at trial are not at trial,\u201d the court permitted the plaintiff to introduce evidence of such a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee presented evidence of the settlement between appellant and South Point Ethanol for several purposes other than proving \u201cliability for or invalidity of the claim.\u201d Appellee presented the evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>explain why pieces of evidence were unavailable to appellant\u2019s expert Dr. McCarthy, to explain why South Point Ethanol is not a party to the case, and to explain South Point Ethanol\u2019s lack of motivation to be forthright concerning the investigation it conducted after the explosion. Because appellee presented the evidence for a purpose other than proving \u201cliability for or invalidity of the claim,\u201d we find no abuse of discretion with the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In its third assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by permitting appellee to elicit expert testimony from his economist on the monetary value of appellee\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life\u2019s pleasurable activities. In support of this assertion, appellant cites federal court decisions excluding such evidence. Appellant claims that the expert testimony from economist Dr. Michael Brookshire in the case <em>sub judice </em>fails both parts of the test enunciated in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, for use in determining the admissibility of expert testimony. Appellant additionally argues that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony does not assist the trier of fact in making its decision. In this regard, appellant cites Evid.R. 702. Appellant claims that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony is more prejudicial than probative. Appellant also claims that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony invades the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Appellee, in response, notes that appellant failed to object to Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony. Appellee additionally notes that many scholars have accepted the willingness-to-pay methodology of determining the monetary value of the loss of use and enjoyment of life. Appellee argues that appellant\u2019s arguments under this assignment of error address the weight, not the admissibility, of Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">In reply, appellant argues that although no Ohio cases have either allowed or disallowed testimony similar to Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony, federal courts have disallowed such testimony. Appellant further argues that appellee, by stating that the testimony was of some assistance \u201cin asking a jury to do what appears to be the impossible \u2014 quantify something which cannot truly be determined, that is the value of human life,\u201d admitted that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony attempts to quantify something which cannot be quantified.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Initially, we will address appellee\u2019s argument that appellant failed to object to Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony. Although appellant did not raise an objection to Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony during the playing of his videotaped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>deposition at trial, appellant did raise an objection prior to the playing of the videotape. The trial court permitted appellant to make the objection early rather than to interrupt the playing of the videotaped deposition. For this reason, we reject appellee\u2019s argument that appellant failed to raise an objection to Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony on the monetary value of appellee\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life\u2019s pleasurable activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Next, we note that in <em>Fantozzi v. Sandusky Cement Products Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 601, 597 N.E.2d 474, paragraph two of the syllabus, the court permitted recovery for \u201closs of ability to perform the plaintiffs usual functions.\u201d The court specified that these damages include damages for loss of enjoyment of life. The court defined \u201chedonic damages\u201d as being damages to compensate the plaintiff for the \u201cinability to perform the usual activities of life that have actually provided distinct pleasure\u201d to the plaintiff. <em>Id., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 614, 597 N.E.2d at 484. In <em>Ramos v. Kuzas </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 42, 43, 600 N.E.2d 241, 243, the court summarized <em>Fantozzi </em>in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201cIn <em>Fantozzi, </em>we observed that the \u2018loss of ability to perform the plaintiffs usual functions\u2019 <em>(i.e., </em>loss of enjoyment of life) damages can be categorized as either \u2018basic\u2019 or \u2018hedonic\u2019 in form. \u2018Basic losses\u2019 or disability losses include the inability to perform the basic mechanical body movements of walking, climbing stairs, feeding oneself, and driving a car. 64 Ohio St.3d at 614-615, 597 N.E.2d at 484^485. \u2018Hedonic losses\u2019 include the inability to perform the plaintiffs usual specific activities which had given pleasure to this particular plaintiff, such as playing golf, dancing, bowling, playing musical instruments, and engaging in specific outdoor sports.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In <em>Ramos, </em>the court held that because a newborn injured in \u00fatero or at birth has not had adequate time to develop an ability to perform a pleasurable activity or hobby specific to his or her lifestyle, a newborn cannot suffer hedonic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee presented Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony by videotape concerning his calculations of the monetary value of appellee\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life\u2019s pleasurable activities. Dr. Brookshire testified that he wrote Economic/Hedonic Damages: The Practice Book for Plaintiff and Defense Attorneys in 1990 and that he supplemented that book annually through 1993.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Brookshire testified in pertinent part as follows concerning the willingness-to-pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>methodology he used to calculate the monetary value of appellee\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life\u2019s pleasurable activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201cQ. How long have economists studied the value of human life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cA. The first economics book was written in 1776 by an economist in England named Adam Smith, it was called the \u2018Wealth of Nations,\u2019 and in that very first textbook he talks about what we call compensating wage differentials. He said, and this is the whole basis of the theory we\u2019re talking about, he said whatever you have to pay a worker to be a common laborer above the ground, you have to pay them more money to do the same job a mile under the ground in a coal mine. And they had coal mines in England at that time.

Dr. Brookshire also explained that his $143,000 estimate \u201cis based on a lot of science.\u201d Dr. Brook-shire reasoned that because the state of Ohio willingly pays $34,381.00 per year to house a maximum security prisoner, we are \u201cwilling to pay * * * $34,381.00 to keep alive the worst of us.\u201d That prisoner amount is forty-five percent of the $77,000 per year amount that Dr. Brookshire calculated as the noneconomic value of appellee\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Appellant contends that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony does not satisfy the two-part admissibility test enunciated in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. Prior to the enactment of Evid.R. 702, courts could admit scientific evidence only if it had gained \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d in the relevant scientific community. The <em>Daubert </em>court held that under Fed.Evid.R. 702, expert scientific evidence is admissible if the trial court determines that the evidence is both reliable and relevant. The <em>Daubert </em>court wrote in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201cFaced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony, then, the trial judge must determine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(A), whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue. This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue. We are confident that federal judges possess the capacity to undertake this review. Many factors will bear on the inquiry, and we do not presume to set out a definitive checklist or test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In <em>State v. Clark </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 389, 414, 655 N.E.2d 795, 810-811, discretionary appeal not allowed in (1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 1548, 650 N.E.2d 1367, the court summarized as follows the reliability half of the two-part test enunciated in <em>Daubert:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cIn <em>Daubert, </em>the Supreme Court set forth various guidelines to assist the trier of fact in determining whether the evidence is based on \u2018scientific knowledge.\u2019 The court explained that the trial court must engage in a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>issue. Key questions for resolution by the trial court include: whether the reasoning or methodology has been tested; whether the theory or technique has been subject to peer review and publication; considerations of the known or potential rate of error and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique\u2019s operation; and, finally, consideration of whether the methods or techniques have gained \u2018general acceptance\u2019 should be considered.\u201d See, also, <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 687 N.E.2d 735. Pursuant to <em>Daubert, </em>the trial court now serves as a gatekeeper who determines whether disputed evidence is scientific and whether it will assist the trier of fact. In <em>Wilson v. Chicago </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 6 F.3d 1233, 1238, the court characterized this gatekeeping function as \u201cthe responsibility for keeping \u2018junk science\u2019 out of the courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In <em>Daubert, </em>the court commented as follows that if a party believes that the trial court has failed in its gatekeeper role by erroneously admitting unsound scientific evidence, the party may employ traditional methods of attacking the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cVigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence. * * * Additionally, in the event the trial court concludes that the scintilla of evidence presented supporting a position is insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the position more likely than not is true, the court remains free to direct a judgment * * *. These conventional devices, rather than wholesale exclusion under an uncompromising \u2018general acceptance\u2019 test, are the appropriate safeguards where the basis of scientific testimony meets the standards of Rule 702.\u201d <em>Id., </em>509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. at 2798,125 L.Ed.2d at 484.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Thus, traditional methods of attacking \u201cshaky but admissible evidence\u201d give parties the opportunity to challenge disputed scientific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner </em>(1997), 522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508, the court rejected the argument that the trial court\u2019s new \u201cgatekeeper\u201d role in screening scientific evidence pursuant to <em>Daubert </em>somehow altered the standard of review that appellate courts must apply when reviewing rulings admitting or excluding expert scientific evidence. In <em>Gen. Elec. Co., </em>the court wrote as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u201cWe granted certiorari in this case to determine what standard an appellate court should apply in reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>509 U.S. 579 [113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469] (1993). We hold that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard.\u201d 522 U.S. at 138-139, 118 S.Ct. at 515, 139 L.Ed.2d at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Thus, the abuse of discretion standard of review applies when appellate courts review trial court decisions to admit or exclude expert scientific evidence in accordance with <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Once again, we note that an abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment. We again note that in <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 126-127, 482 N.E.2d 1248, 1252, the court wrote as follows that an abuse of discretion involves a result \u201cpalpably and grossly violative of fact and logic\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cThe term discretion itself involves the idea of choice, of an exercise of the will, of a determination made between competing considerations. In order to have an \u2018abuse\u2019 in reaching such determination, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Thus, an abuse of discretion will not be found when the reviewing court simply could maintain a different opinion were it deciding the issue <em>de novo. </em>Rather, an abuse of discretion indicates an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find no abuse of discretion with the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony. Although we might have chosen to exclude Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony, we find nothing unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable with the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony. We note that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony arguably supports the scientific validity and relevance of his methodology of calculating the monetary value of appellee\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life\u2019s pleasurable activities. Dr. Brookshire testified that his methodology has been the subject of one hundred articles published in the economics literature. Dr. Brookshire compared his figure of the value of human life with figures from the Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Appellant presented no evidence to prove that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s methodology was unscientific, not generally accepted, or otherwise infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We acknowledge that although appellant presented no evidence to prove that Dr. Brookshire\u2019s methodology was flawed, appellant cited various federal district court cases that excluded willingness-to-pay hedonic damages testimony by Stan Smith, an economist who apparently co-authored Economic/Hedonic Damages: The Practice Book for Plaintiff and Defense Attorneys in 1990 with Dr. Brook-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>shire.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Kurncz v.

U.S. Gypsum Co. </em>(D.Kan.1994), 862 F.Supp. 317; <em>Mercado v. Ahmed </em>(N.D.Ill.1991), 756 F.Supp. 1097, affirmed in (C.A.7, 1992), 974 F.2d 863. We agree with appellant that Stan Smith\u2019s proposed testimony in those cases bears strikingly similarity to Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We also agree with appellant that those cases provide cogent reasons for excluding Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Kumcz, </em>the court noted that the willingness-to-pay methodology \u201cvalues life or the enjoyment of life according to how much people are willing to pay for safer living.\u201d The <em>Kumcz </em>court reasoned that the willingness-to-pay method of calculating hedonic damages includes assumptions that cannot be validated, including the assumption that people consider and accurately evaluate the risks they face when making purchases or choosing employment, the assumption that people have freedom to choose whether to work in a high risk or a low risk job, and the assumption that risk calculation governs decision-making. Accord <em>Hein v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(M.D.Tenn.1994), 868 F.Supp. 230, 234. The <em>Kurncz </em>court also noted that the willingness-to-pay method involves a certain \u201ceyeballing\u201d in selecting a statistical life value because \u201c[e]conomists\u2019 studies have varied tremendously in their valuations, arriving at figures as disparate as $100,000 and $12,000,000,\u201d and \u201c[i]n the government regulation arena, the figures have varied between $70,000 to $132,000,000.\u201d See, also, <em>McGuire v. Santa Fe </em>(D.N.M.1996), 954 F.Supp. 230, in which the expert witness concluded that the economic value of a human life ranges from $928,000 to $18,464,000. The <em>Kurncz </em>court concluded that \u201cin the end, Mr. Smith\u2019s method is nothing more than a compilation of lay responses.\u201d For those reasons, the <em>Kurncz </em>court rejected the willingness-to-pay methodology employed by Stan Smith in that case and by Dr. Brookshire in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>Ayers, </em>the court found that \u201cthe entire process of selecting and adjusting willingness-to-pay data has proven unreliable because of the widely divergent views among economists concerning what does and does not constitute a sound study.\u201d 887 F.Supp. at 1061. The <em>Ayers </em>court also noted that the willingness-to-pay methodology estimates the value of a statistical person, not the value of the plaintiffs particular life. After noting that in his expert testimony, Stan Smith referred to Adam Smith\u2019s 1776 work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, the <em>Ayers </em>court caustically commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201cBy seeking to portray as a genealogical credential the exceedingly tenuous connection between his willingness-to-pay methodology and Adam Smith\u2019s <em>Wealth of Nations, </em>Stan Smith coats his novel use of a quite recent economic theory with a vintage veneer that it does riot deserve.\u201d 887 F.Supp. at 1063.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Brookshire likewise referred to Adam Smith\u2019s work in an attempt to give the willingness-to-pay methodology a genealogical credential.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the court noted that the willingness-to-pay methodology does not take into account any particular facts about the plaintiff. Accord <em>Kurncz, supra; Patch v. Glover </em>(1993), 248 Ill.App.3d 562, 188 Ill.Dec. 13, 618 N.E.2d 583. See, also, <em>Ramos v. Kuzas </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 42, 600 N.E.2d 241, in which the court held that because a newborn has not had adequate time to develop an ability to perform a pleasurable activity, a newborn cannot suffer hedonic damages. The <em>Sullivan </em>court additionally noted that damages for loss of enjoyment of life \u201care, by their very nature, not amenable to such analytical precision.\u201d 862 F.Supp. at 321. The <em>Sullivan </em>court believed that \u201ca jury is capable of determining these losses from its own experiences and knowledge, and through testimony\u201d about the plaintiffs life. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In <em>Mercado, </em>the district court rejected the willingness-to-pay methodology because \u201cthere is no basic agreement among economists as to what elements ought to go into the life valuation,\u201d and because the willingness-to-pay evidence is founded on the consensus \u201cof persons who are no more expert than are the jurors on the value of the lost pleasure of life.\u201d 756 F.Supp. at 1103. The circuit court affirmed and additionally commented that \u201cwe have serious doubts about [Stan Smith\u2019s] assertion that the studies he relies upon actually measure how much' Americans value life.\u201d 974 F.2d at 870. In this vein, the circuit court noted that many noneconomic factors influence purchases of safety items and choices of occupations.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Once again we note that although we agree with appellant that the above cases provide cogent reasons for excluding Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony, we find no abuse of discretion with the trial court\u2019s decision in the case <em>sub judice </em>to admit Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony. We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We believe that the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>question falls into the \u201cshaky but admissible\u201d category of evidence envisioned in <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">In conclusion, we note that in <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 614, 687 N.E.2d 735, 741, the court cautioned as follows against using the <em>Daubert </em>test to exclude all evidence of questionable reliability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cFurthermore, the reliability requirement of <em>Daubert </em>should not be used to exclude all evidence of questionable reliability, nor should a court exclude such evidence simply because it is confusing. <em>In re Paoli RR. Yard PCB Litigation </em>(C.A.3,1994), 35 F.3d 717, 744. Instead, there must be something that makes the scientific technique particularly overwhelming to laypersons for the court to exclude such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 746.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is arguably nothing in Dr. Brookshire\u2019s methodology that makes it particularly overwhelming to laypersons. Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony arguably supports the scientific validity and relevance of his methodology of calculating the monetary value of appellee\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life\u2019s pleasurable activities. The trial court thus did not abuse its discretion when performing its <em>Daubert </em>\u201cgatekeeper\u201d function. After the trial court admitted Dr. Brookshire\u2019s testimony, appellant had the opportunity to employ traditional methods of attacking Dr. Brookshire\u2019s evidence, including \u201cvigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and [a request for] careful instruction on the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 596,113 S.Ct. at 2798,125 L.Ed.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">In its fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury to limit its consideration of medical expenses incurred by appellee to those expenses documented in appellee\u2019s medical exhibit binder. The binder included only about ten percent ($13,221.37) of the $125,000 to $130,000 of medical expenses that appellee testified he incurred. Appellant claims that because appellee never produced any medical bills during the discovery process and because appellee failed to present testimony to prove the reasonableness or necessity of the medical expenses, the trial court should not have permitted the jury to consider the medical expenses that were not in the binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In response, appellee argues that appellant never questioned him on cross-examination about the reasonableness or necessity of the medical expenses and never presented any other evidence to question the reasonableness or necessity of the medical expenses. Appellee further argued that Ohio case law does not require expert testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In reply, appellant cited <em>Davidson v. Brockman </em>(Dec. 30, 1982), Franklin App. No. 82AP-610, unreported, 1982 WL 4617, for the proposition that personal injury plaintiffs must present expert testimony to demonstrate the reasonableness and necessity of medical expenses. In <em>Davidson, </em>the court commented, \u201cIn any event, expert testimony is required to support the necessity of the services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">After <em>Davidson, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that proof of the amount paid for medical services is prima facie evidence of the necessity and reasonableness of the charges. In <em>Wagner v. McDaniels </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 184, 9 OBR 469, 459 N.E.2d 561, paragraph one of the syllabus, the court held as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u201cProof of the amount paid or the amount of the bill rendered and of the nature of the services performed constitutes prima facie evidence of the necessity and reasonableness of the charges for medical and hospital services. <em>(DeTunno v.

With regard to the reasonableness of the services, the <em>Wagner </em>court found that evidence of the amount of the medical charges was prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of the charges. The <em>Wagner </em>court specifically rejected the notion that the plaintiff must bring in the accounting head of the medical facility or other experts to testify about the reasonableness of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>testimony by appellee and others concerning the extent of his injuries supported the necessity of the medical services he received. Appellant presented no evidence to the contrary. Appellee\u2019s testimony about the amount of the medical charges constituted prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of the medical charges. Appellant had the opportunity to cross-examine appellee concerning the medical charges. Appellant presented no evidence to rebut the presumption that the medical charges were necessary and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In his first assignment of error,\" appellee contends that the trial court erred by granting appellant\u2019s motion for directed verdict on the punitive damages claim. Appellee acknowledges that to prove a punitive damages claim, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant acted with actual malice or with conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others. Appellee claims that three items of evidence prove that appellant acted with conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others. First, in a February 7, 1994 letter from appellant\u2019s vice-president Howard Sager to the South Point Ethanol Director of Operations, Sager admitted that after the accident he discovered that stress corrosion fatigue was present in the rotating assembly when it was released for use by South Point Ethanol and appellee. Second, appellant guaranteed the rebuilt rotating assembly would be as good as new. Third, appellee\u2019s expert R. Dean Harris testified that appellant\u2019s practice of not using new three-fourth-inch stainless steel connecting screws to join the bowl to the flange extension violated accepted practices and standards in the industry. Appellee claims that these three items of evidence would have been sufficient to support an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In response, appellant argues pursuant to R.C. 2315.21(C)(3) that appellee must prove punitive damages by clear and convincing evidence. Appellant cites <em>Preston v. Murty </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 334, 512 N.E.2d 1174, and <em>Cabe v. Lunich </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 598, 640 N.E.2d 159, for the proposition that in Ohio a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with actual malice before the plaintiff may recover punitive damages. Appellant notes that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee presented no evidence that appellant acted with actual malice. Appellant notes that although more than five thousand of its decanter centrifuges have logged an \u201castronomical number\u201d of hours of operation, no similar accident has ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In reply, appellee contends that actual malice may be inferred. Appellee argues that the jury could have inferred actual malice from the fact that appellant failed to use new stainless steel connecting screws and the fact that appellant guaranteed the product to be the same as new.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Civ. R. 50(A)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cWhen a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>When determining a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court must submit an essential issue to the jury if there is sufficient credible evidence to permit reasonable minds to reach different conclusions on that issue. If, however, all the evidence, when construed most strongly against the movant, permits only a finding against the other party, then the trial court must instruct a finding or direct a verdict against that party. <em>Wagner v. Roche Laboratories </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 116, 671 N.E.2d 252; <em>Helmick v. Republic-Franklin Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 71, 529 N.E.2d 464; and <em>O\u2019Day v.

Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1985), 24 Ohio App.3d 94, 24 OBR 164, 493 N.E.2d 293.

Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 93, 551 N.E.2d 172. The \u201creasonable minds\u201d test of Civ. R. 50(A)(4) requires the court to determine only whether there is any evidence of substantial probative value in support of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>Thus, a motion for a directed verdict should be denied where the party against whom the motion is made has offered evidence tending to support all material issues necessary to constitute a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we agree with the trial court that appellee failed to present sufficient evidence to support an award of punitive damages. In <em>Preston v. Murty </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 334, 512 N.E.2d 1174, syllabus, the court held as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u201cActual malice, necessary for an award of punitive damages, is (1) that state of mind under which a person\u2019s conduct is characterized by hatred, ill will or a spirit of revenge, or (2) a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.\u201d Accord <em>Malone v. Courtyard by Marriott L.P. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 440, 445-446, 659 N.E.2d 1242, 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee failed to present sufficient evidence of actual malice. The evidence presented at trial, when construed most strongly in favor of appellee, does not support an award of punitive damages. The fact that Sager admitted that after the accident he discovered that stress corrosion fatigue had been present in the rotating assembly before the accident does not prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>appellant knew about the fatigue before the accident. The fact that appellant guaranteed that th\u00e9 rebuilt rotating assembly would be as good as new does not prove that appellant acted with hatred, ill will, or a spirit of revenge, and does not prove that appellant exhibited a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of appellee. The fact that appellant\u2019s practice of not using new three-fourth-inch stainless steel connecting screws to join the bowl to the flange extension violated accepted practices and standards in the industry also does not prove that appellant acted with hatred, ill will, or a spirit of revenge, and does not prove that appellant exhibited a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of appellee. Thus, we find no error with the trial court\u2019s decision granting appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellee\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In his second assignment of error, appellee contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for prejudgment interest pursuant to R.C. 1343.03(C). Appellee claims that he presented evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he made a good faith effort to settle the action and that appellant did not make a good faith effort to settle the action. Appellee contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant\u2019s insurer\u2019s claim file demonstrates that appellant failed to make a good faith effort to settle the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In response, appellant notes that we may not reverse a trial court\u2019s judgment concerning prejudgment interest unless that judgment constitutes an abuse of discretion. Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision denying prejudgment interest does not constitute an abuse of discretion. In support of this argument, appellant notes, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) this case involved thousands of pages of documents and over thirty depositions; (2) appellant settled with South Point Ethanol just one week prior trial; (3) appellant did not receive a settlement demand from appellee until one month prior to trial; (4) discovery continued until eleven days prior to trial; (5) two days before the discovery cut-off date, appellant received documents from South Point Ethanol, which documents appellant alleges \u201cclearly showed that the accident in this case resulted from the presence of a foreign object left inside the cover of the centrifuge by South Point Ethanol employees\u201d; and (6) these documents gave appellant \u201creason to believe that it would succeed in absolving itself from liability at trial.\u201d Appellant contends that these factors and others demonstrate that appellant did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">In reply, appellee notes that appellant did not introduce the allegedly favorable South Point Ethanol documents into evidence at trial. Appellee further notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>that it is unclear whether the trial court read appellant\u2019s insurer\u2019s claim file before the trial court denied appellee\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We agree with appellant that the abuse of discretion standard of review applies to decisions on motions for prejudgment interest. See <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 159, 25 OBR 201, 202-203, 495 N.E.2d 572, 574. Once again, we note that an abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment \u2014 it involves a result that is \u201cpalpably and grossly violative of fact and logic.\u201d <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 127, 482 N.E.2d 1248, 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find no abuse of discretion with the trial court\u2019s decision denying appellee\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest. R.C. 1343.03(C) permits trial courts to award prejudgment interest as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201c(C)(1) In addition to the post-judgment interest described in division (B) of this section, interest on a judgment, decree, or order for the payment of money rendered in a civil action based on tortious conduct and not settled by agreement of the parties shall be computed from the date the plaintiff gave the defendant written notice in person or by certified mail that the cause of action accrued until the date that the judgment, decree or order for the payment of money is rendered or from the date the plaintiff filed a complaint to commence the civil action until the date that the judgment, decree, or order for the payment of money is rendered, whichever time period is longer, <em>if, </em>upon motion of any party to the civil action, <em>the court determines </em>at a hearing held subsequent to the verdict or decision in the civil action <em>that the party required to pay the money failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case and that the party to whom the money is to be paid did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle the case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 25 OBR 201, 495 N.E.2d 572, syllabus, the court defined as follows what constitutes the absence of a failure to make a good faith effort to settle the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">\u201cA party has not \u2018failed to make a good faith effort to settle\u2019 under R.C. 1343.03(C) if he has (1) fully cooperated in discovery proceedings, (2) rationally evaluated his risks and potential liability, (3) not attempted to unnecessarily delay any of the proceedings, and (4) made a good faith monetary settlement offer or responded in good faith to an offer from the other party. If a party has a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he has no liability, he need not make a monetary settlement offer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Thus, if a party has fully cooperated in discovery proceedings, has rationally evaluated risks and potential liability, has not attempted to unnecessar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ily delay the proceedings, and has made a good faith monetary settlement offer or responded in good faith to an offer, that party has not failed to made a good faith effort to settle the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In the case <em>stib judice, </em>the trial court\u2019s ruling denying appellee\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest is not \u201cpalpably and grossly violative of fact and logic.\u201d The record supports a finding that appellant cooperated in the extensive discovery proceedings in this action, rationally evaluated its risks and potential liability, did not attempt to unnecessarily delay the proceedings, and participated in settlement negotiations in good faith. We note that this action involved thousands of pages of documents and over thirty depositions. We further note that appellant settled its action against South Point Ethanol just one week prior trial. Last, we note that less than two weeks before trial appellant received documents from South Point Ethanol, which documents appellant alleges \u201cclearly showed that the accident in this case resulted from the presence of a foreign object left inside the cover of the centrifuge by South Point Ethanol employees.\u201d The existence of these documents arguably gave appellant an excuse for not attempting further settlement negotiations prior to trial. <em>Kalain, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellee\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-8\">Kline, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b259-9\">Harsha, J., concurs in Assignments of Error Nos.
