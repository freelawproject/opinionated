Blair appeals from his conviction and sentence for attempted rape, following a negotiated guilty plea. Blair contends that the trial court erred by accepting the plea without first determining that he understood the nature of the charge, as required by Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). We agree with Blair. Consequently, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Blair was charged with kidnapping and attempted rape. On the day of trial, Blair accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to attempted rape, with the state dismissing the kidnapping charge. The trial court accepted the plea and sentenced Blair accordingly. From his conviction and sentence, Blair appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Blair\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">\u201cThe trial court violated appellant\u2019s due process rights as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and erred under Ohio Criminal Rule 11(C) by accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea without first determining that appellant understood the nature of the charge to which he was pleading guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Blair relies upon Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">\u201cIn felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest, and shall not accept such plea without first addressing the defendant personally and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">\u201c(a) Determining that he is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and of the maximum penalty involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">Blair contends that the trial court failed to determine that he understood the nature of the charge \u2014 attempted rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">The pertinent part of the plea colloquy between Blair and the trial judge includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Mr. Blair, did you understand the plea agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-17\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand the State of Ohio is dismissing the kidnapping indictment; and your attorney, Mr. Lehmkuhl\u2019s, entering a guilty plea on your behalf to the charge of attempted rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201cThat charge is an aggravated felony of the second degree. When you plead guilty, you\u2019re admitting you committed that offense; and you\u2019re subject to a maximum sentence of 8 years to 15 years in the state penitentiary and a maximum fine of 7,500 dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cUnder this plea agreement, the Court will sentence you at this time to the Ohio State Penitentiary for a term of 5 years to 15 years. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Have you discussed the facts of the ease with your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you understand the nature of the charge against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: And do you understand the consequence of the plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you wish to enter this plea voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Whereupon, the trial court proceeded to explain to Blair the rights that he would be waiving by pleading guilty and also ascertained that Blair was willing to waive those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">The Ohio Supreme Court has expounded upon the nature of the determination that the trial court must make, in accepting a guilty plea, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-17\">\u201cThe question before the court is whether the defendant received a notice of the charges leveled against him and, if so, did he understand the nature of those charges. As to the latter requirement, there is no easy or exact way to make such a determination, <em>ie., </em>to determine what someone subjectively understands. If the defendant receives the proper information, then we can ordinarily assume that he understands that information. In this case, we must decide whether the defendant\u2019s counsel, or someone else, provided defendant with information or notice of the charges. To do so, we look at all the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the case. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 458, 464 [58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 1466].\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 34, 38, 14 O.O.3d 199, 201, 396 N.E.2d 757, 760.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">In view of the fact that Blair\u2019s plea was tendered on the day of trial, it is entirely plausible that his counsel had reviewed with him the nature of the charges against him, so that he understood what the state was required to prove. However, there is nothing in the record from which the trial court could make that determination. \u201cThe record must demonstrate that [the] defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>acquired an understanding of the nature of the charges against him, from whatever source, be it from the trial court itself, the prosecutor, or some other source, such that the trial court can determine that [the] defendant understands the charges to which he was pleading guilty or no contest.\u201d <em>State v. Shultz </em>(Mar. 28, 1994), Miami App. Nos. 93-CA-24 and 93-CA-25, unreported, 1994 WL 101512. See, also, <em>State v. Cookson </em>(June 1, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13368, unreported, 1993 WL 189921.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Because there is nothing in this record to support a finding that Blair was ever advised, by anyone, of the nature of the charge of attempted rape \u2014 that is, what the state would have had to prove to convict him \u2014 we agree with Blair that the trial court erred in accepting his plea. A defendant\u2019s mere affirmative response to the question whether he understands the nature of the charge against him, without more, is insufficient to support the necessary determination that he understands the nature of the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Blair\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Blair\u2019s sole assignment of error has been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-10\">Wolff and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
