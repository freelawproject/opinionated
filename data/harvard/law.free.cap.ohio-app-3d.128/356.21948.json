McMonagle, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Appellant Shaun West appeals the decision of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division, which found appellant delinquent and placed him in the custody of the Ohio Department of Youth Services (\u201cODYS\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the finding of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The record reflects that appellant was charged with being a delinquent child for acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.12(A)(2), a felony of the second degree. During the arraignment, appellant admitted to the charge against him, notwithstanding that he was without counsel and had been served the complaint by the court only during the arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">In addressing the appellant, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, we\u2019re going to serve you today then. This is a copy of it. This will save us from sending it through the mail to you. You can sign a waiver that you waive service of process. She\u2019ll give you another form to sign in a minute.

The state concedes that the court\u2019s acceptance of the admission was flawed and likewise requests this court to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Juv.R. 29(D) governs the initial procedure upon an entry of an admission and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cThe court may refuse to accept an admission and shall not accept an admission without addressing the party personally and determining both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u201c(1) The party is making the admission voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the allegations and the consequences of the admission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">\u201c(2) The party understands that by entering an admission the party is waiving the right to challenge the witnesses and evidence against the party, to remain silent, and to introduce evidence at the adjudicatory hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">In order to satisfy the requirements of this rule, the court must address the youth personally and conduct an on-the-record discussion to determine whether the admission is being entered knowingly and voluntarily. <em>In re McKenzie </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 275, 277, 656 N.E.2d 1377, 1378-1379, citing <em>In re Meyer </em>(Jan. 15, 1992), Hamilton App. Nos. C-910292 and C-910404, unreported, 1992 WL 5843. An admission once made is reviewed for substantial compliance with these requirements. <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>In re William H. </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 761, 766, 664 N.E.2d 1361, 1364-1365. Absent a showing of prejudice, if there is substantial compliance with the rule, the plea is voluntarily and intelligently entered and will not be disturbed on appeal. See <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio. St.2d 86, 92-93, 5 O.O.3d 52, 55-56, 364 N.E.2d 1163, 1166-1167. \u201cSubstantial compliance means that under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant subjectively understands the implications of his plea and the rights he is waiving.\u201d <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474, 476; <em>In re Jenkins </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 177, 181, 655 N.E.2d 238, 240. The test for prejudice is \u201cwhether the plea would otherwise have been made.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>supra, </em>at 93, 5 O.O.3d at 56, 364 N.E.2d at 1167; see, also, <em>In re Palmer </em>(Nov. 21, 1996), Franklin App. No. 96APF03-281, unreported, 1996 WL 673537.</p>\n<p id=\"AUv\">As can be ascertained from the excerpted colloquy above, the trial court failed even to minimally comply with the requirements of Juv.R. 29(D). While appellant was personally addressed, there was only minimal discussion of the charged offense and the penalties associated with that offense. More alarming is the fact that there is no discussion regarding the rights that appellant would be waiving by entering an admission and only a cursory attempt at inquiring of appellant\u2019s right to counsel. Because the trial court\u2019s acceptance of appellant\u2019s admission did not comply with Juv.R. 29(D), it is not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"A68\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken and is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"ATx\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AYo\">Patton and Rocco, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
