Though the parties stipulated that appellee did not in fact have a disability, the trial court concluded that appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>was handicapped as a matter of law pursuant to R.C. 4112.01(A)(21) because appellant \u201cregarded\u201d him as having a handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In October 1992, appellant placed a job notice in the local newspaper for an \u201centry level employee in the water/wastewater plant.\u201d The ad required that applicants possess a minimum of an associate degree in civil engineering technologies and live no further than twenty minutes from St. Clairsville, Ohio. After responding to the ad in November 1992, appellee was granted an initial interview with the superintendent of the water department, Richard Bauer, and a second interview with the director of public services, Dennis Bigler.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The position for which appellee was being considered was a \u201chybrid\u201d job consisting primarily of general labor duties and inspecting duties on an as-needed basis. The record reveals that starting pay for the hybrid position was $7.70 an hour, plus full medical benefits, and was to be covered by a collective bargaining agreement upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period. An official job posting dated December 12, 1992 described the labor duties as \u201ctypical duties in the water/wastewater department.\u201d A review of the record indicates that both Bauer and Bigler considered appellee qualified to execute the inspection duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In December 1992, the city council approved an offer of employment to appellee, contingent upon his submitting to a routine medical examination. That the contingent offer was orally presented to appellee as such does not appear to be disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Prior to appellee\u2019s taking the required medical exam, Bigler was informed by one of appellee\u2019s prior employers during a routine reference check that appellee had suffered a back injury several years earlier that caused him to take time off for treatment and rehabilitation. In a January 27, 1993 report prepared as a result of appellee\u2019s medical examination, appellant\u2019s examining physician, Dr. Murray, noted that appellee disclosed a prior herniated disk injury, that appellee had a \u201csomewhat rigid lumbar spine with loss of normal lumbar lordosis,\u201d and that his \u201cforward flexion is to only 45 degrees.\u201d Though Dr. Murray made no specific conclusory statements as to the aforementioned medical notations, he did write in an attached letter dated January 29, 1993 that appellee \u201cappears currently to be well and denies any back problems. Although recurrence remains a possibility, he should be able to perform routine activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">On or about February 10, 1993, Bigler informed appellee that he would not be hired for the \u201chybrid\u201d position. Bigler, however, proposed that appellee consider providing inspection services for the city as an independent contractor on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. The record indicates that both parties understood at the time of this discussion that the starting pay for the inspector\u2019s position was $12 an hour, no benefits were provided, and appellee would not be covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Both parties to this discussion also agree that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>no discussion as to the number of hours appellee would be guaranteed as an inspector or the potential for such a position developing into full-time employment. Though the city council had authorized a hiring to fill the \u201chybrid\u201d position, it had not authorized the hiring of an inspector. As a postscript, the record reveals that the \u201chybrid\u201d position remained unfilled at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Bigler testified that his decision to rescind the contingent offer of employment was made in consideration of a combination of factors, including appellee\u2019s prior back injury, his layman\u2019s assessment of Dr. Murray\u2019s medical report, the unique physical demands placed upon laborers in the water/wastewater department, his personal knowledge of the burden that workers\u2019 compensation and insurance claims place upon an employer and appellee\u2019s apparent interest and skill in the inspecting duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Appellee, however, testified that Bigler told him that the decision was primarily based upon a discussion he had with a workers\u2019 compensation consultant who, upon reviewing Dr. Murray\u2019s report, opined that a back injury claim would cost the city between $30,000 and $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Appellee subsequently forwarded to Bigler a letter from Dr. Marquart dated March 2, 1993. Dr. Marquart, the physician who initially treated appellee\u2019s back injury in 1990, stated that appellee had completed his physical therapy program and that appellee\u2019s limited extension and flexion did not pose \u201cany type of a restriction on his activities in any way whatsoever.\u201d Dr. Marquart also recommended, upon review of <em>appellee\u2019s 1991 functional capacity evaluation, </em>that appellee was \u201ccapable of doing any activity he so desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The record also includes, however, a prior draft of Dr. Marquart\u2019s letter, dated February 23, 1993, which is substantially similar to the March 2 letter, but which also included an additional sentence stating, <em>\u201cAt the present time, </em>strictly measuring his back, he only has a 35% flexion * *</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Appellee also submitted a personal letter to Bigler, dated March 3, 1993, \"indicating his continued interest in the full-time city employee position that appellant had \u201coffered\u201d and he had \u201caccepted\u201d in December 1992. Appellee also expressed his disinterest in the nonemployee inspector position by virtue of its not being comparable to the full-time position, noting that he would have to seek legal advice if appellant did not allow him to begin full-time work as an employee of the water department.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Appellee filed the underlying complaint on December 12, 1994, alleging that appellant had violated R.C. 4112.05(B) by denying him employment on the basis of a perceived disability. After a bench trial was had on October 22, 1996, the trial court entered a final judgment, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, on December 4,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The trial court found, as a matter of fact, that appellee was hired on Feb. 1, 1993, the labor duties attached to the hybrid job were general and routine, Dr. Murray\u2019s report did not in any way suggest that Kemo could not perform the essential functions of the hybrid job, appellant did not hire appellee for the hybrid position because it perceived appellant as having a physical impairment that substantially limited one or more major life functions, and appellee had no physical limitation that would have made him unable to perform all the duties and essential functions of the hybrid job.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The trial court concluded, as a matter of law, that appellee was a \u201chandicapped person\u201d as defined in R.C. 4112.01(A)(21), that appellant unlawfully discriminated against appellee pursuant to R.C. 4112.02(A), and that Bigler\u2019s alternate offer to have appellee perform inspector duties as an independent contractor on an as-needed basis was not comparable to the \u201chybrid\u201d position because the offer was not approved by council as required by R.C. 735.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Appellant filed this timely appeal on December 31,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Appellant presents five assignments of error in its appeal. Because the first and second assignments of error are interrelated, we shall address them concurrently. Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding that Jack Kemo is a \u2018handicapped person\u2019 as defined in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4112.01(A)(21).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that defendant regarded plaintiff as having a handicap.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">R.C. 4112.02 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">\u201c(A) For any employer, because of the * * * handicap * * * of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">The trial court\u2019s determination as to what appellant <em>regarded </em>is a question of fact that will not be reversed unless we find such a determination clearly erroneous and unsupported in the record. However, the definition of <em>handicapped </em>is a matter of statutory construction, subject to de novo review as a matter of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">\u201cIn order to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination, the person seeking relief must demonstrate (1) that he or she was handicapped, (2) that an adverse employment action was taken by an employer, at least in part, because the individual was handicapped, and (3) that the person, though handicapped, can safely and substantially perform the essential functions of the job in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>question.\u201d <em>Hood v. Diamond Products, Inc. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 298, 658 N.E.2d 738, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u201cOnce the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of handicap discrimination, the burden then shifts to the employer to set forth some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken.\u201d <em>Hood, supra, </em>at 302, 658 N.E.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The employer\u2019s burden is only one of production, satisfied upon the presentation of an explanation legally sufficient to justify judgment for the employer. <em>Manofsky v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 663, 664, 591 N.E.2d 752, 752, paragraph two of the syllabus, citing <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201c[I]f the employer establishes a nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken, then the employee or prospective employee must demonstrate that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext for impermissible discrimination.\u201d <em>Hood </em>at 302, 658 N.E.2d at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">R.C. 4112.01(A)(21) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">\u201c \u2018Handicapped person\u2019 means a person with a handicap.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">R.C. 4112.01(A)(13) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">\u201c \u2018Handicap\u2019 means a physical or mental impairment that <em>substantially </em>limits one or more <em>major life activities, </em>including the functions of caring for one\u2019s self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working; a record of a physical or mental impairment; <em>or being regarded as having a physical or mental impairment. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">In determining whether the trial court erred in concluding that appellee was handicapped, we address (1) whether appellee satisfied his burden in establishing a prima facie case that appellant rescinded the contingent offer of employment because it regarded appellee as having a physical impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities; (2) if appellee established a prima facie case, whether appellant satisfied its burden of production in presenting some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for rescinding the contingent offer; and (3) if appellant satisfied its burden of production, whether appellee satisfied his burden in proving that these otherwise legitimate reasons were merely pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Appellee does not challenge that an employer may make an offer of employment contingent upon the applicant\u2019s submitting to a medical examination for the purpose of evaluating the applicant\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of the specific employment for which he is being considered, where such a requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>is routinely and nondiscriminatorily applied as a matter of policy. We accept for purposes of this appeal that the requirement of a medical evaluation as a condition of employment was a proper and nondiscriminatorily applied policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">R.C. 4112.02(L) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cNothing in divisions (A) to (E) of this section shall be construed to require a handicapped person to be employed or trained under circumstances that would significantly increase the occupational hazards affecting either the handicapped person, other employees, the general public, or the facilities in which the work is to be performed, or to require the employment or training of a handicapped person in a job that requires the handicapped person routinely to undertake any task, the performance of which is substantially and inherently impaired by the handicapped person\u2019s handicap.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The language of R.C. 4112.02(L) reflects the General Assembly\u2019s contemplation of circumstances where an employer could properly deny employment to an individual on the basis of a medical evaluation without regarding the applicant as being handicapped. Without such a construction, every individual who was denied employment subsequent to a pre-employment medical evaluation would be considered handicapped as a matter of law. As a matter of public policy, such a construction is simply unmanageable.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">We therefore conclude that the threshold before which an employer may legitimately and justifiably deny an individual employment based upon a medical evaluation and after which a subsequent denial of employment rises to the level of discriminatory conduct due to an actual or perceived handicap is crossed where the impairment upon which the decision is allegedly based would, if it in fact existed, substantially limit one or more major life activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Factors to be considered in determining whether the impairment substantially limits one or more life activities include the nature and severity of the impairment, the duration or expected duration of the impairment, and the permanent or long-term impact, or the expected permanent or long-term impact of or resulting from the impairment. Section 1630.2(j)(2), Title 29, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In the present matter, the record clearly indicates that appellant regarded appellee\u2019s physical capabilities to be limited in some way. It is just as clear that an adverse employment action was taken by appellant, at least in part, because of appellee\u2019s perceived impairment. Though we accept for purposes of establishing a prima facie case the trial court\u2019s finding that appellee was capable of safely and substantially performing the specific tasks of the \u201chybrid\u201d position, we save for later an analysis of whether appellant would be justified in concluding under the circumstances that employing appellee in the \u201chybrid\u201d position would serve to significantly increase the occupational hazards affecting either him, other employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ees, or the general public. Therefore, our analysis of whether appellee satisfied his burden in establishing a prima facie case of handicap discrimination focuses on the degree of impairment appellant regarded appellee as having, and whether such an impairment, if it in fact existed, would substantially limit one or more major life activities. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the specific facts of the case do not support a conclusion that appellee satisfied this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Though R.C. 4112.01(A)(13) expressly includes \u201cwork\u201d as a major life activity, we must construe the term within the context of the statute as covering the most basic and fundamental of physical <em>tasks </em>in general, not specific <em>jobs </em>with specific <em>employers. </em>The record reveals that appellant\u2019s concern as to appellee\u2019s physical limitations arose from information acquired via Dr. Murray\u2019s report and letter and a routine reference check with a prior employer. The record does not support a finding that the cumulative effect of these communications could lead a reasonable person to conclude the degree of appellee\u2019s impairment was of such nature and severity, or of such duration or expected duration, or of such permanent or long-term impact as to render him substantially limited in performing routine labor duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">That appellant regarded appellee\u2019s physical limitations as unsuited for this specific job and that it subjectively believed that the specific duties associated with the job had the potential to cause a recurrence of appellee\u2019s back injury are insufficient to support a finding that appellant regarded appellee as substantially limited in a major life activity. Appellee\u2019s burden is to establish that appellant regarded him as substantially limited in his ability to perform such fundamental and routine tasks as are necessary to exist in everyday life, not merely to establish that appellant regarded him as limited in his abilities to perform the specific tasks associated with a specific job. In consideration of the description of the duties associated with the \u201chybrid\u201d position, discussed above, and Bigler\u2019s proposal that appellee perform inspection duties on an as-needed basis, we conclude that appellee did not satisfy the burden necessary to establish a prima facie case of handicapped discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Even if we accept <em>arguendo </em>that appellee did satisfy his initial burden, the burden would then shift to appellant to produce some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action legally sufficient to justify judgment in its favor. As noted above, Bigler testified that his decision to rescind the job offer was based upon his assessment of several factors, including appellee\u2019s prior back injury, his layman\u2019s assessment of Dr. Murray\u2019s medical report, the unique physical demands placed upon laborers in the water/wastewater department, his personal knowledge of the burden workers\u2019 compensation claims place upon an employer, and appellee\u2019s apparent interest and skill in the inspecting duties. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>also includes testimony that some of the duties associated with the \u201chybrid\u201d position were not so routine, such as climbing down and up dark, wet manholes, having to bend within the small confines of the manhole, and having to lift materials overhead within that restricted area. Based upon these specific facts of record, we cannot find that employer\u2019s stated reason for rescinding the contingent offer was a pretext for impermissible discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Having concluded that appellee failed to establish that he was a \u201chandicapped person\u201d as defined in R.C. 4112.01(A)(21), we also conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that defendant regarded plaintiff as having a handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we find appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error to be with merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that the job defendant offered to plaintiff when it withdrew an earlier conditional job offer was not comparable to the first position offered for purposes of tolling or reducing back wages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">In light of our discussion addressing appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, we find it unnecessary to address the comparable nature of the two offers. Having concluded that appellant was not bound to employ appellee pursuant to R.C. 4112.02(A), the similarity or difference of the two offers is immaterial, as they are legally independent of each other. We therefore find appellant\u2019s third assignment of error irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Since appellant\u2019s fourth and fifth assignments of error relate to the calculation and amount of damages awarded by the trial court, we shall dispose of them together. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that plaintiff is entitled to back pay beyond the date he voluntarily quit his employment with Demand Side Resources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s award of back wages in the amount of $45,212.79 is not supported by the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">We have already concluded that appellant was not bound to employ appellee. We also conclude that appellee failed to establish that he was injured as a result of appellant\u2019s conduct. Having failed to establish an injury, a discussion of damages is moot. Appellant\u2019s fourth and fifth assignments of error are therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. Judgment for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-5\">Gene Donofrio, P.J., and Vukovich, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
