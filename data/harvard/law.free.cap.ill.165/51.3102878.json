Homestead\u2014right must exist when judgment lien attaches.

Same\u2014wife may claim homestead exemption, though not the head of a family. The provision of the Exemption act (Rev. Stat. 1874, p. 497, sec. 1,) that \u201cevery householder having a family\u201d is entitled to a homestead exemption, does not require such householder to be the head of the family, and a wife is entitled to the exemption in her separate property when occupied as a homestead by herself, husband and children.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b51-16\" pgmap=\"51\">3.

Arthur H. Chetlain, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-18\" pgmap=\"51(151) 52(188)\">This cause arose upon a motion in the court below to set aside a sale of real estate on execution. The motion is based upon the affidavit of Elizabeth Scott, setting up that she is the owner in fee of the property sold, subject to an incumbrance, by mortgage, of \u00a73100; that the premises are' improved by a frame house, and are worth, with all the improvements, approximately, \u00a74000; \u201cthat said lot of land and buildings thereon are occupied by affiant as her residence and constitute the homestead of affiant and her family; that her husband is living, and he, together with affiant and her seven children, occupy said premises as their homestead, and the same is the family residence.\u201d It then sets up the judgment against herself and husband, the issuing of the execution thereon and the sale of the premises for \u00a7585.09, and that in the levy and sale no homestead was set off, nor $1000 to her or her husband in lieu thereof; that the sale was not for unpaid taxes or assessments or for debt or liability incurred for the purchase or improvement thereof, and no release of the homestead was made; that she and her husband are living together as husband and wife, and she makes the affidavit for the purpose of claiming the homestead exemption and having the sale thereof set aside. A counter affidavit by Edward W. Zander was filed, the substance of which is, that notwithstanding said Elizabeth Scott and her husband knew of the levy upon and intended sale of the premises, and by themselves and their attorneys made propositions for the payment and satisfaction of said judgment and postponement of the sale, they at no time claimed or gave him any notice whatever that the premises were occupied as a homestead or made any objection to the sale thereof. The court sustained the motion and set aside the sale and satisfaction of the judgment, from which this writ of error is prosecuted.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-5\" pgmap=\"52\">George A.

The language of the affidavit, as above shown, is, \u201cthat said lot of land and buildings thereon are occupied by appellant as her residence and constitute the homestead of appellant and her family; that her husband is living, and he, together with the affiant and her seven children, occupy said premises as their homestead and the same is the family residence.\u201d All these expressions as to occupancy are in the present tense, and the affidavit wholly fails to show that the premises were at any time so occupied previously to making the affidavit and motion. It is therefore not shown that they were so occupied when the judgment became a lien nor even when the sale was made. In Reinbach v. Walter, 27 Ill. 393, in which case the defendant attempted to set up homestead rights against an action of ejectment, it was said:. \u201cAs the defendant did not prove that any portion of the premises were his homestead at the time the judgment was rendered and when the lien attached, the law has no application. The proof is, that it was his homestead at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale. He may have moved upon the premises but the week before.\u201d To the same effect are Tourville v. Pierson, 39 Ill. 446, Chappell v. Spire, 106 id. 472, and Rock v. Haas, 110 id. 528. Indeed, it seems clear, upon principle, that in the absence of some express provision of the statute the right of exemption from execution sale, in order to be availed of, must exist at the time the lien attaches.</p> <p id=\"b54-5\" pgmap=\"54\">We do not think either of the other positions assumed can be maintained, but as the judgment of the court below must be reversed for the reasons stated, it will be unnecessary to discuss them at length. As to the contention that the real estate of the wife is not exempt from sale for payment of her debts, we think the law is otherwise. The language of section 1 of the statute entitled \u201cExemptions\u201d is, that \u201cevery householder having a family shall be entitled to an estate of homestead, to the extent in value of \u00a71000, in the farm or lot of land, and buildings thereon, owned or rightly possessed, by lease or otherwise, and occupied by him or her as a residence.\u201d We see no reason why-a wife, though living with her husband, may not be considered a householder under this provision. The statute does not make it necessary that the party claiming the exemption should be the head of a family. It is sufficient that he or she be a \u201chouseholder having a family.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b55-2\" pgmap=\"55\">The homestead right was not waived merely because it was not claimed before the sale. Imhoff v. Lipe, 162 Ill. 282.</p> <p id=\"b55-3\" pgmap=\"55\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause will be remanded, with directions to the Superior Court to overrule the motion.</p> <p id=\"Au\" pgmap=\"55\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
