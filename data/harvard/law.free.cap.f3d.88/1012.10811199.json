In the present case, the borrower, American Gasohol Refiners (American), in 1982 sought a $20,000,000 loan from Mid-Kansas Federal Savings and Loan Association (Mid-Kansas) to build an ethanol manufacturing plant in rural Kansas. Ethanol is an alcohol which may be blended with gasoline for use as fuel. Its price fluctuates depending upon changes in the prices of corn and other grains (from which it is made) and of oil. <em>See Worldwide: Wall St Roundup HIGH PLAINS CORP. (HIPC), </em>Wall Street Transcript, Mar. 21, 1994; <em>Research Analyst Interview: BASIC BRANDED FOOD PRODUCTS, </em>Wall Street Transcript, Aug. 8, 1994; <em>Broker Report: ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND (ADM), </em>Wall Street Transcript, Sept. 12,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Mid-Kansas and American applied to the Administration for a guarantee of the loan. In the application, Mid-Kansas stated that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0-k\">is pleased to sponsor and recommend this loan guaranty request to the [Administration]. We believe that this application and project are well planned, financially sound and properly suited for an [Administration] loan guarantee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Mid-Kansas sought a guarantee of ninety percent of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">In October 1982, the Administration issued a Conditional Commitment to Mid-Kansas and American, containing various conditions and stating that \u201c[a] Loan Note Guarantee will not be issued until the Lender certifies that it has no knowledge of any adverse change, financial or otherwise, in the Borrower, his business, or any parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates since it requested a Loan Note Guarantee.\u201d The Conditional Commitment also stated that \u201c[w]hen these conditions and requirements are met, Farmers Home Administration will issue a loan note guarantee in the amount of ninety percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">In December 1982, Wells Fargo agreed to finance American\u2019s construction of the proposed ethanol plant. Subsequently, the Conditional Commitment to Mid-Kansas and American (which changed its name to High Plains, <em>see Wells Fargo Bank, NA, </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 807 n. 2), which would have expired in 1983, was extended. The ethanol plant was built and began production in 1984, but \u201cWells Fargo and High Plains determined that an additional $3.5 million was necessary to bring the plant to full production.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">Wells Fargo, High Plains, the Administration, and several other interested parties executed an Intercreditor Agreement, dated September 9, 1985, \u201cwhich addressed the terms and conditions under which additional financing would be advanced by Wells Fargo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Intercreditor Agreement extended the Conditional Commitment through June 1986, and stated that \u201c[d]ue primarily to difficulties in achieving adequate production levels at the Plant, the [Administration] Guarantee has not issued.\u201d The Agreement also reaffirmed that \u201cupon compliance with the conditions of the Commitment and [Administration] regulations, the [Administration] will issue the [Administration] Guarantee for the benefit of Mid-Kansas or if Wells Fargo [become]s the lead lender, for the benefit of Wells Fargo.\u201d A new Conditional Commitment naming Wells Fargo as the lead lender was executed in October 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>In April 1986, the Administration directed its state directors to notify \u201clenders holding a conditional commitment for an alcohol production facility\u201d of ten items that it intended to consider \u201cin order to assure there is no adverse change in the project prior to their closing of the loan.\u201d The items included \u201c[e]urrent and future demand and markets for the product of the facility\u201d and \u201c[cjurrent and future prices of the product of the facility.\u201d Wells Fargo objected to this directive, stating that the consideration of price and other macro-economic factors in the decision whether to issue a guarantee was contrary to the policy goals of the loan guarantee program and to the understanding of the parties at the outset of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">In October 1986, the Administration wrote Wells Fargo that \u201cwe do not believe, based on the information submitted to date, that High Plains Corporation or Wells Fargo have met all conditions precedent to our issuance of the loan note guarantee.\u201d The letter stated fifteen respects in which High Plains and Wells Fargo\u2019s fulfillment of the conditions was deficient. Wells Fargo immediately responded, answering the fifteen deficiencies and explaining how each of the conditions had been satisfied. Additional correspondence ensued, both between Wells Fargo and the Administration and within the Administration, some of which indicated that the Administration was satisfied with the bank\u2019s response and intended to issue the guarantee. Based on these discussions, Wells Fargo agreed to provide an additional $5,000,000 in financing for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In a December 19, 1986, letter from the Administration\u2019s state director to Wells Fargo, however, the Administration stated that it was \u201cunable to execute a Loan Note Guarantee.\u201d The Administration explained that it was refusing to execute the guarantee because \u201c[t]here has been an adverse change in the financial condition of High Plains Corporation during the period of time between the issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee in 1982 and December 17, 1986.\u201d It referred to a Peat Marwick Mitchell and Company (Peat Marwick) report that \u201cindi-eate[d] that based on the price of ethanol ($.80 per gallon) and the cost of milo [grain] ($1.23 per bushel), the company would not generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations as of October 1986, or in the foreseeable future.\u201d The Administration also asserted that \u201c[t]he history of the management of the corporation reveals numerous decisions which have caused adverse results and. led us to have serious concerns about the credibility of its management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">D. After the Administration refused to issue the loan guarantee, High Plains and Wells Fargo twice restructured the loan. As part of the first restructuring, Wells Fargo received options to purchase eighty-four percent of High Plains\u2019s stock and reduced the loan balance by $12,700,000. In the second restructuring, Wells Fargo surrendered the options in exchange for $2,500,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Following a public offering of its stock in 1993, High Plains paid its indebtedness to Wells Fargo with the exception of $389,423, which the bank forgave in exchange for receiving the proceeds of the public offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">E. After the Administration denied an administrative appeal of the refusal to issue the guarantee, Wells Fargo filed a breach of contract suit in the United States Claims Court (the name of which in 1992 was changed to the United States Court of Federal Claims. For convenience\u2019s sake, we refer to the trial court by the latter name.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">In its opinion on liability, the court granted Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, holding that the Administration had contracted to issue the guarantee and had breached the contract. <em>Wells Fargo Bank, NA, </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 805 (1992). The court ruled that both the 1982 Conditional Commitment and the later Intercreditor Agreement were valid \u201cconditional contracts.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A, </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 810. According to the court, the Conditional Commitment was a unilateral contract, under which the Administration\u2019s commitment to issue the guarantee became binding when the bank began performance by making the loan to American. <em>Id. </em>at 810-11. The court stated that \u201c \u2018[t]here is ample case law holding that a contractual relationship arises between the government and a private party if promissory words of the former induce significant action by the latter in reli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>anee thereon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810 (quoting <em>National Rural Utils. Coop. Fin. Carp. v. United States, </em>14 Cl.Ct. 130, 137 (1988), <em>aff'd, </em>867 F.2d 1393 (Fed.Cir.1989)). In the court\u2019s view, both the Conditional Commitment and the Interereditor Agreement \u201cconstitute contracts that bind the [Administration] to issue the guarantee if the conditions were satisfied. The [Administration] was not free to withdraw its offer or to refuse to determine if the conditions were, in fact satisfied.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The court concluded that all of the conditions had been satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 817. It rejected the Administration\u2019s claims that adverse changes had occurred in either the financial condition or management of High Plains. The court ruled that the \u201cfirst reason for denying the guarantee, insufficient cash flow due to low ethanol prices,\u201d was \u201clegally insufficient\u201d because it was \u201cbased on conditions outside plaintiffs control for which the plaintiff did not assume the risk of forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815. The court also rejected the Administration\u2019s concerns about adverse changes in company management, because many of the examples the Administration gave pre-dated the Intercreditor Agreement and \u201cdid not prevent the [Administration] from signing [it],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 816, and also were known \u201cprior to [the Administration] indicating informally that the guarantee would be issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Following a separate trial on damages, the court awarded Wells Fargo $10,885,423.86. <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>33 Fed.Cl. at 236. This amount comprised two elements. The major portion \u2014 $10,496,000\u2014was for profits Wells Fargo allegedly lost because it was unable to make additional loans following a capital restructuring required as a result of the government\u2019s refusal to issue the guarantee. <em>See infra </em>part III.A. The second item was the $389,423 that Wells Fargo forgave when it received the proceeds of High Plains\u2019s public stock sale. <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>33 Fed.Cl. at 245-46. The court, however, denied Wells Fargo\u2019s additional request for damages of up to $26,264,000, reflecting its alleged losses from the surrender of its equity interest in High Plains, because those losses did not \u201cmeet the standards of foreseeability and certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The government challenges the rulings of the Court of Federal Claims (1) that there was a valid contract between the Administration and Wells Fargo that obligated the government to issue the guarantee upon Wells Fargo\u2019s compliance with the conditions, and (2) that the Administration breached the contract when it refused to issue the guarantee because Wells Fargo had not satisfied the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">A. The Court of Federal Claims correctly ruled that the Conditional Commitment constituted a unilateral contract by which the government agreed to guarantee the loan upon Wells Fargo\u2019s performance of the conditions specified, and that Wells Fargo accepted the contract through beginning performance by making the loan. As that court pointed out, \u2018\u201ca contractual relationship arises between the government and a private party if promissory words of the former induce significant action by the latter in reliance thereon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, </em>N.A, 26 Cl.Ct. at 810 (quoting <em>National Rural Utils. Coop. Fin. Corp., </em>14 Cl.Ct. at 137). Here, following the issuance of the Conditional Commitment, in which the Administration \u201cagree[d] ... [to] execute\u201d the \u201cLoan Note Guarantee\u201d (see <em>infra), </em>Wells Fargo accepted the government\u2019s offer by making the $20,000,000 loan to finance construction of the ethanol plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">The government, however, argues that no contract was formed because \u201c[u]nder [Administration] regulations, no Government official, not even one having authority to sign the guarantee at the proper time, had the authority to bind the United States to a loan note guarantee prior to compliance with all the regulatory requirements for issuance of a loan note guarantee.\u201d As the Court of Federal Claims correctly stated, however, \u201cthe issue at this point is not whether these officials had the authority to grant a guarantee, but whether these officials had the authority to obligate the [Administration] to a Conditional Commitment.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 810 n. 4. Administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>officials were authorized to execute conditional commitments under the regulations implementing the business and industrial loan guarantee program. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.452 (1982). That the guarantee could not finally be executed until the conditions were fulfilled is irrelevant in determining the validity of the Conditional Commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Although Administration regulations characterize the Conditional Commitment as mere \u201cadvice\u201d to the lender, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1980.6(a)(4), the document itself shows that the government is making a binding promise:</p>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">[T]he United States of America acting through the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) hereby agrees that ... it will execute Form(s) FmHA 449-34 \u201cLoan Note Guarantee\u201d subject to the conditions and requirements specified in said regulations and below.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Conditional commitments are signed by the Administration\u2019s state director, the lender, and the borrower. The document lists twenty-nine separate conditions that must be satisfied before the Administration issues the loan guarantee. These include such costly endeavors as obtaining insurance, establishing an escrow account, paving a road, obtaining permits, and providing extensive documentation to the Administration. No lender and borrower would be willing to undertake such steps in reliance on mere \u201cadvice\u201d rather than a firm promise. Moreover, in reliance on the Conditional Commitment, Wells Fargo risked the $20,000,000 it furnished to High Plains.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">That the government\u2019s promise to issue the loan guarantee was contingent upon High Plains and Wells Fargo\u2019s performance of numerous conditions does not make the promise any less binding. Indeed, the essence of a unilateral contract is that one party\u2019s promise is conditional upon the other party\u2019s performance of certain acts and when the other party performs, the first party is bound. <em>See M.K Metals, Inc. v. Container Recovery Corp., </em>645 F.2d 583, 588 (8th Cir. 1981) (\u201c \u2018(a) contract condition which qualifies a duty of performance by a party does not make the existence or validity of the contract hinge on the condition\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Moratzka v. United States (In re Matthie-son), </em>63 B.R. 56, 60 (D.Minn.1986) (\u201c[A] condition precedent is a condition precedent to performance under the contract, not formation of the contract. When a condition precedent is not satisfied, it relieves a party to the contract of the obligation to perform. It does not negate the existence of the contract or the binding contractual relationship of the parties.\u201d). Although these cases did not involve unilateral contracts, they set out a general principle of contract law concerning conditional performance that is applicable to all types of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Thus, the \u201cpreguarantee audit,\u201d <em>see </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.454 (Administrative B) (1982), which the government contends was a \u201c \u2018further [necessary] act of the offeror,\u2019 \u201d <em>Cutler-Hammer, Inc. v. United States, </em>194 Ct.Cl. 788, 441 F.2d 1179,1182 (1971) (citation omitted) that \u201cnegate(s) existence of a contract,\u201d <em>id., </em>does not alter the government\u2019s commitment that once the conditions are satisfied, a loan guarantee will issue. The audit is only to ensure that all the conditions have been met, and \u201cto assure that no adverse change has taken place,\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.454 (Administrative B).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The government relies on and urges us to follow <em>Runnemede Owners, Inc. v. Crest Mortgage Corp., </em>861 F.2d 1053 (7th Cir.1988), which it contends shows that it did not enter into a contract with Wells Fargo. That case involved a qualified commitment letter by a mortgage company relating to a projected loan to finance the purchase of a motel. <em>Id. </em>at 1054. The commitment was subject to the approval by the lender \u201cin its sole discretion\u201d of twenty specified items, including the income and expenses of the project. <em>Id. </em>at 1054,1057. After substantial discussions, the lender refused to make the loan because it concluded that the anticipated cash flow from the motel would be insufficient to support the loan. <em>Id. </em>at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Applying Illinois law, the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the breach of contract claim. It described the commitment letter as \u201cnothing more than an agreement to consider extending a loan, not an unqualified promise that such consideration would yield the financial help desired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>court stated: \u201cBecause of Crest\u2019s determination, under the clear terms of paragraph IV, no binding contract to extend the loan arose____ Runnemede\u2019s interpretation runs contrary to the intent of the parties expressed in the conditional written commitment letter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">In the significantly different circumstances of the present case, in contrast, the Conditional Commitment created an obligation on the government to issue the guarantee if Wells Fargo made the loan and satisfied the other conditions. As the Court of Federal Claims correctly stated, this is an example of \u201c \u2018a contractual relationship aris[ing] between the government and a private party [because] promissory words of the former induce[d] significant action by the latter in reliance thereon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 810 (quoting <em>National Rural Utils. Coop. Fin. Corp., </em>14 Cl.Ct. at 137). There is no provision in the Conditional Commitment comparable to the \u201cin its sole discretion\u201d language in <em>Runnemede. </em>To the contrary, the Conditional Commitment stated that, \u201cwhen these conditions are met, [the Administration] will issue a loan note guarantee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The fact that Mid-Kansas was the named lender in the 1982 Conditional Commitment and that Wells Fargo was not substituted as the lead lender until 1986 does not affect the binding nature of the 1982 commitment. The Administration was aware from the outset that Wells Fargo would provide the $20,000,000 financing for the ethanol facility. Furthermore, the 1986 Conditional Commitment that explicitly made Wells Fargo the lead lender stated that \u201c[t]he Conditional Commitment for Guarantee and all items of conditions specified in the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee dated 10/1/82 and revised 12/15/82 continue in effect.\u201d Thus, the 1982 Conditional Commitment was fully applicable to Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">The 1985 Intercreditor Agreement, to which the Administration was a party, confirms that the earlier Conditional Commitment was a binding undertaking by the Administration to issue the guarantee upon Wells Fargo\u2019s compliance with the conditions. The 1985 agreement, which covered the provision of additional financing for the ethanol plant by Wells Fargo, extended the Conditional Commitment through June 1986, stated that \u201c[d]ue primarily to difficulties in achieving adequate production levels at the Plant, the [Administration] Guarantee has not issued,\u201d and reaffirmed that \u201cupon compliance with the conditions of the Commitment and [Administration] regulations, the [Administration] will issue the [Administration] Guarantee for the benefit of Mid-Kansas or if Wells Fargo [become]s the lead lender, for the benefit of Wells Fargo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Indeed, at no time during the protracted discussions regarding the issuance of the guarantee did the Administration ever state, or even suggest, that the Conditional Commitment did not constitute a binding undertaking by it to issue the guarantee. Implicit in those discussions was the Administration\u2019s recognition that it had made such a commitment and intended to carry it out. When the Administration finally refused to issue the guarantee, it relied not on the lack of a binding commitment to do so, but on changes in the borrower\u2019s situation that it alleged constituted a failure to comply with the conditions upon which the commitment was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">B. The Conditional Commitment required that, before the Administration would issue the guarantee, \u201cthe Lender certiffy] that it has no knowledge of any adverse change, financial or otherwise, in the Borrower, his business, or any parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates since it requested a Loan Note Guarantee.\u201d Wells Fargo provided this certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">The Administration nevertheless refused to issue the guarantee for two reasons: (1) \u201cThere has been an adverse change in the financial condition of High Plains Corporation during the period of time between the issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee in 1982 and December 17, 1986.\u201d It relied on the Peat Marwick report that \u201cbased on the price of ethanol ($.80 per gallon) and the cost of milo ($1.23 per bushel), the company would not generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations as of October 1986, or in the foreseeable future.\u201d (2) \u201cThe history of the management of the corporation reveals numerous decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>which have caused adverse results and led us to have serious concerns about the credibility of its management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">We agree with the Court of Federal Claims that neither reason justified the Administration\u2019s refusal to issue the guarantee; and that since Wells Fargo had fulfilled all of the conditions of the Conditional Commitment, the Administration was required to issue the loan guarantee. <em>Cf. Winstar Corp. v. United States, </em>64 F.3d 1531, 1545 (Fed.Cir. 1995) (in banc) (\u201cWhen the plaintiffs satisfied the conditions imposed on them by the contracts, the government\u2019s contractual obligations became effective '....\u201d), <em>cert. grant</em>ed; \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 806, 133 L.Ed.2d 753 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">High Plains\u2019s alleged financial problems resulting from low ethanol prices and high grain prices were the very kinds of economic risks that were inherent in the ethanol manufacturing business. It was those risks that underlay the loan guarantee program. As an Administration official testified, \u201cthe purpose of the lender program is to get banks to make loans that they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t make. They are high risk loans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Whatever financial problem High Plains may have had as a result of these price fluctuations, it was not an \u201cadverse change ... in the Borrower, [or] his business\u201d within the meaning of the certification clause of the Conditional Commitment. That provision related to changes in High Plains\u2019s own internal financial condition, not to changes in the markets in which High Plains operated and did business.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The low price of ethanol and the high price of the grain from which it was made had not dissuaded the Administration in the latter part of 1986 from telling Wells Fargo that \u201c[if] Wells Fargo provides [an additional $5,000,000 to High Plains], then [the Administration] is satisfied with the projected economics of this project.\u201d The Peat Marwick report, on which the Administration relied, questioned High Plains\u2019s continued viability only if there were no loan guarantee and no additional $5,000,000 financing. The report did not evaluate the company\u2019s financial situation if Wells Fargo provided that additional financing, as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">With regard to the company\u2019s alleged management problems, the Administration had been aware of nearly all of them for a long time, and until the final decision letter, did not raise them as problems during the discussions about the company\u2019s viability. Several of the items had occurred prior to the Intercreditor Agreement and the issuance of a new Conditional Commitment with Wells Fargo as the lead lender, apparently on the assumption that the loan guarantee process was proceeding as planned. Indeed, despite the supposedly significant management problems, shortly before the Administration\u2019s refusal to issue the guarantee the Administration\u2019s administrator wrote a member of the House of Representatives that the process was \u201cculminating in the granting of the guarantee.\u201d We agree with the Court of Federal Claims that \u201c[t]he evidence offered by the [Administration] in the December 19th letter to support their allegation of poor management by High Plains does not support a finding that an adverse change had taken place.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>26 Cl.Ct. at 816-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">\u201cThe general rule in common law breach of contract cases is to award damages that will place the injured party in as good a position as he or she would have been in had the breaching party fully performed.\u201d <em>Estate of Berg v. United States, </em>231 Ct.Cl. 466, 687 F.2d 377, 379 (1982); <em>Northern Helex Co. v. United States, </em>207 Ct.Cl. 862, 524 F.2d 707, 713, 720 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 866, 97 S.Ct. 176, 50 L.Ed.2d 146 (1976). However, \u201cremote and consequential damages are not recoverable in a common-law suit for breach of contract ____ especially ... in suits against the United States for the recovery of common-law damages, such as the instant case.\u201d <em>Northern Helex Co., </em>524 F.2d at 720. Moreover, attempting to determine what would have happened if the guarantee had been issued necessarily involves a highly speculative and conjectural inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">The government challenges both items of damages the Court of Federal Claims awarded for the government\u2019s breach of the eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>tract to issue the guarantee: (A) $10,496,000 for the profits the court determined Wells Fargo lost as a consequence of the breach and (B) $389,423 of High Plains\u2019s indebtedness that Wells Fargo forgave when it received the proceeds of High Plains\u2019s public stock offering. We reverse on the first item, and affirm on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">A. 1. The Court of Federal Claims awarded lost profits damages on the following theory:</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">A bank\u2019s ability to make loans from the deposits it receives is limited by its capital. For each dollar of Wells Fargo\u2019s capital, it could make loans of fifteen dollars. As a result of the Administration\u2019s refusal to issue the guarantee and the poor quality of the High Plains loan, Wells Fargo charged off $9.7 million on the loan, which \u201cresulted in an equal reduction to Wells\u2019 capital. This capital reduction lessened the ability of Wells to make loans of up to 15 times the amount of the charge-offs \u2014 the approximate capital leverage ratio for the bank at the time. The lost income on these allegedly foregone loans was quantified by Wells\u2019 expert to be $6,849,-000.00, which was based on a 14% average rate of return on Wells\u2019 lending business for the preceding years.\u201d WeZZs <em>Fargo Bank, N.A, </em>33 Fed.Cl. at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In addition, the risky character of the High Plains loan precluded Wells Fargo from treating interest payments it received on the loan as income. \u201c[TJhat would have increased Wells\u2019 capital by the same amount. This loss was temporary because the High Plains loan eventually reached the \u2018recovery phase\u2019 in March 1990, at which time all payments were booked as income. Just as with the charged-off capital, Wells argues this temporarily lost capital would have been put to a profitable use. Wells\u2019 expert calculated the lost earnings from loans this capital could have supported, and accounted for the re-coupment that occurred during the recovery phase of the High Plains loan. These damages were quantified at $3,647,000.00, which essentially represent the time value of the lost earnings caused by the temporary loss of capital. In sum, the total debtside damages claimed by Wells is $10,885,423.86.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The court held that Wells Fargo was entitled to recover \u201cthe lost profits resulting from the capital losses caused by the government\u2019s breach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. The court ruled that \u201c[t]he effect of the charge-offs and the loan\u2019s non-accrual status (i.e., inability to book interest as income when received) were clearly foreseeable in this ease due to the nature of the [Administration\u2019s] loan guarantee program, and the regulated nature of the banking industry____[t]he lost capital damages claimed by Wells were foreseeable at the time of contracting, and ... there was no intervening causal step between the government\u2019s breach and the damages claimed by Wells.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">2. Our predecessor court, the Court of Claims, in breach of contract cases repeatedly refused to award damages for profits lost on transactions not directly related to the contract that was breached. <em>See Roberts v. United States, </em>18 Cl.Ct. 351, 358 (1989) (citing Court of Claims eases denying lost profits damages). Of course, not every injury resulting from a breach of contract is remediable in damages. <em>Globe Ref. Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co., </em>190 U.S. 540, 23 S.Ct. 754, 47 L.Ed. 1171 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">In <em>Ramsey v. United States, </em>121 Ct.Cl. 426, 101 F.Supp. 353 (1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 977, 72 S.Ct. 1072, 96 L.Ed. 1369 (1952), where the government delayed payment on contracts with the plaintiff, the court, in denying lost profits damages, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-12\">The profits lost from the corporation\u2019s over-all business activities, because of its shortage of capital allegedly occasioned by the Government\u2019s failure to pay the contract amounts when due, may not be recovered either. It is important to bear in mind that the corporation\u2019s claim is not for the anticipated profits of the contracts in question, but is a claim for the anticipated profits of its entire business enterprise. The lost profits of these collateral undertakings, which the corporation was unable to carry out, are too remote to be classified as a natural result of the Government\u2019s delay in payment...-. \u201c[T]here is a distinction by which all question[s] of this sort can be easily tested. If the profits are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>such as would have accrued and grown out of the contract itself, as the direct and immediate results of its fulfillment, then they would form a just and proper item of damages, to be recovered against the delinquent party upon a breach of the agree-ment____ But if they are such as would have been realized by the party from other independent and collateral undertakings, although entered into in consequence and on the faith of the principal contract, then they are too uncertain and remote to be taken into consideration as a part of the damages occasioned by the breach of the contract in suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-6\"><em>Id. </em>101 F.Supp. at 357-58 (quoting <em>Myerle v. United States, </em>33 Ct.Cl. 1, 26 (1897)).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">This reasoning is equally applicable to the present case. Here the Court of Federal Claims awarded damages for the profits Wells Fargo allegedly would have made on the additional loans it could have made if the guarantee had been issued. Like the lost profits in <em>Ramsey, </em>Wells Fargo\u2019s loss of interest on additional loans it allegedly could have made had there been no breach is \u201ctoo uncertain and remote to be taken into consideration as a part of the damages occasioned by the breach of the contract in suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APU\">In <em>Olin Jones Sand Co. v. United States, </em>225 Ct.Cl. 741 (1980), the Court of Claims refused to award damages to a company that, as a result of government wrongdoing, lost its bonding capacity and therefore was unable to obtain unrelated contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 743-44. <em>See also Rocky Mountain Constr. Co., </em>218 Ct.Cl. 665, 666 (1978) (damages claim that had government not delayed contract performance, plaintiff would have profited from other contracts on which it would have bid, held legally insufficient); <em>Northern Helex Co., </em>524 F.2d at 720-21 (\u201c[Authorities support our denial of plaintiffs claim for the costs of the operation of its plant to the end of the contract term in connection with its nonfederal work with its related companies, because such costs are too remote, speculative, an[d] consequential to be compensable as damages.\u201d); <em>William Green Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>201 Ct.Cl. 616, 477 F.2d 930, 936 (1973) (\u201c[I]n a common law suit there would be no recovery for general loss of business, the claimed loss of the entire Green net worth, and losses on the non-federal work \u2014 such damages are all deemed too remote and consequential.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 909, 94 S.Ct. 2606, 41 L.Ed.2d 213 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The cases Wells Fargo cites are not to the contrary. In <em>Neely v. United States, </em>152 Ct.Cl. 137, 285 F.2d 438 (1961), lost profits damages were permitted when the government breached an agreement to lease land for mining. <em>Id. </em>285 F.2d at 442. There, however, the profits lost on the mine were caused directly by the breach and were proven with certainty. Unlike the present ease, the profits lost in <em>Neely </em>were profits on the use of the subject of the contract itself. Indeed, the only purpose of the contract in <em>Neely </em>and the other cases was for the plaintiff to make profits on the subject of the contract \u2014 through mining, dairy cow operations, or property resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">In the present case, in contrast, the purpose of the guarantee was to enable Wells Fargo to make profits from the interest on its loan to High Plains, not on some other loans it might make. The only portion of the damages the Court of Federal Claims awarded that directly resulted from the failure to issue the guarantee was the $389,423 of the indebtedness that Wells Fargo wrote off\u2014 the award of which, as explained in part III.B below, we uphold.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">In awarding lost profits damages, the Court of Federal Claims stated that \u201cthe main issue before the court with regards to whether or not the lost capital damages are recoverable is whether they were foreseeable at the time of contracting.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>33 Fed.Cl. at 247. The court rejected the \u201cdefendant\u2019s interpretation of the case law that lost profits from unrelated business transactions are never recoverable against the federal government. Rather, the court interprets the case law cited by the government \u2014 eases in which lost profits from unrelated business transactions were denied \u2014 to have been decided on foreseeability grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247 n. 11. As our prior discussion shows, we approach the question differently, and do not agree with the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s holding that \u201cthe lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>capital damages claimed by Wells were foreseeable at the time of contracting, and that there was no intervening causal step between the government\u2019s breach and the damages claimed by Wells.\u201d Mat 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">B. Unlike the lost profits damages, which we have concluded were too remote and uncertain, the $389,423 of High Plains\u2019s indebtedness that Wells Fargo wrote off when it received the proceeds of High Plains\u2019s public stock offering in satisfaction of that indebtedness was a direct result of the government\u2019s breach of its' contractual obligation to issue the guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">If the government had issued the guarantee, it would have used a standard form which would have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">\u201cThe guaranteed portion of the loan is $[18,000,000] which is [90](%) percent of loan principal____ [T]he United States of America ... will pay to: A. Any Holder 100 percent of any loss sustained by such Holder on the guaranteed portion____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.83 App. A \u2014 Form FmHA 449-34, Loan Note Guarantee (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The regulations governing the guarantee provided that \u201c[t]he maximum loss covered by the Form FmHA 449-34, \u2018Loan Note Guarantee,\u2019 can never exceed ... 90 percent of the principal and interest indebtedness as evidenced by said note(s) or by assumption agreement(s).\u201d M. \u00a7 1980.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">We read this language as providing that the government would pay 100 percent of any loss on the guaranteed portion of the loan, but not more than ninety percent of the total indebtedness. At the time of the write-off, Wells Fargo already had charged off two million dollars of High Plains\u2019s twenty million dollar indebtedness to it. The eighteen million dollar balance was satisfied by Wells Fargo\u2019s receiving the proceeds of High Plains\u2019s public stock offering and writing off the remaining balance of $389,423.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">If the guarantee had been issued, Wells Fargo would have been entitled to recover the $389,423, because (1) the guaranteed portion of the loan (ninety percent of the twenty million dollar indebtedness) was eighteen million dollars and (2) the government agreed to pay 100 percent \u201cof any loss sustained on the guaranteed portion\u201d of the loan. By accepting $389,423 less than the guaranteed portion of the loan, Wells Fargo suffered a loss in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">Furthermore, unlike the lost profits, which were not foreseeable when the government executed the Conditional Commitment, it was foreseeable that if the government breached its obligation to issue the guarantee, the lender would suffer a loss on its loan to High Plains. Indeed, it was the likelihood of loss on this risky loan that led the lender to seek the guarantee. Wells Fargo\u2019s loss of the $389,423 portion of its loan to High Plains was one of the contingencies against which the guarantee was intended to protect the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">The government contends, however, that the award of $389,423 would constitute interest on interest, the payment of which an Administration regulation currently prohibits. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.11 (1996). The argument relates to the 1987 and 1989 restructuring of High Plains\u2019s loans and Wells Fargo\u2019s accounting treatment of payments High Plains made to it in connection therewith. As the Court of Federal Claims explained, the government \u201cessentially argues the payments received from High Plains should have been used to reduce principal on the customer balance; thus the remaining $389,423.86 would constitute interest upon interest. However, there was no evidence presented at trial that this would have been appropriate or consistent with industry or regulatory accounting standards.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, </em>N.A, 33 Fed.Cl. at 246. Indeed, the only testimony on this point was that the bank treated the $389,423 as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">Like the Court of Federal Claims, we are \u201cunwilling to accept the recharacterization of payments urged by the government.\u201d M</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">Wells Fargo\u2019s cross-appeal challenges the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s refusal to award it damages for its alleged loss on surrendering, in the second restructuring of the High Plains loan, for $2,500,000, the options to purchase eighty-four percent of High Plains\u2019s stock it had acquired in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>restructuring of that loan. Wells Fargo argues that, if the guarantee had issued, it would not then have surrendered the equity interest but instead either would have sold it for much more or retained part of it. According to its expert, it suffered a loss on surrender of its equity interest ranging from $18,277,000 to $26,264,000. <em>Id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The Court of Federal Claims rejected these damage claims because (1) they did not \u201cmeet the standards of foreseeability and certainty,\u201d and (2) \u201cfaded to establish that the value of the equity was an <em>interest </em>protected by the contract. While the [Administration] might have foreseen that Wells was going to acquire an equity interest in High Plains, it does not follow that the [Administration] could have foreseen that the denial of a loan guarantee would cause a loss to debt turned into equity which was never intended to be guaranteed.\u201d <em>Id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">We agree. These damages are even more remote and conjectural than the lost profits damages that we have disallowed. Our analysis of those damages in part IIIA also requires the conclusion that the Court of Federal Claims correctly denied Wells Fargo these additional damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is reversed insofar as it awarded Wells Fargo lost profits damages of $10,496,-000. It is affirmed insofar as it awarded Wells Fargo damages of $389,423 and denied Wells Fargo additional damages for the surrender of its options to acquire High Plains stock. The case is remanded to the Court of Federal Claims to enter judgment in favor of Wells Fargo for $389,423.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED-IN-PART, REVERSED-IN-PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
