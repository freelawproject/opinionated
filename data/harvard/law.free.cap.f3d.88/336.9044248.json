Hornsby challenges his sentence on this and two other bases; we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">On June 13, 1995, in Brookeland, Texas, Hornsby approached his former girlfriend and asked to speak to her. When she refused, Hornsby choked her until she was unconscious, placed her in her automobile, and took her to Louisiana, where he was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Hornsby was indicted for kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, and for interstate domestic violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261. In exchange for his plea of guilty to interstate domestic violence, the kidnapping charge was dismissed. A person commits the crime of interstate domestic violence by, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ceaus[ing] a spouse or intimate partner to cross a State line ... by force, coercion, duress, or fraud and, in the course or as a result of that conduct, intentionally commit[ting] a crime of violence and thereby causing] bodily injury to the person\u2019s spouse or intimate partner\u201d. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">At sentencing, the district court, over Hornsby\u2019s objections, applied the base offense level for kidnapping to the interstate domestic violence offense. The court also found, over Hornsby\u2019s objections, that he was a career offender; and that, because Horns-by committed the instant offense while on state parole, his sentence for the federal offense should run consecutively to his state sentence. Hornsby was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 60 months imprisonment, to run consecutively to his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Hornsby challenges use of the kidnapping guideline, the career offender finding, and his federal sentence being served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Hornsby contends that, rather than using the base offense level for kidnapping, the district court should have used that for assault or aggravated assault. He asserts that those guidelines are more closely analogous to his offense conduct because each necessarily involves bodily harm, while kidnapping can occur without violence. We review <em>de novo </em>the ruling that the kidnapping guideline is the most analogous guideline. <em>United States v. Smertneck, </em>954 F.2d 264, 265 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 833, 113 S.Ct. 101, 121 L.Ed.2d 61 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">The district court sentenced Hornsby under the 1994 version of the Guidelines, which do not specify a base offense level for interstate domestic violence. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1 (1994) (court should apply the most analogous offense guideline for an offense for which no guideline has been promulgated), the district court applied the kidnapping guideline, finding that it was the most analogous to Horns-by\u2019s offense conduct. The court rejected Hornsby\u2019s contention that the assault or aggravated assault guideline should have been used instead, adopting the PSR\u2019s reasoning that the kidnapping guideline was the only one that addressed the elements of abduction and crossing a state line.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">Because Hornsby was sentenced on November 15, 1995, the 1995 version of the Guidelines, effective that November 1, should have been used. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A); <em>see United States v. Castaneda-Cantu, </em>20 F.3d 1325, 1336 (5th Cir.1994) (sentencing court must apply version of guidelines in effect at sentencing unless such application would violate <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause). Appendix A of those Guidelines, which specifies the guideline section applicable to the statute of conviction, references several applicable guidelines for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261, including those for assault and kidnapping. U.S.S.G. App. A (1995). The introduction to Appendix A states that, if more than one guideline section is referenced for the particular statute, the court should use the one most appropriate for the nature of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>fense conduct charged in the offense for which the defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the analysis is the same whether under the 1994 or 1995 version. (This applies equally to all of the guidelines cited here. Accordingly, the 1995 version is used.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Although Hornsby\u2019s offense conduct involved violence and bodily injury, which would make the guidelines for assault and aggravated assault applicable, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2A2.2, 2A2.3, it also involved abducting and carrying the victim across a state line. The offense guideline for kidnapping, which includes increases in the offense level if the victim suffered certain degrees of bodily injury, is the only guideline which takes into consideration all of these specific offense characteristics. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1. Therefore, because the kidnapping guideline is the most analogous to Hornsby\u2019s offense conduct, the district court did not err by using it to determine the offense level for interstate domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The career offender finding is challenged next. Hornsby asserts that the PSR, which the district court adopted, contains no evidence or factual basis for the conclusion that the offenses on which career offender status is based involved the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, such that they were crimes of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">We review the interpretation of \u00a7 4B1.1 <em>de novo, </em>and the factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Shano, </em>955 F.2d 291, 294 (5th Cir.1992). A defendant is a career offender if, <em>inter alia, </em>he has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a felony offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(l)(i). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d also includes, <em>inter alia, </em>burglary of a dwelling. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The PSR stated that one of Hornsby\u2019s prior theft charges was filed initially as a burglary of a habitation and that one of his burglary offenses also involved burglary of a habitation. Hornsby offered no evidence to rebut this.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">A presentence report generally bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered as evidence by the trial judge in making guideline determinations, especially when there is no evidence in rebuttal. <em>United States v. Alfaro, </em>919 F.2d 962, 966 (5th Cir.1990). Because burglary of a habitation is considered a crime of violence, the court did not err in holding that Hornsby had the two requisite prior crimes of violence for career offender status. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(l)(ii) &amp; comment, (n. 2) (conduct of which defendant was convicted is focus of inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">The final issue concerns Hornsby\u2019s federal sentence being served consecutively to an undischarged state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">Hornsby asserts that, because his state conviction was used to determine his base offense level for the instant offense, he should have been sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b). It provides that, if \u201cthe undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Hornsby\u2019s state conviction was used in calculating his criminal history score, but not in determining his base offense level. Accordingly, \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">The district court ordered a consecutive sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), p.s., which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-16\">(Policy Statement) ... the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), p.s. The commentary to \u00a7 5G1.3 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>[i]f the defendant was on ... state ... parole ... at the time of the instant offense, and has had such ... parole ... revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of ... parole ... in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of ... parole....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">When Hornsby committed the instant offense, he was on state parole until June 5, 1998, for three burglaries. His parole was revoked on September 5, 1995. Note 6 of the commentary, quoted above, squarely addresses this situation. Therefore, the court did not err by ordering a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Hornsby\u2019s contention that due process forbids a consecutive sentence because his state parole had not been revoked at the time of the commission of the instant offense and entry of his plea is meritless. He does not explain how his due process rights have been violated; nor does he support his contention with citations to any authority. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence is <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
