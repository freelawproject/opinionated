Appellant seeks his release without retrial, understandably, since the present appeal marks the fourth time that this case has been before an appellate, tribunal. We shall briefly review the relevant facts, the prior reversals and the issues raised herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Oddly, the prior appellate decisions do not set forth the rather bizarre factual background giving rise to the several appeals. The body of Burl Howell, Jr., appellant\u2019s father, was discovered by a-state police investigator, Arthur Lincoln, at the deceased\u2019s home in Cecil County on January 17, 1979. The body was found in a bed and death resulted from multiple stab wounds to the victim\u2019s throat, abdomen and hands. A file cabinet in the living room and a chest of drawers in the bedroom had been ransacked. Lincoln also recovered from the floor of the bedroom a pistol with one spent shell; the expended bullet was recovered from a closet in the same room.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">David Gibson Linkey, Jr., upon an agreed statement of facts, entered a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree of the decedent Howell. In a statement given to Corporal Robert G. Ellis on March 8, 1979, appellant said he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>drove Linkey to the Howell home on January 16th, the night of the crime, and he remained in the yard working on his car while Linkey went into the house. Fifteen minutes later, according to appellant, Linkey returned stating that he \u201chad some stuff to get rid of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Appellant later advised Sheriff John F. DeWitt that he drove Linkey to a wharf and observed him remove a vest and throw it and another unidentified object into the water. In a second discussion with DeWitt, allegedly initiated by appellant, DeWitt learned that Linkey resented the fact that his girl friend was living with appellant\u2019s father and on an unknown date prior to the murder appellant and Linkey discussed \u201chitting on the old man.\u201d Presumably, appellant would receive his father\u2019s property and Linkey would avenge the loss of his girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>The Trials</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Appellant was convicted of second degree murder and conspiracy to murder by a Cecil County jury. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of twenty-five years for second degree murder (ten years suspended with five years probation) and ten years for conspiracy to commit murder. Appellant\u2019s privately retained counsel advised the court of a conflict of interest that mandated his withdrawal as counsel in order that he could testify as a witness in a pending suppression hearing. Although painstakingly advised by the court that he should consent to a postponement beyond 180 days in order for the public defender to prepare his case, appellant demanded both counsel and his trial within the 180 day mandate of Rule 746 which was then effective. As a result, he was tried within the 180 days, but without counsel. We affirmed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> holding that appellant\u2019s dilemma was knowingly self-imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> holding that the accused was denied his constitutional right to counsel. The stage was then set for a second trial which resulted in a conviction of accessory after the fact to murder. Appellant\u2019s original sentence was reimposed spawning his second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Relying upon <em>Cooper v. State, </em>44 Md.App. 59, 407 A.2d 756 (1979), we said, in reviewing appellant\u2019s second conviction, that an essential element of the crime of accessory after the fact was a showing by the State of \u201c[a] completed felony ... committed by another prior to the accessory-ship.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Linkey, who had already entered a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree, testified for, and to the consternation of, the State. On cross-examination, Linkey stated that he killed Howell in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The trial court, despite Linkey\u2019s testimony, no matter how incredible it may have been perceived, refused appellant\u2019s requested instruction that if Linkey killed in self-defense appellant was not guilty of any crime. Appellant was convicted of being an accessory after the fact. He received the identical sentence imposed at his third trial. We reversed, holding that a <em>prima facie </em>case of self-defense was generated and the appellant was entitled to a jury instruction on this issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Appellant returned to court for his third time at bat on the accessory after the fact charge. He was convicted and for the third time received the same sentence imposed in his two prior trials. This time he has expanded his issues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>sixteen. A number of the alleged issues are merely argument without any supporting authority. We, therefore, shall address the substantive issues, numbers 1, 3 and 4, which are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">1. Insufficient evidence was presented to convict appellant of accessory after the fact to second degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">3. The State should have been barred from retrying appellant because it procured David Linkey\u2019s conviction for perjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">4. Admission of evidence of Linkey\u2019s conviction for second degree murder and the agreed statement of facts upon which this conviction was based was improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Before addressing the issues, we point out the twists the case has taken since the second trial. Aggrieved by Lin-key\u2019s protestations of self-defense in case two, the State charged and convicted Linkey of perjury. Under Cts. &amp; Jud.Prod. Article Sec. 9-104, therefore, he was unavailable to the State in trial number three due to his perjury conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">In order to establish a completed felony in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State, over objection, introduced the indictment, docket entries and the agreed statement of facts upon which Linkey\u2019s murder conviction was predicated. We hold that the admission of this evidence was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">As Chief Judge Gilbert pointed out in <em>Cooper, supra, </em>there are four necessary ingredients to constitute the crime of accessory after the fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">\u201c1) A completed felony must have been completed by another prior to the accessoryship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">2) The accessory must not be a principal in the commission of the felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">3) The accessory must have knowledge of the felony; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>4) The accessory must act personally to aid or assist the felon to avoid detection or apprehension for the crime or crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">R.M. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law. </em>667 (2d ed. 1969); <em>accord, </em>Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 8.06 (M.F. Wingersky, 6th ed. 1958); 22 C.J.S., <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 95-99 (1961); H. Ginsberg &amp; I. Ginsberg, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure in Maryland </em>13-14 (1940); 1 Hale, <em>Historia Placitorum Coronae, </em>(The History of the Pleas of the Crown) 618-622 (1st Am. ed. 1847); 1 Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 33 (C.E. Torcia, 14th ed. (1978).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Admittedly, the State must show that a completed felony was committed by another. It is not necessary, however, to obtain a judgment of conviction against the actual perpetrator to establish the completed felony. This is so because since <em>Lewis, supra, </em>an accessory may be tried notwithstanding that the case against the principal has .not been and conceivably may never be prosecuted. It is the establishing of a completed felony by another that the State must show, not a conviction of the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">If we accept the State\u2019s argument that a judgment of conviction of the principal is admissible, and we expressly do not accept that premise, the only thing that would be established is prima facie evidence of the guilt of the principal. A conviction, moreover, does not necessarily establish the truth regarding the underlying felony. A plea bargaining principal may agree to certain facts in order to escape conviction of a more onerous crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The accessory, moreover, is entitled to contest a conviction and introduce testimony to show the perpetrator is innocent despite his conviction. <em>See </em>Perkins, <em>Criminal Law, </em>1st ed., at 591; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. DiStasio, </em>11 N.E.2d 799 (Mass.1937); <em>Aston v. State, </em>136 Tex.Cr.R. 12, 122 S.W.2d 1073 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The State had already established the \u201ccompleted felony\u201d through the testimony of the investigating officer that he discovered the body and observed multiple stab wounds. The admissions by appellant that he and Linkey discussed \u201chitting on the old man\u201d and that appellant drove Linkey to the deceased\u2019s home on the night of the murder satisfied the State\u2019s burden of proving the completed felony \u201cby another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The second element in establishing whether one is an accessory after the fact requires a finding that he is not a principal in the commission of the felony. We need not discuss principal in the first degree because Linkey, not appellant, was the actual perpetrator of the crime. A principal in the second degree must be present, actually or constructively, at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201cA person is held to be constructively present at the scene of the commission of the crime if he is acting in concert with the actual perpetrator of the crime by aiding, abetting, or assisting the perpetrator by positioning himself or herself in such a way as to be able to give aid or assistance to the perpetrator or by acting as a lookout for the perpetrator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">R. Gilbert and C. Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law: Practice and Procedure, </em>Sec. 21.3-1; <em>McBryde v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 357, 352 A.2d 324 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Appellant herein was neither actually nor constructively present at the scene. Nothing in the evidence shows that he was rendering any assistance to Linkey while the crime was being committed. Appellant was not acting in concert with Linkey by working on his car while Linkey entered the house. He was not a lookout or positioned to be of assistance to the perpetrator if needed. The mere fact that he stood by even though he may have been aware that a crime was being committed is not sufficient to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>him a principal in the second degree. <em>See Pope v. State, </em>284 Md. 309, 396 A.2d 1054 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Appellant\u2019s knowledge of the felony, the third element, is established by his admission of prior discussions of ways to get rid of his father, together with Linkey\u2019s immediate request upon leaving the house to assist him in getting rid of \u201csome things\u201d which turned out to be a vest Linkey was wearing and another unidentified object. The fourth requirement was met when appellant drove Linkey from the area enabling him to dispose of certain property and then leave the area. Appellant was an accessory after the fact; not a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Conceding that it was error to admit the indictment and docket entries,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the State contends that the error was harmless in light of the State\u2019s perception that the agreed statement of facts in Linkey\u2019s trial was admissible in the case <em>sub judice. </em>We disagree. The State seizes upon a statement by Judge Moylan in the second trial where he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201cThe putative principal in the first degree for the homicide in question was State\u2019s witness David Linkey. Linkey, to be sure, had on an earlier occasion entered a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree. The docket entry, however, is not dispositive for purposes of the present case; <em>absent an agreed statement of fact, </em>the State has the affirmative burden of showing the underlying crime.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Judge Moylan was clearly referring to an agreed statement of facts between the State and the accessory being sufficient to relieve the State of its burden to establish the underlying felony. We find no support in Judge Moylan\u2019s comment for the State\u2019s assertion that the agreed statement of facts in Linkey\u2019s case is admissible in the later trial of the accessory. A careful reading of Judge Moylan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>discussion indicates it is completely at odds with the State\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We think the admission of the prior agreed statement of facts, the indictment and docket entries in Linkey\u2019s case was prejudicial error. As to appellant, the evidence was hearsay and deprived him of his right of cross-examination. We do not know what impact the introduction of Linkey\u2019s conviction may have created in the minds of the jurors. We cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt, however, that the error was harmless. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). The State may well have been justified in prosecuting Linkey for perjury. As a result, however, it painted itself into a corner as to appellant. Linkey is no longer a competent witness due to his perjury conviction. The State would have us sanction its use of a statement of facts that Linkey has either repudiated or controverted and, at the same time, deny appellant an opportunity to present the discrepancy in Linkey\u2019s testimony to the jury for its consideration. We reject the temptation. Where a witness is unavailable by procurement of the party offering the hearsay statement, the requirement (unavailability) ought not to be regarded as satisfied. McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>2d ed., Sec. 253; <em>Motes v. United States, </em>178 U.S. 458, 20 S.Ct. 993, 44 L.Ed. 1150 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The State insists that appellant, despite Linkey\u2019s perjury conviction, should have called him as a witness and asserted that appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process was superior to the statutory prohibition set forth in Sec. 9-104. We agree that appellant could have made such an attempt; we offer no opinion on what the court\u2019s ruling may have been on that issue. The failure to attempt to call Linkey, a move that would undoubtedly have been resisted by the State, does not negate the errors of commission chargeable to the prosecution. The authority for the State\u2019s suggestion, <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967), is not directly on point. In <em>Wasgington, </em>the Supreme Court held that a Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>statute that precluded codefendants from testifying on behalf of each other violated an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a full defense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A convicted perjurer may very well not be accorded the same treatment as a willing witness with no such taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We decline to rest our decision on insufficient evidence as urged by appellant. Whether the State can present a case not flawed by the errors present in three attempts is the' State\u2019s responsibility to determine, not this Court\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The only remaining issue we feel constrained to address is former jeopardy. The trial judge instructed the jury in the first trial that if appellant was found guilty of second degree murder and conspiracy, the remaining counts (accessory before the fact, solicitation and accessory after the fact) merged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957), states that silence is tantamount to an acquittal when the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201c[w]as given a full opportunity to return a verdict on the charge, that nothing prevented the jury from rendering a verdict, and that the jury chose not to find the defendant guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the jury was instructed not to return a verdict if appellant was found guilty of the greater offenses. Not having considered the remaining charges, the rationale of <em>Green, supra, </em>is inapplicable. Thus, former jeopardy does not apply. <em>See State v. Moulden, </em>292 Md. 666, 441 A.2d 699 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
