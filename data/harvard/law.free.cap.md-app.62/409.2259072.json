Mrs. Jackson was 25 or 26 weeks into her pregnancy and was undergoing premature labor. The examination of Mrs. Jackson by Mercy\u2019s medical staff revealed that a routine vaginal delivery would create serious and dangerous medical complications for both Mrs. Jackson and the unborn child. The fetus was lying in the womb in an \u201coblique to transverse position,\u201d and the risk of a ruptured uterus was great because Mrs. Jackson had previously undergone a myomectomy <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because of her having given birth prematurely on a prior occasion. Mercy\u2019s diagnosis suggested an abdominal, or Caesarean section, delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">A Caesarean delivery is a relatively safe and routine, albeit surgical, form of childbirth. The most serious drawback \u2014 the surgical intervention prescribed in the matter now before us \u2014 is that the mother inevitably loses a certain, but not predeterminable, quantity of blood. In the instant case, it was the contemplated loss of blood together with the attendant risks that injected the legal profession into an otherwise sterile medico-monopolistic delivery room.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">We explain. Mrs. Jackson is by religious persuasion a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. One of the tenets of that faith is that a believer may not, under any circumstances, receive blood transfusions. Members of Mercy\u2019s medical staff counselled Mrs. Jackson that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance she would need a transfusion. If that need developed and if there were no transfusion, the doctors told her that they thought it likely she would die during a Caesarean delivery. Mrs. Jackson, nevertheless, steadfastly refused to compro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>mise her religious beliefs. She requested that the Caesarean delivery proceed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without blood transfusions. Mrs. Jackson\u2019s husband was with his wife at Mercy and he, also a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, wholeheartedly supported her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Mercy adjudged the risk that Mrs. Jackson had assumed to be medically unacceptable. As a result, its counsel immediately orally petitioned the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Greenfeld, J.) for the appointment of a guardian for Mrs. Jackson with authority in the guardian to consent to blood transfusions to Mrs. Jackson. Judge Greenfeld appointed counsel for Mrs. Jackson and then convened a court hearing at her bedside in the hospital. Some physicians on Mercy\u2019s staff testified with respect to the life threatening condition that Mrs. Jackson was precipitating as a result of her steadfast refusal to be transfused. Mrs. Jackson and her husband told Judge Greenfeld of their firm religious convictions and their decision to proceed with the surgical intervention, sans transfusion, despite the potentially fatal risk entailed. Judge Greenfeld denied Mercy\u2019s application for guardianship, and the operation occurred without the use of transfusions. Mrs. Jackson and her child survived the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">It is from the denial of the appointment of a guardian for Mrs. Jackson that Mercy brings this appeal and posits to us the single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">\u201cDid the ... [circuit] court err in holding that a competent, pregnant adult has a paramount right to refuse consent to a blood transfusion on the basis of her religious beliefs in the circumstances presented in this case?\u201d The hospital vigorously contends that the \u201csole issue\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABP\">before this Court devolves to deciding whether Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Greenfeld erred as a matter of law in balancing certain competing State interests<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against Mrs. Jackson\u2019s right to freedom of religion under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and then finding in Mrs. Jackson\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Viewing the matter from an entirely different perspective, Mrs. Jackson has moved to dismiss this appeal because there is no actual controversy between the parties; there is no remedy which this Court may fashion between Mercy and Mrs. Jackson. Patently, Mrs. Jackson has already undergone the surgery. In her words, she \u201cno longer requires medical attention of the sort at issue here, and if she did, would be extremely unlikely to seek it from [Mercy Hospital].\u201d In sum, Mrs. Jackson states that the issue is moot and should be dismissed. Md.Rules 1035 b. 8 and 1036 d.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The threshold issue in the matter at bar is, inescapably, that of mootness. Inasmuch as the surgery was concluded, the child born, and the patient discharged, this case would ordinarily be found not judiciable. <em>See Hamilton v. McAuliffe, </em>277 Md. 336, 353 A.2d 634 (1976). Mercy and the Attorney General<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> urge that we not dismiss the appeal for mootness, but that we address it because the issue is likely to arise again and again. Because of the probability of repetition and the substantial likelihood that the matter will always be moot by the time it reaches an appellate court, we deem it to be in the public interest for us to answer Mercy\u2019s question. <em>See Coleman v. Coleman, </em>57 Md.App. 755, 758, 471 A.2d 1115, 1117 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Mercy Hospital argues to this Court that, \u201cMercy is a private, non-profit, Catholic hospital which is run by the Sisters of Mercy, a Catholic religious order,\u201d and that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. Despite the absence of testimony to that effect before the circuit court, Mrs. Jackson has stipulated that the hospital\u2019s self-portrayal is accurate. Mercy says that it \u201cis dedicated to the preservation of life and family through the provision of medical services____\u201d Nevertheless, Mercy may not properly complain that Mrs. Jackson\u2019s religious beliefs were upheld to the detriment of the hospital\u2019s own religious convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State, in this case personified by the circuit court judge, must \u201cbe a neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and non-believers.\u201d <em>Atlantic Department Store, Inc. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>22 Md.App. 381, 387, 323 A.2d 617, 620 (1974), citing <em>School District of Abington Tp. Pa. v. Schempp, </em>374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (also cited as <em>Murray v. Curlett); Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Freedom of religion means the right to pursue one\u2019s religious beliefs without interference from any other religion, non-religion or the government. <em>Montgomery County Department of Social Services v. Sanders, </em>38 Md.App. 406, 416 n. 10, 381 A.2d 1154, 1161 n. 10 (1978) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cNo chapter in human history has been so largely written in terms of persecution and intolerance as the one dealing with religious freedom. From ancient times to the present day, the ingenuity of man has known no limits in its ability to forge weapons of oppression for use against those who dare to express or practice unorthodox religious beliefs. And the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are living proof of the fact that even in this nation, conceived as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>was in the ideals of freedom, the right to practice religion in unconventional ways is still far from secure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em>Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 176-76, 64 S.Ct. 438, 447, 88 L.Ed. 645, 657 (1944) (Murphy, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Although the First Amendment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> precludes the State from interfering with the religious beliefs of its citizens, the State may nevertheless intervene in those instances where a compelling State interest is jeopardized by a practice generated by a religious impetus. <em>See McMillan v. State, </em>258 Md. 147, 265 A.2d 453 (1970). For example, the State\u2019s interest in the safety and well-being of minors may compel medical treatment for a child despite objections by the parents that are based upon their religious beliefs. <em>See Craig v. State, </em>220 Md. 590, 155 A.2d 684 (1959) (statutory duty imposed by former Md.Ann.Code art. 72A \u00a7 1 (now Md.Family Law Code Ann. \u00a7 5-203(b)(l)) requires parents to provide reasonable medical treatment to minor children even when such treatment is antithetical to the religious beliefs of the parents); <em>accord Levitsky v. Levitsky, </em>231 Md. 388, 190 A.2d 621 (1963) (religious beliefs of mother, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, could not overcome the State\u2019s interest in the welfare of her child, and blood transfusions for the minor were properly ordered); <em>see also Snyder v. Holy Cross Hospital, </em>30 Md.App. 317, 352 A.2d 334, <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 750 (1976) (State\u2019s interests in peace, health, and good order found sufficiently compelling to override religious objections of father against autopsy of son\u2019s body).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The State of Maryland, as we have seen, participated in this appeal by submitting a written brief as <em>amicus curiae, </em>and despite Mercy\u2019s assertions to the contrary, pointed out that any State interest in the preservation of life is not necessarily absolute. After a thorough review of a number of cases in Maryland, and other jurisdictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>which have addressed free exercise of religion <em>vis-a-vis </em>the right to refuse medical treatment, the Attorney General summarized: \u201c[T]he compelling need to preserve life is itself limited by society\u2019s demand for recognition of fundamental individual liberties.\u201d <em>See also, </em>Cantor, <em>A Patient\u2019s Decision to Decline Life-Saving Medical Treatment: Bodily Integrity Versus the Preservation of Life, </em>26 Rutgers L.Rev. 228 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The State\u2019s characterization of its interest in the preservation of human life as being a qualified one is buttressed by previous pronouncements on the subject by Maryland legislation. Md.Health Gen.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-107, the statute addressing consent for medical treatment upon individuals who lack, the capacity or present ability to make their own decision provides, in pertinent part:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Definitions </em>\u2014 (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">(2) In this section, \u2018disabled individual\u2019 means an individual who lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate a responsible decision on health care for the individual because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">(i) A physical disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">(ii) Chronic alcoholism;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">(iii) Drug addiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">(iv) A disaease; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">(v) A mental disability, including senility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">(b) <em>Scope of section. </em>\u2014 This <em>section does not authorize any treatment of a disabled individual if the health care provider knows that the treatment is against the religious belief of the disabled individual.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>(f) <em>Same [Substituted consent] </em>\u2014 When <em>not allowed. </em>\u2014The substituted consent provided for by subsection (d) of this section may not be given:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">(2) <em>If the health care provider is aware that the person for whom the health care is proposed has expressed disagreement with the decision to provide health </em>care____\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Each of the above quoted sections of the statute embodies an emphatic legislative mandate that the patient\u2019s decision regarding the type of treatment the patient shall endure is paramount. The statute goes so far as to declare that, in the final analysis, it is the patient who determines whether there shall be any treatment at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The protection afforded the able or competent adult can hardly be less than that accorded by the legislature to the disabled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">As we have said, Mrs. Jackson was competent to provide consent at all pertinent times, and her baby was never at risk because of the refusal to allow a blood transfusion. In his denial of Mercy\u2019s petition for a guardian for Mrs. Jackson, Judge Greenfeld said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201cThis Court is of the opinion that a competent, pregnant adult does have the paramount right to refuse a blood transfusion in accordance with her religious beliefs, where such decision is made knowingly and voluntarily and will not endanger the delivery, survival or support of the fetus. This conclusion is consistent with a patient\u2019s right of informed consent to medical treatment, <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, [379 A.2d 1014] (1977), and the corollary right to refuse that medical treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\">.

The record reveals that the medical staff at University of Maryland Hospital, not a party to this appeal, concurred with the finding of a high risk of mortality if Mrs. Jackson did not permit transfusion. It was evidently for that reason that Mrs. Jackson was rushed from that facility to Mercy Hospital. The circuit court found that despite the risks to the mother, delivery by Caesarean section without blood transfusions posed virtually no threat to the health of the fetus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\">.
