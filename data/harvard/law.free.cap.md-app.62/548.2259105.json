The court sentenced appellant to six months incarceration, suspended the sentence, and placed appellant on probation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">On June 11, 1981, a violation of probation warrant was issued for appellant. On September 21, 1982, appellant appeared before the court on the violation of probation charge. After a hearing, the court revoked the probation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201creimposed\u201d the original sentence, again suspended that sentence, and placed appellant on probation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On September 19, 1983 \u2014 two days shy of the end of his probation period \u2014 a warrant was issued for appellant charging him with violating the conditions of his probation. Specifically, appellant was charged with having</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">\u201cviolated Rule # [4] The subject was arrested on 6/3/83 on a Possession of Marijuana charge, and arrested again on a Failure to Appear charge on 8/3/83. Rule <em>#7 </em>Failed to appear in court on 8/3/83. Rule # 10 To pay court costs of $245.00 plus today[\u2019s] court costs of $105.00 totalling $350.00. The subject presently owes $96.30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abo\">Appellant reappeared before the court on April 24, 1984 for a hearing to determine whether he violated his probation. The only person to testify was appellant\u2019s probation officer, who offered the following basis for violating appellant\u2019s probation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201cOkay. I charged Mr. Johnson with Rule No. 4, obey all rules. The subject was arrested on June 3, 1983, on a possession of marijuana charge, and he was arrested again on 8/3/83 on a failure to appear charge. Rule No. 7, appear in court when notified to do so. The subject failed to appear in court on 8/3/83.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">At the time when the report was made, I also charged him with Rule No. 10, because he had owed 96.30 on his case, which he has since then paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">Q Okay. Has he had any problems since that period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">A I received a call in December from the Investigative Unit stating that he had been arrested in December, I think, on another possession of marijuana charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">Q Has he been convicted of that, do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">A. Not that I know of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">That was the full extent of the evidence against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">The court, without stating its reasons, found that appellant had violated the conditions of his probation and ordered execution of appellant\u2019s original six-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>On appeal, appellant argues that there was no basis for finding him in violation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The decision whether to grant or revoke probation is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the sentencing court. An abuse of that discretion will be found \u201conly if the trial court has erroneously construed the conditions of probation, ... has made factual findings that are clearly erroneous, ... or has acted arbitrarily or capriciously in revoking probation.\u201d <em>Herold v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 295, 303, 449 A.2d 429 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">As the lower court did not state its reasons for revoking appellant\u2019s probation, we must consider each of the violations alleged by the agent to determine whether there was any basis for the court\u2019s ultimate ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\"><em>Rule #4 </em>\u2014 Obey <em>All Rules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The sole basis of this claimed violation was appellant\u2019s alleged arrest on June 3, 1983, for possession of marijuana and his alleged arrest on August 3, 1983, for failure to appear in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">In <em>Dean v. State, </em>291 Md. 198, 434 A.2d 552 (1981), the Court of Appeals summarized the law applicable to probation revocation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201cA probationer is entitled to retain his liberty as long as he substantially abides by the conditions of his probation. Probation may not be revoked unless the probationer has in fact acted in violation of one or more conditions of his probation. Generally, before probation may be revoked, the State must prove that the probationer has not complied with one or more lawful conditions of probation .... The procedural protections afforded a probationer at a revocation of probation hearing are not equivalent to those accorded at a criminal trial. Formal procedures and the rules of evidence are not employed. Finally, before probation may be revoked, the trial court need only be reasonably satisfied that there was, in fact, a violation of probation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Under these principles, it is not necessary that a conviction precede a determination that the probationer has violated a condition of probation requiring him to obey all laws. <em>If it is shown by independent, probative evidence that the probationer has committed a crime subsequent to his probation and the trial court is reasonably satisfied by that evidence'that the probationer committed the crime, </em>probation may be revoked on the ground that the probationer violated the special condition of his probation that he obey all laws.\u201d (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 202-203, 434 A.2d 552; <em>see also Horsey v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 667, 468 A.2d 684 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\"><em>Dean </em>is really the benchmark for what is required. There must be \u201cindependent, probative evidence that the probationer has committed a crime____\u201d A judgment of conviction, absent a jurisdictional defect, certainly suffices as such evidence. A mere arrest, however, does not. Proof of an arrest, standing alone, indicates no more than that the defendant has been formally accused. As noted in <em>People v. Hunter, </em>106 Mich.App. 821, 308 N.W.2d 694, 697 (1981), \u201c[t]he notion that a person is presumed innocent until proven otherwise is basic to our system of criminal justice, and an arrest, standing alone, does not <em>per se </em>indicate wrongdoing or justify revocation.\u201d It indicates, said the Louisiana court in <em>State v. Harris, </em>368 So.2d 1066, 1071 (1979), \u201conly that a crime may be charged, not that a crime has been committed.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Webster, 492 </em>F.2d 1048 (D.C.C.A.1974); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>475 F.Supp. 156 (E.D.Mich.1979); <em>United States ex rel Spero v.

Serio, </em>168 N.J.Super. 394, 403 A.2d 49 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Warren, </em>250 Pa.Super. 522, 378 A.2d 1271 (1977); <em>People v.

State, </em>542 S.W.2d 403 (Tex.Cr.App.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">In the absence of proper proof of a conviction, it is incumbent upon the State to show, by competent evidence, that the probationer did, indeed, commit the criminal acts offered as the basis for the requested revocation. The revocation hearing is not the equivalent of a criminal trial, of course, and the fact need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but there must be some \u201cindependent, probative evidence\u201d to show that the probationer did what the State claims he did. Something more than the fact that he or she was arrested is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><em>Rule </em># <em>7 </em>\u2014 Appear <em>In Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Appellant\u2019s alleged failure to appear in court on August 3, 1983, also formed the basis of the agent\u2019s charge under Rule 7, which, we are advised, obligated appellant to appear when required.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole support for that charge consisted of the probation agent\u2019s statement, \u201cThe subject failed to appear in court on 8/3/83.\u201d The agent did not indicate where appellant was to appear or why he was to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">A careful review of the record indicates two important things: first, the probation agent clearly was mistaken as to the date on which appellant was to appear; and second, appellant had a good excuse for not appearing on the date he was, in fact, supposed to appear \u2014 he was in jail at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The record shows that appellant was first charged with violating his probation on June 11, 1981. A warrant issued that day was returned July 21, 1982 \u2014 thirteen months la<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ter \u2014 with a notation that appellant was in jail. That matter was eventually heard on September 21, 1982, and, as noted earlier in this Opinion, the court, in effect, continued his probation until September, 1983. On December 9, 1982, a \u201cNotice of Violation of Probation\u201d was issued, although, unlike the earlier proceeding, there is no indication that a warrant was issued or that the notice was served on appellant. The hearing on the alleged violation was twice postponed and was eventually set for February 17, 1983. The docket entry for that day states, \u201cViolation of Probation Hearing: Defendant failure to appeal [sic] \u2014 Bench Warrant do issued [sic]. Bail set at None.\u201d At the circuit court hearing in this case, counsel asserted, without contradiction by the State, that appellant failed to appear in court that day because he was in jail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Nothing more happened until September 19, 1983, when the Violation of Probation warrant triggering this proceeding was issued. It was in that warrant that appellant was charged with failing to appear in court on August 3, 1983. Interestingly, that warrant also was returned with the notation that appellant was in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">What we have then is not only the absence of any support for the agent\u2019s bald accusation that appellant \u201cfailed to appear in court on 8/3/83,\u201d but a rather clear indication that no court appearance was required at that time. If there was a \u201cfailure to appear,\u201d it occurred on February 17, 1983, and is accounted for by the fact that appellant was then in jail. Upon this record, we find insufficient evidence to sustain the alleged violation of Rule # 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Rule #10 </em>\u2014 Pay <em>Court Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Appellant\u2019s probation officer testified that at the time the instant warrant was issued, appellant owed $96.30. It was conceded at the hearing, however, that appellant had since paid that sum in full and thus had complied with that condition of his probation. To revoke appellant\u2019s probation for failure to pay costs, therefore, would have been an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In summary, it is apparent that the State failed to adduce evidence sufficient to show that appellant did not comply with the conditions of his probation. The facts, it would seem, were there, and had the State prepared its case in a proper manner, they likely could have been established. But that is not the point; the court can only act upon what is actually presented to it, not what might have been presented had the party or its counsel been more diligent. Upon this record, we conclude that the trial court erred in revoking appellant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">. The actual order for probation is not in the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">. The probation agent testified that on February 22, 1982 \u2014 prior to the September, 1982, hearing at which the court elected to continue appellant\u2019s probation \u2014 appellant was convicted of some other offense for which he was sentenced to four years in jail. That testimony was stricken upon appellant's objection, presumably on the basis that that conviction was not alleged in the instant warrant. It would, however, tend to support counsel\u2019s assertion that appellant was indeed incarcerated on February 17, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
