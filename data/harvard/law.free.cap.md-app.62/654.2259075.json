He was also the owner of a pickup truck listed as an \u201cinsured automobile\u201d in that policy. On June 28, 1982, his sister, Nancy Haring, was named personal representative of his estate. A month later appellant Leonard Oroian, while driving the truck for his own purposes, was involved in an accident in which appellant Louise Breininger and Cathie Perrigon (not an appellant) were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Perrigon, it seems, filed a tort action against Oroian, Haring\u2019s estate, Nancy Haring, and Breininger. Apparently, the bases of this suit were that Oroian was negligent, John Haring\u2019s estate was liable because Oroian was operating the truck as an agent of the estate, and Nancy Haring negligently entrusted the vehicle to Oroian and permitted him to operate it in violation of the motor vehicle laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Allstate refused to defend or provide any coverage for Oroian.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Allstate then brought a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. It named as defendants appellants Oroian, Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (Perrigon\u2019s uninsured motorist carrier), and Breininger, as well as Nancy Haring (not an appellant), individually and as personal representative of Haring\u2019s estate, and Perrigon. The insurer sought a declaration that \u201cAllstate Insurance Company ... has no duty to defend or provide any coverage for Leonard Ordian <em>[sic </em>] and Nancy Haring....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Oroian answered and requested a \u201cdecree declaring that [Allstate] afford coverage and a defense to him in regard to subject accident.\u201d He also asked for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in both the tort action and the declaratory judgment case. MAIF answered and requested \u201ca decree declaring that [Allstate] afford coverage and a defense to defendant Oroian in regard to subject accident.\u201d MAIF also filed a counterclaim for attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses \u201cfor the reason that [Allstate] ... has failed and refused to afford ... Oroian ... coverage and a defense for claims arising from said accident____\u201d The other defendants, in their answers, simply prayed for \u201ca declaration of the rights and duties of all parties herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In due course the declaratory judgment came in for hearing before Judge Albert T. Blackwell, Jr. On June 25, 1984, after an evidentiary hearing, he declared \u201cthat ... Allstate Insurance Company has no duty to defend or provide coverage to Leonard Oroian for the July 28, 1982 accident involving Cathie Perrigon and Louise Breininger____\u201d On September 10, 1984, he entered a \u201cFinal Order\u201d which supplemented the June declaration by stating \u201cthat the duty of plaintiff ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY in regard to the duty to defend or provide coverage to NANCY HARING, individually and as the Personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Representative of the Estate of JOHN HARING has not been addressed.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">From that order, appellants have appealed. They ask whether the court erred</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">1. in admitting a computer printout as evidence of John Haring\u2019s status as named insured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">2. in declaring that Oroian\u2019s operation of the pickup truck was not covered by the Allstate Policy? and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">3. in declining to address the issue of Nancy Haring\u2019s coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">\n<em>Computer Printout</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">At trial Allstate introduced into evidence a computer printout. This was the only evidence that John Haring was the \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the subject insurance policy. His status as \u201cnamed insured,\u201d as we shall see, was important to the issue of Oroian\u2019s coverage. Appellants now question whether that document \u201cunsigned, unverified, unauthenticated, satisfactorily establishes John Haring as the sole named insured?\u201d Allstate responds that the printout was properly admitted as a business record (Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Art. \u00a7 10-101 (1984)) through the testimony of its witness, claims adjuster Linda Burnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">We need not decide these contentions. Appellants, in their brief, have cited no authority for their position. We deem it waived. <em>See Larmore v. Larmore, </em>241 Md. 586, 589-90, 217 A.2d 338 (1966); <em>Jacober v. High Hill Realty, Inc., </em>22 Md.App. 115, 125, 321 A.2d 838, <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 743 (1974). Haring\u2019s status as named insured was virtually conceded by appellants\u2019 answers to Allstate\u2019s demand for admissions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\n<em>Oroian\u2019s Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Absent a policy provision extending coverage, an automobile liability policy lapses on the death of the named insured. 9 R. Anderson, <em>Couch Cyclopedia of Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 39.243 (2d ed. 1962); 7 Am.Jur.2d <em>Automobile Insurance </em>\u00a7 12 (1980). The Allstate policy now before us contains such a provision. General Condition 7 informs us</p>\n<p id=\"ABO\">... if the named insured, or his spouse as a resident of the same household, shall die, this policy shall cover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">(a) the survivor as named insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">(b) his legal representative as named insured but only while acting within the scope of his duties as such; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">(c) with respect to an owned automobile, any person having proper temporary custody as insured, until the appointment and qualification of such legal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">We need only consider the effect of paragraph (b). Paragraph (a) clearly applies to the \u201csurvivor\u201d of the named insured (John Haring) and his spouse; the record discloses no surviving spouse. Paragraph (c) is inapplicable because the accident in question occurred after Nancy Haring\u2019s appointment and qualification as personal representative of John\u2019s estate. <em>Federated Mutual Implement and Hardware Ins. Co. v. Eng, </em>178 N.W.2d 321, 323 (Iowa 1970). Nancy Haring, then, was the named insured if the use of the truck on the night of the accident was the result of her \u201cacting within the scope of her duties\u201d as personal representative. Only if she were the named insured, could Oroian have been covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The facts bearing on this question are reasonably straightforward, although not altogether undisputed. Oroian was a close friend of the Haring family. He was among the first to find John Haring dead. Just before John\u2019s sudden demise he had been \u201crototillering a garden\u201d for his sister, Nancy. The rototiller, the property of Ray Harbaugh, had been transported in John\u2019s pickup truck. After John\u2019s death, Oroian placed the rototiller in the truck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>drove to Harbaugh\u2019s home. There the truck remained for several weeks, when Oroian retrieved it. Nancy knew the whereabouts of the truck and knew Oroian had taken possession of it. Oroian testified she imposed no restrictions on his use of the vehicle. Nancy said she had never given him permission to use the truck. There was evidence, however, that Nancy acquiesced in Oroian\u2019s possession of the truck for the purpose of keeping it in proper shape until it was appraised for estate purposes. There was evidence that Nancy was willing to sell Oroian the truck after that had been accomplished, although Nancy\u2019s brother, Skip, wanted to give the truck to Oroian. In any event, it was clear, as Oroian himself said, that on the night of the accident he was not using the vehicle for any estate-related purpose, but rather for his \u201cown purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Appellants argue that the critical question on the issue of coverage for Oroian is whether Oroian had permission to use the truck at the time of the accident. Judge Blackwell saw it otherwise. He found \u201ca dispute as to the question of whether Oroian had permission to operate the truck.\u201d He found \u201can agreement between [Oroian and Nancy] that Oroian would have possession of the truck, but that there was no agreement concerning its use.\u201d But he concluded that the issue of permissive use was not critical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">This court[,] however[,] does not have to resolve the issue of permissive use of the truck..., for even assuming Oroian had permission to use the truck, he does not fall within the second requirement, that he be acting within the scope of the duties of the personal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We agree with Judge Blackwell\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">By the terms of Allstate\u2019s policy, it was required to \u201cpay for an insured all damages which the insured shall be \u25a0legally obligated to pay because of ... bodily injury sustained by any person, and ... injury to or destruction of property, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use ... of the owned automobile.... \u201d Persons insured include \u201c[t]he named insured with respect to the owned automobile\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and \u201c[a]ny other person, with respect to the owned automobile, provided the use thereof is with the permission of the named insured and within the scope of such permission .... \u201d Because of John Haring\u2019s death, and by virtue of General Condition 7(b), his personal representative, Nancy Haring, was the named insured at the time of the accident, but <em>only </em>\u201cwhile acting within the scope of [her] duties as such----\u201d If, therefore, Oroian\u2019s use of the vehicle at the time of the accident was not within the scope of Nancy\u2019s duties as personal representative, she was not then the named insured and, as Judge Blackwell ruled the question of permissive use was unnecessary to decide. Under that hypothesis, there could be no named insured and hence no use of the truck by or with permission of a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Maryland law defines the scope of a personal representative\u2019s duties. The personal representative is a fiduciary who \u201cis under a general duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent ... as expeditiously and with as little sacrifice of value as is reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d Md.Est. <em>&amp; </em>Trust Art. \u00a7 7-101(a) (1974). Pursuant to the general duty, the personal representative must \u201c... take possession or control of the estate of the decedent...\u201d (\u00a7 7-102), \u201c... prepare and file an inventory of property owned by the decedent at the time of his death...\u201d (\u00a7 7-201), cause the property to be appraised (\u00a7 7-202), and file accounts (\u00a7\u00a7 7-301-307). The personal representative also possesses the powers listed in \u00a7 7-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Neither any \u00a7 7-401 power nor any other statutory authority conferred on a personal representative permits her to use an estate-owned vehicle for personal, non estate-related purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor do these provisions authorize a personal representative to permit another to use estate proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ty for such purposes. It may have been proper, and within the scope of Nancy Haring\u2019s duties as personal representative, to give Oroian custody of the truck in order to keep it in good shape pending appraisal. That, however, is a far cry from giving Oroian permission to use the pickup for his own purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">It will be recalled that at the time of the accident Oroian, by his own admission, was using the truck on a purely personal venture. His visit to a bar that night had no conceivable connection with administration of John Haring\u2019s estate. Judge Blackwell so found, and his finding was amply supported by the evidence. On the basis of this he declared that Oroian was not covered by the Allstate Policy at the time of the July 28, 1982, accident. We hold that he did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Although we have found no reported Maryland case that addresses this question, two out-of-state decisions are instructive. The first is <em>Federated Mutual Implement Hardware and Ins. Co. v. Eng, supra. </em>Before the Supreme Court of Iowa in that case was an insurance policy provision identical to Allstate\u2019s General Condition 7(b). The facts were that a collision occurred when the deceased-named insured\u2019s executor was operating a vehicle the deceased had owned. The trial court found that the executor had been driving the car on estate business (\u201cwhile acting within the scope of his duties as\u201d executor) and declared that there was coverage. The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 324-25. That case, of course, is the converse of this one where the vehicle was not being operated on estate business. <em>Eng, </em>therefore, stands for the proposition that there is coverage under a 7(b)-type provision when an accident occurs while the vehicle is used for estate purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The other side of the coin is illustrated by <em>Litz v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>58 Tenn.App. 585, 435 S.W.2d 124.(1968), <em>cert. denied </em>(1968). State Farm\u2019s policy in that case was, again, identical to Allstate\u2019s General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Condition 7(b) in this case. The facts were that the decedent\u2019s administratrix and her husband (the driver of the car) were on a personal junket when the accident occurred. Holding that no coverage existed, the Tennessee intermediate appellate court reasoned: \u201cLiability ... is excluded because the undisputed evidence shows that Mrs. Litz was not driving within the scope of her duties as Administratrix but was upon a personal mission of her own.\u201d 435 S.W.2d at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Appellants attempt to distinguish <em>Litz </em>by pointing out that two days before the accident Mrs. Litz, <em>qua </em>administratrix, had sold the car to Mrs. Litz, individually. That is true, but it makes no difference. For reasons not important here, the <em>Litz </em>court treated the case as though no transfer had occurred and as if the vehicle had been an \u201cowned automobile\u201d under State Farm\u2019s policy. <em>Litz, </em>therefore, is authority for the proposition that there is no coverage under a 7(b)-type provision when the vehicle is not being operated on estate business.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We find <em>Litz </em>persuasive. Under its reasoning, had Nancy Haring been driving the pickup truck on personal business, there would have been no coverage. The same result follows when Oroian was driving the vehicle on a personal venture. Even if he is considered as some sort of additional insured, \u201chis rights can be no greater than the rights of the named insured.\u201d <em>DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 723-24, 475 A.2d 454 (1984). In short, since the truck was concededly not being operated on estate affairs, no coverage existed for the accident in question, regardless of how permissive the use of the truck might have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\n<em>Lack of Declaration as to Nancy Haring\u2019s Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">We turn now to the most difficult question in this case: Must we reverse because Judge Blackwell declined to issue a declaration as to Nancy Haring\u2019s coverage? We first consider the circumstances in which this issue arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>It will be recalled that Allstate had sought declarations as to non-coverage with respect both to Oroian and Nancy Haring. In its trial memorandum it addressed only the former issue. Only that issue was argued before Judge Blackwell when, as we have seen, on June 25, 1984, he signed a memorandum and order deciding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">This troubled Oroian and MAIF. After their motion for new trial was denied, they filed a \u201cPetition for Entry of Final Judgment.\u201d In it they pointed out that Allstate had sought declarations as to both Oroian and Nancy Haring, but that only Oroian\u2019s lack of coverage had been decided. They expressed fear that because of this all claims had not been adjudicated; thus there was no final judgment from which they could appeal. Former Md.Rule 605a; present Rule 2-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Allstate responded, saying among other things, that in view of Judge Blackwell\u2019s decision there could be no doubt as to Nancy Haring\u2019s coverage, that the January 25 order was a final, appealable judgment and that Allstate had in effect withdrawn its request for a declaration as to Haring.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The matter came on for hearing on September 10. Apparently, a proposed order was presented to Judge Blackwell. It is not in the record, but from the hearing transcript we infer that it contained a declaration of no coverage as to Nancy Haring. Judge Blackwell thought there might be at least a duty to defend her under the negligent entrustment count of the tort declaration. Counsel for Oroian and MAIF (the parties who had petitioned for a final judgment) then suggested \u201cyou can order that the court will not pass upon that at this time, on her____\u201d Counsel for Haring objected to an order declaring no coverage for her. He agreed with Allstate that its request for a declaration as to Haring had been withdrawn. He and counsel for MAIF and Oroian eventually agreed that it would be both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>appropriate and sufficient for the order simply to provide that the court had declined to rule as to Haring.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">That is what eventually happened. On the same day Judge Blackwell signed the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">FINAL ORDER</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">This is a declaratory judgment action brought by ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY to resolve a coverage dispute as to multiple parties. The facts of the case are complex and have been stated and reviewed in this court\u2019s Memorandum and Order dated June 25, 1984, ... and it is not necessary to repeat them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">The court, having previously declared in its said Memorandum and Order of June 25, 1984, that ... ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY has no duty to defend or provide coverage to Leonard Oroian for the July 28, 1982, accident ..., now, to finally decide the matter and to render a final judgment herein, states that it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">ORDERED, that the duty of ... ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY in regard to duty to defend or provide coverage to NANCY HARING, individually and as the Personal Representative of the Estate of JOHN HARING has not been addressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Appellants now contend (with some ill grace, in view of the concessions they made at the September 10 hearing) that Judge Blackwell erred in not addressing the question of Nancy Haring\u2019s coverage. They cite cases such as <em>Robert T. Foley Co. v. W.S.S.C., </em>283 Md. 140, 154-55, 389 A.2d 350 (1978) which hold that in a declaratory judgment action the trial court ordinarily must declare the rights of the parties in light of the issues raised \u2014 that is, make a declaration as to every claim presented. <em>See also Jennings v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>302 Md. 352, at 355, 488 A.2d 166, at 167 (1985); <em>Stevan v. Brown, </em>54 Md.App. 235, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>248, 458 A.2d 466, <em>cert. denied, </em>297 Md. 110 (1983). This requirement has been applied regularly despite the apparently discretionary language of the Declaratory Judgments Act \u2014 \u201c... a court <em>may </em>grant a declaratory judgment or decision in a civil case____\u201d Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Art. \u00a7 3-409(a) (1984) [emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Allstate counters by citing the statute and <em>Brohawn v. Transamerican Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975). In <em>Brohawn, </em>Judge Getty, the trial judge, dismissed Transamerica\u2019s action for a declaration as to non-coverage of an insurance policy. We reversed, reasoning that \u201c[i]t is firmly established that seldom, if ever, should a bill or petition in a declaratory judgment proceeding be dismissed without a declaration of the rights of the parties\u201d and that \u201c[discretion in the courts to refuse a declaratory judgment is very limited.\u201d 23 Md.App. 186, 195, 326 A.2d 758 (1974) [citations omitted], <em>rev\u2019d, </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u25a0 The Court of Appeals disagreed. It held that \u201cwhere ... the question to be resolved in the declaratory judgment action will be decided in the pending [tort] actions, it is inappropriate to grant a declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 406, 347 A.2d 842. The Court also noted the discretion granted by \u00a7 3-409 of the Courts Article, observing that \u201c[i]f the granting of the judgment would ... allow one party to wrest control of the litigation from another and cause a confusing alteration of the burden of proof, the court should refuse to grant the relief sought, [citation omitted], Under such circumstances, granting a declaratory judgment would constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying these principles to the case before it, the Court of Appeals concluded that to allow Transamerica to litigate certain issues in the declaratory judgment case would allow the insurance company, and not the tort plaintiffs, to control the litigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Much of this reasoning appears applicable here. It is true that some issues relating to Nancy Haring\u2019s coverage will be decided in the tort action. It is equally true that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>a declaratory judgment action, this case presents a <em>Brohawn </em>problem in that it allows Allstate, and not the tort plaintiffs, to control the litigation. With regard to Nancy Haring\u2019s liability coverage, Judge Blackwell\u2019s discretionary decision not to address that question might well be supported by the <em>Brohawn </em>holding. But that is not necessarily so as to the related question of whether Allstate had a duty to defend Haring. If nothing else, it may have owed her a defense, at least in her capacity as personal representative. <em>See Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 407-15, 347 A.2d 842. <em>See generally St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar. Ins. Co. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 438 A.2d 282 (1981)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (duty to defend broadly construed).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Having said all this, however, we conclude that we need not decide whether to apply <em>Brohawn </em>or appellants\u2019 theory to this case. We hold that what Judge Blackwell did in his \u201cFinal Order\u201d of September 10, 1984, was the functional equivalent of the granting of a motion for voluntary dismissal under Md.Rule 2-506(b). Subject to exceptions not here pertinent, that rule provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">[A] plaintiff may dismiss an action only by order of court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded prior to the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for voluntary dismissal, the action shall not be dismissed over the objection of the party who pleaded the counterclaim unless the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">This rule speaks in terms of dismissal of \u201can action\u201d but we think it applies equally to dismissal of a separate claim in an action. <em>See Mildred Davis, Inc. v. Hopkins, </em>224 Md. 626, 169 A.2d 450 (1961) (applying former Rule 541). Otherwise, there would be no available mechanism for the voluntary dismissal of such a claim. Allstate, the plaintiff below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>asserted a separate declaratory judgment claim with respect to coverage of Nancy Haring and its duty to defend her. It effectively withdrew or abandoned that claim when it omitted it from its trial memorandum and when it did not present that claim in oral argument. <em>Cf. Shafer v. Bernstein, </em>256 Md. 218 at 219, 260 A.2d 57 (1969) (withdrawal of one claim in declaratory judgment case). This was tantamount to a motion for voluntary dismissal. The court effectively granted that motion in its September 10 order, thereby satisfying the requirement that voluntary dismissal (after the introduction of evidence under former Rule 541(b); after the filing of an answer or a motion for summary judgment under Rule 2-506(a-b)) be accomplished by order of court absent a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">There was, to be sure, a counterclaim in this case, filed by MAIF. That counterclaim addressed only the Oroian coverage question and was disposed of by Judge Blackwell\u2019s declaration on that issue. In any case, MAIF did not object to the September 10 order. Oroian\u2019s answer to the declaratory judgment application was not a separate claim or counterclaim. It merely requested the converse of what Allstate had requested as to him. <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 459-60, 445 A.2d 343 (1982). And if appellant Breininger\u2019s answer be deemed a counterclaim (she prayed for \u201ca declaration of the rights and duties of all parties herein\u201d) she, too, failed to object to the September 10 order. The same is true as to non-appellant Perrigon.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Thus, the September 10 \u201cFinal Order\u201d did, indeed, produce a final judgment. It did so by in effect dismissing Allstate\u2019s Haring claim, thereby disposing of the only claim not adjudicated in the prior June 25 memorandum and order. By virtue of Judge Blackwell\u2019s September 10 action, all claims were disposed of and Rule 2-602 was satisfied. That action dismissed Allstate\u2019s claim as to Nancy Haring without prejudice because it did not specify otherwise. Rule 2-506(c). It rendered Allstate \u201cresponsible for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>costs of ... the part [of the action] dismissed.\u201d 2-506(d). Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">We, therefore, affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"AtjU\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\">. We can only speculate as to the contents of the tort declaration, since it is not included in the record before us. What we have said about it is gleaned from the admitted allegations in Allstate's declaratory judgment action, which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-12\">. Although the court did not expressly dispose of MAIF\u2019s counterclaim .or Oroian\u2019s request for fees and expenses, both of these claims were necessarily rejected by its declaration that Allstate had no duty to defend or provide coverage for Oroian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">. Section 7-102 permits the personal representative under some circumstances to allow an heir or legatee to retain possession of property to which that person is \u201cpresumptively entitled.\u201d Oroian was neither heir nor legatee. At best, he was a prospective purchaser or donee of the truck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\">. Although counsel for appellant Louise Breininger was not at the September 10 hearing, it appears that he had asked either counsel for Oroian and MAIF or counsel for Haring (it is not clear which) to represent her at it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">. The record suggests that Allstate conceded its duty to defend Haring, at least in her capacity as personal representative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
