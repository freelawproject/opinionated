Finding that the district court erred in dismissing Cooper\u2019s suit, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we vacate and remand for further disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Cooper filed this civil rights suit against various Lubbock County jail officials. He originally alleged that the defendants were denying him food. He specifically asserted that he was denied food on December 30, 1989, and again for five consecutive days from January 10, 1990, through January 15, 1990, the day he signed his complaint. He also alleged that the jail staff had already stated that he would not be fed on January 16, 1990. Cooper sought compensatory and punitive damages, a temporary restraining order, and a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">The defendants answered by stating that jail policy required that all inmates dress fully for all meals. They further claimed that \u201c[i]f an inmate is not fully dressed and refuses to fully dress for a meal, he voluntarily rejects the meal.\u201d They alleged that food was, thus, always available to Cooper but that his \u201cfailure to eat was due to his own voluntary refusal to fully dress during meals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">Individual defendants Sheriff Keesee and jail administrator Addington also asserted that they have qualified immunity for their actions and that Cooper had failed to allege any facts that overcame this immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">The magistrate judge concluded that Cooper\u2019s complaint alleged at worst that the defendants had acted negligently toward Cooper. The magistrate judge found that the complaint also failed to state whether Cooper was a pretrial detainee or a convicted prisoner. The magistrate judge gave Cooper thirty days to file an amended complaint. He also advised Cooper of the heightened pleading requirement that the immunity defense imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">After obtaining an extension of time, Cooper filed an amended complaint. In it, he alleged that the defendants had refused him food for thirteen days, ending on January 21st, twelve of which days had been consecutive. During at least some of those days Cooper had been housed in solitary confinement. He further asserted that the defendants knew, or should have known, that their conduct subjected Cooper to \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By this time, as his return address evidences, Cooper was no longer housed in the Lubbock County jail. He did not repeat his original request for various forms of equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">The defendants\u2019 new answer claimed that Cooper\u2019s amended complaint still failed to plead sufficient facts to overcome their qualified immunity. Their answer also pointed out that Cooper\u2019s amended complaint named as defendants four county commissioners<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who were not parties to this suit. In his reply, Cooper conceded that he had refused to dress fully before meals. He asserted, however, that the \u201cdefendants made on the spot disciplinary measures by refusing to allow the plaintiff to receive his meals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">Under the liberal construction given to pro se pleadings, the magistrate judge should have construed Cooper\u2019s reply to the defendant\u2019s new answer as a motion to amend the complaint. <em>See McGruder v. Phelps, </em>608 F.2d 1023, 1025 (5th Cir.1979). Nothing in the record suggests that Cooper delayed in clarifying his complaint because of bad faith or other \u201cdilatory motive.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number><em>See Dussouy v. Gulf Coast Inv. Corp., </em>660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir.1981). Thus, the court should have granted Cooper\u2019s motion to amend. Cooper\u2019s complaint, then, is that the defendants punished him without due process of law and that the form of punishment violated the eighth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The magistrate judge filed a report recommending that Cooper\u2019s suit be dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The magistrate judge found that the defendants\u2019 \u201crefusal to feed [Cooper] under the jail regulations was due to his own obstinacy in refusing to conform to the jail regulations.\u201d He further found that Cooper had failed to allege that he had suffered any harm as a result of this lack of food. Concerning the qualified immunity defense, the magistrate concluded that Cooper\u2019s allegations \u201cdo not state a claim showing a violation of clearly established law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Before the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, Cooper filed a \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d in which, <em>inter alia, </em>he again argued that punishment may not deprive a prisoner of the \u201cnecessities of life.\u201d He also stated that the defendants knew, or should have known, that their actions violated this \u201cun-disputable\u201d law. Cooper also alleged a specific physical harm \u2014 a \u201csubstantial weight loss,\u201d which prison medical records would verify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">The district court treated Cooper\u2019s \u201cnotice\u201d as his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. The court then adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s opinion as its own and, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), dismissed, without prejudice, Cooper\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">This court received a letter from Cooper indicating his intent to appeal. We treat that letter as a timely notice of appeal. <em>See Incas &amp; Monterey Printing &amp; Packaging, Ltd. v. M/V SANG JIN, </em>747 F.2d 958, 963 n. 15 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1117, 105 S.Ct. 2361, 86 L.Ed.2d 261 (1985); Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1). In his brief, Cooper also asks this court to appoint counsel because he suffers \u201csuch mental anguish\u201d that he is unable to \u201cattend to the matters of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, this court accepts \u201call well pleaded aver-ments as true and view[s] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Rankin v. City of Wichita Falls, </em>762 F.2d 444, 446 (5th Cir.1985). We do not uphold the dismissal \u201c \u2018unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\">A. <em>Meals &amp; Dress Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">Given Cooper\u2019s admissions, the district court could properly assume that Cooper\u2019s \u201cobstinacy\u201d \u2014 his failure to dress fully before meals \u2014 was the immediate cause of his lack of food. The magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Cooper failed to allege that he \u201csuffered ... nutritional harm or other problems\u201d was, however, incorrect. In fact, Cooper alleged harm by stating that he had suffered \u201csubstantial weight loss.\u201d As outlined above, his complaint also alleged that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated his due process rights by inflicting a punishment upon him without due process of law; and that the continual deprivation of food he suffered was \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. Neither the magistrate judge nor the district court addressed these claims of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-15\">The defendants argue that their conduct does not violate the Constitution, because they merely followed prison regulations that required Cooper to be dressed fully before his meals could be served. The defendants claim that the regulation preconditions meals on a dress requirement. They do not deny Cooper\u2019s allegation that he went without food for the number of days alleged, but they characterize Cooper\u2019s failure to dress properly for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>meals as a \u201cvoluntary rejection]\u201d of those meals. Although Cooper agrees that prison regulations required him to dress for meals, he asserts that the regulations do not specify what consequences would follow from his failure to comply. He asserts that the jail guards made an \u201con the spot disciplinary decision\u201d by refusing to feed him. Despite this disagreement concerning the interpretation of the regulation at issue, no copy of this regulation appears in the record. Dismissal was, therefore, premature because the present record is inadequate to support the district court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the defendants acted within the regulation\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">Even if the regulation required the defendants to respond as they did, a dismissal of Cooper\u2019s complaint does not necessarily follow. The mere existence of such a regulation is not an automatic shield against a civil rights suit. <em>See, e.g., Gates v. Collier, </em>501 F.2d 1291, 1304-06 (5th Cir.1974) (permitting use of prison\u2019s \u201cdark hole\u201d only if conditions exceeding state's statutory requirements are met). Complaints against the enforcement of prison regulations which deny a prisoner some privilege may, in the proper circumstances, be dismissed as frivolous. <em>See, e.g., Felix v. Rolan, </em>833 F.2d 517, 518-19 (5th Cir.1987) (state can reasonably deny privileges such as access to prison law library because prisoner refuses to use his \u201ccommitted name\u201d as an alias for prison identification purposes). Whether, however, a prisoner\u2019s meals constitute a like \u201cprivilege\u201d is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">Also, the magistrate judge erred when, citing <em>Beck v. Lynaugh, </em>842 F.2d 759, 761 (5th Cir.1988), he held that because there was \u201cno evidence this harm [Cooper\u2019s lack of food] was caused maliciously or deliberately by responsible people,\u201d Cooper had failed to state a sufficient claim. The court in <em>Beck, </em>on the contrary, specifically rejected the \u201ccaused maliciously or deliberately\u201d standard. It reiterated that the traditional eighth amendment standard \u2014 whether the infliction of pain was \u201cunnecessary and wanton\u201d \u2014 applied. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Foulds v. Corley, </em>833 F.2d 52, 54-55 (5th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">Because depriving a prisoner of adequate food is a form of corporal punishment, the eighth amendment imposes limits on prison officials\u2019 power to so deprive a prisoner. <em>See, e.g., Gates, </em>501 F.2d at 1301-03, 1306 (discussing cruel and unusual analysis and noting that deprivation of adequate food is a form of corporal punishment); <em>Cunningham v. Jones, </em>567 F.2d 653, 656-57 (6th Cir.1977). A facially permissible form of punishment may, for example, through continual use inflict cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Dearman v. Woodson, </em>429 F.2d 1288, 1289 (10th Cir.1970) (allegation that prison officials refused to provide prisoner food for 50V2 hours states cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983). Thus, Cooper\u2019s assertion that he was continuously deprived of food presents a set of facts that may entitle him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">Cooper also claims that the defendants punished him by denying him food without due process. The level of process due a prisoner depends in part on the severity of the sanction to be imposed and the needs of the institution. <em>See Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 473-77, 103 S.Ct. 864, 872-74, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); <em>Dzana v. Foti, </em>829 F.2d 558, 561 (5th Cir.1987). Even though the due process standards in <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 570, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2981, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), do not apply to all prison disciplinary proceedings, the less restrictive procedural protections of <em>Hewitt </em>do apply to most prison punishment. Such protections require that a prisoner receive \u201csome notice of the charges against him and a opportunity to present his views to the prison officials]_\u201d <em>See Hewitt, </em>459 U.S. at 476, 103 S.Ct. at 873. Cooper alleged that he was summarily punished and so lacked all notice or opportunity to state his views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">As the Eleventh Circuit has observed, \u201c[deciding whether an institution\u2019s action involves enforcement of a restriction or punishment ... requires that [the court] examine the officials\u2019 actions.\u201d <em>Solomon v. Zant, </em>888 F.2d 1579, 1582 (11th Cir.1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>(denying a prisoner food is, the court also notes, a punishment requiring compliance with due process). In the present case, the district court conducted no such examination. Such an analysis requires the court to look at the regulation to determine whether the officials acted within the scope of the regulation and whether the regulation was valid. <em>Id. </em>If the defendants\u2019 conduct falls within the scope of a valid regulation, such conduct \u201cis not punishment for the purposes of an inmate\u2019s right to due process. If, on the other hand, the action exceeds the scope of a valid governmental regulation, it is punishment which cannot be imposed without due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, as no copy of the regulation was made part of this record, the summary dismissal of Cooper\u2019s claim was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">\n<em>B.Qualified Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">The district court\u2019s qualified immunity analysis was at best premature. Cooper satisfied his obligation to allege sufficient facts in his complaint to overcome the presumption of immunity. <em>See Elliott v. Perez, </em>751 F.2d 1472, 1478-82 (5th Cir. 1985). He did so by challenging the scope of the regulation that the defendants claim they were enforcing and by raising his due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">Further, if at all times relevant to Cooper\u2019s charges, the defendants were acting within the scope of their authority and in their official capacity, the burden would be on Cooper to show that the defendants \u201cviolated clearly settled law of which a reasonable person would know.\u201d <em>See Whatley v. Philo, </em>817 F.2d 19, 20 (5th Cir.1987) (citing <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 813, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2735, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). First, Cooper claims that the defendants had acted outside the scope of their authority because neither the regulation nor the eighth amendment permitted the type of punishment they had imposed. Second, an official has no immunity when \u201cthe contours of the right [violated] were so clear at the time the officials acted that a reasonable official would have understood that what he was doing violated that right.\u201d <em>Brawner v. City of Richardson, </em>855 F.2d 187, 192 (5th Cir.1988) (citing <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). This circuit has long held that state prisoners are entitled to reasonably adequate food. <em>See, e.g., Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1125 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Newman v. Alabama, </em>559 F.2d 283, 291 (5th Cir.1977), <em>rev\u2019d in part, </em>438 U.S. 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">C. <em>Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">On appeal, Cooper also contends that the district court erred by failing to rule on the request in his original complaint for equitable relief. By the time Cooper filed his amended complaint, he was no longer held in the Lubbock County jail. Thus, even if Cooper\u2019s failure to raise these claims in his amended complaint or other pleadings does not waive this issue, his transfer to another prison has rendered moot these claims for relief. See, <em>e.g., Beck, </em>842 F.2d at 762 (injunctive relief moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">D. <em>Appointment of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">This court may appoint counsel in civil rights suits presenting \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212, 213 (5th Cir.1982). We base a decision to appoint counsel on many factors, including the type and complexity of the case; the petitioner\u2019s ability adequately to present and investigate his case; the presence of evidence which largely consists of conflicting testimony so as to require skill in presentation of evidence and in cross-examination; and the likelihood that appointment will benefit the petitioner, the court, and the defendants by \u201cshortening the trial and assisting in a just determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213 (citations omitted). Cooper\u2019s assertion that his \u201cmental anguish\u201d prevents his attending <em>to </em>this suit plainly does not satisfy the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement set out in <em>Ul-mer. </em>Therefore, his motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-12\">Without stating or implying any opinion as to the ultimate merits of Cooper\u2019s case, we find that his complaint as amended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>other pleadings presents sufficient facts upon which relief could be granted. Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Cooper\u2019s suit is VACATED and the case REMANDED for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1161-10\">. Cooper also alleged that the defendants denied him access to the courts by confiscating and then refusing to return his \"writing material, legal correspondence as well as all of plaintiff's property.\u201d As he does not raise this issue on appeal, he has abandoned the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1161-15\">. The amended complaint named County Commissioners Carpenter, Biggs, Solis, and Brazell as defendants. These individuals have never been served in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
