In light of the standards established by this court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Hu-guet v. Barnett, </em>900 F.2d 838 (5th Cir. 1990), and progeny, however, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-30\">Keith J. Hudson, a Louisiana state prisoner confined to Angola penitentiary invoked 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and sued corrections officers Jack McMillian, Marvin Woods, and Arthur Mezo. The parties consented to disposition of the case by a magistrate, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). The evidence reflects that on October 30, 1983 Hudson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>got into an argument with McMillian who punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomach while Woods held him. The blows cracked Hudson\u2019s partial dental plate, split his lower lip and loosened his teeth. He received bruises to his body but no other cuts. Woods kicked Hudson on his backside. Mezo, the supervisor of McMillian and Woods, watched the beating but merely cautioned the officers not to \u201chave too much fun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">Hudson appeared at sick call on October 31 and November 1, 1983 with a dental complaint; his medical record contains no reference to facial bruises or other injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">In awarding Hudson a modest judgment the magistrate credited the testimony of Hudson, rejecting that of the officers, and concluded that \u201cdefendants Woods and McMillian used force on the plaintiff when there was no need_ the force used resulted in minor bruises and swelling to the plaintiffs face, mouth and lip_ [pjlain-tiff s injuries from the beating were minor and required no medical attention.\u201d Defendants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">This court joins the magistrate in deploring the use of unnecessary force in the treatment of prisoners. Hopefully someday this blight on our criminal justice system will be forever removed. However not every use of excessive force rises to a constitutional violation cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-17\">In our recent decision in <em>Huguet v. Barnett </em>we announced the standard to be applied in excessive force claims made by prisoners under the eighth amendment. We there held that to prevail in such a claim four elements must be proven:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-18\">1. a significant injury, which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-19\">2. resulted directly and only from the use of force that was clearly excessive to the need, the exeessiveness of which was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-20\">3. objectively unreasonable, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-21\">4. the action constituted an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-10\">If any one of these elements fails, so too does the plaintiffs claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">900 F.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">In the case at bar no force was required; therefore, the force used was objectively unreasonable. The conduct of McMillian and Woods qualified as clearly excessive and occasioned unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. Hudson\u2019s claim, however, founders on the significant injury prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\"><em>Huguet </em>evolved from our en banc decision in <em>Johnson v. Morel, </em>876 F.2d 477 (5th Cir.1989), a fourth amendment excessive-force case. We there held that minor harms do not rise to constitutional proportions. In awarding recovery the magistrate characterized Hudson\u2019s injuries as \u201cminor\u201d and noted that they \u201crequired no medical attention.\u201d The injuries sustained by Hudson are not unlike those at issue in our recent decision in <em>Wise v. Carlson, </em>902 F.2d 417 (5th Cir.1990), which were held not to constitute a significant injury. In <em>Wise </em>the inmate sustained bruises to the anterior chest wall and right forearm and a hematoma to his right upper eyelid. The <em>Wise </em>case injuries were insufficient to base a section 1983 claim; Hudson\u2019s injuries are likewise insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">For these reasons the judgment is REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
