In that Court he was found guilty on trial by jury, and the following order entered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\"><em>\u201cThe People v. James JST. Gross. </em>In this cause the said James N. Cross having been found guilty in manner and form as appears by the record thereof. Therefore it is adjudged by the Court here, that the said James N. Cross is the father of the child charged by the complainant, Harriet Donaldson, in her complaint to have been begotten by him; and it is therefore ordered, on motion of S. Abel, attorney, that the said defendant James N. Cross, do pay, for the maintenance of said child, with the assistance of the mother, Harriet Donaldson, within thirty days from this date, twenty-five dollars, and the further sum of four dollars and fifty cents for each and every month thereafter, payable at the end thereof, and until the further order of this Court; and it is further ordered, on like motion, that the defendant James N. Cross give a bond to the Superintendents of the Poor of the county of Washtenaw, with good and sufficient sureties to be approved by this Court, to perform this order,, and to indemnify the county from all damages they may. sustain by reason of their becoming \u2022chargeable with the maintenance of said child; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the said defendant be committed to th% county jail, and there remain until he shall execute and deliver such bond,5\u2019 It no where appeared in the proceedings, either before the justice or in the Circuit Court, that Cross was called \u2022upon to plead or did plead to the complaint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-6\"><em>O. Hawkins, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUP\">argued that the complaint was the complaint of the father, and not of Harriet Donaldson as it should have been: \u2014 3 <em>Pick. </em>164; that the .jurat ought to show before whom the complaint was sworn to: \u2014 3 <em>Mich. </em>590; that there was no issue upon which Cross could have been tried: \u2014 6 <em>Cush. </em>111; and that the Order was void for uncertainty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-7\">\n<em>C. Upson, Attorney General,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay\">contra, to show that the complaint was sufficient, cited, 8 <em>Vt. </em>130; 24 <em>Vt. </em>517. But as this objection was not made below, it is now too late to make it: \u2014 24 <em>Vt. </em>517; 8 <em>Vt. </em>130; 7 <em>Vt. </em>419; 4 <em>Ired. </em>484; 2 <em>Ired. </em>46; 5 <em>Conn. </em>541; 4 <em>Denio, </em>93; 9 <em>Humph. </em>450.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-8\">A formal joining of issue upon the complaint is not required by the statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-9\">Campbell J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">The first error assigned is that no complaint was made by Harriet Donaldson, nor was any accusation and examina'tion taken in writing under oath of the said Harriet before the justice who assumed to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">The statute does not contemplate any complaint distinct from the \u201c accusation and examination in writing under oath.\u2019\u2019 <em>R. S. </em>1846, <em>p. </em>189. Inasmuch as the case shows no other such accusation and examination than that of Harriet Donaldson, and that contains all the necessary facts required by law to be enumerated, we do not think that the action of her father outside of and in addition to her complaint can in any way affect its validity. It \u25a0may be regarded as matter of surplusage. It preceded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>her complaint, and the latter is complete without it. The-objection that the complaint does not appear to have been sworn to before the justice is also unfounded. Where it appears in the body of the instrument to have been taken on oath before the justice, there is no force in the objection that his certificate at the foot does not also contain the words \u201cbefore me,\u2019\u2019 whether the objection would have been valid or not otherwise \u2014 a point we are not called on to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The next objection is that no issue was formed in the Circuit Court to be presented to the jury. The statute declares that \u201cthe issue to the jury shall be whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.\u201d The charge contained, in the complaint is required to give time and place, and it is evident the statute designed that this should be the-formal accusation, and the only one for any purpose. If the defendant did not admit the charge, it was to be left to the jury. There was no occasion for any formal issue therefore, as the law defined it, and a trial could not be had upon any special one. The proceedings are not designed to be in the regular form of common law prosecutions,, and a statutory issue exists whenever the defendant fails, to admit the charge <em>(see section </em>4).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">We see therefore no error in any of the proceedings whereby the verdict of the jury can be vitiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The order of maintenance, however, is not sustainable^ The statute makes it the duty of the Court upon a Verdict of guilty to make an order directing in what manner the defendant with the assistance of the mother shall stand chargeable with the maintenance of the child. The form in which the order here is \u2022 entered makes the liability to, support the child\u2019 joint throughout, and does not point out what amount the defendant shall pay himself. While it was probably designed by the Court that he should furnish the money and the mother take care of the child, yet the order can hardly be made to bear that construction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>as it stands. It must point out bis duty and liability expressly; and until that is done there is nothing to be \u2022enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The order of the Circuit Court must be quashed, and the cause must he remitted for the entry of a proper order \u2022upon the verdict. No costs will he awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
