Ch. </em>459; Saxton, 413; 2 <em>Green Ch. </em>125; 1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>447; 5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>235; 1 <em>Green Ch. </em>396; 8 <em>Barb. </em>9; 24 <em>Barb. </em>135; 3 <em>Halst.

Hall, who is a subsequent purchaser, answered, showing that the mortgagor had conveyed a part of the mortgaged premises to one Lucina Redson <em>subject to the entire mortgage, which the deed declared she was to pay, </em>and that his own purchase was made subsequently. He claimed that in decreeing a sale the Court below should require the portion of the land sold to Mrs. Redson to be first offered, and that his portion should only be resorted to in case of deficiency. The evidence shows without contradiction that a sale in this order would not prejudice complainant. The Court below declined to protect his priority, and Hall appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">There can be no doubt of the right of the defendant Hall to have this course taken. The case of. <em>Mason v. Payne, Wal. Ch. </em>461, fully settles the doctrine, which is a very familiar and reasonable one. The objection that a cross bill was necessary, is not well taken. The defendant does not seek any affirmative relief, neither does he seek to deny or destroy any right of the complainant, to whom, upon the case as presented, the order in which the parcels are sold must be a matter of .indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The decree of the Court below must be so modified as to require the sale of Hall\u2019s premises to be postponed, so that the remainder be first offered and sold. The appellant is entitled to the costs of this Court, but not of the Court below.</p>\n<judges id=\"b41-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
