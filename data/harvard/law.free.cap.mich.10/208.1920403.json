Z. \u00a71667] which does not set forth any facts or circumstances, but merely states the belief of the complainant that the person complained of basP between certain specified days, sold liquors in violation of the act, is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the justice to whom it is made to issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses to testify concerning supposed violations. And, consequently, a witness attending on such a subpoena, and refusing to testify, cannot be committed for contempt of court in so refusing.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>Heard May 14th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJq\">\n<em>Decided May 15th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-8\">Habeas Corpus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-9\">The petition set forth, that on April 26th, .1862, the following complaint was made, and filed with W. <em>W. </em>Mitchell, a Justice of the Peace of Ionia county:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-10\"><em>\u2018\u25a0'\u25a0State of </em>Michigan, <em>County of </em>Ionia, <em>ss.: </em>Alexander F. Bell, being duly sworn, says, that he is a resident of the township of Ionia, in said county, and that he verily believes that Giles B. Conkey did, at the township of Ionia aforesaid, between the fifteenth day of April, 1862, and the twenty-sixth day of April, 1862, sell intoxicating liquors, in violation of an act entitled \u201cAn Act to prevent the Manufacture and Sale of Spirituous or Intoxicating Liquors as a beverage,\u201d and that he is unable of his own knowledge to state sufficient facts and circumstances to authorize the issuing of a warrant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-11\">Alexander F.

Lothrop </em>for petitioner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aji\">to show want of jurisdiction in the justice, offered to read a certified copy of said complaint, which was objected to by counsel for the People, on the ground that it was not competent to go behind the commitment \u2014 which was claimed to be fair on its face \u2014 to inquire into the correctness of the justice\u2019s action. But the court held otherwise, and the evidence was read.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-8\"><em>A. Williams </em>and <em>D. E.

The statute (\u00a7 1667) provides that, whenever a complainant is required to state facts and circumstances for the information of the court or magistrate to whom the complaint is made, and the complainant shall be unable, of his own knowledge, to state sufficient facts and circumstances to authorize the issuing of a warrant, the court or magistrate may, after the making of such complaint, issue subpmnas for the attendance of witnesses to testify concerning such facts and circumstances. This language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>does not authorize the making of a complaint in general form, and the issuing thereupon of subpoenas to compel witnesses to testify to facts and circumstances which are not indicated by the complaint, but which may be suspected to be within the knowledge of the witnesses. The statute requires that the <em>facts and circumstances </em>shall be set forth in the conqilaint, whether the complainant can substantiate them by his oath or not. If he cannot, subpoena may be issued to compel the attendance of witnesses to testify concerning <em>such </em>facts and circumstances as are thus set forth.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b210-4\">Manning J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">dissented, holding that the prisoner had no right to set up the objection to the complaint, <em>he not </em>being a party defendant; and also that the commitment could not be impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>Prisoner discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
