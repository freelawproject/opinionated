The petition showed that, on a complaint being made before a justice of the peace under section 9 of the Prohibitory Liquor Law, petitioner was subpoenaed as a witness to lay the foundation for 2R-\u2019ocess against the person complained of; that a question was put to him which he refused to answer; whereupon the justice issued his warrant, committing him to the common jail until he should submit to answer the question, and he discharged by due course of law. The j^tition further showed that on issuing this commitment all further proceedings on the complaint- were discontinued. The complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>was the same set forth in the preceding case of <em>John Morton.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">The sheriff having returned, the commitment as his authority for detaining the petitioner in custody,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-6\"><em>G.

But he concurred in discharging Hall on the ground that the proceedings before the Justice had become discontinued, and that the commitment would not authorize an imprisonment when the prisoner could not have an opportunity to purge his contempt by answering.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">\n<em>Prisoner discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
