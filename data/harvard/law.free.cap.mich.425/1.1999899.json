Thus, we set aside the judgment of divorce, and need not reach the other issue raised by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The parties were granted a consent default judgment of divorce on April 27, 1981, by the Livingston Circuit Court. The plaintiff alleged in her sworn complaint for divorce, and testified at the pro confesso hearing on her complaint, that she had lived in Livingston County for at least ten days immediately preceding the filing of her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">A property settlement apportioning the assets and liabilities of the parties was among the several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>provisions incorporated in the divorce judgment granted by the court. Also included was a provision requiring defendant to pay $625 toward plaintiffs attorney fees. Approximately one year following entry of this default judgment, the defendant filed a motion to modify the property settlement provisions, as well as the attorney-fee provision. As an alternative to modification, the defendant requested that the entire default judgment of the divorce be set aside, alleging that the plaintiff had committed several frauds upon the court, including misrepresenting that she was a resident of Livingston County for the statutorily required ten days immediately preceding the filing of the complaint. The plaintiff eventually filed an affidavit admitting failure to comply with the ten-day county residency rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Following the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court found that it had been without jurisdiction to enter the judgment of divorce. However, the trial judge further concluded that, since the plaintiff had remarried, rather than set aside the judgment he would set aside the property settlement provisions and the award of attorney fees. In addition, the court denied the plaintiffs request for attorney fees which accrued pursuant to defendant\u2019s motion to modify. The plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint for divorce alleging fault and seeking alimony, followed by a motion for change of venue or, in the alternative, a dismissal of the proceedings. The court granted the request for dismissal and assessed attorney fees and costs totaling $6,107.38) against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">It was the refusal of the trial court to award attorney fees and the assessment of fees and costs against her that the plaintiff raised in the Court of Appeals. However, while the plaintiff did not chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>lenge the trial court\u2019s ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to enter a divorce decree, the Court of Appeals concluded that jurisdiction was the dispos-itive issue, holding that MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89 is a venue provision. Consistent therewith, they reinstated the consent default judgment of divorce and vacated the award of attorney fees and costs against plaintiff. The case was remanded to the trial court for consideration of whether attorney fees and costs incurred pursuant to defendant\u2019s motion for modification and the resulting appeal should be assessed against either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In Michigan, there is no common-law authority to grant a judgment of divorce. The jurisdiction of the circuit courts in matters of divorce is strictly statutory. <em>Yedinak v Yedinak, </em>383 Mich 409; 175 NW2d 706 (1970), <em>Flynn v Flynn, </em>367 Mich 625; 116 NW2d 907 (1962), and <em>Hatch v Hatch, </em>323 Mich 581; 36 NW2d 152 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The statute in question provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">A judgment of divorce shall not be granted by a court in this state in an action for divorce unless the complainant or defendant has resided in this state for 180 days immediately preceding the filing of the complaint <em>and the complainant or defendant has resided in the county in which the complaint is Med for 10 days immediately preceding the Ming of the complaint. </em>[1974 PA 344, MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The dispute in this case centers on the emphasized language regarding county residency. However, an examination of the state residency requirement is necessary to our analysis of the county residency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>State residency requirements, by definition, obligate a plaintiff, in order to obtain a decree of divorce, to reside a certain period of time within the state in which the divorce decree is sought. These state residency requirements have been upheld by the United States Supreme Court against the contention that they violate the United States Constitution. <em>Sosna v Iowa, </em>419 US 393; 95 S Ct 553; 42 L Ed 2d 532 (1975). Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including Michigan, have held that compliance with the statutory requirement as to the length of residency is jurisdictional and that the failure of a court to comply renders a divorce decree absolutely void.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In <em>Kennedy v Kennedy, </em>325 Mich 613, 617; 39 NW2d 67 (1949), this Court held that where there was no evidence that either of the parties to divorce actually had resided in the state for at least one year as required by the applicable statute, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to render a divorce decree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">There was no testimony on the hearing in open court to establish that either of the parties had resided in the State of Michigan for a period of 1 year. See CL 1929, \u00a7 12731, as amended by PA 1941, No 2, (CLS 1945, \u00a712731, Stat Ann 1946 Cum Supp \u00a7 25.89).[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">While the defendant withdrew his answer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>consented that the bill of complaint be taken as confessed, and consented that the plaintiff proceed at once as in a pro confesso case, still such consent does not establish jurisdiction. In <em>Bradfield v Bradfield, </em>154 Mich 115, 119 (129 Am St Rep 468) [117 NW 588 (1908)], we say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">\"It is urged that, even should the court hold that complainant was not a resident of this State within the meaning of the statute, defendant by admitting in his answer the allegation of the bill relative to her residence is precluded from raising the question. Such admission did not confer jurisdiction upon the court. If the law were otherwise, the very purpose of the statute would be defeated, and collusive and fraudulent divorces encouraged. Such holding would be against public policy. Upon this question the conclusion of the court is founded upon reason and supported by authority.\u201d (Citing <em>Smith v Smith, </em>10 ND 219 [86 NW 721 (1901)], and <em>Prettyman v Prettyman, </em>125 Ind 149 [25 NE 179 (1890)].) [325 Mich 615-616.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">See also <em>White v White, </em>242 Mich 555; 219 NW 593 (1928), <em>Bradfield v Bradfield, supra, </em>and <em>Pierson v Pierson, </em>132 Mich App 667; 347 NW2d 779 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Having reaffirmed that Michigan case law supports the conclusion that the state residency requirement of MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89 is jurisdictional, we conclude, also, that the ten-day county residency requirement set forth in the same statute also represents a jurisdictional limitation on the circuit court\u2019s power to enter a divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">This Court held in <em>Lehman v Lehman, </em>312 Mich 102, 105; 19 NW2d 502 (1945), that the county residency requirement extant at that time represented a jurisdictional limitation on the circuit court. In applying the county residency requirement which read \"[a] divorce from the bonds of matrimony may be decreed by the circuit court of the county where the parties or one [1] of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>reside . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we reversed the trial court\u2019s decree and directed the entry of a decree dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint and defendant\u2019s cross-bill, because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the decree in question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">The record clearly establishes that neither party was a resident of Chippewa county at the time the present suit was begun or when the decree was entered. <em>Wright v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>117 Mich 244 [75 NW 465 (1898)]; <em>Reed v Reed, </em>52 Mich 117 (50 Am Rep 247) [17 NW 720 (1883)]. Therefore, under section 12728 quoted above, the circuit court of that county was without jurisdiction to grant the decree in question. The jurisdiction of the court was statutory <em>(Winter v Winter, </em>276 Mich 665 [268 NW 774 (1936)]; <em>Herp v Herp, </em>254 Mich 33 [235 NW 850 (1931)]; <em>Haines v Haines, </em>35 Mich 138) [1876], and jurisdiction could not be conferred by consent of the parties. <em>Mondou v Lincoln Mutual Casualty Co, </em>283 Mich 353 [278 NW 94 (1938)]; <em>Nichols v Houghton Circuit Judge, </em>185 Mich 654 [152 NW 482] (Ann Cas 1917 D, 100) [1915]. Failure to allege residence in the county could be cured by amendment, but the fact of residence must be proved. In the case of <em>People v McCaffrey, </em>75 Mich 115, 125, 126 [42 NW 681 (1889)], we said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\"Failure to allege his residence within that particular county was not a jurisdictional defect. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\"The omission to allege it may be cured by amendment, <em>though this fact (of residence) must be made to appear in the proofs in order to give relief.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">In 3 Searl, Michigan Pleading &amp; Practice, p 333, \u00a7 1334, it is stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">\"Bills for divorce must be filed in the county where one of the parties resides.\u201d_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>See, also, <em>Titus v Chippewa Circuit Judge, </em>168 Mich 507 [134 NW 487 (1912)]. [Emphasis in original. 312 Mich 106.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The county residency rule was later at issue in <em>Beaudry v Beaudry, </em>20 Mich App 287; 174 NW2d 28 (1969), wherein the defendant appealed from the denial of his motion to dismiss the complaint for divorce on the basis of the plaintiffs inability to meet the residency requirement. The Court of Appeals reversed, pointing out that the jurisdiction in circuit courts over divorce actions is entirely statutory and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">[b]ecause the statutory jurisdiction was not established, the trial court was without jurisdiction and should have granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. <em>White v White, </em>242 Mich 555 [219 NW 593 (1928)]; <em>Lehman v Lehman, </em>312 Mich 102 [19 NW2d 502 (1945)]; and <em>Fox v Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, </em>375 Mich 238 [134 NW2d 146 (1965)]. [20 Mich App 288.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Inexplicably, despite consistent authority to the contrary, in 1977, in <em>Abadi v Abadi, </em>78 Mich App 73, 76-77; 259 NW2d 244 (1977), lv den 402 Mich 870 (1978), the Court of Appeals found the ten-day county requirement set forth in the same statute to be a venue provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">We recognize that the statute includes a primary requirement that the complainant or defendant reside in the state for 180 days immediately preceding the filing of the complaint. That requirement is intended to be jurisdictional, so as to prevent \"forum shopping\u201d by complainants who may live in states where divorces are more difficult to obtain than they are under the Michigan no-fault divorce law. See <em>Sosna v Iowa, </em>419 US 393; 95 S Ct 553; 42 L Ed 2d 532 (1975).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">However, we find the 10-day requirement with respect to the county in which the action is brought is a venue provision only. Regarding the present case, plaintiff has resided in this state since 1969; but the change in her marital status has unexpectedly disrupted her life style and prompted her to seek solace with her family outside Michigan. The 10-day residency requirement is not designed to bar persons such as plaintiff from dissolving their marital bonds in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">However, as Judge Benson noted in his dissent in <em>Stamadianos, supra, </em>the conclusion in <em>Abadi </em>regarding the county requirement was dictum because the trial judge, following a hearing on the question of plaintiff\u2019s residency, found that plaintiff had in fact satisfied the ten-day residency requirement of MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89. Thus, there was no reason for the Court of Appeals in <em>Abadi </em>to determine whether or not the ten-day county requirement was a venue or a jurisdictional provi-sion_</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Nevertheless it was the <em>Abadi </em>dictum, stating that the ten-day residency requirement was a venue provision, that the Court of Appeals panel in the instant case followed. In addition, while acknowledging the holding in <em>Lehman </em>that the county residency requirement was jurisdictional, the Court of Appeals distinguished <em>Lehman </em>from this case on the basis of the fact that <em>Lehman </em>involved a different statute than the one presently in question,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that when <em>Lehman </em>was decided, \"the Michigan Legislature had not yet embraced the modern concept of venue as subsequently set forth in Chapter 16 of the Revised Judicature Act . . . .\u201d <em>Stamadianos, supra, </em>435-436.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">While it is true that the <em>Lehman </em>case involved a different statute, we also believe that the existing county requirement at the time of <em>Lehman </em>(1929 CL 12728) was no more positive in its command that the county residency requirement he implemented as a jurisdictional limitation on the circuit court than the current language in MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89 and, thus, does not compel disparate application.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Regarding the Court of Appeals conclusion that <em>Lehman </em>need not be followed because it was decided prior to the modern concept of venue embraced in Chapter 16 of the 1961 Revised Judicature Act, we do not agree that the Legislature intended the venue provisions of Chapter 16 of the Revised Judicature Act to supersede the jurisdictional county provision set forth in MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We believe that the history of MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89 evidences a legislative intent that the ten-day county residency requirement be jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tional. Prior to the 1948 codification of the Michigan statutes, this Court construed a precursor to 1974 PA 344, MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89 as being jurisdictional. <em>Lehman, supra. </em>(1929 CL 12728.) In 1961, Chapter 16 of the Revised Judicature Act was enacted. This act provided that the venue provisions of Chapter 16 were not jurisdictional. MCL 600.1601; MSA 27A.1601. However, there is nothing in Chapter 16 of the Revised Judicature Act addressing venue that in any way affects or influences MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court believes that if the Legislature had intended to abrogate the rule of <em>Lehman </em>by codifying the venue provisions in the Revised Judicature Act, it would have included a provision in the Revised Judicature Act addressing venue in divorce cases. However, this it did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Furthermore, following the enactment of the Revised Judicature Act in 1961, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed <em>Lehman </em>in <em>Beaudry, supra. </em>And, subsequently, when the Legislature amended MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89 in 1974 PA 344, they did so with language similar to that used in the provision in effect at the time of <em>Beaudry </em>and kept this provision in that section of the compiled laws concerning divorce and not in the venue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>provisions of the Revised Judicature Act. In analyzing the pattern of legislative and judicial action related to MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89, we can only conclude that the 1974 Legislature knew that the courts had not interpreted the venue chapter of the Revised Judicature Act as affecting prior holdings that the ten-day county residency requirement was jurisdictional. <em>Beaudry, </em>citing <em>Lehman. </em>On two occasions the Legislature, in promulgating Chapter 16 of the 1961 Revised Judicature Act (following the 1945 <em>Lehman </em>holding), and later in enacting 1974 PA 344 (following the 1969 <em>Beaudry </em>decision), did not act to change judicial interpretation of the statutory county residency provision. Thus, this Court believes that legislative silence can only be interpreted as consent to the judiciary\u2019s position that the ten-day county residency requirement of MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89 is a jurisdictional and not a venue provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Finally, the specific language of the statute, coupled with the legislative and judicial history of the county residency requirement, further convinces this Court that the county residency requirement is a jurisdictional provision. But for the number of days needed to satisfy the requisite residency requirements, one requiring a period of 180 days within the state, and one requiring a period of ten days within the county, the language of the two residency requirements are identical. Moreover, the plain language of the statute indicates similar application by the use of the word \"and\u201d between the state and county residency requirements. Also, we note that nowhere in the statute is the term venue used. Consequently, a clear reading of the statute evidences no basis for the county requirement to be applied differently than the state residency requirement. This Court believes, because of the substantially similar lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>guage used addressing both the state and county residency requirements, that the Legislature intended the provisions to be applied similarly. Further, because the 180-day state residency requirement has been consistently determined to be jurisdictional,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the specific language of the statute dictates that the ten-day county residency requirement must also be jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision holding that the county residency requirement is a venue provision. The plaintiff\u2019s judgment of divorce is set aside and her appeal as to attorney fees, assessments, and costs thus need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-7\">Williams, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\"> On order of the Court, the certification by the Court of Appeals pursuant to Administrative Order No. 1984-2 that its decision in the instant case is in conflict with its decision in <em>Beaudry v Beaudry, </em>20 Mich App 287; 174 NW2d 28 (1969), and the pleadings filed by the parties are considered.

Some courts have reasoned that if both parties submitted to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and neither party raised a residency issue, they are later barred from challenging the divorce on those grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">There may be a subjective element to satisfying the ten-day county residency requirement which frequently will be difficult to satisfy. In many, perhaps most cases, when a spouse moves out of the marital home, that spouse might not relocate in a county in which there is an intention to make a new permanent home. It is a transitory time in a person\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The Court of Appeals ruled that the county residency requirement was a venue provision, not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the filing of a complaint for divorce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In seeking legislative intent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the Court commented that living arrangements after a decision to discontinue living together are often temporary. The Court observed that voiding an otherwise valid decree of divorce on the basis adopted in the opinion of this Court could cast a cloud of uncertainty over such decrees and \"constitutes too powerful a weapon to place in the hands of disgruntled former spouses . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_\">Because there has not been the requisite advocacy in this Court to decide a question of this importance, leave was improvidently granted and the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"Av\">Archer, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-12\"> MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"> Eugenia initially stated that she had lived in Livingston County for the requisite ten days immediately preceding the filing of her complaint. She subsequently said that she failed to comply with the ten-day county residency provision because \"she never intended to make Livingston County her permanent home and had not understood the necessity of such intent in establishing legal residency.\u201d 133 Mich App 430, 433; 350 NW2d 268 (1984). The subjective aspect of residency might be a judicial gloss.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Neither party is arguing that the ten-day county residency provision is a venue provision. Thomas has not filed a brief in this Court. Initially, Eugenia sought the divorce and obtained a consent default judgment in Livingston Circuit Court on April 27, 1981. The Stamadi-anoses had resided in Washtenaw County, but Eugenia commenced the action in Livingston County at the request of Thomas who wished to avoid shame in the Ann Arbor Greek community. Almost a year later, Thomas filed a motion to modify the property settlement and attorney-fee provision or, in the alternative, to set aside the default judgment on the basis that Eugenia had committed fraud on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Eugenia filed, on June 30, 1982, an amended answer to Thomas\u2019 motion to modify the judgment of divorce and consented to the alternative relief sought, namely that the entire judgment of divorce be set aside. Thomas then changed his position and opposed setting aside the divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\"> See <em>Gunn v Gunn, </em>205 Mich 198, 200; 171 NW 371 (1919).

In <em>Abadi, </em>the Court of Appeals construed the residency requirement of 180 days in the state (MCL 552.9; MSA 25.89) to be jurisdictional (to prevent \"forum shopping\u201d), but found the ten-day county requirement to be a venue provision only. The Court was apparently sympathetic to the plight of the woman who left her marital home in Wayne County on October 4, 1973, to return to her family in Virginia, then returned and checked into a Holiday Inn in Oakland County on October 8, 1973. She did not wish to return home because of fear of her husband. The complaint was filed on October 19, 1973, and she returned to Virginia on October 20, 1973. The trial judge held a hearing on the residency question and resolved the issue in her favor. The opinion of this Court states that the language with respect to the county provision is dictum since Mrs. Abadi had satisfied the ten-day requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\"><em>Beaudry v Beaudry, </em>20 Mich App 287; 174 NW2d 28 (1969), is said to be in conflict with <em>Abadi </em>and <em>Stamadianos. Beaudry </em>was an appeal from a denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint for divorce. Apparently, in contrast with the instant case and <em>Abadi, </em>there was no <em>decree of divorce </em>that would be set aside if the court was found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>lack jurisdiction. The plaintiff in <em>Beaudry </em>commenced residency in Oakland County on June 22, 1968, and ten days later filed her complaint for divorce on July 1, 1968. Because the ten-day period is computed excluding the first day, the ten-day county requirement was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The other case said to be in conflict is the pre-no-fault divorce case of <em>Lehman v Lehman, supra, </em>where this Court said that the county residency requirement was jurisdictional. The statute at that time provided: \"A divorce from the bonds of matrimony may be decreed by the circuit court of the county where the parties or one of them reside.\u201d There was no durational requirement. The Court held, because neither party resided in the county in which the divorce was sought but were just \"visiting parents,\u201d that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to grant the divorce decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\"> 133 Mich App 435.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
