Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 51. In addition, as this Court stated in <em>In re Brewster St Housing Site, </em>291 Mich 313, 333; 289 NW 493 (1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">In passing upon the constitutionality of State legislation, it is necessary to point out in the Constitution of the State the limitation which has been placed by the people through the Constitution upon the power of the legislature to act, before it may be declared unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Therefore, the county jail overcrowding act must be found to be constitutional unless a specific limitation, contained in the constitution itself, restricts legislative power in this area. I find such a limitation is clearly mandated by the specific grant of power over commutations given by the people to the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 14 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">The governor shall have power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons after convictions for all offenses, except cases of impeachment, upon such conditions and limitations as he may direct, subject to procedures and regulations prescribed by law. He shall inform the legislature annually of each reprieve, commutation and pardon granted, stating reasons therefor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">This power is granted solely to the Governor. There is no provision granting like power to either the legislative or the judicial branch of government. As we stated in <em>Rich v Chamberlain, </em>104 Mich 436, 446; 62 NW 584 (1895), such \"power is vested exclusively in the Governor of the State, and any law which restricted this power would be unconstitutional and void.\u201d In the same case we also reiterated the reasoning behind the exclusivity of the Governor\u2019s commutation power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">It is therefore of the highest importance to the public that this power should be carefully exercised, and that the fullest responsibility should rest upon the person to whom it is confided. The office of Governor seems to be generally considered the proper one with which to lodge such responsibility, and the public have the right to insist upon his performance of the duty. Not only is it beyond the power of the Legislature to impose the duty upon others, but it should not in any way lessen his responsibility to the public, when he sets aside the judgment of court and jury by opening the doors of a prison to a convicted felon. If the act in question does this, it should not be sustained. <em>[Id., </em>p 442.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">We also recognized the exclusivity of this power in <em>People v Fox, </em>312 Mich 577; 20 NW2d 732 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>(1945), and <em>People v Whalen, </em>412 Mich 166, 169; 312 NW2d 638 (1981), where we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-4\">a trial court is without authority to set aside a valid sentence and impose a new one, because to do so \"would infringe upon the exclusive power of the governor under the Constitution to commute sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 45 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">The legislature may provide for indeterminate sentences as punishment for crime and for the detention and release of persons imprisoned or detained under such sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">It was only on the basis of this specific grant of power that we found that the prison overcrowding act, MCL 800.71; MSA 28.1437(1), was constitutionally permissible, even though application of the act could result in a reduction of the length of indeterminate sentences. <em>Oakland Co Prosecutor v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>411 Mich 183; 305 NW2d 515 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Jail sentences, as my colleagues agree, are not indeterminate \u2014 they are for a fixed and determinate amount of time. Therefore, the grant of power over indeterminate sentences may not properly be applied to find that the Legislature has not unconstitutionally infringed on the Governor\u2019s commutation power in adopting the county jail overcrowding act.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">In <em>People v Freleigh, </em>334 Mich 306; 54 NW2d 599 (1952), this Court determined that determinate sentences which were imposed as on the basis of an earlier mandatory sentencing statute could not constitutionally be reduced by the Legislature\u2019s adoption of a later indeterminate sentencing provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>sion. As we clarified in <em>Oakland Co Prosecutor, supra, </em>p 196:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">The statute considered in <em>Freleigh, </em>unlike 1980 PA 519, did not provide for . . . release of persons imprisoned or detained under <em>indeterminate </em>sentences (emphasis supplied) since, as the Court there observed, the statute had \"retroactive effect upon sentences which were <em>mandatory. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Thus, we have determined that commutative power over determinate sentences is not within the specific powers granted to the Legislature. It follows that the county jail overcrowding act is unconstitutional if it operates to commute determinate sentences. I find that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Commutation has been defined as \"the change of a punishment to one which is less severe.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 254. Although my colleagues maintain that a commutation must be an act of individualized clemency, citing for the proposition a concurrence in a California case, <em>Way v San Diego Co Superior Court, </em>74 Cal App 3d 165, 177; 141 Cal Rptr 383 (1977), the majority in that case clearly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">Amicus curiae suggests that commutation and pardon are not the equivalent of amnesty and that accordingly even if the Legislature does not have the power to grant individual commutations, the legislation must be upheld as an amnesty or general pardon of current isl prisoners. Such a distinction has deep historical roots. However, it has been firmly rejected by the federal courts, and we are unaware of any state court decision adopting it. Amnesty is nothing more than collective pardon, and the distinction between the two is without legal significance; only the Governor can grant general amnesty, as only he can pardon or commute. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The United States Supreme Court also noted the trivial distinction between individualized and general clemency in <em>Brown v Walker, </em>161 US 591, 601; 16 S Ct 644; 40 L Ed 819 (1896).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">The distinction between amnesty and pardon is of no practical importance. It is said in <em>Knote v United States, 95 </em>US 149, 152 [24 L Ed 442 (1877)], \"the Constitution does not use the word 'amnesty,\u2019 and, except that the term is generally applied where pardon is extended to whole classes or communities, instead of individuals, the distinction between them is one rather of philological interest than of legal importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In addition, it cannot be said that the process mandated by the county jail overcrowding act does not involve individualized clemency. Pursuant to \u00a7 6, the chief circuit judge for the county is required to review the name of each prisoner, the offense for which the prisoner was convicted, the length of the individual\u2019s sentence, the date on which the prisoner began serving the sentence, the release date, and the name of the sentencing judge. The judge then makes an individual determination for each prisoner as to whether or not the sentence should be reduced, based on an assessment of the risk involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Clearly, the sentences of the prisoners who benefit from an application of the county jail overcrowding act are reduced from the time specified by the sentencing judge. This, in my estimation, is a commutation in every sense of the word. As we have previously determined that the Governor\u2019s power of commutation is exclusive and because there is no constitutional grant of power to the Legislature over determinate sentences, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>find that the county jail overcrowding act is unconstitutional.</p>\n<judges id=\"b821-5\">Brickley and Riley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b821-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaY\">The county jail overcrowding act, 1982 PA 325,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizes a county sheriff to declare a jail overcrowding state of emergency, and sets forth a multistep procedure for reducing the prisoner population of county jails when a state of emergency has been declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The question presented is whether Act 325 unconstitutionally contravenes the Governor\u2019s commutation power under Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 14. We conclude that it does not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Act 325 provides that a sheriff shall declare a jail overcrowding state of emergency if the general prisoner population of a county jail exceeds one hundred percent of the jail\u2019s rated design capacity for seven consecutive days, unless within three business days a majority of the chief circuit judge, chief district judge, and each municipal judge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the county and certain county officials, find that the sheriff acted in error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">If the judges and the sheriff are unable by other means<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to reduce the prison population to ninety percent of rated design capacity within fourteen days after the declaration of the state of emergency, the sheriff shall present to the chief circuit judge certain information concerning each prisoner residing in the county jail at that time. The chief circuit judge is required to classify the prisoners into two groups: high-risk and non-high-risk individuals. The chief circuit judge also must determine a minimum and maximum percentage by which the sentences can be reduced. The sheriff must then reduce the sentences of all prisoners who would not present a high risk to the public safety, if released, by an equal percentage which is within the minimum and maximum percentages determined by the chief circuit judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">If these actions do not reduce the jail\u2019s population to ninety percent of rated design capacity within twenty-eight days after the declaration of the state of emergency, the original sentences, not including good time, of all prisoners sentenced to and housed in the jail on that date shall be equally reduced by the sheriff by the least possible percentage necessary, not to exceed thirty percent, to reduce the jail\u2019s population to ninety percent of the rated design capacity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The pertinent sentence reduction provisions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are modeled on the sections in the Prison Overcrowd<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ing Emergency Powers Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that authorize reduction in the minimum sentence of prisoners in state prisons by the Director of the Department of Corrections upon a declaration of emergency not found to be erroneous by the Governor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These provisions were challenged in <em>Oakland Co Prosecutor v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>411 Mich 183, 195; 305 NW2d 515 (1981), as violative of the constitutional authority of the Governor to commute sentences. The constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">The governor shall have power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons after convictions for all offenses, except cases of impeachment, upon such conditions and limitations as he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>direct, subject to procedures and regulations prescribed by law. He shall inform the legislature annually of each reprieve, commutation and pardon granted, stating reasons therefor. [Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">This Court ruled that the prison overcrowding act was constitutional. The opinion of the Court relied in part on Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 45, which empowers the Legislature to \"provide for indeterminate sentences as punishment for crime and for the detention and release of persons imprisoned or detained under such sentence.\u201d This Court said that \"[although the retroactive reduction of minimum sentences because of prison overcrowding has consequences similar to commutation, it derives from a wholly separate constitutional grant of power. The legislation was within the constitutional grant of authority to the Legislature in art 4, \u00a7 45 to 'provide for . . . release of persons imprisoned or detained under such sentences.\u2019 \u201d 411 Mich 197. The act was found to be within this authority granted the Legislature, and thus constitutional, <em>\"regardless of whether the release of prisoners under the statute is properly characterized as a commutation \u201d Id. </em>at 195. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">It is contended that the jail overcrowding act cannot be sustained on the basis of art 4, \u00a745 because sentences to a county jail \u2014 which cannot exceed one year \u2014 are generally fixed or determinate rather than indeterminate sentences.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The argument that one year or less sentences to the county jail are fixed or determinate and thus not within the scope of art 4, \u00a7 45 ignores that all sentences to a county jail imposed after February 8, 1983 \u2014 the effective date of Act 325 \u2014 are subject to the provisions of Act 325. While such sentences are generally fixed or determinate, one year or less sentences imposed after February 8, 1983, are indeterminate to the extent that the Legislature has empowered the sheriff and the judges to reduce the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The power conferred by Act 325 on the sheriff or judges to reduce a sentence, and thus the time of confinement, is essentially the same kind of power conferred on the parole board. A sentence to six months or one year in the county jail is fixed or determinate to the extent that a definite time is stated, i.e., six months or one year, but is indeterminate insofar as the act empowers the sheriff or judges to reduce the sentence. Although ordinarily an indeterminate sentence has a minimum term stated by the judge at the time of sentencing, and a maximum term set by the judge or the Legislature, an indeterminate sentence may be for a definite or fixed term at the time of sentencing with a power in a parole board or sheriff or judges to set, at some future time, a lower minimum time of confinement._</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>In <em>People v Freleigh, </em>334 Mich 306; 54 NW2d 599 (1952), this Court held unconstitutional legislation that empowered a judge to establish retroactively a lower sentence than had been initially imposed. <em>Freleigh </em>said that the Legislature cannot empower a judge to change a sentence imposed before the legislation was enacted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is, however, nothing in <em>Freleigh, </em>or any other case decided by this Court since the indeterminate sentencing provision was added to the 1850 Constitution in 1901,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that bars the Legislature from empowering a judge or other governmental authority to change a sentence or establish a lower minimum sentence at some time after the sentence is first imposed if legislation empowering the judge or other governmental authority to do so is enacted and becomes effective before the sentence is initially imposed. Where a sentence is imposed after the enactment of legislation conferring the power to change a sentence \u2014 here, after February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>8, 1983 \u2014 the situation posed in <em>Freleigh </em>is not confronted.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The sheriff contends that to shorten a sentence is, in effect, to commute that sentence, and that the Governor has exclusive authority to commute a sentence. Not every shortening of a sentence is a commutation. Reprieve, pardon, and commutation are acts of individualized clemency.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The statutory requirements for commutation include (i) application, (ii) notice to the Governor, prosecuting attorney of the county having original jurisdiction of the case, and the sentencing judge, (iii) an opportunity for them to object, (iv) public hearing, and (v) full investigation by the parole board.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The reduction of a number of sentences pursuant to Act 325 has consequential similarities to commutation, but results from exercise of a wholly different kind of governmental power.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">The constitution provides: \"The legislative power of the State of Michigan is vested in a senate and a house of representatives.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Legislature thus has the power to designate the grade of, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>prescribe penalties for, criminal offenses,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the power to determine the length of imprisonment for a felony,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and to alter established rules of criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Act 325 provides for the early release from service of a sentence on the basis of generalized criteria not designed to reduce the length of time served by a particular offender or class of offender. The potential for a reduction of sentence pursuant to a declaration of emergency does not involve the factors that a judge would consider in sentencing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A reduction depends primarily on the occurrence of a greater than one hundred percent rated design capacity in the jail for a set period of time. There is individual review only insofar as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>sheriff presents to the chief circuit judge for the county in which the jail is located factual information about the prisoner including his name, offense, length of sentence, and scheduled release date (taking into account reduction for good time).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The chief circuit judge, having reviewed the information, classifies the prisoners into two groups \u2014 those who, if released, would present a high risk to the public safety, and those who would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The criterion for this determination \u2014 essentially the offense committed<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u2014 differs from the multiple factors that a judge might consider in imposing a sentence. The Sentencing Guidelines Manual provides sentencing grids and offense variables that include the use of a weapon, physical attack or injury, the offender\u2019s role, and whether there were multiple victims and prior felony or misdemeanor convictions. The sentence grid also takes into consideration mitigating variables such as provocation or mistake. The absence of such criteria for determining who would be released early, pursuant to Act 325, means that it is not contemplated that there will be individualizing in the release decision as is done in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">A number of statutes that provide for a reduction of determinate sentences on the basis of non-sentencing criteria have not been thought to violate the Governor\u2019s commutation power.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>time acts provide for a mandatory reduction in the county jail sentence of five days for each month of the sentence for every prisoner whose record shows no violation of the rules and regulations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Pursuant to the day parole statute, a county jail prisoner may receive, if approved by the court, a reduction of one-fourth of his term if his conduct, diligence, and general attitude merit such reduction.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A fixed deduction of three days per month from the sentence of county prisoners is authorized for obedience to the rules of a work farm, factory, or shop.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 14 empowering the Governor to grant commutations, reprieves, and pardons, does not state that such power is exclusive.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>provision stating that the powers of government are divided among three branches of government does not bar overlapping in the exercise of power by the several branches.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The principle of separation of powers precludes one branch of government from exercising <em>all </em>the powers of a coordinate branch.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The constitution empowers the Legislature to enact a law unless it has been prohibited. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>declaring a statute unconstitutional, a court must be able to \"lay [its] finger on the part of the Constitution violated, and . . . the infraction should be clear, and free from a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Bowerman v Sheehan, </em>242 Mich 95; 219 NW 69 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The decisions of this Court do not support the claim that the Governor\u2019s power to commute is so far \"exclusive\u201d that the other branches of government may not act with respect to a sentence. Nor do the decisions of this Court support the contention that the commutation power is infringed by legislation designed to relieve overcrowded jails.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In the cases relied on to support the decision of the Court of Appeals, the challenged judicial action was with respect to a particular person rather than an enactment that applied generally to a group of persons.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>People v Brown, </em>54 Mich 15; 19 NW 571 (1884), illustrates the degree of individualization in these cases. The question was whether a judge was empowered to in effect pardon a particular defendant in response to a petition signed by thirty-five prominent citizens of the city seeking an \"entire and absolute remission of all penalty and excusing of all guilt\u201d by indefinitely suspending the sentence. In <em>People v Fox, </em>312 Mich 577; 20 NW2d 732 (1945), the judge modified the original sentence of life imprisonment to fifteen to twenty years, stating that the sentence seemed too severe once he became aware of the good character of the defendant and all the facts and circumstances.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In <em>People v Whalen, </em>412 Mich 166; 312 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>NW2d 638 (1981), the judge vacated a valid sentence because of unkept promises made to the defendant by fbi agents. <em>Freleigh </em>is similarly distinguishable; the habitual offender act required the judge to render an individualized decision and authorized him to change the sentence of a particular habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The general provisions of the jail overcrowding act are not applied through the judiciary on an individualized basis. No new sentence is pronounced. Any general mercy arising from the exercise of the power conferred by the act is simply incidental to the primary goal of relieving county jail overcrowding, a goal clearly within the plenary power of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The constitution confers on the Legislature the duty to regulate the public health and general welfare of the people of the state. The constitution contemplates that the Legislature will \"pass suitable laws for the protection and promotion of the public health.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Legislature may also enact \"emergency statutes\u201d designed to promote the \"health, morality, comfort and peace of the people of the State\u201d as an incident of the legislative power, sometimes referred to as the police power.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Act 325 is an enactment in furtherance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>public health of the state\u2019s jail population.

The California court initially said that the legislature was not empowered to commute prison sentences and that the act had the effect of commutation in certain cases. The court concluded, however, that there was not such an invasion of the executive power as to make the retroactive feature of the act unconstitutional, primarily because the shortening of prison terms was incidental to the main legislative purpose: \"We note that the motivation behind [the act] is not consistent with commutation. The Legislature\u2019s objective, admittedly one within its power, is to restructure punishments for criminal conduct and to make them uniform to the extent reasonably possible. ...

The provision was invalid in two respects: (1) the potential for arbitrary exercise of the authority by the board, e.g., by imposition of conditions to parole, and (2) infringement of the Governor\u2019s \"absolute\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 251-252) power to pardon which \"belongs to [him] alone\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 255) if the parole became a full release.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">After <em>Cummings, </em>the Legislature submitted to the people an amendment to the 1850 Constitution which was adopted.

In <em>State v Morris, </em>55 Ohio St 2d 101; 378 NE2d 708 (1978), the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a new controlled substances act that required the trial court to review previously imposed sentences and allowed for reduction or alteration of such sentences did not unconstitutionally infringe the governor\u2019s pardoning power. The legislation was seen as in effect granting a general pardon, but was found to be within the plenary power of the legislature to prescribe penalties for crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Contra <em>People v Herrera, </em>183 Colo 155; 516 P2d 626 (1973), where the Supreme Court of Colorado struck down a statute that authorized postconviction review of sentences and retroactive application of changed legal standards on the ground it infringed on the governor\u2019s exclusive power to grant commutations. In <em>State ex rel Pettit v Thurmond, </em>516 SW2d 119 (Tex, 1974), the Texas Supreme Court held that a statute that permitted persons convicted of possession of marijuana to be sentenced as misdemeanants if the conviction was pending on appeal on the effective date of the statute making the crime a misdemeanor (instead of a felony) was unconstitutional as it amounted to a commutation of sentence which is exclusively a prerogative of the governor. The court noted that \"[a]s this statute concerns a matter peculiarly within the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeals, we feel constrained to follow its decision\u201d and invalidated the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Also, compare <em>Bossie v Maine, </em>488 A2d 477, 479-480 (Me, 1985), where the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held unconstitutional a statute increasing \"good time\u201d reductions available to prisoners committed to custody before its effective date because it acted to commute \"the lengths of existing sentences\u201d and <em>Gilbert v Maine, </em>505 A2d 1326 (Me, 1986), in which the Court found unconstitutional the application of the discharge provision which was added many years subsequent to Gilbert\u2019s sentence to life imprisonment without parole. The provision vested the parole board with discretionary authority to provide a person sentenced to life imprisonment with <em>full discharge </em>after ten years of parole. Other amendments providing that such a person was <em>eligible for parole </em>after completion of a fifteen-year minimum term were held to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">In New Jersey, remedial measures to relieve a prison overcrowding state of emergency taken by the governor were challenged as viola-tive of the separation of powers. Pursuant to his emergency powers under the civil defense and disaster control act, the governor had issued an executive order which authorized the commissioner of corrections to direct that state prisoners be housed in county correctional facilities and to redistribute prisoners among the counties. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>New Jersey Supreme Court held the action was constitutional against a challenge that it was in derogation of the authority of the Legislature. <em>Worthington v Fauver, </em>88 NJ 183; 440 A2d 1128 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b838-12\"> See n 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b838-13\"> MCL 801.64; MSA 28.1748(14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b838-14\"> <em>Oakland Co Prosecutor, supra, </em>at 193.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
