First, is the notice provision of Michigan\u2019s labor mediation act preempted by the National Labor Relations Act? Second, if state law is preempted, and this Court is precluded from fashioning a remedy based on state labor law, what effect does preemption have on the parties\u2019 dispute concerning payment of unemployment compensation? We find that since the notice provision of the labor mediation act is preempted, this preemption prohibits the construction of the Employment Security Act to permit payment of compensation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">The dispute between the parties is whether some sixty employees were disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits from the Michigan Employment Security Commission from July 31, 1974, through August 22, 1974. The employers contested payment of benefits, charging that the claimants were involved in a labor dispute and therefore disqualified from receiving the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Plaintiff, the Metropolitan Detroit Plumbing &amp; Mechanical Contractors Association, represents some sixteen employers in the business of plumbing and mechanical contracting in metropolitan Detroit. The association negotiates for its members in collective bargaining with members of Local Union 636 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefit-ting Industry of the United States and Canada, afl-cio. The union is the collective bargaining agent for the employees. The association itself employed none of the employees involved in this case, rather it was the association members who were the employers. The association and the union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>began negotiations for a new contract in March, 1974. In a letter dated March 19, 1974, the union notified the association of its intent to terminate the expiring 1972-74 contract on May 31, 1974, and of the changes the union desired in the contract terms. In addition, the union stated: \"It is also the purpose of this letter to serve written notice of proposed modification, in accordance with the provisions of the Taft Hartley Act.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The union also sent letters to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and to the State of Michigan Labor Mediation Board on March 19, 1974, to notify officials that the contract would terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The parties were still negotiating when the contract expired on May 31, 1974. They agreed that the previous contract would remain in effect on a day-to-day basis while negotiations continued. On July 1, 1974, two employers, the Lome Company and the Donald Miller Company, reported to the association that union members were walking off job sites. At a special board of directors meeting called for July 1, the association\u2019s board adopted a resolution giving the association\u2019s negotiating committee the power to execute \"in behalf of the association any action required including a lockout, to cope with Pipefitters Local 636 during current negotiations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Later in July, the same two employers reported that they were subject to \"selective strike action\u201d and that their work was subject to slow-downs. The Donald Miller Company reported that it was unable to get tradesmen to report to a job site, despite the request the company made to the union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b505-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The employers\u2019 association was of the opinion that the union had engaged in strikes against its two members; so the association called a lockout, as authorized in its constitution and in the power of attorney executed by each member. According to the power of attorney, a strike against one association member is a strike against all.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">About July 31, 1974, the association\u2019s lockout of the union members occurred. Each of the union members involved in this case reported to work until his employer notified him on the job on July 31, 1974, that he was laid off or that his employment was terminated. There was work remaining for each union member when he became unemployed. Following the association action, the union picketed the plants and job sites of the association members. None of the union claimants in this appeal was an employee of the Lome Company or the Donald Miller Company, the employers who alleged concerted labor activity against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">A new tentative agreement between the union and the association was reached on August 21, 1974. Most of the claimants involved in this appeal were recalled to work by their respective employers between August 22 and August 26, 1974. The locked-out employees applied to the Employment Security Commission for unemployment compensation benefits, but their applications were denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The union appealed to a hearing referee who upheld the commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained the referee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>decision, as well as the board of review\u2019s decision (by a vote of two to one) to reverse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\">The referee held, under the above facts, that the unemployment of the claimants was the result of a labor dispute in which the claimants were directly involved, so that they fell within the disqualification provisions of the Employment Security Act, MCL 421.29(8)(a)(ii); MSA 17.531(8)(a)(ii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">On appeal from the referee\u2019s decision, the board of review reversed. After noting that the statute was enacted to protect those who are involuntarily unemployed, who are capable of working but are prevented from doing so by others, the board considered the effect of a lockout on this statutory purpose. The board held that, in Michigan, an employer seeking to avoid payment of unemployment benefits on the basis of a labor dispute must prove that the employee is disqualified. The board also held that \"a lockout situation is not automatically entitled to a designation as a labor dispute in active progress.\u201d In the case at bar, the board concluded that the claimants were unemployed solely because the members of the employers\u2019 association who were not experiencing strike activity honored their internal agreement to lock out the union because the union had \"walked out\u201d on two other employers. Thus, the claimants were entitled to compensation. <em>[Metropolitan Detroit Plumbing Ass\u2019n v Employment Security Comm, </em>113 Mich App 439, 442-443; 317 NW2d 649 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The Whyne Circuit Court affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In the Court of Appeals, the parties continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>litigate the issue whether the employees were disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits under MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8) by reason of direct involvement in a labor dispute. See <em>Smith v Employment Security Comm, </em>410 Mich 231; 301 NW2d 285 (1981).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court explained that, under <em>Smith, </em>the affected employees could fall within the \"labor dispute\u201d disqualification of MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8). It stated that \"[t]he individual claimants were directly involved in the 'labor dispute\u2019 by reason of the fact that they were subjects of the lockout at their own place of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The Court nevertheless concluded that the affected employees were eligible for benefits. It explained that a failure to observe a statutory notice provision rendered the lockout unlawful, and stated further: \"We cannot allow plaintiff to benefit from such wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">It appears from the foregoing that the claimants are ineligible for unemployment benefits under the rationale of <em>Smith. </em>There is, however, an important factor distinguishing the instant case. As claimants point out, the lockout went into effect with less than one day\u2019s notice to the claimants. This was a violation of MCL 423.9; MSA 17.454(9), which requires a minimum of ten days notice before instituting a lockout. MCL 423.22; MSA 17.454(23) specifically provides that institution of a lockout without provision of the requisite notice is unlawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Under <em>Smith, </em>a lockout is clearly a disqualifying \"labor dispute\u201d when used as a bargaining tactic to gain a concession from employees. When legitimately instituted with proper advance notice, the lockout gives employees a choice within the bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>gaining process. They may choose [1] to yield to the employer\u2019s demands, [2] to offer some concession in hope of avoiding the lockout, or [3] to accept the condition of unemployment where the employee finds the first two alternatives unacceptable. In this sense, an employee who is unemployed as a result of a lockout is \"voluntarily\u201d unemployed. He has chosen his course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">Because the lockout in the instant case was instituted without the requisite notice, or any meaningful notice, the employees were precluded from making a choice among the three alternatives discussed. Thus, the employees in the instant case were involuntarily unemployed. As such, they are entitled to unemployment compensation since they fall within the purpose of the Employment Security Act to provide for the involuntarily unemployed. They are not disqualified by reason of their involvement in the lockout because the lockout was not legitimately instituted as contemplated by the Legislature. Put another way, the disqualification of MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8) applies to a situation where a lockout has been properly instituted, but in the instant case the lockout was instituted in a manner forbidden by the Legislature. We cannot allow plaintiff to benefit from such wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">Our conclusion is supported by the discussion in <em>Smith </em>which indicates that if the lockout therein had been instituted for the purpose of avoiding the payment of unemployment benefits during an impending layoff, the lockout would not be considered a manifestation of a labor dispute. See <em>Smith, supra, </em>266-267.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the decision of the trial court that the claimants are not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits is affirmed. <em>[Metropolitan Plumbing, supra, </em>pp 444-446.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The association then moved in the Court of Appeals for a rehearing. It argued that <em>UAW-CIO v O\u2019Brien, </em>339 US 454; 70 S Ct 781; 94 L Ed 978 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>(1950), had already held that MCL 423.9; MSA 17.454(9) was preempted by federal labor law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals denied rehearing without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The association applied to this Court for leave to appeal. To obtain a Court of Appeals evaluation of the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>preemption issue, we remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on rehearing granted. 417 Mich 869 (1983). The Court of Appeals responded with an order reaffirming its earlier decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">This Court having reviewed the entire matter on briefs submitted and thereafter, having concluded that its original position as set forth in the February 18, 1982, opinion fairly covers the issues and clearly sets forth our position therein, now, therefore, upon reconsideration, or as on rehearing granted, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in the manner as set forth in our February 18, 1982, opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The association again applied for leave to appeal to this Court, and we again remanded this case to the Court of Appeals to obtain that Court\u2019s evaluation of the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>preemption issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">Pursuant to GCR 1963, 853.2(4), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, the case is remanded on September 21, 1983, to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration whether the notice requirements of MCL 423.9; MSA 17.454(9) are preempted by the notice provisions of the National Labor Relations Act for purposes of determining eligibility for state unemployment compensation. [UAW-]CTO <em>v O\u2019Brien, </em>339 US 454; 70 S Ct 781; 94 L Ed 978 (1950). _</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The Court of Appeals then issued a second order adhering to its earlier opinion. It relied on three cases, including <em>New York Telephone Co v New York Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>440 US 519; 99 S Ct 1328; 59 L Ed 2d 553 (1979), for the proposition that \"states are free to fashion their own criteria for unemployment compensation eligibility\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">This Court having given due consideration to the matter, we conclude that the use of the notice provision for this purpose does not offend the doctrine of federal labor law preemption, as states are free to fashion their own criteria for unemployment compensation eligibility. <em>New York Tel Co v New York Labor Dep\u2019t, </em>440 US 519; 99 S Ct 1328; 59 L Ed 2d 553 (1979); <em>Florida AFL-CIO v State Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>676 F2d 513 (CA 11, 1982); <em>Hawaiian Tel Co v State of Hawaii, </em>614 F2d 1197 (CA 9, 1980), <em>cert den </em>446 US 984; 100 S Ct 2965; 64 L Ed 2d 840 (1980). Having so resolved the question, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in the manner as set forth in our February 18, 1982, opinion.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The association has applied for the third time to this Court for leave to appeal._</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ii</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Michigan\u2019s labor mediation statute, MCL 423.9; MSA 17.454(9), provided at the time of the dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">No strike or lockout shall take place or be put into effect until and unless each of the steps have been taken and the requirements complied with as provided in this section.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The statute, in subsection 9(a), further provided in pertinent part that notice be given in the event of a strike or lockout:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">In the event the parties thereto are unable to settle any labor dispute, the employees or their representatives, in the case of impending strike, or the employer or his agent, in the case of an impending lockout, shall serve notice of such dispute together with a statement of the issues involved upon the board and the other party to the dispute.

The Court observed that Congress safeguarded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>exercise by employees of \"concerted activities\u201d and expressly recognized the right to strike. After quoting the federal prerequisites to the right to strike, the Court stated: \"None of these sections can be read as permitting concurrent state regulation of peaceful strikes for higher wages. Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The <em>O\u2019Brien </em>Court went on to observe that \"[t]he federal Act thus permits strikes at a different and usually earlier time than the Michigan law; and it does not require majority authorization for any strike.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>p 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Because the state statute conflicted with the federal act, the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>Court found that the state legislation must yield. \"A state statute so at war with federal law cannot survive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 458-459.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Preemption of state law by the nlra was recognized and applied in <em>Davidson v Michigan Carpenters Council, </em>356 Mich 557; 97 NW2d 11 (1959).

The plaintiff\u2019s conduct regarding the notice provisions is governed exclusively by federal law. We find that MCL 423.9; MSA 17.454(9) is preempted by \u00a78(d) of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Defendants argue that both sides, labor and management, are obligated to give notice under the provisions of 29 USC 158(d) and the lockout notice provision of MCL 423.9(a); MSA 17.454(9)(a). Since the notice provision is preempted by federal law, we look to the requirements of notice under federal law. No such dual notices are required. Whereas MCL 423.9; MSA 17.454(9) would require notice from the association prior to a lockout, federal law requires only that the party originally proposing contract changes (here the union) give notice. <em>United Furniture Workers v NLRB, </em>118 US App DC 350; 336 F2d 738 (1964). See also <em>NLRB v Mar-Len Cabinets, Inc, </em>659 F2d 995, 998 (CA 9, 1981); <em>Hooker Chemicals v NLRB, </em>573 F2d 965 (CA 7, 1978); <em>NLRB v Painting &amp; Decorating Contractors, </em>500 F2d 54, 56 (CA 7, 1974). We find that the union gave the notice required under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Since we have determined that Michigan\u2019s labor mediation statute governing lockouts is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act, what effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>does it have on the parties\u2019 dispute concerning payment of unemployment compensation?</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\">This Court in <em>Smith v Employment Security </em>Comm, 410 Mich 231; 301 NW2d 285 (1981), interpreted the unemployment benefit disqualification of MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.53K8)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and held that a lockout is one form of a labor dispute which would disqualify an employee from receiving unemployment benefits, provided his unemployment was due to a labor dispute in which he was directly involved.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Upon review, we must determine whether the findings of the mesc are supported by law and by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.

Beauvais, was named to represent the claimants who belong to the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> The referee who heard the consolidated appeals on defendants\u2019 claims took testimony regarding the contract negotiations and the eventual lockout and rendered identical decisions on the employees\u2019 claims since the individual factual variations were not of such a significant nature as to alter the ultimate decision in any one appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">[A]t the time of the lockout none of the employees seeking unemployment benefits was on strike or in a slowdown. In fact, no finding has been made to the effect that any employees of any member of the Association was on strike. That assertion is made only by the employers, and has not been adopted by any of the fact finders below.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> See also, generally, Anno: <em>Unemployment compensation: Application of labor dispute disquali\u00f1cation for bene\u00f1ts to locked out employee, </em>62 ALR3d 437.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"><em> </em>The filing of that motion marked a turning point in this case. The prior proceedings had focused almost exclusively on the MCL 421.29(8); MSA 17.531(8) labor dispute disqualification. The subsequent proceedings have focused almost entirely on whether the MCL 423.9(a); MSA 17.454(9)(a) notice requirement is preempted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> The Court of Appeals was clearly correct to the extent that it cited these cases for that proposition. Unfortunately, that proposition does not resolve this case. No eligibility criteria for unemployment compensation are challenged here. The criterion that is relevant to these claimants is the alleged involvement in a labor dispute. The Michigan Legislature has decided, as <em>New York Telephone Co </em>held it may, that such involvement disqualifies a claimant from receiving benefits. This Court has construed such involvement to include lockouts. See <em>infra, </em>pp 424-425 for a discussion of <em>Smith v Employment Security Comm, </em>410 Mich 231; 301 NW2d 285 (1981). The Court of Appeals has added an additional gloss by holding that the lockouts must be legal. Even assuming that this additional statutory construction is permissible, the fact remains that the legality of the lockout must be determined by reference to labor law provisions, which define when a lockout may occur. The Court of Appeals chose to refer to the preempted Michigan notice requirement even though, as a labor law provision, that requirement is invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> 1949 PA 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The quoted portion of the statute now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">A strike or lockout shall not take place or be put into effect until and unless each of the steps are taken and the requirements complied with as follows ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"Ax66\"> 1949 PA 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">The quoted portion of the statute now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">If the parties thereto are unable to settle any labor dispute, the employees or their representatives, in the case of impending strike, or the employer or his agent, in the case of an impending lockout, shall serve notice of the dispute together with a statement of the issues involved upon the commission and the other party to the dispute.
