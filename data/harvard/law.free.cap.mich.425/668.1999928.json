Moreover, because the earlier treatment of the res judicata issue by the Court of Appeals was based on the erroneous conclusion that <em>Gusler </em>was null and void, and because the retroactive effect of <em>Gusler </em>was never addressed, we remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of these issues in light of our holding that <em>Gusler </em>is binding precedent._</p>\n<p id=\"AmN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>PACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">Plaintiff .originally filed a petition for hearing with the Department of Labor on July 15, 1980, alleging a back disability attributable to her work for defendant-employer. Following trial on that petition, the hearing referee concluded that the plaintiff had sustained a disabling injury arising out of and in the course of her employment and determined the plaintiffs weekly compensation wage in a decision dated October 6, 1981. It is alleged that no appeal was taken from this decision because the parties believed that <em>Jolliff v American Advertising Distributors, Inc, </em>49 Mich App 1; 211 NW2d 260 (1973), lv den 391 Mich 780 (1974), governed determination of the minimum weekly compensation rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">However, on December 30, 1981, this Court filed its opinion in <em>Gusler, supra, </em>expressly overruling <em>Jolliff, </em>holding that the minimum weekly compensation rates in \u00a7 351 were not subject to the adjustments prescribed in \u00a7 355. As a result of <em>Gusler, </em>the defendant filed a petition for determination of rights with the bureau, seeking an order reducing plaintiffs weekly rate of compensation. In a decision and order dated May 26, 1983, the hearing referee directed the reduction of plaintiffs weekly benefits in accordance with <em>Gusler, </em>thus rejecting plaintiff\u2019s argument that res judicata barred such reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Plaintiff appealed this decision to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, and, in a decision mailed December 8, 1983, the board reversed the referee\u2019s decision and order, holding that res judi-cata did in fact bar a reduction in plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The Court of Appeals granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal on April 4, 1984, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>subsequently, in an opinion dated January 2, 1985, <em>Riley v Northland Geriatric Center, </em>140 Mich App 72; 362 NW2d 894 (1985), affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, holding that <em>Gusler </em>was not binding authority. The Court of Appeals opined that, inasmuch as this Court had granted a rehearing in <em>Gusler, </em>the subsequent dismissal of the appeal on the basis of the stipulation by the parties rendered that opinion a nullity. The Court of Appeals concluded by affirming the appeal board\u2019s order that interest be paid at a rate of twelve percent per annum. <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products, </em>419 Mich 1; 345 NW2d 184 (1984); <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products (On Resubmission), </em>419 Mich 32; 348 NW2d 652 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">For purposes of this appeal, the history of the minimum rate controversy begins with the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Jolliff </em>where the Court of Appeals held that the adjustment provisions of \u00a7355<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applied to both minimum and maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>weekly rates. Several years later, a different Court of Appeals panel affirmed the <em>Jolliff </em>opinion in <em>Gusler v Fairview Tubular Products, </em>92 Mich App 164; 284 NW2d 487 (1979). On appeal to this Court, we ruled in <em>Gusler </em>that the minimum rates provided for in \u00a7351 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were not subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>adjustments provided for in \u00a7 355 of the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">We disagree with this interpretation and hold that no adjustment to the minimum rates prescribed in \u00a7 351 is authorized because none was intended by the Legislature. We reach that conclusion because of 1) the Legislature\u2019s failure to make specific provision for adjustment of minimum rates while explicitly doing so with respect to maximum rates, 2) an analysis of the history of the provision in question, and 3) the internal conflicts and plainly absurd results which plaintiff\u2019s construction of the statute would effect. [412 Mich 285.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">This Court recognized that the holding was \"not unlike the announcement of a new rule of law\u201d and that, in the interest of fairness, the opinion would not affect disability payments already made (nor would a recipient be obligated to repay any overcompensation), but that benefits due and not yet paid or to be awarded after the date of the opinion would be in accord with the <em>Gusler </em>ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 298. In this Court\u2019s order, issued pursuant to the <em>Gusler </em>opinion decided December 30, 1981, we reversed and remanded the case to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board for proceedings in conformity with the filed opinion. We subsequently granted a timely filed motion for rehearing on August 5, 1982. However, on March 15, 1983, before any action was taken on rehearing, this Court dismissed the appeal upon stipulation by the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 414 Mich 1102 (1982)._</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>In the instant case, the Court of Appeals, in granting leave to appeal, raised the issue, sua sponte, whether <em>Gusler </em>had any force or effect in light of this Court\u2019s grant of the rehearing and, thereafter, dismissal of the appeal pursuant to stipulation by the parties. In deciding this issue, the Court of Appeals looked to GCR 1963, 866,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> specifically \u00a73, as authority for ruling that, because the <em>Gusler </em>opinion and judgment were not issued due to the stipulation to dismiss, the <em>Gusler </em>opinion was a nullity and, thus, inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">We find GCR 1963, 866 to be dispositive of this situation. GCR 1963, 866.3(a) provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsH\">\"Entry. The clerk shall enter an order or judgment pursuant to an opinion as of the date the opinion is filed with him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\"><em>Gusler </em>was filed and entered on December 30, 1981. The \"entry\u201d of an order or judgment, however, is not the same as the date of its \"issuance.\u201d GCR 1963, 866.3(d) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">\"Execution or Enforcement. Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, an order or judgment is effective when it is issued under (b)(1), (b)(2), or (c) and execution is to be obtained in the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">An order or judgment does not become effective, and is therefore of no precedential value, until it is \"issued\u201d in conformity with either subsection (b) or (c). <em>People v Phillips, </em>416 Mich 63, 74; 330 NW2d 366 (1982). Compare <em>People v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge #2, </em>73 Mich App 156, 160; 250 NW2d 812 (1977), <em>lv den </em>400 Mich 825 (1977), and <em>People v Draine, </em>72 Mich App 592, 596; 250 NW2d 139 (1976), <em>lv den </em>401 Mich 824 (1977), both decided prior to the 1978 amendment to GCR 1963, 866.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">Under the provision for routine issuance of an order or judgment, 866.3(b), the clerk must send <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>certified copies of the Supreme Court\u2019s order or judgment to both the trial court and the Court of Appeals no less than 20 days or more than 30 days after the order or judgment was entered. Under (b)(2), however, if a motion for rehearing is timely filed, the clerk does not send certified copies of the order or judgment until after the motion for rehearing is denied, or, if granted, until at least 20 days after the filing of the Court\u2019s opinion on rehearing. GCR 1963, 864.4(b). In other words, if a motion for rehearing is timely filed, the order or judgment previously entered by the clerk does not \"issue\u201d or become effective until after the motion is decided one way or the other. Here, as a motion for rehearing was filed within 20 days of the filing or \"entry\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Gusler </em>opinion, GCR 1963, 864.4(a), and as the motion was subsequently granted, the <em>Gusler </em>opinion was never \"issued\u201d in conformity with the court rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">The subsequent dismissal of the appeal by the Court upon stipulation of the parties does not somehow work to \"issue\u201d the Court\u2019s order or judgment. Nor is this a case of \"exceptional issuance\u201d otherwise ordered by the Court under subsection (c). Compare, <em>e.g., Oscoda Chapter of PBB Action Committee, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>403 Mich 215, 233; 268 NW2d 240 (1978), and <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v City of Detroit, </em>410 Mich 616, 636; 304 NW2d 455 (1981), with <em>Gusler, supra, </em>p 298. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gusler, </em>therefore, is without binding precedential effect. In accord, see <em>Phillips, supra, </em>p 75. [140 Mich App 75-77.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">While we agree with the Court of Appeals determination that GCR 1963, 866, is dispositive of the legal question, we believe that the Court of Appeals has erroneously applied \u00a7 3 of that court rule, instead of \u00a7 2, to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">GCR 1963, 866.2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">.2 Filing and Publication. <em>The Court shall </em>file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>signed opinion with the clerk, who shall stamp the date of filing on it. </em>The Supreme Court reporter is responsible for having the opinions printed, in a form and under a contract approved by the Court. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We find the language, \"[t]he Court shall file a signed opinion with the clerk, who shall stamp the date of filing on it,\u201d as authority in ruling that a Supreme Court opinion becomes binding precedent for intermediate appellate and trial courts at the time a signed opinion is date-stamped and filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court, unless this Court, in rendering an opinion, specifically states that the opinion is effective at a different date.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This determination is consistent with <em>Draine, supra, </em>wherein the Court of Appeals held that a Supreme Court opinion becomes binding authority on the date it is decided (i.e., the date stamped on the opinion when the opinion is filed in the Supreme Court Clerk\u2019s office). The <em>Draine </em>panel rejected the argument that GCR 1963, 866, dictates that a Supreme Court opinion is not binding precedent until twenty days after it is filed with the clerk, holding that court rule 866 is \"designed only to facilitate the handling of motions for rehearing which must also be filed within 20 days\u201d and is silent \"about when a rule of law enunciated in a Supreme Court opinion is effective as binding precedent for inferior courts . . . .\u201d 72 Mich App 596.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Additionally, in <em>Recorder\u2019s Court Judge #2, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals, in addressing the issue when a Supreme Court opinion becomes precedent, binding on lower courts, held, \"We see little reason to vary from the long held rule that case law is effective upon the date of the filing of the opinion in which it is contained.\u201d 73 Mich App 160.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The Court of Appeals, in reaching its decision, also failed to recognize the distinction between a rule of law set forth in an opinion properly filed, GCR 1963, 866.2, as precedent, and an order or judgment issued pursuant to an opinion, GCR 1963, 866.3(a), which affects only the specific parties to the litigation. A rule of law enunciated in a Supreme Court opinion is determinative of the legal question involved and, upon compliance with GCR 1963, 866.2, becomes binding precedent on intermediate appellate and trial courts at that time. Conversely, an order or judgment entered pursuant to an opinion, GCR 1963, 866.3(a), is strictly limited in its scope to the particular parties involved in the appeal. Routine issuance of an order or judgment does not affect the precedential force of an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">While it is true, as the Court of Appeals stated, that an order or judgment cannot become effective for execution or enforcement purposes until it is issued, GCR 1963, 866.3(d), it simply does not follow that an opinion of this Court is not effective as precedent until that same time. An opinion of this Court is not rendered meaningless because litigants involved in the controversy cannot begin execution or enforcement until issuance of an order or judgment. Further, this does not connote that an opinion is applicable to everyone but the litigants to that case. Rather, the opinion does apply to those litigants, and, whether or not an order or judgment issued pursuant to that opinion is enforced or executed between the parties, is an issue separate and distinct from when the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>has precedential effect. This Court will not equate issuance of an order or judgment for execution or enforcement purposes, GCR 1963, 866.3(d), with the precedential effect of an opinion for guidance and authority, GCR 1963, 866.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Finally, if a motion for rehearing is timely filed with this Court, as was the case in <em>Gusler, </em>then GCR 1963, 864.4(b) controls, and the issuance of the order of judgment as to the litigants is postponed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">b) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, timely filing of a motion <em>postpones issuance of the Court\u2019s judgment order </em>until the motion is denied by the Court or, if granted, until at least 20 days after the filing of the Court\u2019s opinion on rehearing. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">This court rule subsection does not state, nor does GCR 1963, 866, that the filing of a timely motion for rehearing or the granting of such a motion, postpones or deprives a previous opinion of precedential effect. This Court is well aware, in reviewing a motion for rehearing and in granting a rehearing, of the substance of the opinion upon which the rehearing motion is based. If we, in granting a motion for rehearing, believe that the precedential effect of an opinion should be postponed pending rehearing, we will specifically so indicate in the order granting rehearing or by separate order. If this Court does not expressly postpone the precedential effect of an opinion, then only the order is postponed pending rehearing, GCR 1963, 864.4(b), and not the precedential force of the initial opinion. And, lastly, if a case is reheard, and not dismissed upon stipulation by the parties as in <em>Gusler, </em>we will, in our opinion following the rehearing, GCR 1963, 866.3(b)(2), set forth changes in the law, if any, we deem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Thus, in applying the facts of the <em>Gusler </em>case to GCR 1963, 866, we can only conclude that, pursuant to \u00a72 of the court rule, the <em>Gusler </em>decision became binding precedent on the courts of this state on the date of the decision, December 30, 1981. The timely filing of the motion for rehearing by the defendants in <em>Gusler </em>and the grant of rehearing by this Court on August 5, 1982, only postponed the issuance of the order and did not affect the <em>Gusler </em>holding that the minimum weekly compensation rates in \u00a7 351(1) are not subject to the adjustments as prescribed in \u00a7 355. The subsequent dismissal of the appeal by this Court, upon stipulation by the parties, was the final order issued pursuant to GCR 1963, 866.3, and applicable only to the parties involved in that case. Therefore, the <em>Gusler </em>opinion, binding precedent as of December 3\u00d3, 1981, and never having been overruled by this Court, is applicable to the instant case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>as to the precedential effect of <em>Gusler </em>and remand this case to that Court for consideration of the res judicata and retroactivity issues. We order that the parties brief these issues prior to consideration by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b777-6\">Brickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\"> On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal is considered, and it is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">The motions for leave to file brief amicus curiae are also considered, and they are granted.

The defendants, in their prayer for relief, have requested this Court to award any accrued payments of outstanding weekly compensation owed to plaintiff at an interest rate of ten percent per annum.

The instant panel of the Court of Appeals is apparently drawing an analogy between a Court of Appeals decision where this Court has granted leave and a Supreme Court decision where this Court has granted a rehearing. We do not believe that the precedential effect of a Court of Appeals decision pending on leave granted to this Court is of similar circumstance as a Supreme Court opinion that has been filed with a rehearing subsequently granted. In <em>Tebo v Havlik, </em>418 Mich 350, 379-380; 334 NW2d 181 (1984), Justice Levin stated in his dissenting opinion: \"[A] decision of the Court of Appeals (except possibly a decision en banc) is not a rule of law within the doctrine of stare decisis, since it binds neither other panels of the Court of Appeals nor the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Further, Justice Ryan, the author of <em>Phillips, </em>indicated that <em>Phillips </em>and <em>George </em>\"explicate the niceties of the point at which an <em>intermediate </em>appellate court judgment is final, binding, and preceden-tial.\u201d 416 Mich 370, n 1. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Thus, the fact that no precedential effect attaches to a Court of Appeals decision pending before this Court (until we resolve the appeal) does not imply that no precedential effect attaches to a Supreme Court opinion until it is issued. A Supreme Court opinion is filed, pursuant to GCR 1963, 866.2, and has precedential effect at that time; it is not issued; only an order or judgment is issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\"> The plaintiff cites four cases from other jurisdictions to support the position that a grant of a rehearing motion deprives a prior opinion of authority. However, we believe these cases are all distinguishable, and, thus, inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In <em>Holcomb v Escambia Co Hospital Bd, </em>291 Ala 114, 117; 278 So 2d 699 (1973), the Alabama Supreme Court, concomitant with the granting of the application for rehearing in that case, <em>speciacally </em>set aside the original opinion and judgment. Conversely, the original opinion in <em>Gusler </em>was not specifically set aside by this Court when the rehearing was granted. Only the judgment order issued pursuant to the original <em>Gusler </em>opinion was postponed. GCR 1963, 864.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">The West Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Miller v Burley, </em>155 W Va 681, 698; 187 SE2d 803 (1972), in addressing the issue of what effect a rehearing has on a previously rendered opinion, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-10\">As a general rule, when a rehearing is granted, the status of the case is the same as though no hearing had occurred. The granting of a rehearing withdraws an opinion previously rendered and destroys its force and effect unless it is subsequently adopted by the same tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">While we do not discount the logic of the West Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning regarding the effect the granting of a rehearing has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>on the precedential force of a previously filed opinion, we cannot adopt its conclusion in a vacuum. We must resolve the issue in this case within the context of the stated court rules of this jurisdiction. As previously noted, neither Michigan court rule GCR 1963, 866, nor 864.4(b), indicates that a grant of a rehearing motion deprives a previous opinion of authority, and, therefore, we concluded that a previously filed opinion <em>does </em>have precedential force unless specifically vitiated by this Court in an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">In <em>Dover v Reynolds, </em>245 Ind 33, 34; 196 NE2d 76 (1964) (incorrectly cited in plaintiffs brief as being <em>State v Boone Circuit), </em>the court held that because the Supreme Court \"granted a petition for rehearing generally, and the case is before the court as if it had never been decided\u201d it thus cannot be cited as authority. The <em>Dover </em>case, however, appears to be an appeal from an intermediate appellate court. Thus, when the Indiana Supreme Court used the language \"rehearing,\u201d it appeared to be making reference to the first appeal to the highest court from an intermediate appellate court, and not a rehearing by the Supreme Court of a case it had previously decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Finally, in <em>Tallman v Eastern Illinois &amp; P R Co, </em>379 Ill 441, 448-449; 41 NE2d 537 (1942), the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that when a rehearing is granted and the case is disposed of without a judgment of the Supreme Court, the decision previously rendered will not be accepted as precedent or as expressing the final views of the court. This rationale was reached in the context of a case in which the opinion was not published because a rehearing was granted. However, in <em>Gusler, </em>this Court issued an order of judgment pursuant to the filed opinion which was subsequently published. The fact that an order of judgment was issued pursuant to the filed and published opinion distinguishes the <em>Gusler </em>case to the extent that we believe the rationale enunciated in <em>Tallman </em>is inapplicable as authority to the facts in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">We conclude, therefore, that the foregoing cases do not support a determination that, in Michigan, an opinion has no precedential effect once a rehearing is granted. Thus, we reject the plaintiffs argument on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b777-7\">Williams, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANh\">(concurring).

There thus was no decision by this Court. Absent a decision, there were only opinions. Since the Court as a court speaks only through its orders and not through its opinions, the Court <em>as a court </em>has not spoken on the merits of the issues dealt with in the <em>Gusler </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">An opinion or opinions filed by this Court, after full briefing and argument, may and should be regarded upon filing as functioning much like an advisory opinion until issuance of the judgment order. The opinions filed represent the views of the justices who sign them; the majority opinion is not, however, precedentially binding under the doctrine of stare decisis until a judgment order issues pursuant to the opinions. The trial courts and the Court of Appeals may and generally will be guided by the majority opinion from the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>filing, but are not required to follow the majority opinion until a judgment order is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The concept that an opinion without an order adjudicating a controversy is not precedentially binding has been recognized in the decisions of this Court and of other courts<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> stating that an advisory opinion is not precedentially binding. \"[T]he court does not act as a court in rendering such opinions\u201d; \"such opinions are regarded as expressing the views of the justices and not a judicial determination of the questions by the court.\u201d <em>Anway v Grand Rapids R Co, </em>211 Mich 592, 603; 179 NW 350 (1920). It has been said: \"Since in an advisory opinion there is no decision, such an opinion of a court does not have stare decisis effect,\u201d and that only a judicial opinion \"expressed in connection with a decision that has become final can have stare decisis effect. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AnN\">This Court recognized the difference between a precedentially binding decision and an advisory opinion in <em>Cassidy v McGovern, </em>415 Mich 483; 330 NW2d 22 (1982). In <em>In re Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 462; 208 NW2d 469 (1973), a majority of the justices had indicated that the question of what constitutes a \"serious impairment of body function\u201d within the meaning of the no-fault automobile liability act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was a question to be decided by the trier of fact. In <em>Cassidy, supra, </em>p 495, the Court, in concluding that the question was to be decided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the Court, observed that the statements in <em>In re Advisory Opinion </em>did \"not constitute a decision of the Court and [were] not precedentially binding in the same sense as a decision of the Court after a hearing on the merits.\u201d The Court said that \"[although advisory opinions are not binding, they may be persuasive,\u201d but the \"validity\u201d of what was said in <em>In re Advisory Opinion </em>would \"have to find a basis other than stare decisis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Since <em>Gusler </em>is not precedentially binding, this Court might remand the cause to the Court of Appeals to decide whether the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Jolliff v American Advertising Distributors, Inc, </em>49 Mich App 1; 211 NW2d 260 (1973), lv den 391 Mich 780 (1974), or the view expressed by a majority of the justices in <em>Gusler </em>is correct. I think it would be more appropriate for this Court to decide the question and would do so.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The question has been fully briefed in this Court by both sides of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">I would, for the reasons set forth in the majority opinion in <em>Gusler, </em>which I signed when the opinions in <em>Gusler </em>were filed, adhere to the view there stated that the minimum rates are not subject to adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">I would also decide the retroactivity and res judicata issues. Again, the questions have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>fully briefed in this Court by both sides of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In <em>Gusler, </em>p 298, the majority opinion concluded with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">In the interest of fairness we do not believe our holding should affect any disability compensation payments already made. Consequently, no recipient will be obligated to repay sums already received by reason of the erroneous computation formula we have nullified today. However, any benefits due and not yet paid or to be awarded after the date of this opinion shall be in accord with this ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The majority thus indicated that <em>Gusler </em>would apply to cases decided before December 30, 1981, as to payments made after that date. Although the majority opinion did not go into an extended retro-activity/res judicata analysis, that is what the opinion stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The question of retroactivity is, as set forth in <em>Gusler, </em>ultimately one of fairness. There is nothing unfair in applying the rule stated in <em>Gusler, </em>which appears to have been reaffirmed today on varying analyses, from and after the date of the announcement of the opinions of the justices in <em>Gusler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The statement in the foregoing concluding paragraph of the majority opinion in <em>Gusler </em>was surely adequate notice to the workers\u2019 compensation department, the wcab, bench and bar, that <em>Jolliff </em>should no longer be followed. The \"interest of fairness\u201d adverted to in <em>Gusler, </em>that prompted this Court to state that <em>Gusler </em>should not \"affect any disability compensation payments already made,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>does not require that the effect of <em>Gusler </em>be deferred until this Court has reaffirmed <em>Gusler. </em>It would not be \"unfair\u201d to hold in the instant case that, as declared in <em>Gusler, </em>\"any benefits due and not yet paid or to be awarded after the date of [the <em>Gusler </em>opinion] shall be in accord with th[e] ruling\u201d stated in <em>Gusler </em>that the minimum rates are not subject to adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">To defer the effectiveness of the overruling of <em>Jolliff </em>beyond the filing on December 30, 1981, of the <em>Gusler </em>opinions would be unfair to employers and their insurers who have been required to pay out large sums because of an incorrect construction of \u00a7 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">There is no constitutional impediment to changing, upwards or downwards, workers\u2019 compensation benefits after an adjudication awarding such benefits. See <em>Franks v White Pine Copper, </em>422 Mich 636, 653-654; 375 NW2d 715 (1985), where this Court said that \"[workers\u2019 compensation benefits are social-welfare income-maintenance benefits,\u201d and that \"[i]n providing for such benefits, the Legislature did not covenant not to amend the legislation,\u201d and that an award of such benefits is not insulated \"from substantive change by subsequent legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">A workers\u2019 compensation award differs from a lump sum tort judgment in that it operates prospectively and is subject to change in response to subsequent events. Just as a change in legislation may result in an upward or downward adjustment in the amount of benefits, so too a change in a rule of law announced by judicial decision may effect a change in the amount of the benefits payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The doctrine of res judicata does not preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>giving effect to such a change in law. In <em>Socialist Workers Party v Secretary of State, </em>412 Mich 571, 584; 317 NW2d 1 (1982), this Court adopted the view expressed in the Restatement of Judgments that although an issue has been actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, relitigation of the issue between the parties is not precluded where the issue is one of law and \"[a] new determination is warranted in order to take account of an intervening change in the applicable legal context or otherwise to avoid inequitable administration of the laws.\u201d Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Were this Court to give preclusive effect to a prior adjudication that was based on <em>Jolliff </em>as to payments of workers\u2019 compensation benefits after <em>Gusler </em>it would perpetuate, in the name of a judicial doctrine, a judicial error in construing a statute that thwarts legislative intent. The policies that explain the judicial doctrine of res judicata do not require the continued imposition on employers and their insurers of payments contrary to the intendment of the statute._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-11\"> This suggests that following decision after remand to the Court of Appeals whoever is dissatisfied with its decision may seek to bring the meritorious question whether minimum rates are subject to upward adjustments back to this Court one more time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-12\"> MCL 418.355; MSA 17.237(355).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b778-13\"> It does not appear why what was said on the meritorious question, whether minimum rates are subject to upward adjustment, is regarded as precedentially binding, but what was said in the concluding paragraph of the <em>Gusler </em>opinion (see Part iii-a, <em>infra) </em>on the retroactivity/res judicata issues is not precedentially binding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\"> 20 Am Jur 2d, Courts, \u00a7 189, pp 524-525; 49 CJS, Judgment, \u00a7 22, p 51. <em>Michigamme Oil Co v Huron Valley Bldg &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n, </em>280 Mich 12,14; 273 NW 329 (1937); <em>Kingsbury v Kingsbury, </em>20 Mich 212, 215 (1870); <em>Newbould v Stewart, </em>15 Mich 15 (1866).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> Because this Court speaks only through its orders, it cannot properly, through construction of a court rule, make an opinion precedentially binding, before issuance of an order pursuant to the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\"> The reason why a judgment order pursuant to the opinions was not issued before issuance of an order dismissing the appeal was that a timely petition for rehearing had been filed and subsequently that petition was granted.
