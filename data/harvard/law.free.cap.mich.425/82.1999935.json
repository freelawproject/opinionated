In a later case, <em>Oliver v United States, </em>466 US 170, 183; 104 S Ct 1735; 80 L Ed 2d 214 (1984), the Court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">The existence of a property right is but one element in determining whether expectations of privacy are legitimate. \"The premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.\u201d <em>Katz, </em>389 US at 353 (quoting <em>Warden v Hayden, </em>387 US 294, 304 [87 S Ct 1642; 18 L Ed 2d 782] (1967)). \"[E]ven a property interest in premises may not be sufficient to establish a legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to particular items located on the premises or activity conducted thereon.\u201d <em>Rakas v Illinois, </em>439 US [128, 144, n 12; 99 S Ct 421; 58 L Ed 2d 387 (1978)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Therefore, I find that in this case there was no intrusion on protected interests sufficient to constitute a search within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment or Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-8\">Williams, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b179-9\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ayu-dedup-0\">The question presented to this Court is whether the trial court properly granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and to dismiss the charges against him. Defendant argued that the arresting officers trespassed upon his land and made a search and seizure without a warrant which violated his right against unreasonable search and seizure as provided by the Michigan and United States Constitutions, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11; US Const, Am IV. The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">On November 14, 1982, officers of the Detroit Police Department received the following radio dispatch: \"North of Glendale stripping of an automobile in progress. Subjects were taking the parts of that car to the garage, rear of 2379 Leslie.\u201d The officers proceeded to the alley where they found a Cadillac which had been \"stripped\u201d (had certain parts removed). The officers then approached the garage at 2379 Leslie, approximately three-quarters of a block away. At the preliminary hearing, Officer Brown testified as to the relative locations of the stripped Cadillac and the garage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\"><em>Q. </em>Where is this location of this Cadillac in the alley in relation to that garage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\"><em>A. </em>Straight down the street. It would be north of that garage. Straight down the street about three-quarters of a block. <em>You can stand in the street in front of the garage and look straight down and you can see the car. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The police proceeded down the alley from the stripped Cadillac to the garage. According to Officer Brown\u2019s testimony, he and his partner walked onto defendant\u2019s property and proceeded to the walk-in door on the side of the garage. There were lights on inside the garage, and there was an opening of approximately one square foot through which the officers could see defendant and three others removing the parts of a black Chevrolet. The officer testified that the trunk lid had already been removed from the car and the individuals in the garage were in the process of removing the car\u2019s left rear door. The officers then entered the garage, ran a check on the vehicle identification number and determined that it had been stolen. At that time they arrested the four men in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>garage. Defendant was charged with receiving and concealing stolen property over $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">At trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence offered against him. The trial court reluctantly granted defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">The Court has reviewed the motion, brief in support of the motion as well as the case submitted by Mr. Giovanni: <em>People versus Dugan found at 102 Michigan Appeals 497 </em>[302 NW2d 209 (1980)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">Based on the Dugan case, the Court has no alternative but to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress with respect to Patrick Houze.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">[T]he Dugan case is controlling. It is the law in this State and even though this Court is in disagreement with the analysis in Dugan, it\u2019s my responsibility to follow the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">So, accordingly, the evidence will be suppressed against Mr. Houze.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Like the trial court, the Court of Appeals majority, in affirming, relied largely on <em>People v Dugan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">Specifically, the judge noted that while in his opinion the police had probable cause to suspect that a crime was being committed, this fact did not excuse a warrantless entry on defendant\u2019s property. The trial judge relied upon the holding of this Court in <em>People v Dugan, </em>102 Mich App 497; 302 NW2d 209 (1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">On review, the ruling of the trial judge must be affirmed unless clearly erroneous. <em>People v Grim-mett, </em>97 Mich App 212; 293 NW2d 768 (1980). We find no mistakes in the ruling below and affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">The dissent would have reversed, noting that the officers had probable cause to search defendant\u2019s garage once the anonymous tip had been verified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>by the discovery of the stripped Cadillac in the alley. Moreover the informant\u2019s tip, corroborated by the finding of the stripped vehicle, was sufficient for the officers to obtain a warrant under the \"totality of the circumstances\u201d standard promulgated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Illinois v </em>Gates, 462 US 213; 103 S Ct 2317; 76 L Ed 2d 527 (1983). However, the dissent did not believe that a warrant would be necessary under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. In the present case, \"[t]he officers were justified in stopping the commission of a crime and seizing evidence before it could be destroyed. The search and seizure was reasonable and therefore constitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">As both the trial court and the Court of Appeals decisions rested largely on the case of <em>People v Dugan, supra, </em>this Court has found it necessary to reexamine <em>Dugan </em>in considering the present appeal. In <em>Dugan, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions for receiving or concealing stolen property over $100. The Court based its decision on the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">In the instant case, Officer Gregory Thompson testified that on the morning of January 29, 1978, he contacted Mr. Charles DeBruyne who reported that a snowblower had been taken from his garage. Mr. DeBruyne reported further that he had followed a set of snowblower tracks from his garage, through an alley, to the rear of a house on East Outer Drive. Officer Thompson testified that he then followed the tracks and an accompanying set of footprints to the rear of the house he had been told about, at which point the tracks and footprints continued through a hole in the fence at the rear of the house and into the garage. Officer Thompson then testified that he walked around to the front of the house where he observed a set of footprints leading from the garage to the front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>door. He then entered onto the property and went to the open garage where he observed a snow-blower that matched the description given by Mr. DeBruyne. On checking further, he verified that the serial number on the snowblower matched the serial number given by Mr. DeBruyne. The officer testified that he then returned to the front of the house where he radioed for his sergeant. Shortly thereafter, the defendant exited from the front of the house, at which time Officer Thompson asked the defendant to stop and told the defendant that he wanted to talk to him. The defendant replied that if the officer did not have a search warrant he should stay off the property and then headed toward the garage. Officer Thompson again entered onto the property, following the defendant and ordering him to stop. Officer Thompson asked the defendant where he was going, to which the defendant replied that he was going to the garage to get his snowblower. Officer Thompson then stepped between the defendant and the snow-blower. The defendant on severed occasions demanded that the officer leave the property unless he had a warrant and the officer replied several times that he did not need a warrant because he had probable cause and was protecting a crime scene. Defendant then went into the house and returned with another young man, who [sic] the officer estimated to be between 15 and 17 years of age. Defendant then stated that they were going into the garage but Officer Thompson would not allow them to touch the snowblower. The officer had radioed for assistance, which arrived shortly. These officers stayed in the garage while Officer Thompson went to the front of the house to speak with his sergeant, who had also arrived. The sergeant then spoke with the defendant\u2019s mother and Officer Thompson loaded the snowblower into a scout car. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with receiving and concealing stolen property over the value of $100. <em>[People v Dugan, supra, </em>pp 501-502.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The prosecutor in <em>Dugan </em>attempted to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the officer\u2019s entry onto defendant\u2019s property without a warrant by arguing that there were \"exigent circumstances\u201d and that the evidence was in \"plain view.\u201d <em>Dugan, supra, </em>p 503. The Court defined the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">The \"exigent circumstances\u201d exception provides that when the police have probable cause to believe that a search of a certain place will produce specific evidence of that crime (the foundation requirements for issuance of a search warrant), there is no need for a warrant if the police also have probable cause to believe that an immediate warrantless search is necessary in order to (1) protect the officers or others, (2) prevent the loss or destruction of evidence, or (3) prevent the escape of the accused. <em>People v Harris, </em>95 Mich App 507, 510; 291 NW2d 97 (1980). See <em>United States v Chadwick, </em>433 US 1; 97 S Ct 2476; 53 L Ed 2d 538 (1977), <em>People v Plantefaber, </em>91 Mich App 764, 770; 283 NW2d 846 (1979). The rationale of the exception is clear; when the police have the probable cause necessary to secure a warrant, but circumstances make it impossible for them to obtain the warrant in time, then it is \"reasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment to conduct a search and to seize evidence or contraband. See <em>United States v Guidry, </em>534 F2d 1220, 1222-1223 (CA 6,1976). <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>See People v Oliver, </em>417 Mich 366, 380; 338 NW2d 167 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Probable cause is a reasonable belief based on trustworthy information that an offense has occurred and that the suspect has committed the offense or that evidence of the offense can be found in the place to be searched. <em>People v Heard, </em>65 Mich App 494; 237 NW2d 525 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">While the <em>Dugan </em>Court found that the officer had probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and that the snowblower was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>evidence of that crime, it found no exigent circumstances arising before the officer entered the garage to check the serial numbers. Rather, the Court found that the exigent circumstances followed the illegal entry and perhaps were precipitated by it. Had the officer sought a warrant to search the premises prior to his entry into defendant\u2019s garage, the defendant may not have attempted to remove the snowblower from the garage. <em>Dugan, supra, </em>pp 504-505.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Moreover, the <em>Dugan </em>Court rejected the prosecutor\u2019s contention that the evidence was in plain view of the officer. The \"plain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement presumes an intrusion, i.e., that the officers were admittedly involved in a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In order to come within the scope of the \"plain view\u201d doctrine the officer must have prior justification for the initial intrusion, must be in a place he has a right to be, and must make an \"inadvertent\u201d discovery of the incriminating evidence. <em>Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443; 91 S Ct 2022; 29 L Ed 2d 564 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Thus, the <em>Dugan </em>Court determined that once the officer sighted the snowblower in defendant\u2019s garage from defendant\u2019s driveway, he should have secured a warrant before further search and seizure. Entry into the garage constituted a search of a protected area under the Fourth Amendment as the officer had no legal right to enter the garage without a warrant, defendant\u2019s consent, or exigent circumstances. He was no longer on a common path of ingress or egress, but in a building within the curtilage of the home. Any exigent circumstances arose subsequent to the officer\u2019s entrance into the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The present case can be distinguished from <em>Du-gan. </em>The officer in <em>Dugan </em>had taken a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>report of theft from Dugan\u2019s neighbor, had been shown the tracks in the snow leading to Dugan\u2019s garage, and was searching the property for evidence of the crime. In <em>Houze, </em>the officers received an anonymous tip, proceeded to the alley, and found a stripped Cadillac. There was no evidence of who owned the car, who had done the stripping, when it had been done, or where the parts had been taken at that time. Nonetheless, it was reasonable on the part of the police to continue their inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The subsequent police viewing of defendant\u2019s activity through the garage door window did not constitute a search. The police did not enter defendant\u2019s home or peer into the windows of his home. Rather, they looked into an unattached garage which abutted a public alley from a common access route. This entry onto the curtilage and the observation by police into the garage was limited and reasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"asb-dedup-0\">Once the police observed defendant and three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>others in the garage surrounded by automobile parts and in the process of dismantling a car, they had probable cause to believe that a crime was in progress and that defendant Houze was committing it. In the present case, unlike <em>Dugan, </em>the police were faced with the exigent circumstances not of their own making and requiring immediate action. Not only were the officers witnessing an ongoing felony, i.e., possessing and concealing stolen automobiles, but they were also witnessing the destruction of evidence of the crime. In <em>United States v Connor, </em>478 F2d 1320, 1323-1324 (CA 7, 1973), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld a police viewing into a suspect\u2019s garage and the subsequent arrest of the suspect and seizure of the goods within the garage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">[T]heir viewing from outside the activities inside the building was not a \"search\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The officers were at the garage for the valid purpose of verifying a tip about illegal activities and they reached the rear of the building via a public way. Although, as the findings of fact state, \"[i]t was uncertain from the evidence whether the police officers were in the alley or on the adjoining apron outside the rear door of the garage when they first saw the activities being conducted inside, . . . the interior of the garage was clearly visible through the open overhead door from outside the building.\u201d Under these circumstances, the defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy. Even if the officers were on the apron, which was not fenced off from the alley, we think that a mere \"technical trespass\u201d did not transform an otherwise reasonable investigation into an unreasonable search. <em>See United States v Hanahan, </em>442 F2d 649, 653-654 (CA 7, 1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">Once the officers observed the suspicious activity in the garage and the dismantled condition of the Chevrolet, they had probable cause to believe that they were witnessing criminal acts. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>police were then justified in making a warrantless entry into the garage to arrest Conner and Mann. As the district court stated, \"it would have been wholly unreasonable to stand idle, watching further damage being done to cars which were almost certainly stolen, while a warrant was obtained. As police officers, they had a duty to preserve and protect the property of the owners, and . . . exigent circumstances justified their entry into the garage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We would find that the entry of the police onto defendant\u2019s property, even if involving a technical trespass, was not an intrusion on defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and was reasonable. The officers\u2019 entry of the garage without a warrant and subsequent arrest of defendant and seizure of evidence were proper.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-7\">Riley, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> It is not objectionable for an officer to come upon that part of the property which \"has been opened to public common use.\u201d The route which any visitor to a residence would use is not private in the Fourth Amendment sense, and thus if police take the route \"for the purpose of making a general inquiry\u201d or for some other legitimate reason, they are \"free to keep their eyes open,\u201d and thus it is permissible for them to look into a garage or similar structure from that location. [1 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure, \u00a7 2.3, p 318.]</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Courts have upheld police entries onto driveways, carports, front walks, and porches as nonintrusive. See, e.g., <em>Pistro v State, </em>590 P2d 884 (Alas, 1979) \u2014 an officer\u2019s observation of a stolen car from defendant\u2019s driveway; <em>State v Seagull, </em>26 Wash App 58; 613 P2d 528 (1980), aff'd 95 Wash 2d 898; 632 P2d 44 (1981) \u2014 an officer\u2019s observation of marijuana plants in a greenhouse twenty feet from house from defendant\u2019s back door; <em>United States v Ventling, </em>678 F2d 63 (CA 8, 1982) \u2014 an officer\u2019s observation of tire tracks from defendant\u2019s driveway and front door; <em>State v Wilbourn, </em>364 So 2d 995 (La, 1978)\u2014 officer\u2019s observation of suspect\u2019s car in carport from suspect\u2019s driveway. In each case, the courts found that the officers\u2019 observations were made from a normal means of ingress or egress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b188-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADr\">(dissenting). I agree with the majority that were the police to view the stripping of an automobile from a common access area, there would be no search violative of the constitutional protection. The record in the instant case does not, however, show that the police viewed the interior of the garage from a common access area.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the motion to suppress, or, if a majority of the Court were of the opinion that remand to the Court of Appeals is appropriate, I could join in remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The record indicates that the officers responded to a radio dispatch which was apparently prompted by an anonymous tip. The tip was that the stripping of an automobile was in progress and that the parts were being taken to a garage in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>rear of 2379 Leslie. The officers proceeded to the scene and could observe a stripped Cadillac three-fourths of a block away from the garage in the rear of 2379 Leslie.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The concurring opinion states that two officers \"walked onto defendant\u2019s property and proceeded to the walk-in door on the side of the garage.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They peered into the window and observed the dismantling of an automobile in progress. They then arrested the defendant and three other men who were dismantling the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The opinion further states that when the officers, following receipt of the apparently anonymous tip, found the stripped Cadillac, they had no evidence of who owned the stripped car, who had done the stripping, when it had been done, or where the parts had been taken. The opinion continues, and I agree: \"Nonetheless, it was reasonable on the part of the police to continue their inquiry.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The opinion then states: \"The subsequent police viewing of defendant\u2019s activity through the garage door window did not constitute a search.\u201d The opinion observes that the police \"did not enter defendant\u2019s home or peer into the windows of his home.\u201d They \"looked into an unattached garage which abutted a public alley from a common access route. This entry onto the curtilage and the observation by police into the garage was limited and reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">I agree that insofar as the officers may have \"walked onto defendant\u2019s property\u201d along \"a common access route\u201d of public ingress and egress, as in the four cases cited in footnote 1 of the concurring opinion, there would have been no unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>search. The record, however, does not establish that the officers were able to gain access to the side entrance door by walking only onto that portion of defendant\u2019s property that was a common access route of public ingress and egress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>does not show that the police traveled a route that a mailman, milkman, or ups man might have traveled and were able to view the activity in the garage from such a route. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b191-5\">Archer, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b190-5\"> The officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\"><em>Q. </em>And what happened when you got to that location?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\"><em>A. </em>We found a white over red Cadillac sitting in the alley stripped.

Because such a person could see the front of the vehicle from a public or \"semi-public\u201d access route, what was discoverable in plain view was not constitutionally protected. In the instant'case the record does not show that the garage and a side door of defendant\u2019s home were located in such relationship to each other that the police could peer through the window at the side of the garage into the interior of the lighted garage and observe the activity therein while they were standing at the side door of defendant\u2019s home or from some other location along a common access route.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">In <em>State v Seagull, </em>26 Wash App 58, 64; 613 P2d 528 (1980), an officer observed what he thought to be contraband from a \u201cportion of the premises to which the public, including police officers on legitimate business, are impliedly invited by the owner . . . .\u201d In <em>Pistro v State, </em>590 P2d 884, 885 (Alas, 1979), the police observed what was going on in a garage upon turning into a driveway, about fifty or sixty feet from the garage, and again ten to twenty feet therefrom \"en route to the side door . . . .\u201d The court said: \"The driveway was a normal means of ingress and egress impliedly open to public use by one desiring to speak to occupants in the garage, or to park off the street while visiting occupants of the house.\u201d <em>Id., </em>887. A similar analysis was adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in <em>United States v Ventling, </em>678 F2d 63 (CA 8, 1982), where tire tracks were observed by an officer after he had driven onto the driveway and went to the front door of the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
