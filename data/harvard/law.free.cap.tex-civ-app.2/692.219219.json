Survey of Public Land\u2014Office Survey Invalid, When.\u2014Article 3908 of the Revised Statutes requires a survey of public land to be actually made on the ground, and the State can not, in opposition to its wishes, be compelled to accept an office survey constructed by merely copying and adopting the field notes of a previous survey made on the ground for other parties by other surveyors.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b718-13\">2. Same \u2014 Survey Under Fifty-Gent Act.\u2014Such office survey, made by adopting prior field notes, is not sufficient to enable a purchaser to enforce against the State an executory contract for the sale of public lands under the \u201c fifty-cent\" Act of July 14,1879, as amended March 11,1881, even though it might constitute a valid survey should the officers of the State see proper to so recognize it, or might not be such a nullity as could be taken advantage of by third persons.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b718-14\">3. Trespass to Try Title\u2014Scope of Action.\u2014The State may properly bring suit in the form of an action of trespass to try title to cancel, on the ground of illegality and fraud, a contract for the sale of its public lands, although patents have not been issued to the purchaser for the lands.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b718-15\">4. Same\u2014Description of Lands Sued for.\u2014In such an action it is sufficient. if the petition gives substantially the same description of the lands as contained in the defendant\u2019s application to purchase them, especially where the defendant\u2019s answer contains such a description of them as will serve as a basis for the judgment rendered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b718-16\">5. Cancelling Sale \u2014 Tendering Back Purchase Money. \u2014It is not now an open question, that in an action brought to cancel an illegal sale of the public lands the State is not required to tender back the purchase money it may have received.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b718-18\">6.

Under the \u201c fifty-cent\u201d Act of July 14,1879, providing that public lands might be purchased \u201c by any responsible person,\u201d the question of such responsibility was for the surveyor to decide; and if he held the party to be responsible, and made the survey for him. this would be sufficient to hold the land until the expiration of the time allowed by law for paying the purchase money to the State.-</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b719-5\">8. Same\u2014Invalidity of Part of the Surveys.\u2014Where a party applied under the \"fifty-cent\"\u2019 act to purchase a number of surveys, the fact that some of them were illegally made, because having too great a frontage on permanent water, would not invalidate the others, since each survey of 040 acres must, under the terms of that act, be treated as a separate purchase.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b719-6\">9. Same\u2014Tender on only Part of the Surveys.\u2014For the same reason, it must be held that the failure of the purchaser to tender payment on all the surveys made under his application would only have the effect to invalidate such part of the proposed purchase as was not covered by the tender.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b719-7\">10. Same\u2014Tender Made in Time.\u2014Where the application to purchase under the \u201cfifty-cent\"\u2019 act was made December 1,1882, and the lands were surveyed January 17 to January 22,1883, and the field notes were filed in the General Land Office in March, 1883, a tender on May 19, 1883, of the purchase money due thereon to the State was made in time, although the act was repealed January 22, 1883; and the State Treasurer could not defeat the applicants\u2019 right of purchase by refusing to receive the money.

None of the land included in this suit has ever been patented by the State under the Bacon and Graves purchase; and on the 26th day of May, 1890, Bacon and Graves transferred by deed of special warranty 579 sections of land to C.

Blocks 97 and 27 were actually surveyed on the ground by Elgin in the manner in which it has been customary by surveyors in Texas to survey large bodies of land; that is, by running the outside boundary lines of the blocks, or a part of them, putting up permanent landmarks, and leaving the interior lines without running. These blocks, in writing up field notes, were divided into 640 acres surveys, and the interior surveys were made without actually running the lines; and Elgin did not run all the lines of any section in blocks 27 and 97, unless, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>says, it was done by accident. The field notes of said blocks 27 and 97 have remained on file in the General Land Office since they were filed therein, and said lands are platted on the maps of said office. There are 33,280 acres of land in block 27, and 611,000 acres in block 97.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-5\">\u201c 16. Deputy surveyors Berry and Williams had, prior to the adoption of the field notes for Bacon and Graves, run lines and ascertained corners in blocks 27 and 97, and found them to be as correct as any work of that character in that part of the State, and were satisfied as to the substantial accuracy of said surveys. Said surveys, as far as marked lines and corners were concerned, and in accuracy of work, were equal to or better than any other surveying in that part of the State, except that done for the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway, which was unusually accurate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-6\">\u201c 17. In December, 1882, and in January, February, and March, 1883,, Joel McKee was the surveyor of the Palo Pinto Land District, and E.- A. Williams and H. M. Berry were deputy surveyors under him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-7\">\u201c 18. I find, that at the time E. G. Graves entered into the agreement with E. M. Bacon to purchase these lands, to-wit, on the 29th and 30th of November, 1882, he was an employe in the General Land Office at Austin as draftsman, and that he drew his salary for the entire month of November, 1882, as well as for the preceding ten months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-8\">\u201c 19. Bacon and Graves have neither paid nor offered to pay taxes on said land or any part thereof at any time, nor have they rendered any part of such land for taxes for any year, except for 1891, when it was rendered by C. C. Gibbs, trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-9\">\u201c 20. Bacon and Graves, at the time of the application by them to purchase said lands, were not responsible parties, being worth less than $3000 each, and had made no arrangements to procure more than enough money to pay for the filing, etc., of the field notes, and afterwards, in February or March, 1883, the promise of a loan of $5000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-10\">\u201c21. The Colorado River is one of the great rivers of the State. It runs through about twenty sections of block 97. It is not a navigable stream where it flows through said block, but it is permanent water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-11\">\u201c 22. The Elgin survey of block 97, adopted by the deputy surveyors, Williams and Berry, is not made in conformity to the fifty-cent act of 1879 and its amendment in 1881, as the surveys made on the Colorado River, which is permanent water, cross the same and have a greater frontage thereon than one-half the square of such survey, and that, too, where they are not surrounded by older surveys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-12\">\u201c 23. On the 16th of May, 1883, Bacon and Graves tendered to the Treasurer of the State $80,640, and on May 19, 1883, tendered to said Treasurer the further sum of $104,640, in payment of surveys numbers 118 to 291, inclusive, block G, in Borden and Scurry Counties; surveys numbers 1 to 119, inclusive, block M, Scurry County; surveys numbers 1 to 52, inclusive, block N, Scurry County; surveys 1 to 117, inclusive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>block B, Scurry County; and surveys 1 to 135, inclusive, block G, Borden and Scurry Counties; which said tenders were refused and declined by said Treasurer. In January, 1891, Bacon and Graves paid to said Treasurer on said lands $149,320, which was received by him under protest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-4\">\u201c24. In December, 1882, the land in controversy was worth $1 per acre. At present it is worth $2 per acre for dry land, and $3 per acre for watered land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-5\">\u201c From the foregoing facts I conclude, that the plaintiff, The State of Texas, is entitled to recover in this suit on each of the following grounds, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-6\">\u201c1. Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase this land, and could not purchase under the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-7\">\u201c 2. They did not comply with the law by having the land surveyed as was required by law, and therefore could not purchase it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-8\">\u201c 3. The survey as adopted was not made in accordance with law; is incorrect\u2014totally so\u2014in having a greater frontage on permanent water than is permitted under the Acts of 1879 and 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-9\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>4. Bacon and Graves have never paid or offered to pay for said land until long after the expiration of the time allowed and required by law. The purported surveys of many of the sections of land, for which they tendered payment on May 19, 1883, were made after the fifty-cent act was repealed, and Bacon and Graves did not separate or offer to separate, in their tender, the surveys made before the repeal from those made after, and there was consequently no legal tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-10\">\u201c5. At the time Graves entered into an agreement with Bacon to purchase these lands, he was an employe of the General Land Office, and his action was against the civil and criminal laws of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-11\">\u201c6.

The question arises as to whether or not a legal survey can be made by adopting another survey. In the case of Horton v. Pace, 9 Texas, 84, the court say: \u201c It was competent for the surveyor to adopt that survey for the plaintiff, and the case of Lynn v. Scott has been relied on as authority. We do not question the surveyor\u2019s right to adopt a previous survey that he thinks correct, as was done in that case.\u201d The right to adopt field notes depended only upon the surveyor\u2019s belief in the correctness of the field notes which he adopted. The case of Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 231, is to the same effect; as also those of Lake v. Wafer, 16 Texas, 570; Styles v. Gray, 10 Texas, 506; and Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 392.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIOF\">4. This brings -us to the question as to whether or not the surveyors could lawfully write field notes from the data they had in their possession, obtained from actual knowledge of the surveys, which they had run and knew to be correct. All of the decisions hold that such could be done. This rule was expressly recognized in Jones v. Burgett, 46 Texas, 292, and Doswell v. De la Lanza, 20 Howard, 33, as well as in many other \u25a0cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b724-10\">5. Section 7 of the Act of July 14, 1879, under which these lands were purchased, provides: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to give such general and specific instructions to surveyors, in relation to the surveying of the public lands, under the provisions of this act, as may best subserve the interests of the State, and carry into force and effect the intent and purpose of this act.\u201d It will be observed, that under the provisions of the very act which offered these lands for sale, it was the duty of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to formulate rules and give instructions to surveyors. It is to be presumed, that the Commissioner, in obedience to the law, gave such general and specific instructions as were deemed by him necessary, and that the surveyors followed the instructions given, and that these surveys have been made in accordance therewith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b724-13\">6. Contractor Thomson surveyed 1,000,000 acres for the University. Land Commissioner Walsh deemed it of no importance whether the corners to each 640 acres survey were established before or after the contractor obligated himself to establish them. Contractor Thomson had done a great deal of this work before he took the contract, and it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>distinctly understood between him and the Commissioner that he should adopt the work already done by him in returning field notes for the University under his contract. Land Commissioner Hall, under the Act of 1887, very wisely instructed State Surveyor Strong to adopt the work of the United States Government in Greer County for the State, in so far as it could be done under that provision of our law that requires surveys on navigable streams to front thereon only the half of the square thereof. The instructions were to practically adopt the whole of the United States survey of Greer County.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-4\">7. The law adopted by the Revised Statutes is not more exacting than the old law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-5\">8. Article 3908, Revised Statutes, was a continuation of the law then in force with reference to making actual surveys on the ground; and was not a re-enactment of the law then in force, nor the enactment of a new law in reference thereto. It is substantially and in fact the same as the statute and the common law in force prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes. Report of Commission of Codifiers, 2 Sayles\u2019 Civ.

An actual survey has been required by all our laws providing for the disposition of the public domain; but while this is true, still the Supreme Court of the Republic and State, by one continuous line of decisions, has established a rule, that the field notes of a survey made by one surveyor may be adopted by another. Upon this rule of property the rights of appellants in this case depend, and under it the officers of the State acted in making appellants\u2019 surveys. Jones v. Menard, 1 Texas, 789; Howard v.

The only statement to the contrary was the certificate of W. L. McGaughey, Land Commissioner of the State. He certifies, \u201c That the field notes of 26 to 32, block M, both inclusive, of the alleged Bacon and Graves survey, in Scurry, Borden, and adjoining counties, were never filed in the Land Office at Austin, and are not now on file in said office, as appears from an examination of the files and other papers connected with said surveys.\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-9\">2.

What record and file in his office will show that they were never filed there ? He could not speak of his own knowledge, because it was limited, as he himself stated. Buford v. Bostick, 58 Texas, 67; Rev. Stats., arts. 3805, 3910.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-5\"><em>jResponsibility of </em>Purchaser.\u2014The court erred in holding that Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase the land, because that issue had been settled by the surveyor who surveyed the lands, and could not again be raised on this trial between the parties at interest. If the law intended the purchaser should be responsible, meaning thereby financially able individually to pay the money at the time the application was made, it was folly to give the purchaser seven months, as the law did, from the date of his application to the day on which he was required to pay the money. This point is settled by the case of White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 342.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-6\"><em>Tender of Purchase </em>Money.\u2014The court erred in holding that Bacon and Graves never paid or offered to pay for said land until long after the expiration of the time allowed and required by law; for that defendants acquired a vested right by the survey of the lands made prior to the repeal of the law, and their right to the land could not be impaired by the law being repealed, nor by any adverse legislation in respect thereto. The tender of the money was in all respects a lawful and legal tender, as required by law for the purchase of lands, and was in all respects sufficient to pay for those surveyed both prior and subsequent to the repeal of the law.

Carter, 36 Texas, 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-7\"><em>Return of Purchase </em>Money.\u2014The court erred in holding that the State is not bound to return the money paid in January, 1891, to entitle it to a judgment for the land.

The State, by putting the lands on the market for sale and accepting the purchase money, is estopped from denying defendants\u2019 right to the land without returning or offering to return the money it has received for the land, as the State can not in good conscience and equity hold the money and the land too.

The court erred in overruling defendants\u2019 general and special exceptions as contained in defendants\u2019 first amended original answer, for the following reasons: First. Because the petition does not give any proper description of the land or state a proper cause of action. Second. Because the same is purely an action in trespass to try title to lands and for rents, and is such an action as is unknown, except by statute; is not afforded to and can not be maintained by the State against a citizen, for the State can neither be ejected nor dis-seized of her land or her public domain. Third. The petition contained no allegation of fraud or any specific wrongful acts, such as would warrant an action for the recovery strictly of the land in the simple statutory form of action provided by statutory law for one citizen to sue another. Fourth. Because the petition should have been in the nature of a bill in equity, showing the nature and character of plaintiff\u2019s claim and defendants\u2019 wrongful acts, etc., so that defendants could know and would be put upon notice of what charges they were expected to meet, and not be in total ignorance of the claims which the State, in her sovereign capacity, through her Attorney-General, might be permitted to raise on the trial of said cause, thus placing the citizen at a great disadvantage in a contest with the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-5\">2. There is no power or authority in the State, through her Attorney-General, to institute an action purely of trespass to try title to lands and for rents under our law; for the State, in legal contemplation, could not be ousted of its possession by a citizen; and in such an action, if permitted to bring an action purely of trespass to try title, no issue is admissible except one purely of title.

The important question is, whether, under the peculiar facts of this case, applicants may lawfully purchase public lands under the Act of July 14, 1879, as amended March 11, 1881, without having the lands surveyed for them in the field. It is admitted here, that there was no actual survey for Bacon and Graves. The field notes were copied literally by the deputy surveyor Berry from the Elgin survey (which we will show was illegal and void), and were, with only a few exceptions, also literally copied therefrom by the deputy surveyor Williams. Each of these deputies testified that he had done surveying on block 97, of which this land was only a part, but neither could say whether he ever tested the accuracy of the Elgin survey of this particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>land. In other words, their theory is, that having tested some of Elgin\u2019s work and found it substantially correct, they concluded that all of it was, and consequently adopted it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-5\">2. It is submitted that the second conclusion of law found by the trial court is correct. In order to give them a right to purchase, the statute requires that persons desiring to do so shall cause the land \u201cto be surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county or district in which said land is situated.\u201d It is only when the applicant has caused a survey of the land to be made for him that the proposition of the State is accepted, and contractual relations are formed. The State\u2019s requirements must be strictly complied with before any rights attach. It has demanded a survey for the particular purchaser, and it has the right to insist that the demand shall be strictly met. That a survey of the land has been previously made is of no consequence. In view of the many and gross inaccuracies in surveys throughout the State, known to the Legislature and this court, it was but a measure of caution and protection against land spoliation that a survey for the person desiring to purchase should in all cases be made. The law having made it a prerequisite that the person desiring to purchase \u201c may do so by causing the tract or tracts which such person desires to purchase to be surveyed,\u201d it is not competent for any executive officer or the courts to dispense with the requirement and substitute for it a survey made many years before for another person or corporation. Act of July 14, 1879, sec. 2; White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 340; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-6\">3. The State has the right to insist that its proposition, that the proposed purchaser shall himself cause the land to be actually survejmd in the field, shall be strictly met. Without it there is no contract. State v. Work, 63 Texas, 148; White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 340; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5; Yosemite Valley Cases, 15 Wall., 77; Frisbie v.

(enlarged ed.), secs. 323, 330, 334, 1420.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-7\">4. The proposition of the State, that if they would cause the land to be surveyed they might purchase it, was accepted by Bacon and Graves by filing their application, but was not performed. They say, in effect, we will not cause the land to be surveyed, but will cause the surveyors to adopt and certify to a previous survey which they believe is correct. This is not sufficient, and is not a performance of the contract between the parties. \u201c If one of two parties is to do a thing, whereupon the other is to do something else, the former can not sue the latter for nonperformance until he has himself performed. Nor will it suffice that the thing which the plaintiff has done is as good as what he agreed; it must be the particular thing.\u201d Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), sec. 1420, and authorities above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>5. To require the purchaser to cause a survey to be made, means a survey on the ground. The law requires this; and these deputies falsely certified that the \u201c survey was actually made in the field.\u201d Rev. Stats., art. 4025. Nor can any other construction be placed upon the language of this court in the \u201cagreed\u201d Jumbo Cattle Company case, 79 Texas, 11, where it would not permit so grave a matter to pass unnoticed. Rev. Stats., art. 3908, par. 8; Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284; Baxter v. Traver, 130 U. S., 236.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-4\">6. It is, however, argued by appellants, that because Commissioners Walsh and Hall, in one instance each, permitted the adoption of surveys, it should be done here. Walsh acted under the only statute which expressly authorizes the adoption of surveys, as we have shown (2 Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes, articles 4025, 4026, 4037a); and Hall acted under a statute which clothed him with discretion as to the character of the surveys to be made. 2 Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., arts. 4038, et seq. Both Walsh and Hall testify that they never authorized the adoption of surveys under the fifty-cent act. Though the surveyors were officers of the State, it was incumbent upon Bacon and Graves to see that their acts were in accordance with law. Land Co. v. Thomson, 83 Texas, 169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-5\"><em>7. </em>Bacon and Graves never surveyed, actually or otherwise, the land according to the acts of 1879 and 1881 offering the land for sale, but simply had the surveyors copy field notes and pretend to adopt them ; and therefore they never complied with the State\u2019s offer, and are not entitled to the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-6\">8. The custom of running outside and base lines and doing the other work in the office can not supersede the statutes and decisions. Laws, on Usages and Customs, 455, sec. 218; Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), secs. 453, 454, 460. What work was done by Elgin was absolutely void, for he was surveying out of his district. Cox v. Railway, 68 Texas, 226. The land was also in the Texas &amp; Pacific reservation in July, 1873. Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-7\">9. If the court should hold that Elgin made a survey of the land in 1873, then it is submitted that the survey, as purported to have been made by him, was grossly inaccurate and incorrect, and for this reason could not be adopted. Neither the State nor other party can be forced to accept the adoption of these surveys. Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 396.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b729-8\">10. The cases cited by appellants in their contention for the adoption of the field notes are based upon surveys prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes, when the requirements for surveys were not so strict as now, as said by Mr. Justice Stayton in Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 397. Compare 1 Pasch. Dig., arts 4522, 4523, 4528; Rev. Stats., art. 3908; Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 397; Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 11. The manner of making surveys was not so specific as now. Since then the Revised Statutes have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>been adopted, and an actual field survey is required by article 3908, subdivision 8; permanent monuments and objects must be put up, and chain carriers must be sworn. Under these mandatory statutes a surveyor may not throw away his chain and compass and make surveys with an adjustable belief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-5\"><em>Certificate of the Land </em>Commissioner.\u2014The court properly admitted in evidence the certificate of the Land Commissioner, who gave not his own knowledge of the transaction, but the result of an investigation of \u201c the files and other papers connected with said survey.\u201d Rev. Stats., art. 2253. But if it shall be thought that the court erred in admitting the certificate, the error did not injuriously affect appellants, because the court having correctly held, upon several fundamental grounds, that appellants never lawfully purchased the land, this question is immaterial. Tripis v. Weslow, 18 S. W. Rep., 684. Again, there being sufficient \u2022evidence to support the finding that these field notes were not returned, without considering the certificate, it will be presumed that it was disregarded by the court in rendering judgment. Lindsay v. Jaffray, 55 Texas, 639.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-6\"><em>Graves an JSmploye of the Land </em>Office.\u20141. The court correctly found, that at the time Graves entered into the agreement with Bacon to purchase these lands, he was an employe of the General Land Office, and his action was against the civil and criminal laws of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-7\">2. It is expressly agreed, that \u201c Graves was employed in the General Land Office at Austin as draughtsman for the entire year 1882, except for the month of December, and that he drew his salary for the entire month of November, 1882, as well as the preceding ten months,\u201d which necessarily includes the 29th and 30th days of November, 1882.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-8\">3. The resignation of Graves was presented and its receipt acknowledged November 29, but neither the one nor the other states when it was to become effective. The agreement above quoted is an explicit interpretation by the appellants that he continued in the service of the State during the entire month of November. Without this interpretation, the result would be the same; for by continuing to draw the salary.Graves is estopped to deny employment. To be complete a resignation must intend and must in fact give up the office. He must let go the salary as well as the authority of the office. Mecli. on Pub. Off., secs. 394, 411.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b730-9\">4. The court also correctly found, that Graves entered into an agreement with Bacon to purchase the land while the former was employed in the Land Office. Bacon testified, that \u201cI had talked the matter over with Graves frequently prior to the 3Qth day of November, 1882. Mr. Graves and myself left Austin on the 29th or 30th of November for Palo Pinto, for the purpose of entering into the business of purchasing the land in controversy.\u201d Rev. Stats., art. 3982; Act of July 14,1879, sec. 3; Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Code, arts. 118, 119; The State v. Work, 63 Texas, 148; The State v.

The payment of the money to the Treasurer in January, 1891, was long after the time in which it was required to be paid, and after the repeal of the law, and the Treasurer was not authorized to accept it or bind the State. His action was a nullity. Act 1879, sec. 5; Laws 1883, p. 2; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 12; Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), sec. 993.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-6\">2. There was no legal tender in' 1883. It will be observed by the court, that on December 1, 1882, Bacon and Graves applied to purchase 61 about 550 sections\u201d of land in one solid body. This land purports to have been surveyed into four blocks between January 17 and 24, 1883, by only two deputy surveyors, and aggregates about 375,040 acres. This transaction, if good for any purpose as a contract, was intended as an entirety and should stand and fall as such. The law authorizing the sale was repealed at 1:30 p. m., January 22, 1883, and took effect from its passage. As a matter of law, therefore, all surveys made on January 22, 1883, and those made after that day, are illegal and void. That is to say, the act having taken effect from its passage, included the day of its passage in its operation. O\u2019Connor v. Towns, 1 Texas, 114; Arnold v. United States, 9 Cranch, 104; Tomlinson v. Bullock, L. R. 4 Q. B.

A tender in bulk was made on all of them. Sections 1 to 12 purport to have been surveyed January 23; as also some of the sections in other blocks. It was the duty of appellants, if in fact they had a contract with the State, to tender the precise amount due for the particular sections of land to which they were entitled, they being separable contracts and obligations.

If the rule be adopted, that the contract to purchase the solid body of land must stand in its entirety, then there was no legal tender. The land was described in the application by metes and bounds. It is claimed to have been afterward surveyed into four blocks of 586 surveys, or 375,040 acres. The tender was only for 370,560 acres, or a difference against the State of $2240 and 4480 acres. 2 Pars, on Con., 6 ed., *639, *640.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b731-9\"><em>Pesponsibitity of </em>Purchaser.\u20141. Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase the land. The surveyor, in the first instance, may pass upon the responsibility of applicants, but his action is not conclusive upon applicants or the State. The former, in a proper case, may compel him by mandamus to file the application and make the survey; and the State, whatever may be the limitations upon its rights, may at least repudiate his official acts when they are designedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>against its interests with the knowledge and sanction of the applicants.

The State, 68 Texas, 535; Sedg. <em>&amp; </em>Wait on Trial Title to Land., secs. 439-445.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b733-4\">HEAD, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AGm\">We adopt the findings of fact filed by the court below, except from finding 20 strike out the words, \u201c were not responsible parties,\u201d and add to finding 23 the following: <em>\u201c </em>By the word \u2018 protest,\u2019 as used in this finding, is meant that the Treasurer of the State-had several times refused to accept this money, and at the time he received it in January, 1891, the parties paying fully understood that the State would contest their claim to this land, and the Treasurer did not-receive the money as a legal payment therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The subject matter of this controversy is 466 sections, or 298,240 acres-of land, situated in Scurry, Borden, and adjoining counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In 1873 the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway Company, for the purpose of locating its land certificates thereon, had a large amount of surveying done in Scurry, Borden, Howard, Kent, and Fisher Counties. This surveying was done by dividing large blocks of land into sections containing 640 acres each, as will be seen by reference to our conclusions of fact, and was done upon the ground in such way as might be regarded as work in the field. The surveying so done by said railway company embraced all of the land in controversy in this suit, but its right thereto-failed by reason of the land at that time being within what is known as the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">On December 1,1882, E. M. Bacon and E. G. Graves made application-to the proper surveyor to survey for them a large part of this Houston <em>&amp; </em>Texas Central Railway Company land, embracing that in controversy in this suit, which they desired to purchase under the Act of July 14, 1879,. amended March 11', 1881, which was generally known as the fifty-cent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The surveyor, instead of doing this work upon the ground, simply adopted the work which had previously been done by the railway company, and copied their field notes from the records in his office, and the field notes so obtained were returned by Bacon and Graves, as to the land in controversy, to the General Land Office within the time required by the law above cited. Bacon and Graves, at the time they returned the field notes, knew how the surveyor had obtained them, and that none of the work had been done in the field. The deputies of the surveyor, however, who appeared from the certificates to the field notes to have done this work, had previously been upon the ground in making other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>surveys, and had seen enough of the railway work to satisfy them of its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The act under which Bacon and Graves were attempting to acquire this land provides, that \u201cAny person, firm, or corporation desiring to purchase any of the unappropriated lands herein set apart and reserved for sale, may do so by causing the tract or tracts which said person, firm, or corporation desire to purchase to be surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county or district in which said land is situated;\u201d \u2022and the question as to whether or not the obtaining of the field notes in the manner above set forth should be considered as their having had the land <em>surveyed </em>within the meaning of this act, constitutes the most important question for our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Prior to the adoption of our Revised Statutes, in prescribing the manner in which surveys were to be made, our law provided, that \u201cThe courses of the lines shall be determined by the magnetic needle, and care shall be taken to determine 'its variation from the pole in the district where the surveys are made. The surveys shall be made with great caution, with metallic chains made for the purpose, and care shall be taken that the place of beginning the survey of each parcel of land be established with certainty, taking the bearings and distances of two permanent objects at least.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Under this law, at an early day, the practice became so common among surveyors to disregard its provisions, by making out field notes in their offices from data obtained otherwise than by work done upon the ground, that the courts in a great number of cases have felt constrained to hold that where the question was raised by subsequent locators, dr third parties adversely interested, such acts on the part of the surveyor would \u25a0constitute a valid appropriation of the land as against such claims. Horton v. Pace, 9 Texas, 84; Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 231; Jones v. Burgett, 46 Texas, 293; Styles v. Gray, 10 Texas, 506; and in Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 392, strong language is used recognizing the adoption of field notes previously surveyed as being a legal survey within the spirit of our law as it stood previous to the adoption of our Revised Statutes. At the same time, it is not to be denied that to constitute a survey <em>strictly </em>within the terms of our law as it has always been, it would be necessary for the work to be done upon the ground in the manner prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">In Stafford v. King, 30 Texas, 269, it is said: \u201cIt is the duty of the surveyor to run round the land located and intended to be embraced by the survey and patent, to see that such objects are designated on it as will clearly point out and identify the locality and boundaries of the tract, and to \"extend a correct description of these objects, natural and artificial, with courses and distances, into the field notes of the survey, in order that they may be inserted in the patent, which will afford the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>owner, as well as other persons, the means of identifying the land that was in fact located and surveyed for the owner.\u201d In Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284, it is said: \u201cActual surveys by which lands granted by the State shall be specifically described and distinguished have always been contemplated and prescribed by our laws. It is true, that under the laws in force when the surveys in controversy were made for the railway company, it was not always regarded as indispensable, however desirable, that the lines of the survey should be actually run and measured on the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Recognizing the great inaccuracies that had frequently resulted from the practices of the different surveyors in attempting to make out field notes in their offices without surveying the land upon the ground, our Legislature, in adopting the Revised Statutes, inserted this provision, (article 3908): \u201cThe field notes of each survey shall state: (1) The county or district in which the land is situated. (2) The certificate or other authority under or by virtue of which it is made, giving a true description of same by numbers, date, when and where issued, name of original grantee, and quantity. (3) The land by proper field notes with the necessary calls and connections for identification (observing the Spanish measurement by varas). (4) A diagram of the survey. (5) The variation at which the running was made. (6) It shall show the names of the chain carriers. (7) It shall be dated and signed by the surveyor. (8) The correctness of the survey, and that it was made according to law, shall be certified to officially by the survey or whomade the same; and also, that such survey was actually made in the field, and that the field notes have been duly recorded, giving book and page. (9) When the survey has been made by a deputy, the county or district surveyor shall certify officially that he has examined the field notes, has found them correct, and that they are duly recorded, giving book and page of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We think the principal object of the Legislature in requiring such strictness in the certificate to be made by the surveyor was to correct the abuse to which the previous law had been subjected as above indicated; and we think it must be conceded, that if the Legislature has the power to condemn what is commonly known as an office survey or office work, and to require its officers, before parting with the public land of the State, to have the surveying actually done in the field, it has done so by the passage of this statute. We know of no case in which the question has been raised as to the validity of an office survey, or the adoption of previous field notes for a survey which should have been made in the field, since the adoption of our Revised Statutes: but our Supreme Court, in several cases, has given strong intimations that its rulings under previous laws would not apply to such surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, cited above, in which the very strongest language is used in upholding such surveys under previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>laws, it is said: \u201c The manner of making surveys was not so specifically prescribed, nor the requirements so exacting, in the year 1874 as are they by the law now in force,\u201d etc. Also, Chief Justice Stay ton, in a dissenting opinion delivered by him in Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 290, uses this language: \u201cI do not understand the holding to be that the field notes returned into the General Land Office were void because not based -on the actual survey of each of the four lines of every section embraced in the block. If such were the holding, it would be useless to refer to -decisions made under the laws in force prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes for the purpose of showing that the rulings of this court have in all preceding cases been to the contrary.\u201d Also, see the opinion of the majority of the court in Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284, quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In Jumbo Cattle Company v. Bacon and Graves, 79 Texas, 12, in speaking of what would constitute a survey of this land under the Acts of 1879 and 1881, it is said: \u201c We think, too, that the agreed statement shows that they have taken all the steps required of them to perfect their right to the land had these acts remained in force. However improbable it may be that this vast quantity of land could have been surveyed into sections of 640 acres each within two days, we feel bound to follow the explicit agreement, that on January 19 and 20, 1883, the said surveyor of Palo Pinto Land District surveyed the lands in controversy into tracts of .640 acres each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">It will be borne in mind that the question presented for decision in this case is not whether the field notes, made out as indicated in the first part of this opinion, constitute such a survey as the officers of the State could adopt, should they see proper to do so, nor whether it is such an absolute nullity as could be taken advantage by a third party; but the question is, does it constitute such a survey within the meaning of the law as the State can be compelled to accept in opposition to its wishes ? The appellants are seeking to enforce against the State an executory con-tract, and base their right to do this upon the ground that they have complied with their part of such contract. In such case, we think they should show that they have obtained the field notes in the manner the State said they should be obtained in its prqposition, and not that they have got as good field notes in some other way as would have been obtained had they complied with the State\u2019s offer. Had an individual owned this large body of land, and had published and offered to sell to any person 640 acres, who would have it surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county in which the land was situated, arid that such surveyor must certify that the work was actually done in the field, we think it would hardly be contended that the proposed purchaser could file his petition against the owner, setting up that the surveyor had copied some field notes for him from the work which had been done by some other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>surveyor years before, and that by reason of the field notes thus obtained he had a right to compel the owner to accept such field notes as a compliance with his offer, and to execute a deed for the land embraced therein; and we see no reason why a different rule should be applied to the State than that applied to an individual under similar circumstances. We know of no case in which the State, as a compliance with an executory contract, was held bound against its wish to accept one of these office surveys, even under the old law; and still less do we believe that it could be compelled to accept such field notes under the law as it was at the time these surveys purport to have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">We think the court did not err in overruling appellants\u2019 special exceptions to the petition of the State. Appellants had filed an application to purchase land under the Act of 1879, giving the description of their desired purchase substantially as set forth in the petition in this case, thereby showing that they assert claim to that part of the State\u2019s land, and we think they can not be heard to say that such description was not sufficient in a petition brought to cancel their claim; besides, the answer filed by appellants contained a sufficient description of that part of the land embraced in the State\u2019s petition which they claimed, and we see no reason why such description would not serve as a basis for the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We also see no objection to the form of the State\u2019s petition. State v. Delesdenier, 7 Texas, 76; The State v. Kroner, <em>2 </em>Texas, 492; Day Land and Cattle Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">We do not now consider it ah open question in this State, that the State, in a suit of this kind, is not required to make a tender of the money received by it. The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 687; The State v. Thompson, 64 Texas, 690; The State v. Rhomberg, 69 Texas, 220; Randolph v. The State, 73 Texas, 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">It will be seen from the conclusions of fact adopted by us, that we are of opinion that the finding of the court below, that Graves was an employe in the Land Office at the time he entered into the contract with Bacon to acquire this land, is supported by the evidence. We think the circumstances disclosed by the record lead to this conclusion, and would have justified a finding that, before he tendered his resignation, Graves and Bacon had come to an understanding as to the terms of their contract, and that Graves\u2019 resignation was tendered in pursuance of this understanding, to enable him successfully to carry out the arrangement that had previously been understood would be made when it might be legally done; but as what we have said disposes of all the land in controversy, and as we have not fully decided as to the effect the agreement above indicated would have in a case where all steps prescribed by the law in the acquisition of the land from the State were taken, after the resignation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>had become complete, we have thought it best to express no opinion, thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We are of opinion that the first conclusion of law by the court below, that Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase this land, and could not purchase under the law, can not be sustained. We incline to the opinion that the question of responsibility, within the meaning of the Act of 1879, was for the surveyor to decide; and if he held them responsible parties and made the survey, this, would be sufficient to hold the land until the expiration of the time allowed the purchaser in which to make payment. We do not believe it was the policy of the law to restrict such sales to persons who, upon investigation of their financial condition, would be found able to pay for the land proposed to be purchased out of their own means, and thereby preclude those equally worthy, who, while not actually owning sufficient property of their own to make the payment, might yet be able, in the time-allowed, to make the necessary financial arrangements. White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">If the court, in its third conclusion of law,' intended to hold that because some of the surveys had a greater frontage of permanent water than is permitted under law, this would invalidate all of the surveys, we do not think the conclusion correct. It will be noted, that under this law the land was only to be sold in tracts of 640 acres, and we think that, under these provisions each tract must be treated as a separate purchase; and while the sections having such excessive water frontage might be held invalid, in so far as it would enable the proposed purchaser to demand title from the State as to them, yet these invalid sections could still be used as a basis to locate and identify the other surveys in the block.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We are also of the opinion, that the fourth conclusion of law by the court below, to the effect that Bacon and Graves did not make a sufficient tender, can not be sustained as to all of the land. As.stated above, we think each section must be taken as a separate purchase, and the tender made by them sufficiently identified all sections upon which they proposed to pay; and the fact that they did not make tender upon all of the sections embraced in the field notes returned by them would only have the effect to invalidate such part of the proposed purchase as was not. designated in their offer to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">By the decision in Jumbo Cattle Company v. Bacon and Graves, 79 Texas, we understand it to be settled that the tender was in time, and that the Treasurer could not defeat their right to purchase by refusing to receive the money .</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">We are of opinion, that the court below erred in admitting the certificate of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to prove that surveys 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 of block M were never returned to the General Land Office (Buford v. Bostick, 58 Texas, 67); but we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>prepared to say that the evidence outside of this certificate was not sufficient to sustain the finding of the court below that these surveys were never in fact so returned. There was no objection to the certificate of the Commissioner to prove that he had made search for the field notes of these surveys, and had been unable to find them in the General Land Office, and that they were not at the time of making said certificate in their proper places; and we think it quite as probable that these field notes-had been lost or mislaid before they reached the Land Office as after, and for this reason the judgment of the court below as to these surveys could be sustained without reference to the objectionable part of this certificate; but as the bill of exceptions shows that the court below must have considered this part of the certificate of the Commissioner as important evidence to sustain its finding upon this point, we are of opinion, that were, it material in the disposition of the case, it would necessitate a reversal as to these surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">We think what we have said sufficiently disposes of the other- assignments of error made by appellants; and as we find no error in the judgment rendered by the court below, we are of opinion that it should in all things be affirmed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\"><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Delivered December 6, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">A motion for rehearing was refused.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Not received by Reporter with records of December.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
