One Chatham, as agent for appellees, accompanied the cattle shipped as aforesaid, and testified as to the injuries received by the cattle; and that he was acquainted with the market value of said cattle at Chicago when delivered; and that he had been engaged in the business of handling and shipping cattle for several years, and knew the condition of said cattle at the time they were shipped and at the time they arrived at Chicago. Whereupon appellees requested him to state what the damage per head to said cattle was on arrival at Chicago; to which appellant objected, on the ground that the question called for a conclusion of the witness; which objection being overruled, the following answer was made: \u201c In my opinion all said cattle were damaged \u00a75 per head.\u201d Appellant having reserved a bill of exceptions to the introduction of this testimony, assigns its admission as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">This question was passed upon by us in the case of Railway v.
