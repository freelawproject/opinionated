After a careful review of. the evidence, we think that the case is one for a jury. The evidence is not entirely consistent, and it is impossible to select a single question and answer, or a single letter, as embodying the actual and entire relations and understandings of the parties. The conclusion of the learned trial judge, that the plaintiff postponed deliveries because of the defendant\u2019s failure to pay for some of the yarn already furnished under one of the contracts, is certainly justified by the evidence. But we think that the other conclusion above referred to would also be justified under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>evidence, and that the case therefore presents a question of fact which should go to a jury, under instructions that will explain and submit the debatable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"AlQB\">&lt;\u00ae=aFor otter cases see same topic <em>&amp; </em>KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
