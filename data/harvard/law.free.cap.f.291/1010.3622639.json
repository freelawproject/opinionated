There were enough errors to repel any theory of accidental coincidence and to warrant a finding of intentional trespass upon appellee\u2019s property. Such a situation justified a further finding that appellant\u2019s copying was not confined to copying appellee\u2019s mistakes. Weil on Copyright Law, pp. 460, 461; Frank Shepard Co. v. Zachary P. Taylor Pub. Co. (C. C.) 185 Fed. 941; Id., 193 Fed. 991, 113 C. C. A. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Since it is impossible for us to determine from this unsatisfactory record what innocent matter, if any, was embodied in appellant\u2019s book, we cannot predicate error on the court\u2019s action in enjoining the entire book. Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S. 617, 9 Sup. Ct. 177, 32 L. Ed. 547; West Pub. Co. v. Lawyers\u2019 Co-op. Pub. Co., 79 Fed. 756, 25 C. C. A. 648, 35 L. R. A. 400; Chicago Record-Herald v. Tribune Ass\u2019n (C. C. A.) 275 Fed. 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">Respecting appellant\u2019s contention that appellee came into equity with unclean hands, in that if copied largely from a third party\u2019s directory, we find that the record does not require us to deny the trial judge\u2019s right to accept appellee\u2019s affidavits as establishing that appellee\u2019s book was based wholly upon independent and original matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
