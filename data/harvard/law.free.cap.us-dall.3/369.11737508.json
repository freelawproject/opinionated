The laws of Holland cannot .bind the people of Friezeland, therefore to decide according to the firlt maxim, the .will would not be. good in-Frieielaml ; but by the third maxim its validity is fupported, and by that judgment is given in its favour.

It often happens,- that young people deiirous of forming improper connexions,- and to fanftion their illicit intercourfe with the ceremony of marriage', go into Eaft Friezeland, or. other places, in which the confentof curators or guardians is - not nec\u00e9flary to marriage, according to the- Roman laws. There they celebrate marriage and prefencly return to their country\u2014 1 think, that this is a manifell fraud or evaiion of- our'iaw, and therefore that the magiilrates here, are Bot obliged by the l^w of nations to acknowledge fuch marriages'or to hold them as vdlid ; efpecially-with refpeft to thofe^ who tranfgrefs and evade-their own laws knowingly' and intention\u00e1lly. Moreover, not- only, the contrail of marriage itfelf,. properly and regularly celebrated in one place, is good in all places, hut the rights and incidents which attend it where celebrated, attend it e-lfe\u2014 where. In'Holland married people have a communion of all their g.iods, uniefs it be oiherwife exprefsly covenanted by them.; this will )ie the effect, as to goods lituatcdin Friezeland, although there marriage only occalions a-common rifq'ue of profit and lofs,notof che goods thcmfelves; therefore the Frisians remain after the marriage each one, bothhulband and wife, feparate owners of their goods lituaced in Holland! When however the married couple -remove from the one Hate or.-province to ih.\u00e9other, whatever is afterwards-acquired or falls to either, is not iu common, but held by diftinft.right, and what was before made common between them, will be either in common or otherwife as they direft : as Sandius lays it down who tells us, B. a. dc is tit. 5. def. 10. there was a difpute among the learned doftors whether immoveable.goods, litu-ueJ in another country, were to be affected and regulated by the rules as we have laid it down.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The place, however, where 2he contraft is entered into, is not to be excluii veiycqulidered :*ifthe parties haclrin contemplation another place at'the time of the contraft, the laws of the latter, will be.pieferrcd iu the coiiftruftion of the contraft. - \u25a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b384-5\">There are perfons who utiderftand tliefe perfonal rights to the following extent, that whoever, in a certain place, is of full age, or a minor, a child-, or put'out of rhe controul of the father, will-enjoy\u2019 the fame fights, anil be fubjeft-to the fame difabilities, as in the place where he became fuch a character, or was fo reputed ; and whether the fame thing would, or would not, have happened in his-own country,-ftill that the fame confequence neceiiarily follows* It appears to me, s that this is laying down, the rule too broad, and would fubjeft. ns to a f&gt;ur-thenfome'inconveni'enc by the laws of our neighbours. .An. example will make liie thing plain :'A child hot emancipated or exempted from the power of his Father, and who has nor ceafed to be one of his family* cannot make a wil 1 in <em>Fnexfand* </em>.

The laws of every empire have force within the\u2019 limits of that government, and are obligatory upon all who are within its bounds.' '</p><p id=\"b378-11\">\u2022 2d.

All bufi-. nefs and tranfa\u00e9lions in court, and out of court, whether teftamentary or other conveyances, or acts, which are regularly done according the law.of any particular place, are valid- even where a different law prevails, and where, had they been fo' tranfacted, they would not have been valid. On tne contrary, tranfa\u00e9lions'and acts which are executed,' contrary to the laws of a country, \u00e1s they are void at firlt,.'never can' be good and valid, and this applies,' not only with refpect to thofe . who have their reiidcnce in-the place of the contract; but tliofe, who were there only occafi\u00f3nally ; under this exception only, that if the rulers of another people would be affe\u00e9ted by an'y peculiar inconvenience of an important nature, by giving this effe\u00e9t.to- tranfa\u00e9lions performed in another country, according to the laws of the place they are in, ftich particular place is not bound .to give effe\u00e9t to thole proceedings, or to coniider them as valid within their j urifdi\u00e9tion. \u2022 It is worth, wl\u00fci\u00e9 10 exemplify the. principle by examples and inftances.</p><p id=\"b379-9\">In Holland a laft will and tefta'uient may be made before a notary, and two witneffes : In Friezeland,jt is of no effe\u00e9tunlefseltablilhed and \u25a0 witneffed by feven witneffes. <em>,</em></p><p id=\"AUGE\">Wbat-we have laid with .refpeft to wills applies equally to conveyan-. ees to take effeft during th'e life of the grantor: Provided a cpintraftf is made accorcling to -the law of the. place, in which it is entered into; throughout, in court, and out of court, even in tbofe places where fuck a mode of contrafting is not allowed; ic w-ill be fupported. For example : In a certuin place particular kinds of mcrchanc'iz\u00e9 are prohibited, if fold there the contradi is void\u2014but if the fame \u2022 merchandize were fold elfewhere, in a place,, where there was not any'prohibition, and a .fiil.t is brought in a place where they were prohibited,.the purehafer will be condemned'and the fuit maintained, becaufe the 'con'lraft was good'in its origin, where made. B.ut if the merchandize fo.ld in another'place, where they were .prohibited, were'delivered, the' purehafer Would not be condemned, becaufe it would'be contrary to the-law.and conveni-enee of the government where they were fold,-and an aftion|wo,uld not be countenanced wherever inftunted,-even to compel the delivery'; for, if on the delivery being'.made 'the purchSfcKsvonld nor p\u00e1y'the price, -he xvould he bound, if at all, not by the coinraft, but that having got' the gopds pf;an\u00f3ther, .it would be unreaf\u00f3nabl\u00e9 that he ihould-enrich him-felf at the expence and lofs of another. - '</p><p id=\"APD\">' The rule is equally applicable to adjudged cafes. <em>A </em>fentence pronounced in any-place, or a pardon granted by thole w ho had j urifdiftion, has equal effeft every where. Nor is it lawful for thc.magiftrates of'ano-thcr commonwealth, to profeedte, or fuffer to be profe,rated, a 'fecond time, one who has been abfolved or pardoned, although without a fufv ' Jieient reafon. \u25a0 Still however under this exception, that no evident danger-or inconvenience refult from it to the other commonwealth, &gt;as an inftabce \u2018within ourown memory may exemplify.. Titius having ftruck .a man on the head, on the-borders <em>the limits') </em>of Friezeland, who the following-night difcharged a great deal <em>of </em>blood at thendfe, and, after having fupped and drank heartily, died. Titiuscicaped into Tranfy Iva\u2014 n\u00eda. B.eing apprehended there as it appears voluntarily, lie wis tried and,acquitted, upon the fuggeftion'that the mail did not die of the wound. This fentence was fenc into Friezeland, and'he applied-for a dif-charge from' t.he profecution as having been acquitted.\u2014Although-the manner of trial was not very exceptionable, yet the court of Friezeland was much difghfted at the idea of exenfing the delinquent, and giving effeft tw the foreign proceedings, although demanded by the TiaVity-lva-hians.; becaulc the flight into the neighbouring government-, 'a-lift the pretended procels appeared roo evidently calculated to elude the jurif-diftion of Friezeland ; which is the.exception under the third' maxim. The fame principle is obfervtd in judgments tefpefting civil matters as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>is evident front the following example within.our rriemory. A citizen of Harlem made a- contraft with one\u215b Groningen and fubmitted himfelf to the Judges of Groningen. Being cifbd by virtue of this fubmiflion, and not appearing he wasebndemned, as contumacious. Execution of tlic fenteuce. being demanded, it was doubted whether it ought tobe .granted in a Frizian court. The'reafon of'doubting was, that by force of the fubmiflion, if he was not'found in theforeign territory, they could riot proceed agaimt him as conrftmaciou's, as we {hall fee eifewhere : nor-vvitliouc prejudice to our jurifSietio'n and alfo of our citizens,- could ef-fetft be given to'fuch fentencei. However it was allowed at that time, - certairi magiftrates concurring, .that it ihould' not be permitted to the Frisians to examine by what principle ilie'fentence pafled at Gro-ningen could be juftifu-d, but only whether it was valid according to the lay.- of the place. Others were governed- by the .following reafon, .that tiie magistrate at.Harlem on requeft had. granted a-citation which he oiight rather not to have done, and the Amfterdam magiftrate denies the execution of the lenience pa.flcd againft .the abfent, being cited to the court of Friezeland by an gdidt founded on the terms of the fubmiflion arid condemned without being heard, and that fuch proceedings ought not to af\u00edeft any one. With this opinion I'concur, on account of the re-ftriclion contained in the third axiom. . . \u215b</p><p id=\"b381-5\">Again: It liasbeen made a queftion, whether if a contradi is entered into at any fuppofed place, abroad., and an -a ilion is commenced with us, and .the rule was different here, and there, either in allowing'or denying the adlion, which law is to govern ?' Fo-inftance: A Frizian becomes a debtor ir. Holland on account of merchandize fold there, and is filed in. Friezeland after the expiiation of two yeai s ; the aril of limitation is pleaded which bars fuch-aclio.ns with us aliera'iap.fe-of two years ; the creditor replies that in Holland; wb-re the contract was made,, inch pie-feription and limitation do not exift * and' therefore is not to be u-iged againft him in this cafe.

The reafon js, that acls1 of limitation, and modes of execution, do not belong to the efleyce of the vomr\u00e1i\u00edh, but to the time and manner of bringingfnits, which is a-'diftim't thing, and therefore, ifis eitabliihed upon the bell ground, that in entering a judgment, the law of the place where it- is rendered, is to govern, although, it refpeits a contract made eifewhere\u2014Sandhis B. 1.

The other\"an-l\u2019wer is, ihat it is'nut fo much liy force of law, as by the confent of the parties reciprocally communicating their .rights to each other, by which means-a change,-or modification of property may arife, not lefs from matrimony than.any other contract!</p><p id=\"b382-8\">\u00bfvery one-is conlide-red as having contrafted in that place, in which he bound hijnfelf to pay or perform any citing \u00bf..21. <em>de. 0. &amp; </em>v/. and the place where matrimony is contrafted is not fo much the place where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the ceremony is performed, \u2022 as where they exped\u00ed and intend to live and fettle. It happens daily, that men in Friezeland, natives or fojourn-ers, marry wives in Holland, which they immediately bring intoFrieze-land. And if at the time ot the marriage, they intended imme\u2014 diately-to let-tie in Friezeland, there will not in fuch cafe be a com'mu-nity of goods. Although they make no fpecial marriage contradi,\u2019not the law. of Holland, but of Frieze!andrwill govern : thelatter, not the former, is the place f their contradi.</p><p id=\"b383-6\">There is a further application of the reliridlion fo often mentioned.

For example, the oldeft and firit <em>hypothecation {mortgage) </em>of a moveable, is to be preferred even againft a third pofleffor, by the law of Cajfar, and in Friezeland, not among the <em>Moravians- </em>therefore if any one upon inch an <em>Hypothecation </em>proceeds to'demand the article from a third perl\u00f3n, he /hall not be heard, but his fuii rejected ; becaufe the right of the third perl'on to that chattel., '/hall not be taken away, by the law of another jiirifdiction or territory, t.ct us enlarge this rule to the following extent:</p><p id=\"b383-7\">If the law of the place i'n another government is contrary to the law . of our Hate, in which alfo a contradi is made, incotiliftent with a contract celebrated and made in another place, it is reafonable in fuch cafe, that we /hould obferve our own law, rather.than a foreign law. For example:</p><p id=\"AL\">In Holland, matrimony is contracted with, this agreement, that the wife /ball not be refpcnlible for the debts contracted by the hulband only; although this is a private contract, it is faid to he valid in Holland, to the prejudice of the creditors, with whom the husband ihall af-terwards contract debts, but in Friezeland fuch a kind ,of contract would not be binding unlefs publiflied, nor would ignorance of the 11c-eeflity ofmaking it public, be an excufe according to the law of Ctefar and equity. The hu/band contracts debts in Friezeland, and the wife is fued as jointly refpo\u00f1fible, and liable for one half,of the debt: She pleads her marriage contract\u2014the creditors reply that this contract is contrary to the laws of Friezeland, becaufe not publiflied\u2014and this is th\u00e9 rule with us, wbere the marriage-was'contracted here ; as I lately gave my opinion when confulted upon the point. But thofe who con .'actecjjn Holland, and in vvhofe favour, the debts were contracted .there, were non-fuited, notwithftanding their fuit was brought in, Frjezeland, becaufe, as far as refpccted them, the, law of the- place,' where the marriage w!as contracted, not the laws of the two countries,, came into confiderarion.
