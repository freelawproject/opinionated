The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>defendant assigned numerous grounds of demurrer to the indictment, the court overruled the demurrer, there was a trial by jury, and from the judgment of the court, pronounced upon a verdict of guilty as charged in the inclictinent, accompanied by a fine of $50, the defendant appeals.</p>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b215-9\">\n<em>Violating Prohibition Law.</em>\n</p><p id=\"b215-13\">Heard before Hon.

The indictment was not subject to demurrer because it failed to name the party to whom the liquor was <em>sold.</em>\u2014Jones <em>v. State, </em>136 Ala. 118, 34 South. 236; <em>Grace v. State, </em>1 Ala. App. 211, 56 South. 25. Section 7 of the act approved August 9, 1909 (General and Local Acts Special Session 1909, p. 12), which is \u201can act to promote temperance,\u201d etc., declares that the act shall be liberally construed, so as to accomplish the purpose thereof, which is to promote temperance and discourage the use and consumption of prohibited liquors. Giving a <em>strict </em>construction to every word in the above indictment, it was plainly sufficient. It may charge more than the law now requires such an indictment to charge, but it plainly charges the defendant with a violation of our present prohibition laws.\u2014Code, \u00a7 7353; <em>Mitchell v.
