The following bill of exceptions was taken :</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4m\" pgmap=\"46(57) 47(53)\">\u201cBe it remembered, that on the trial of this cause there was no evidence that the defendant held or occupied the premises by the assent or permission of the plaintiff, except a conversation which defendant had with the plaintiff\u2019s agent, in which the plaintiff\u2019s agent wished the defendant to agree to pay a specific rent, and in which the defendant made no other objection than to the amount of rent required, and offered a smaller sum which was not agreed to, and defendant continued to occupy and use the premises. Defendant also offered in evidence an instrument between himself and one Thomas S.

The cause was submitted to the Court, on evidence, without the intervention of a jury, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff in the Circuit Court.</p> <p id=\"b48-7\" pgmap=\"48\">From the bill of exceptions it is very clear, on the evidence stated in it, that there is nothing to support the judgment. It does not appear that the relation of landlord and tenant existed between the parties to the action. An offer to hire, and a refusal to pay rent, negatives the idea of a contract, instead of supporting one by inference ; besides there is no proof how long the party occupied the premises, nor was there any promise to pay any specific sum for rent, nor has the value of the use of the ground been shown. So far as there is evidence of value, the defendant has shown it to be fifty dollars per annum, under an arrangement with a third person under whom the defendant below claimed to use the premises and ferry.</p> <p id=\"b48-8\" pgmap=\"48\">We cannot doubt that the judgment should be reversed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b48-9\" pgmap=\"48\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
