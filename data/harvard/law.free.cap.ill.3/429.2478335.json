The first described the notes, and alleged they were each endorsed by defendant to the plaintiffs, on the day of their date. The second count, as amended, described the notes, and alleged that the note first above mentioned was endorsed by defendant to plaintiffs January 29, 1838, and that the second note above mentioned was endorsed to the plaintiffs by defendant on the day of its date. Each count alleged the insolvency of the makers of the notes, and the last diligence.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\" pgmap=\"448\">To this declaration the defendant pleaded three pleas in bar, as follows, to wit:</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\" pgmap=\"448\">1st plea: Actio, non; \u201c Because, he says, that at the time this defendant made the endorsements on said notes in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration mentioned, William H. Schooler, to whom this defendant sold said notes and made said endorsements, expressly agreed, that this defendant should not be held liable upon said endorsements, or either of them, and upon this said agreement, defendant made said endorsements, and upon none other\u201d 8tc., 8tc. 2d plea: Actio, non; \u201c Because, he says, that said endorsements made by defendant, on said promissory notes, as set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, were made by said defendant after said notes became due, to wit, on the 25th day of June, A. D. 1838, at the county aforesaid, to William H. Schooler, one of the endorsers of said notes, without any consideration whatever, at the request of said William H. Schooler, and for the only purpose of enabling said Schooler to sue upon said notes in his own name, and with the express agreement of said Schooler with this defendant, that he, the said defendant, should not in any way be held liable on said endorsements;\u2014 and defendant further avers, that said notes were sold and delivered to said Schooler sometime before said endorsements were made, and after said notes had become due; and the said Schooler, at the time of such sale and delivery of said notes to him by said defendant, purchased them of the defendant for an amount much less than the amount payable on the face of said notes, to wit, the sum of two thousand dollars, and at his said Schooler\u2019s own exclusive riskand a verficaation. The 3d plea is like the second, except the following averment is added, to wit: \u201c And the defendant avers, that the plaintiffs, at the time said notes were endorsed and delivered to them by the said Schooler, well knew that said endorsements were made by the defendant without consideration, and of the making of the agreement with the said Schooler, as aforesaidand a verification, &amp;c.</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\" pgmap=\"448\">To the first and second pleas of the defendant, the plaintiffs demurred generally, and the defendant joined in demurrer, which the Court sustained.</summary><summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\" pgmap=\"448(60) 449(14)\">To the defendant\u2019s third plea, the plaintiffs replied, precludi non; \u201c Because, they say, that at the time the said notes in the said declaration mentioned, were endorsed by the said Schooler to the said plaintiffs, they had no notice of any contract or agreement of said Schooler with said Hayes, or want of consideration as set forth in said plea of said defendantand tendered an issue to the country, which was joined.</summary><summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\" pgmap=\"449\">The cause was tried at the April term, 1839, before the Hon. Thomas Ford. Verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiffs for $5837,87, the amount of the notes and interest.</summary><summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\" pgmap=\"449\">On the trial the following bill of exceptions was taken :</summary><summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\" pgmap=\"449\">\u201c Be it remembered, that on the trial of this cause, the said plaintiffs produced as a witness, Hugh N. Schooler, to prove that the said plaintiff had no knowledge of the facts stated in the defendant\u2019s plea at the time of the endorsement of the notes by W. H. Schooler, described in the declaration to them; and upon examination it appeared that the said Hugh N. Schooler was one of the endorsers of said notes to the said plaintiffs, and that judgment of this Court has already been obtained by said plaintiffs against him for the amount of said notes and interest; whereupon the said defendant objected to the said witness, as interested and incompetent; but the Court overruled said objection, and permitted the said Hugh N. Schooler to testify, that, at the time he endorsed said note to the plaintiffs, they had no knowledge of the facts stated in the plea, so far as he knew ; and also, that they had no such knowledge before said endorsement, as far as he knew. To which decision of the Court in overruling said objection, and permitting said Schooler to testify as aforesaid, the said defendant excepts, and prays the Court to sign and seal this his bill of exceptions, which is done.</summary><summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\" pgmap=\"449\">\u201cThomas Ford, [seal.]\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-9\" pgmap=\"449\">The cause was brought to this Court by writ of error, and the following error assigned:</summary><summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-10\" pgmap=\"449\">1.
