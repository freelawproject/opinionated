He pleaded not guilty. A change of venue was taken to McHenry county, and at the April term, 1840, of the McHenry Circuit Court, the Hon. John Pearson presiding, the defendant was convicted, and sentenced to the penitentiary for one year. A motion in arrest of judgment was made by the defendant, and overruled by the Court.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\" pgmap=\"461\">The indictment charges that the plaintiff in error, on the \u201c twelfth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, in the county aforesaid, [Cook,] a certain falsely made, forged, and counterfeited check, for the payment of money, commonly called a Canal Check, feloniously did utter, publish, and pass,\u201d which instrument is set forth in the indictment in hcec verba, directing the \u201c Branch of the State Bank of Illinois, at Chicago, ninety days after date, to pay to the order of John A.

Spring and G. Goodrich, for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af\" pgmap=\"461\">that the Commissioners had no authority to draw the instrument named in the indictment. They had authority to draw checks on the Bank where the Canal Fund should be deposited. Acts of 1839, 179.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-11\" pgmap=\"461\">A check is a written order, or request, addressed to the person carrying on the business of banks, and drawn upon them by a party having money in their hands, requesting them to pay on presentment, to a person therein named, or to bearer, a named sum of money. Chitty on Bills 322.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-12\" pgmap=\"461\">If the Commissioners had no authority to draw instruments like those described in the indictment, the instrument, if genuine, would be null and void, and not the subject matter of forgery. An instrument, void on its face, is not the subject matter of forgery. Roscoe\u2019s Crim. Ev. 390 ; People v. Shall, 9 Cowen 778.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-13\" pgmap=\"461\">The indictment is bad for not describing the offence within the language of the statute. ' It should have charged the plaintiff with uttering the checks as true and genuine. R. L. 186 ; Gale\u2019s Stat. 211.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-14\" pgmap=\"461(35) 462(11)\">It is generally necessary not only to set forth on the record, all the circumstances which make up the statutory definition of the of-fence, but also to preserve the precise and technical language in which they are expressed.
