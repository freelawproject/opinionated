Defendant then offered to plead to the merits, and asked time to write and file his plea herein, which was not allowed. And thereupon judgment was entered by default against the defendant,\u201d who excepted to the several decisions of the Court.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-13\" pgmap=\"37\">Judgment was entered for $2,218,96. Thereupon an attorney for the defendant made affidavit that the motions were made by mistake; that no appearance was intended to be entered by the defendant, and no appearance was in fact entered ; and that the defendant was entitled to a credit of $ 1400. The plaintiffs then remitted $ 1,452,50, and took judgment for the balance, $ 766,46 and costs. The cause was heard at the June term, 1838, of the Schuyler Circuit Court, before the Hon. James H. Ralston.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-14\" pgmap=\"37\">The defendant appealed to this Court, and assigned for error the decisions of the Court below.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-15\" pgmap=\"37\">A. Williams, for the appellant,</attorneys><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4x\" pgmap=\"37(16) 38(53)\">objected to the scire facias because it did not appear that Stewart and Pearson were authorized to act for the other creditors named in the mortgage, and because it contained no averment that the mortgage was either acknowledged or recorded, or that default had been made in the payment of the money secured by it.

We perceive no error in the decision of the Circuit Court on the points made. The sheriff\u2019s return appears to be full and formally correct.</p> <p id=\"b38-11\" pgmap=\"38\">The writ is conceived to be sufficiently full and descriptive of the cause of action ; and as it recites the mortgage, we do not consider that there can be any valid objection to it. As to the rendition of the judgment, and the application to set it aside, full and entire justice has been done in the cause ; and the amount claimed by the defendant having been allowed, and judgment entered only for the amount admitted by him to be actually due, we are of opinion that the Court did not err in refusing to set aside the default; and therefore the judgment is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b38-12\" pgmap=\"38\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b38-13\" pgmap=\"38\">Note.
