Witness thought $ 20,000. The witness stated he did not know who were the partners at the other trading posts. That it was stated that there was one at Rock Island, superintended by Davenport, one at Flint Hill, under the control of Farnham, and one on Fever river, managed by Farrar, each of which persons, the witness understood, was individually interested to the amount of one third, in each establishment.</p> <p id=\"b515-6\" pgmap=\"515\">The witness also testified, that on the settlement of the accounts of said Fever river establishment, in 1829, there were debts due said concern by while persons, who bad traded with the establishment, as well as the Indians, which were then outstanding-</p> <p id=\"b515-7\" pgmap=\"515\">Another witness for plaintiffs, among other things, testified that he was told in 1829, by Farnham, that the partnership was dissolved. Farnham also said Farrar came poor, but that he would come out well, when he got his share of the allowance to be made to the Sacs and Foxes. That the name of the firm, till 1826, was \u201c Davenport &amp; Farrar,\u201d and from that time till 1829, it was \u201cDavenport, Farrar, &amp; Co. witness further testified to some declarations of Davenport, tending to show that Farrar had an interest in the debts due from the Indians to the Fever river establishment, and that the Indians had agreed to allow $20,000, as due to that establishment.</p> <p id=\"b515-8\" pgmap=\"515\">The plaintiffs then read a deposition in evidence, by which it appears that the $40,000, mentioned in the treaty and law above mentioned, belonged to, and was received by, the American Fur Company, and George Davenport, and Russel Farnham ; but the deponent did not know for what it was appropriated.</p> <p id=\"b515-9\" pgmap=\"515(67) 516(20)\">After the plaintiffs had closed their evidence, and rested their cause, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the Court to instruct the jury by way of nonsuit, for the following reasons : First, That the said plaintiffs show, by their evidence, that the money sued for, arose out of partnership transactions between plaintiffs\u2019 intestate and defendant, and that it is such a case as corpes within the rules of law, that one partner cannot sue his copartner, at common law, for money had and received in indebitatus assumpsit.</p> <p id=\"b516-5\" pgmap=\"516\">Secondly, That there was no evidence before the jury, of defendant\u2019s having had and received any money for the use of Amos Farrar, deceased.</p> <p id=\"b516-6\" pgmap=\"516\">Thirdly, That one partner cannot sue another in this form of action, where there was another partner joined in the contract sued on, and who has since deceased.</p> <p id=\"b516-7\" pgmap=\"516\">These instructions the Court refused ; to which the defendant excepted.</p> <p id=\"b516-8\" pgmap=\"516\">Numerous errors have been assigned ; it is, however,- only necessary to notice the following one, to wit: That the Court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as in case of nonsuit. The law in relation to partnership transactions is well settled, that one partner cannot bring an action of assumpsit against his late copartner, unless, upon the dissolution of the copartnership, the partners account together, and, a balance being stated in favor of one, the other expressly promise payment. The balance so found must be a final balance of all the partnership accounts ; balances which are struck, preparatory only to a final account, are not sufficient to form the subject matter of an action.</p> <p id=\"b516-9\" pgmap=\"516\">The rule above laid down is the law of England, and has received the sanction of the courts in several of the States. In Pennsylvania, where they have no courts of equity, the courts have decided that where accounts between partners have been settled, and a balance struck, which is the act of both parties, the action of assumpsit may be maintained, without an express promise to pay. This is the furthest that any Court has gone in sustaining the action of assumpsit, in favor of one partner against his copartner. Testing the case at bar by these principles, the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs\u2019 below, was wholly insufficient to sustain the action. The first witness introduced by the plaintiffs, only proved that the copartners informed him that their partnership affairs were closed, except bills due from the parties, and the debts due from the Sac and Fox Indians, which were supposed to amount to from $16,000 to $ 20,000. The same witness also stated that there were debts due the firm from white persons, who had traded at the Fever river establishment.</p> <p id=\"b516-10\" pgmap=\"516\">This evidence also proves the dissolution of the firm, and that debts were due to and from the firm.</p> <p id=\"b516-11\" pgmap=\"516\">There was no specific sum found due from one partner to another, and no promise to pay; consequently, whether the rule that an express promise to pay the sum found due on settlement be considered the correct rule or not, will make no difference. We are, however, inclined to the opinion, that a promise to pay is essential to entitle one partner to sue his copartner,</p> <p id=\"b517-4\" pgmap=\"517\">The testimony of the second witness is equally defective. He only relates loose statements of Davenport, that Farrar had an interest in the Indian debts due the Fever river establishment; he does not prove a final settlement of the partnership accounts, and a promise to pay a specific sum to the plaintiffs\u2019 intestate.</p> <p id=\"b517-5\" pgmap=\"517\">The deposition introduced by the plaintiffs, only proves that the $40,000, appropriated by the act of Congress, to Davenport and Farnham, was received by the American Fur Company, and Davenport and Farnham ; the witness did not know for what the appropriation was made. Neither the act of Congress, nor the treaty, state the sum of $ 40,000, appropriated to Davenport and Farnham, embraced the debts due the firm of Davenport, Farrar, &amp; Co., at Fever river ; consequently, the count for money had and received is not sustained by the deposition. It does not even appear from this deposition, how much money was paid to Davenport.</p> <p id=\"b517-6\" pgmap=\"517\">The testimony, consequently, was improperly suffered to go to the jury.</p> <p id=\"b517-7\" pgmap=\"517\">The judgment is therefore reversed with costs, and a judgment of nonsuit entered.</p> <p id=\"b517-8\" pgmap=\"517\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
