Yet if the special endorsement be erased at the trial, the action may be maintained.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-12\" pgmap=\"450\">This was an action of assumpsit instituted in the McDonough Circuit Court, by James Thompson and Francis W. Thompson, for the use of Warburton &amp;, King, on the following note :</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-13\" pgmap=\"450\">\u201c $ 976T\u00b0\u00a55o \u2022 Saint Louis, 16th Nov. 1836.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-14\" pgmap=\"450\">\u201c Six months after date, I promise to pay to the order of J. and F.

W. Thompson.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-18\" pgmap=\"450\">It was also in proof, that the attorney who brought the suit received the note from Warburton &amp;. King, who resided in St. Louis, Missouri, with instructions to collect the same, and pay the proceeds over to them.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-19\" pgmap=\"450\">The Court instructed the jury, that the fact of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney having possession of the note, was a fact from which the jury might presume, prima, facie, that the note was the property of the plaintiffs, and that they had a right to sue on it, notwithstanding the assignment.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\" pgmap=\"451\">Upon this state of the case, there was a verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount of the note and interest; whereupon the defendant moved the Court for a new trial, for the reasons that the damages were excessive, and that the Court misdirected the jury. The Court overruled the motion, and rendered judgment upon the verdict of the jury.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\" pgmap=\"451\">To reverse this judgment Kyle brought the case into this Court, by appeal. \u2022</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-6\" pgmap=\"451\">C.

The variance between the allegations of the declaration, and the proof offered, was fatal.</p> <p id=\"b451-14\" pgmap=\"451\">The plaintiff might have stricken out the assignment on the note at the trial, but he did not do that, but permitted proof to be given of the validity of the assignment, and that the assignees were the legal holders of the note.</p> <p id=\"b451-15\" pgmap=\"451\">The instructions given by the judge were erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b451-16\" pgmap=\"451\">The judgment is reversed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b451-17\" pgmap=\"451\">Judgment reversed,.</p> <p id=\"b451-18\" pgmap=\"451\">Note.
