At the October term, 1838, the Hon. Jesse B. Thomas presiding, the plaintiff obtained leave to file an amended declaration, making additional demises, and from other and different persons than the lessor named in the original declaration. He then amended his declaration by filing a count laying a demise from Henry H. Haynie, and a count laying a demise from Seth Pratt. Thereupon the defendant filed the following affidavit:</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\" pgmap=\"541\">\u201c The said Isaac Johnson being sworn, states that the above named Seth Pratt left the State of Illinois, several years since, with the intention of removing from the State ; that said Pratt has not since returned to the State, as he believes. He further states, that said Pratt, as he is informed and believes, does not reside in the Slate of Illinois. He further states, that the above named Henry H. Haynie conveyed the land in controversy in this suit, on the 8th day of April, 1830, to Samuel Stanfield; that said Stanfield subsequently conveyed the said land to Nicholas Selby, who subsequently conveyed the same to James Tucker, who, as this defendant believes, subsequently conveyed the same to Seth Pratt; that said Seth Pratt conveyed the land to this defendant, on the 16th day of February, 1833, and after this conveyance was made, the above lessor, Murray McConnel, purchased the land upon an execution against said Seth Pratt, and claims the land under and by virtue of that purchase, as defendant believes. This defendant further states, that he does not believe that said Haynie or Pratt ever authorized their names to be used as lessors in this cause. This defendant is satisfied that neither Haynie or Pratt have any claim to said land, or any desire or intention to prosecute suits for the same.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\" pgmap=\"541\">\u201c Isaac Johnson.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\" pgmap=\"541\">\u201c Subscribed and sworn to before me$ this 31st day of October, 1838.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-10\" pgmap=\"541\">\u201c Wm.

The said plaintiff claims said land under a deed from the sheriff of Morgan county, which conveys to the lessor of the plaintiff, all the right and title of one Seth Pratt, who, it is claimed, was the owner of said land. Said defendant also claims under a deed from the same Pratt. Said lessor further states, that Daniel Roberts is a witness in this cause, by which he expects to prove, that the conveyance by the said Pratt to the said Johnson, was made without any consideration, and for fraudulent purposes, and to defraud creditors, and for the express purpose of defrauding the creditor upon whose judgment the execution issued, upon which the land was sold, for which the deed under which the plaintiff claims was made. Said Roberts had been subpoenaed, and he resided at the time he was subpoenaed in this cause, in the county of Scott; but this lessor is now informed that said witness has since removed to Greene county. Said subpoena has not been returned from Scott county ; but the said witness has acknowledged to the said lessor, that said subpoena has been properly served upon him, and that he would attend this Court; but the said witness is not here in attendance upon this Court; and therefore the said lessor prays that said cause may be continued to the next term of said Court.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\" pgmap=\"542\">\u201c M.

A Register\u2019s certificate from the Register of the Land Office at Springfield, to Henry Haynie ; 2d. A deed from Haynie to Stanfield; 3d. A deed from Stanfield to Selby ; 4th. A deed from Selby to Tucker; 5th. A deed from Tucker to Pratt; 6th. A deed from the sheriff of the county of Morgan, conveying all the rights of the said Pratt to the lessor of the plaintiff, which deed of the sheriff bore date the 31st October, 1836, and accompanying which was a transcript of a judgment properly certified to have been filed in the clerk\u2019s office of Morgan county, and made a judgment of the Circuit Court of said county, according to the statute, on the 16th of April, 1835, under which judgment the execution upon which the land was sold, and out of which grew the sheriff\u2019s deed, was issued. The possession of the defendant was proved, at the service of the declaration. The possession and occupancy of said Pratt was proven to have existed before the date of said sale under which the sheriff\u2019s deed was made. Whereupon the defendants objected to the admissibility of the deed from Selby to Tucker, because of the insufficiency of the certificate of acknowledgment, which is as follows :</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\" pgmap=\"543\">\u201c \u2018 State of Illinois, Morgan county.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\" pgmap=\"543\">\u201c \u2018 Personally appeared before me, Presley N.

It was also proved that the defendant had possession of the land prior to the filing of the transcript of the judgment aforesaid. The defendant then moved the Court to instruct the jury, that, if they believed that the deed from Pratt to the defendant, included the land in controversy, then the said deed being prior, in date, to the filing of the transcript of the judgment, under which the levy and sale by the sheriff took place, they must find for the defendant; which instruction the Court gave, and to which opinion of the Court the plaintiff excepted.\u201d</summary><attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-9\" pgmap=\"544\">M.

No reason appears why the deposition was not taken, no evidence that the witness had been served with subpoena, or that his fees had been tendered. The want of diligence was therefore manifest.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-5\" pgmap=\"545\">Upon the question of rejecting the deed offered by plaintiff to show title, the record shows that this question and this deed was wholly immaterial.

They are as follows :</p> <p id=\"b545-10\" pgmap=\"545\">First, The Court erred in striking out the amended counts in the declaration which contained demises in the names of Pratt and of Haynie.</p> <p id=\"b545-11\" pgmap=\"545\">Secondly, There was error in the Court\u2019s refusing a second continuance of the cause.</p> <p id=\"b545-12\" pgmap=\"545\">Thirdly, There was error in rejecting the deed from Selby to Tucker offered as evidence.</p> <p id=\"b545-13\" pgmap=\"545\">Fourthly, There was error in admitting the deed from Pratt to Johnson to be read in evidence.</p> <p id=\"b545-14\" pgmap=\"545\">Upon the first ground, it is to be remarked, that the general rule is, that a\" person ought not to be made a lessor in ejectment, who has no subsisting title.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b545-15\" pgmap=\"545\">Although the two new counts were added to the declaration by the leave of the Court, under an order to amend the declaration, yet it subsequently appearing by the disposition of Johnson, that Pratt and Haynie had no interest whatever in the lands in controversy, the order to strike out the counts added was consequently correctly made.</p> <p id=\"b545-16\" pgmap=\"545(37) 546(30)\">If any person, who may have once had a title, is to be made lessor, the burden of deducing a title from him is taken from the plaintiff, and thrown on the tenant, which would be unreasonable. If there is a case that ought to be excepted from the general rule, it ought to be clearly and specially stated to the Court, and its necessity shown.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b546-5\" pgmap=\"546\">On the refusal to grant the second continuance of the cause, we discover no error; but on the other hand, a great want of diligence on the part of the applicant. The materiality of the testimony of Roberts, had been long previously shown by a deposition of McConnel, on file, and why early steps had not been taken to have his testimony taken by deposition, the witness residing out of the county of Morgan, does not appear ; nor is it perceived that even ordinary efforts had been made to obtain the attendance of the witness. His absence is not accounted for. The refusal to postpone the trial was entirely justified.</p> <p id=\"b546-6\" pgmap=\"546\">On the third ground of the rejection of the deed from Selby to Tucker, the exclusion of the deed is justified on the plainest principles of evidence.</p> <p id=\"b546-7\" pgmap=\"546\">The lessor of the plaintiff and the defendant claiming title from the same source, (Seth Pratt,) it was a matter wholly immaterial whether the deed should be admitted as evidence of title, neither disputing the title of Pratt. It was consequently a matter of no importance from whom Pratt derived his title, for the purpose of determining the main question before the Court.</p> <p id=\"b546-8\" pgmap=\"546\">A ready answer may be given to the point presented by the last ground. The execution of the deed from Pratt to Johnson, which was admitted in evidence, was sufficiently proved by the acknowledgment made before the justice of the peace, and the certificate of the recorder of the county. The certificate by the magistrate is full, certain, and direct. The additional proof contained in the deposition of Harlin, of the handwriting of Pratt, and the subscribing witness, Roberts, is only cumulative, and fortifies the certificate of acknowledgment of the justice.</p> <p id=\"b546-9\" pgmap=\"546\">We are of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b546-10\" pgmap=\"546\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b545-17\" pgmap=\"545\"> 10 Johns. 369 ; 4 Johns. 483.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b546-16\" pgmap=\"546\"> 4 Johns. 483.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
