The declaration would have been had on general demurrer, and is therefore bad on error.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-9\" pgmap=\"559\">1st. Because it does not appear in the declaration, that the Court below, which is a court of limited jurisdiction, had jurisdiction of the suit below.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-10\" pgmap=\"559\">2d. Because there is no sufficient averment of the commencement of, or the proceeding or judgment in, the replevin suit.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-11\" pgmap=\"559\">3d. Because the bond, as declared on, does not show that it was taken in any replevin suit, against Hubbard and Jamison, or any other person, nor is there any averment of such fact.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-12\" pgmap=\"559\">4th. Because there is no averment that Sherman was sheriff of Cook county, either at the time the bond was given, or at the commencement of the action in the Court below.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-13\" pgmap=\"559\">5th. Because there is no averment that the goods were replevied out of the possession of the defendants in replevin, or either of them.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-14\" pgmap=\"559\">6th. Because there is no averment of the interest of the defendants in replevin, or either of them, in the goods replevied.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-15\" pgmap=\"559\">7th. Because it does not appear by the declaration to whom return of the goods was awarded, in the replevin suit.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-16\" pgmap=\"559\">8th. Because there is no averment, that a writ of retorno habendo ever issued in the replevin suit, or of any return thereon made.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-17\" pgmap=\"559\">9th. Because, as the bond is to indemnify the sheriff, and he brings the action and lays damages by himself sustained, he was bound to assign damage, as this was his only interest.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-18\" pgmap=\"559\">10th. Because there is no averment that Hubbard and Jamison, for whose use the suit below purports to have been brought, were the defendants in replevin.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-19\" pgmap=\"559(11) 560(27)\">11th.

The joinder of the two defendants in the declaration, while the judgment is against one only ; this is error.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\" pgmap=\"560\">1st. Because where two or more are sued jointly, and some of the defendants only are served with process, the plaintiff in his declaration should state the fact on whom process has been served, and on whom not, and declare against and proceed to judgment as against all.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-8\" pgmap=\"560\">2d. Because, on the face of the record in this cause, the declaration is against two and the judgment against one only, without any acquittal or non pros, as against the other ; the judgment being general, is bad, if it do not sustain the whole declaration.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-9\" pgmap=\"560\">III. The cause of action, if the declaration be held good, is debt, whereas the judgment is for damages only; this is fatal.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-10\" pgmap=\"560\">1st. Because, in debt on bond, the judgment must be for the penalty, which is the debt, and costs.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-11\" pgmap=\"560\">2d. Because, even if judgment had been entered for the penalty, a judgment afterwards entered for the damages assessed, would be bad in error.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-12\" pgmap=\"560\">IV. The damages are laid at $ 300, the judgment is for $ 399,06 damages.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-13\" pgmap=\"560\">Damages cannot be assessed at a greater amount than they are laid at in the declaration ; and if judgment is entered up for a greater amount, it is bad on error.</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-14\" pgmap=\"560\">V. The judgment is entered up for the plaintiff, and cannot be construed for the use of Hubbard and Jamison.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-15\" pgmap=\"560\">As the plaintiff declared for the use of others, it should have been in form, as in fact for their use, and as it stands, it is, under the pleadings in the Court below, error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-16\" pgmap=\"560\">James Turney, was also for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-17\" pgmap=\"560\">After the writ of error had been sued out in this case, the defendant in error, the plaintiff in the Court below, gave notice to the defendant in that Court, the plaintiff in error here, that he should apply at the next term of the Court below, to wit, the November term, 1837, to have the record amended so as to conform to the action, and by entering a remittitur of all the damages exceeding $ 300, the amount laid in the declaration. At said term of the Court, the Hon. Thomas Ford presiding, the record was thus amended, and by virtue of a writ of certiorari, a new transcript certified to this Court.

Such amendment was authorized by well settled principles.

Judgment was rendered in the late Municipal Court of the city of Chicago, by default, against Hunter, who was alone served with process, the other defendant not having been found. Numerous errors have been assigned, all of which are considered untenable.</p> <p id=\"b562-5\" pgmap=\"562\">It is first objected, that the Municipal Court had no jurisdiction of the cause. This question has been fully investigated, and was settled at the last term, in the case of Beaubien v. Brinckerhoff; <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and has been again decided at this term, it being held that the late Municipal Court of the city of Chicago, being a superior court of general jurisdiction, it will be presumed to have jurisdiction until the contrary is made to appear. No exception having been taken to the jurisdiction in the Court below, the jurisdiction must be presumed. The exception to the declaration, for the want of an averment that a writ of retorno habendo had been awarded by the Court, on the entry of the judgment in the Court, in favor of the defendants, in the action of replevin, is not well taken. There are five counts in the declaration, four of which aver, that by the consideration and judgment of the Court, in which the action of replevin was determined, that return of the goods was ordered and adjudged, at the October term of the Cook Circuit Court, 1836, to the defendants in the action of replevin ; and that the defendant in error refused and neglected to return the goods according to such order and adjudication ; and the last count specially refers to the record of the Court, as evidence of the truth of the averment that return of said goods was ordered and adjudged, and makes profert of such record.</p> <p id=\"b562-6\" pgmap=\"562\">It is a sufficient answer to the objection, to say, that the averment is in language full as broad as the condition of the bond; and no necessity is perceived for the assignment of a breach, in broader terms than the condition of the bond, which the parties had chosen to adopt. To require more, would seem to be a useless act, and one the rules of pleading do not seem to require. We have looked into precedents of declarations in similar cases, and find the averment has not only been omitted in the forms, but has been held to be unnecessary. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b562-7\" pgmap=\"562\">It has also been held, that in this action the breach need not be formally assigned, and the plaintiff will be entitled to recover if a sufficient breach otherwise appear. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> Where the condition is to prosecute the suit with effect, and without delay, a breach in those words would suffice, and proof of two years delay would suffice, without proving a judgment of non pros. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>. The issuing of a writ of retorno habendo is sometimes stated, <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> but is unnecessary. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b562-8\" pgmap=\"562(9) 563(188)\">The numerous other objections assigned as error, are purely technical in their nature, most of which would be cured by the statute of jeofails, did they all exist; but many are not perceived to be in the record. The rendering a judgment against one, when the other is not served with process, is distinctly authorized by the practice act; and without enumerating all the causes here alluded to, it is sufficient to say that there appears to be no ground on which to sustain them. The last error to be considered, is as to the form of the rendition of the judgment, being for damages, when the action is in debt. This supposed error has been obviated by the amended record, sent up by virtue of the writ of certiorari, by which it appears that the late Municipal Court of the City of Chicago, since the filing of the original record in this Court, amended the judgment below so as entirely to remove the objection, which might otherwise have been fatal. Upon the whole case, we perceive no sufficient error to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error, and accordingly affirm the judgment, with costs.</p> <p id=\"b563-5\" pgmap=\"563\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b562-9\" pgmap=\"562\"> Ante 269.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"(2)\"> <p id=\"As9\" pgmap=\"562\"> 1 Chit.
