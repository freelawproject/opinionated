That the defendant was bound to know when the \u201c next term \u201d of the Court would be holden, as the time is fixed by the law of the State ; and no person can plead ignorance of the law. That the summons having been made returnable \u201c on the first day of the next term,\u201d all in addition, with regard to the time when returnable, may be rejected as surplusage. R.

The process was served on the defendant, on the 7th of November, 1839, and judgment was taken by default, at the November term, 1839, which was holden on the third Monday of said month. The only question is, whether this judgment was regular.</p> <p id=\"b240-9\" pgmap=\"240\">It has repeatedly been held, that where more than a term intervenes between the test and return of original process, the writ is a nullity. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> The writ being absolutely void, the cause is out of Court. It was consequently irregular to enter judgment by default. The judgment is reversed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b240-10\" pgmap=\"240\">Judgment reversed.</p> <p id=\"b240-11\" pgmap=\"240\">Note.
