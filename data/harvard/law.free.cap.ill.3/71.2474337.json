The affidavit stated that the defendant expected to prove by said witness, an item of $150, in the defendant\u2019s account of set-off; that he expected to be able to procure the attendance of the witness at the next term ; that he knew of no other witness by whom he could prove the same fact; \u2014 and that the affidavit was not made for delay. The motion was overruled by the Court.</p> <p id=\"b91-14\" pgmap=\"91\">This affidavit clearly shows that every requisite of the statute was complied with, for the purpose of getting the cause continued. Diligence has been used; the name and residence of the witness, and what particular fact to be proved \u2014 all these facts appear in the affidavit.</p> <p id=\"b91-15\" pgmap=\"91\">The Court erred in refusing to continue the cause. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Will county is reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for a new trial<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p> <p id=\"b91-16\" pgmap=\"91\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b91-17\" pgmap=\"91\"> R.
