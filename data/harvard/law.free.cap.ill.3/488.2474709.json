Jones, a justice of the peace of Fayette county, and referred to arbitrators by the parties. The arbitrators awarded thirty-eight cents to the plaintiff, and the justice rendered judgment accordingly. The plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court, where, on motion of the defendant, the appeal was dismissed, at the October term, 1839, the Hon. Sidney Breese presiding. The cause was brought to this Court by writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-5\" pgmap=\"507\">Josiah Fisk, for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEa\" pgmap=\"507\">cited R.

The plaintiffs and defendant, by mutual consent, submitted the decision of their cause to arbitrators chosen by them, who returned an award in favor of the plaintiffs, upon which award the justice rendered a judgment for a certain amount, and costs, in favor of the plaintiffs against the defendant. From which award, and judgment of the justice, the plaintiffs appealed to the Circuit Court of Fayette county. The defendant moved the Court to dismiss the appeal, which motion was sustained by the Court, and the suit dismissed. To reverse the decision this writ of error is brought. The parties in this case thought proper to select this mode of trial by arbitrators.
