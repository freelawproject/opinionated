The plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court, and filed a new bill of particulars, embracing the account filed before the justice, together with additional items amounting to $ 21,45. The Court, on motion of the defendant\u2019s counsel, rejected all of the additional items; and at the June term, 1838, the Hon. Dan Stone presiding, a judgment for $ 1,25, in favor of the plaintiff, was rendered, a new trial granted, and the cause continued. At the March term, 1839, the Hon. Thomas Ford presiding, the cause was again tried. On this trial, the plaintiff offered evidence to prove all the items of his bill of particulars as originally filed in the Circuit Court, which evidence the Court rejected, and gave judgment for the defendant for six cents.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\" pgmap=\"96\">The plaintiff excepted to the opinion of the Court, and brought the cause to this Court by writ of error, and assigned for error both of the decisions of the Court below.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-10\" pgmap=\"96\">O.

It is only for overruling and refusing applications for new trials, that exceptions are allowed, and made causes which may be assigned for error in this Court, not for granting them. The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b97-6\" pgmap=\"97\">Judgment affirmed,.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
