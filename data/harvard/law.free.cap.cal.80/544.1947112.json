B. Drew. The defendants demurred to the indictment, upon the ground, among others, that the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco, in which they stood indicted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>and by which they were to be tried, was without jurisdiction to consider and determine their cause. The demurrer was overruled, and a trial had before a jury. The defendants were convicted as charged. From the judgment therein rendered, and an order denying them a new trial, they have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The principles of law involved in this case, as affecting the jurisdiction of the- superior court of the city and county of San Francisco to try an offense such as the one in hand, were fully discussed and plainly declared in the case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, 78 Cal. 556, and the conclusion reached in favor of the defendants\u2019 contention that the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco had no jurisdiction to try a misdemeanor. It follows, therefore, that the judgment and order should be reversed, and we so advise.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Hayne, C.,. and Belcher, C.
