Munson and Mary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Munson, his wife, in the George Simpson Metallurgical Works, now being erected in West Point, Calaveras County, California, for working base and refractory gold ores; and whereas, the said D. L. and Mary Munson have advanced and paid the said company the sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000); which sum of two thousand dollars said company agree to repay to the said D. L. and Mary Munson out of the first money made and taken out by the said works, blow, should said company fail to pay said sum, or any part thereof, I hereby agree and bind myself to pay the said D.

L. Munson had assigned to her all his interest in the foregoing agreement; that said metallurgical works had proved a failure, and had repaid no part of said investment of $2,000, and that defendant, after notice and demand, had refused to pay any part of said sum of $1,000 as provided in said agreement; that defendant had borrowed $1,850 of plaintiff on the 4th of March, 1884, of which $1,570 was her separate property, and had given notes to her therefor, upon which she sued defendant in a former action, in which it was adjudged that said notes had been paid and invested in said business on the order of plaintiff\u2019s husband. The complaint averred that the said guaranty was intended to secure to plaintiff the repayment of $1,000 of her separate property. Further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-7\"><em>Page &amp; Eells, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-8\"><em>Joseph M.

The complaint, after stating a good cause of action, proceeded to anticipate an expected defense. By thus violating a plain rule of pleading, the pleader rendered his complaint uncertain and ambiguous. But we think it was good against the general demurrer that was interposed. The point made against it is that it shows a former adjudication of the question presented in this case, but we think that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Paterson, J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
