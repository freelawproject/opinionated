If such waiver be filed, then that the new trial be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">\u201cFiled August 5, 1887.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The notice of appeal was as follows:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">\u201cYou will please take notice that the defendant in the above-entitled action hereby appeals to the supreme court of the state of California from the order of said court granting her motion for a new trial, made on the fifth day of August, and more particularly from so much of said order as permits the plaintiff to prevent the said grant of a new trial by the remission of twenty-five dollars damages in the judgment recovered by him; and also from the judgment therein entered in the said superior court on the thirteenth day of June, 1887, in favor of the plaintiff in the said action, and against said defendant, and from the whole thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">There is nothing in the record showing, or tending to show, that the plaintiff ever remitted the amount mentioned in the order. If not, the order was one granting a new trial. We must presume the amount was not remitted, as the notice of appeal was from an order <em>granting </em>a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>This condition of the record renders it unnecessary for us to examine and pass upon the questions attempted to be presented upon the merits, as the judgment appealed from was vacated by the order granting a new trial, but we may say that we have carefully read the appellants\u2019 brief and the transcript, and are satisfied that no error was committed by the court below of which she has any reason to complain. If any error was committed, it was against the respondent in requiring him to remit a part of his judgment or submit to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Judgment and order affirmed, with twenty per cent damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Fox, J., and Paterson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
