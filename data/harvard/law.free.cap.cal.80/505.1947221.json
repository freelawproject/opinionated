Defective allegations of fact may be cured by verdict, but not so where there is a total absence of facts, or where the facts defectively alleged, if properly stated, make out no cause of action. <em>(Barron </em>v. <em>Frink, </em>30 Cal. 489; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>60 Cal. 341.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-20\"><em>C. W. Cross, </em>and <em>P. F.

There was a demurrer to the complaint, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrer was overruled; the defendant answered, denying the material allegations of the complaint, and setting up some affirmative matters. There was a trial by jury, verdict for the plaintiffs, and judgment accordingly. The defendant appeals on the judgment roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The only point made in this court is, that the demurrer to the complaint was improperly overruled, for the reason that there-was no allegation in the complaint that the policy was unpaid, or any allegation showing a breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">A party suing upon a contract to pay money must show a breach of the contract, or his complaint states no cause of action. Therefore it is held that the complaint must, in such cases, allege the non-payment of the money claimed under the contract. <em>(Du Brutz </em>v. <em>Jessup, </em>70 Cal. 75; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>60 Cal. 341.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Numerous other decisions of this court might be cited, but the question is too well settled in this state to render such citations necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The complaint was fatally defective in this respect. It contained no allegation of non-payment; nor is there any allegation from which such non-payment can be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Counsel for respondent attempt to meet the objection on two grounds, viz., that the demurrer appears from the record to have been submitted without argument, which should be taken as a waiver of the point, and that the defect was cured by the verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Neither of these grounds can be maintained. We know of no reason for holding that a party who submits a demurrer without argument thereby waives any objection raised by the demurrer. The objection is taken by the demurrer, and not by the argument, and it points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>out to the court and the opposite party every objection to the complaint that is raised by such a demurrer. It is the duty of the opposite party to look to his pleading and see that it is sufficient to withstand such a demurrer, and it is equally the duty of the court to examine the pleading and determine as to its sufficiency, whether the demurrer is argued or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The doctrine that a defective pleading may be cured by verdict has no application where there is an entire absence of a material allegation. <em>(Barron </em>v. <em>Frink, </em>30 Cal. 489; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Menzies, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Thornton, J., Paterson, J., Sharpstein, J., Fox, J., and Beatty, C.
