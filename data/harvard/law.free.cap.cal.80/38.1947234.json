The defendants claimed under a constable\u2019s sale and deed of the plaintiff\u2019s title under an execution against the plaintiff. The prior action referred to in the opinion was an action by the plaintiff to quiet title against the defendants\u2019 grantor, and to set aside the judgment and execution sale on the ground of want of jurisdiction because the complaint was filed upon a legal holiday. Further facts are stated in the opinion of the court, and in the decision upon the former appeal in 75 Cal. 174.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>P.

On, a second trial this evidence was supplied, and judgment was again rendered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The plaintiff objected to the introduction of the judgment and execution in evidence, on the ground that the judgment was invalid. But it was, shown by the evidence that in an action between the plaintiff and the defendants\u2019 grantor, who was the purchaser at the constable\u2019s sale, it was determined by the judgment of the court that the judgment of the justice\u2019s court and the sale under it were valid. This adjudication was conclusive as to the validity of the judgment. <em>(Peterson </em>v. <em>Weissbein, supra.) </em>Therefore, the court below, did not err in admitting, it in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The judgment roll in the case between the plaintiff and the defendants\u2019 grantor was objected to on the ground that- the parties in that action were not the same as in this. But the defendants, having purchased from the party in the former action, the. judgment inured to their benefit, and was competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Sharpstein, J., McFarland, J., Paterson, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
