Afterwards, whilst they, with their children, were residing upon the land, the wife executed, acknowledged, and recorded a declaration of homestead upon the land, the validity of which is not questioned. Thereafter the wife brought an action against the plaintiff herein for a divorce on the grounds of extreme cruelty and habitual drunkenness, in which, on the tenth day of September, 1875, the district court rendered a judgment and decree without written findings other than recited in the decree, of which the following is a copy:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u201cIn the district court of the fifth judicial district of the state of California, in and for the county of San Joaquin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201c'Roxanna Simpson, plaintiff, <em>v. </em>John K.

Simpson will be entitled to have, hold, and own an undivided'one-half interest therein relieved from said trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Subdivision 3 of section 146 of the Civil Code provides, in case of a divorce, that \u201c if the homestead has been selected from the community property, it may be assigned to the innocent party, either absolutely or for a limited period, subject in' the latter case to the future disposition of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The third paragraph of the divorce decree expresses an absolute, unconditional assignment of the homestead property to the wife,\u2014\u201cthe innocent party,\u201d\u2014in pursuance of the authority conferred upon the court by the above section of the code, unlimited to any period of time, and which is not limited to any, <em>period </em>by any other part of the decree; nor, properly construed, does the fifth paragraph of the decree reduce the estate as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>signed to a trust, or otherwise qualify its absolute character.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The meaning of the fifth paragraph of the decree is certainly indefinite and obscure, and therefore properly subject to construction. The intent to create a trust does not clearly appear from the language of the decree itself, to say nothing of other considerations which may be properly invoked as aids to the construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In section 1009 of Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, the author says: \u201cThe declaration of trust, whether written or oral, must be reasonably certain in its material terms; and this requisite of certainty includes the subject-matter or property embraced within the trust, the beneficiaries or persons in whose behalf it is created, the nature and quantity of interests which they are to have, and the manner in which the trust is to be performed. If the language is so vague, general, or equivocal that any of these necessary elements of the trust is left in real uncertainty, then the trust must fail.\u201d The decree under consideration is uncertain as to what interest the children are to have. Are they entitled to support for life, or only during their minority? When a part of them arrive at the age of majority or die, is the interest of the infants or survivors thereby increased? Under any circumstances, would the beneficiaries be entitled to have the land sold and the proceeds expended for their support ? or are they limited to the rents and profits ? In case the rents and profits should be more than sufficient to support those entitled to support, what disposition is to be made of the surplus ? Who would be entitled to call upon the trustee to account for such surplus? And finally, in what manner is the trust to be performed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Again, in the same section, the author proceeds to say: \u201cNo particular technical words need be used; even the words \u2018 trust \u2019 or \u2018 trustee \u2019 are not essential. Any other words which unequivocally show an intention that the legal estate was vested in one person,- but to be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>in some manner or for some purpose on behalf of another, if <em>certain as to all other requisites, </em>are sufficient. On the other hand, if the words \u2018 trust' or \u2018 trustee \u2019 are employed, they do not necessarily show an intention to create or declare a trust.\u201d (See also Perry on Trusts, sec. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">As to the inference of a trust from the use of the words \u201c for her support and for that of the children,\u201d and like words and phrases, Mr. Pomeroy says (section 1012): \u201c Ho definite rule can be laid down; each case must stand upon its own circumstances. If the language is sufficient for the intention to be clearly inferred, the trust will be enforced; otherwise the donee will take an absolute estate, and the provisions concerning maintenance will be regarded as mere motives for the gift and recommendations addressed to his discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The words in the divorce decree from which it is claimed that a trust may be inferred immediately follow the paragraph giving the wife the custody of seven, minor children, and thereby casting upon her the duty of supporting aud educating them, regardless of any aid which the court might allow her from the property of her husband. Under these circumstances it seems not to have been inappropriate for the court to express, as a reason or motive for giving her the homestead, that it was intended for the support of herself and children, for which, by the decree, she had been made solely responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Another consideration tending to support the construction here given to the decree is, that the law did not authorize the court to assign the homestead or any equitable interest in it to the children, nor to the wife <em>in trust </em>for any purpose; and in the absence of a reasonably clear expression to the contrary, the court must be presumed to have intended to act within the scope of its authority, and not to exceed it. The authority of the court, in actions for divorce, to transfer the property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>either party to the other* or otherwise to dispose of it, is. purely statutory; and the,statute did.not- authorize the. court, to. create .a trust in the- homestead\u25a0. or community, property, but only to- assign it .directly,to .tifie innocent party, <em>\u201cabsolutely, </em>or for. a <em>limited </em>period.\u201d If, any trust was created in this case by the divorce decree, it must have been a direct or express trust, created, not - by,the owner personally, nor by any agency authorized ;by. him, but by. the court acting by-authority of law; but it is. plain that the court had no- such statutory authority, and pur courts have no common-law authority, to create any kind of:trusts, certainly not express .trusts. In the exercise. of equity.jurisdiction, they find and adjudge trusts, to exist by reason of contracts, devises, bequests, gifts* or wrongful' or fraudulent acts, and may always- appoint trustees when necessary to execute- .them, but never, bycommpn-law authority, create them.. It should be further remarked in this-connection, that, as-,to the interest given to the wife, she could not be .trustee for-herself, it being a legal impossibility for a person to be both trustee and <em>cestui que trust </em>at the same time (Perry on-.Trusts,, sec. 13.)* and, moreover, that, it is at least doubtful whether an express trust, for the purpose claimed in this case, is authorized by our Civil - Code, sections 847' and 857; since it -is not expressed nor clearly -implied in. the divorce, decree that the rents and profits, only, of the-homestead property were to be applied to the use of the wife and children. Indeed, \u201c rents and profits\u201d are not mentioned in the decree,</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">It is. not necessary or proper to decide what .would have been the effect of a decree (as to-being.void,or only voidable by .appeal) clearly \u2022 expressing an.' assignment of; the homestead in trust, since it appear^, by proper; construction of the - decree, rendered, that, by-it the, court did not intend to create a trust, or -to limit or. qualify.the.absolute assignment, to the wife expressed in' the third paragraph .of the decree-..</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>I think the judgment should be reversed, and that the trial court should be directed to give judgment for the defendants upon the findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Gibson, C., and Belcher, C. C., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b275-6\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AiS\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment is reversed, and the court below directed to enter judgment for the defendants upon the findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Paterson, J., took no part in the decision of the above cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
