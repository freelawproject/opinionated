The term commerce included traffic; but it signified more than that, for it included commercial intercourse of every kind between the people of different nations and states, and parts of states, and what was meant by regulating .it, was prescribing the rules by which it should be carried on and be controled and governed, and the power to regulate it, was 'the power, of course, to prescribe the rules by which commerce or commercial intercourse in all its branches is to be governed. <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>9 <em>Wheat. </em>189. There was nothing, however, in the act of the legislature in question which looked to or pretended to prescribe any regulation for the government of commerce between this and other states or parts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>world, in the sense in which the term was employed and the power was conferred on Congress in the constitution of the United States, for it merely imposes a tax of ten cents on every passenger traveling upon any part of the railroad of the defendants within the limits of this State, for State revenue, and nothing more, so far as this case was concerned. But it had been recognized by the highest tribunal, the Supreme Court of the United States, that there is a concurrent power residing in the States, to regulate commerce between them and other States, and even foreign countries, unless Congress has legislated on the subject in such a manner as necessarily to preclude legislation upon it by the States; and that the mere grant to Congress, of the power to regulate commerce in the terms employed in the constitution, does not prohibit the exercise of the power by a State over the same subject. <em>Wilson v. The Blackbird Creek Marsh Co. 2 Pet. </em>245. <em>License </em>Cases, 5 <em>How. </em>578. <em>City of New York v. </em>Milne, 11 <em>Pet. </em>151. <em>Cooky v.

He had said, what was apparent upon the face of it, that it was no part or purpose of the act to regulate, or to prescribe any regulation in relation to the commerce or conveyance of passengers on the railroad of the defendants within or without the limits of this State. But even conceding that it might have the indirect or incidental effect to affect the latter kind of commercial intercourse between citizens of other States traveling on it, such incidental effect merely could not render it unconstitutional. <em>License Cases, </em>5 <em>How </em>615. <em>Nathan v.

The sole object of the act is simply a tax for State revenue; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>but it had been held that the State may tax, although it cannot regulate, foreign commerce. <em>Passenger </em>Cases, 7 <em>How. </em>402.

The tax imposed by the act was a 1 ax on the business of the railroad company to be ascertained and graduated by the number of passengers carried, and not upon the passengers directly, and was, therefore, in no sense a commercial regulation as between it and other States, but was such a tax as the State had the power to constitutionally impose upon the property and business of the company within its own limits. <em>The Commonwealth v. P. &amp; R. R. R. Co., </em>62. <em>Penn. </em>286. And there was nothing in the union and consolidation of the railroad company originally incorporated by the legislature of this State, with the railroad companies likewise originally and respectively incorporated by the legislatures of the adjoining States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, for the purpose of constructing the present railroad of the defendants from Philadelphia through this State to Baltimore, into one united company that could in any manner impair, abridge, or diminish the power of this State to tax the property and business of the consolidated company within its limits. <em>O. &amp; M.

There is no discrimination whatever in the act in favor of the citizens of this State in regard to the tax, for they were all alike subject to it when traveling upon any part of the road, however short it might be, within the limits of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-3\">The act does not interfere with or impair the right of the officers or servants of the Federal Government to travel or pass through the State. He had already said that the tax in question was not a tax on the passenger, but on the railroad company, to be measured by the number of passengers carried upon any portion of their road in the State, and was to raise revenue for the support of the State government and to pay its debts, and more particularly, the large debt' contracted by it in supplying troops to the armies of the United States during the exigencies of the late war. For until those great emergencies arose about the time of the passage of the act, which was in 1864, we never had any such tax, and we never should have had any such tax in the State, but for the heavy debt which the war had entailed upon it. The language of the law is that the company, or any other corporation or persons engaged in the business of carrying passengers for hire in this State, \u201cshall pay at and after the rate of ten cents for every passenger,\u201d and that was not only in terms, but in its direct effect, a tax on the company, and not upon the passenger, for it was entirely optional with the company whether, or not* it would require him virtually to pay it by increasing the fare <em>pro tanto. </em>But whether that was done, or not, the company, and the company alone, was subject to, and bound to pay it. <em>Society of Savings v. Coit, </em>6 <em>Wall. </em>594. The case of <em>Crandall v. Nevada </em>would be referred to on the other side, but the statute of that state involved in that case, imposed a capitation tax of one dollar upon every passenger going out of the State or through it, but not on any one going into it, or from one point to any other within its limits ; and the court very properly held that it was a personal tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>imposed directly on the passenger, although the point was made by the counsel for the State that it was not a tax on the passenger. But in this case the statute of our State is different, for it was as he had already shown, under the law of this State a tax upon the carrier, and not upon the passenger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-4\">The act was not obnoxious to the objection that it impairs the obligation of any contract, either express or implied, between the State and the company under the provision of the nineteenth section of the original charter of what was then named the Maryland and Delaware Bail-road Company, and whose road, rights and franchises now constitute a part of the road, rights and franchises of the present united and consolidated company, the defendant in this case. It was under that provision since the union of the companies that the original exemption from taxation of that road by the State of Maryland, it would be contended, was now extended and would apply to the whole road of the company as at present constituted, as well in Delaware and Pennsylvania, as in Maryland, both by its express terms, and by necessary implication. But there was nothing in the act of this state authorizing and providing for the union and consolidation of the several companies into one company, which warrants any such pretension, as against this State, at least. There was no consideration paid to the State for the act to authorize the consolidation of them, and unless the exemption from taxation is clear and explicit, or for a valuable equivalent, and even then,only for a specified and determinate period, it is void. Besides, a strict construction of railroad and other like charters, was now the well settled rule of American law on that subject, and no court will ever infer or presume such an. exemption without express and unequivocal words which cannot be otherwise interpreted. <em>Pierce's American Railroad Law </em>9. <em>Dartmouth College Case, </em>4 <em>Wheat. </em>636. <em>Rice v.

An act of the legislature of the State of California imposing a stamp tax on bills of lading for the transportation of gold from that State, was held to be a tax on exports, and was consequently void. The court considered the intention to impose the tax on the gold exported, by imposing it on the bill of lading, was too plain to be questioned. <em>Almy v. California, </em>24 <em>How. </em>169. If this is a tax on the passenger in his transit into or through the State, united and consolidated as the original railroad companies had been into one, and their roads made one, two out of the three original roads thus united and made one, one being in Pennsylvania and the other in Maryland, and this having been done with the mutual sanction and consent and by the authority of all three of the States acting through their respective legislatures, what right has this State to restrict travel over it to and from those States, or any other part of the country, to even the slightest degree, without the consent of those States ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-4\">According to the definition given by C. J. Marshall in <em>Gibbons v. Ogden </em>of the term commerce and the regulation of it, it means intercourse, and embraces travel as well as traffic : and it was so considered and beld by the court in the cases also cited on the other side, of <em>McCullough v. Maryland. Crandell v. Nevada </em>and in <em>Ex. Parte Crandell v. Nevada, </em>1 <em>Nevada. </em>294. Where the object of the act is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>raise revenue by taxation, the power to regulate commerce is not in the State. It is never allowable in a State when such is the operation or effect of it. <em>Passenger cases, </em>7 <em>How. </em>470. In those cases the Judges differed in their opinions as to the construction of the different statutes of the several States involved in them. In regard to the Sew York statute, the argument was on the first branch of it relative to passengers from foreign ports, and the question was whether it constituted a tax and a regulation of commerce ; but where that was clear, as a matter of fact, the opinion was just as clear that the law was as he had just announced it. And it was so held in the <em>License Cases, </em>5 <em>How. </em>605. <em>McCullough v. Maryland, </em>4 <em>Wheat. </em>428. <em>Weston v. City of Charleston, </em>2 <em>Pet. </em>467. <em>Gilman v. Philadelphia, </em>3 <em>Wall. </em>730. <em>Cooley v. Philadelphia, </em>12 <em>How. </em>300. <em>Searight v. Stokes, 3 How. </em>170. <em>Veasy v. Moore, </em>14 <em>How. </em>568. In the case cited on the other side of the <em>Commonwealth v. P. P. P. P. Co., </em>the court did not question the propriety of the decision in the case of <em>Crandell v. Nevada, </em>but distinguished it from the case then before the court. And in the case of <em>Thompson v. The Union Pacific R. R. </em>Co.,the only question was whether the State had the power to tax the property of the company within its limits, and in which the power of the State to do that was affirmed. The governmental regulations of trade and commerce by states and nations were usually prescribed and enforced by some method of taxation with a view to public revenue, and which in general is the primary, if not the sole object of them. Foreign commerce usually by impost duties collected at ports of entry established by authority of the State for that purpose, and where alone the commodities allowed to be introduced for sale, can be lawfully imported into the country; and domestic commerce in the main by taxes imposed by law in the form of licenses or other excise duties, sometimes with a view to restrict or regulate certain branches of internal trade or traffic, but generally and primarily for the same purpose as the other, to raise public revenue for the support of government. And any law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>for that purpose which had the effect, either directly or indirectly to interfere with or affect the commerce of a country, whether foreign or domestic, was generally recognized and denominated throughout this country and England, at least, before and at the time of the formation and adoption of the constitution of the United States, as a commercial regulation,and that was the broad and comprehensive and well known and well understood sense in which the intelligent and enlightened framers of the constitution of the United States employed, to them the familiar terms, \u201cto regulate commerce,\u201d (penned and expressed with care, as every other passage was in that instrument) which were adopted and incorporated into the commercial clause of it. The travel of passengers, whether on business or pleasure, is a branch of commercial intercourse between States and nations, and wherein does a tax on travelers on coming into or going out of the State, imposed for public revenue, differ in principle and in the purview of that clause of the constitution, from a tax imposed for the same purpose on any other branch of commercial intercourse between the States of this Union? A tax on such a traveler is <em>per se </em>a commercial regulation, because it prescribes a requirement with which he must comply before he can lawfully exercise the right or privilege which the regulation on that condition concedes to him; and it was no answer to that to say that the act in question does not operate upon him directly, or directly require him to pay the tax, but only the railroad company to do that which it may or may not do at its option, for it is manifest that it contemplates that the passenger shall pay the tax, because it absolutely requires the company to pay it, and at the same time specially provides that it shall have the power to increase the fare to the amount of the tax, if it did not already possess that power before the passage of, and independent of the act itself. And it was to prevent the general inconvenience and evil of a serious interference with the domestic commerce of the whole country, that is to say, the commerce among the States and with the Indian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>tribes, by the several State governments, that the provision in regard to those particular departments of commercial intercourse, was inserted in the clause referred to, and the exclusive power to regulate it, as he contended, by such or any ' other means, was expressly delegated to Congress, other and more specific provisions of the constitution reserving to Congress the control and regulation of the foreign commerce of the country in the several modes provided for in it. He would, therefore, conclude what he had to say on the subject by adding that the act in question, both on the authorities cited by him, and the evident meaning and design of the provision of the constitution which he had been considering, was to his mind clearly unconstitutional as an attempt on the part of this State to interfere with and regulate, in the sense in which that phrase is employed in the constitution, commercial intercourse between it and the other States of the Union, so far as that intercourse was conducted over and by means of the railroad of the defendants, which was a great national thoroughfare, and in the direct line of communication between two great commercial sections of it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-4\"><em>T. F. Bayard, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad\">The Government of the United States was formed out of the States of the Union with limited and delegated powers for the benefit and welfare of the whole confederation, and to have charge of the great concerns which pertain to it. The eighth section of the first article of the constitution of it, among other provisions, confers on Congress the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises ; and to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes ; and the provision contained in the second paragraph of section ten of the same article, that no State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws, the net produce of which should be for the use of the treasury of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>States, nor without the consent of Congress lay any duty of tonnage, were to be considered and construed with the former, in order to apprehend the true and proper meaning of them, and the powers conferred by them, as qualified and indicated when considered in connection with each other. And the first legitimate inference and deduction to be derived from them, when thus viewed and considered together was, that the several States were not to be prohibited from laying or imposing any taxes, except as is therein limited and provided. The power of a State to regulate or tax foieign commerce is expressly prohibited in explicit terms in the provision which he had read that \u201cno State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports,\u201d except as therein provided, and then only, so far as the net receipts from them were concerned, for the use of the general government. A State, however, was not to be prohibited from laying taxes, except as is limited and provided in the clauses of the constitution which he had just read. And such was the construction which Chief Justice Taney had given to the definition of Chief Justice Marshall of the term commerce, and the power of Congress to regulate it with foreign nations, and among the several States. <em>Gibbons v. </em>Ogden, 9 <em>Wheat. The Passenger Cases, </em>7 <em>How. </em>479.. If' then there- is an express and positive prohibition incorporated into the constitution against a State\u2019s laying any tax on foreign commerce, if it was the design of the framers of it to deny them the right and power to tax domestic commerce, or commerce between the States, why was not an express prohibition also incorporated in it to that effect ? Or why should it be left to be inferred or implied merely from the grant to Congress of the general power to regulate commerce ? But would you go to that clause of the constitution to find by implication merely the power of Congress to tax by imposts or duties the foreign commerce of the country ? Certainly not, because that power is expressly conferred by the clause almost immediately preceding it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>and that was itself conclusive proof of the fact that the authors and framers of the instrument never intended that the power of Congress to tax foreign commerce should or could be derived by implication from the power given to it to regulate it merely. Nor can you, for equally as strong and sound a reason, resort to the latter clause to find by implication simply the power of Congress to tax domestic commerce, or commerce among the several States. Because the latter power is also expressly given in the same clause by which the power to tax foreign commerce is conferred. It is a sound rule of construction of such instruments that we are never to depend on implications merely from any provision in it for a power which is conferred by the express terms of it. But there were other ways of regulating commerce, both foreign and domestic, than by the taxation of it, for the power to regulate it and the power to tax it were not necessarily one and the same power, On the contrary, the distinction between the two powers was clearly recognized in the constitution itself. For while the power to regulate commerce is conferred upon Congress in the few general words which he had so often repeated, without any express restriction or exception whatever with reference to the power of the States to regulate it, the power to tax it is conferred and prescribed in several specific provisions relating to the subject, with the express restriction that no State shall tax commerce with foreign nations, without the consent of Congress, except as therein mentioned, and for the purpose therein stated. And if we are to have recourse to constitutional implication to ascertain the meaning of it in either of these respects, does not that restriction much more reasonably and legitimately imply that any State may tax commerce among the States, or with the Indian tribes without the consent of Congress for the use of its own treasury, than it is implied that no State shall have the power to tax those two branches of commerce, because another power, the power to regulate such branches of commerce is exclusively con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ferred on Congress, as is contended for on the other side ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-3\">But conceding for the sake of argument, that Congress has under the commercial clause in the constitution, the sole and exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several States and with the Indian tribes, it will not be contended that its power to tax is sole and exclusive, or be denied that while its power to tax property or commerce within the limits of any State, is co-extensive with the power of that State to tax the same, it, is only a concurrent power with that of the State over the same subject matter; and which consideration would serve to show that there is, and must be a manifest distinction recognized in the constitution itself, between the power to regulate and the power to tax commerce. Indeed, he might say that there was not a provision in it relating to either power, that did not unequivocally discriminate the one from the other, and indirectly recognize a distinction between them. The distinction was also clearly recognized and stated by Chief Justice Marshall, in the opinion announced by him in the case of <em>Gibbon v. Ogden, </em>9 <em>Wheat. </em>On that subject the <em>Federalist </em>says \u201c I am willing to allow in its fullest extent the justness of the reasoning which requires that the individual states should possess an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their own wants. And making this concession, I affirm that (with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports) they would under the plan of the convention, retain that authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense; and that an attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of it, would be a violent assumption of power unwarranted by any article or clause of its constitution. <em>The Federalist, No. </em>32. The decision of the court in the case of <em>McCullough v. Maryland, </em>4 <em>How. </em>427, simply was that a State cannot tax within its limits,any means established by the General Government for the execution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>its functions, or so as to defeat their legitimate operation; but no such point or principle is presented in this case, for the means there referred to was the Bank of the United States, an institution incorporated by an act of Congress, and used as a fiscal agent by the General Government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-3\">But upon whom d'oes the act in question directly operate ? It is expressly directed against the defendant as a common carrier of passengers within the limits of this State for hire, and as an incorporated company,, although now consolidated with other similar companies originally chartered by Maryland and Pennsylvania respectively, but so far as this State is concerned and within its limits, it still exists as a body politic or corporation, solely by virtue of the laws of it, and the tax which it imposes is but an equivalent for the grant and use of the valuable franchise conferred upon the company by the State. <em>Society for Savings v. Coit. </em>6 <em>Wall. 606. </em>Besides, it operates, and can operate, upon no one else unless he is, and no longer than he is, within the limits of the State. Bo case had been cited, and none could be, in which it had ever been held that a State cannot tax an artificial highway within its limits, and especially when it is instituted and made under the express authority and sanction of the State itself, and is endowed with the delegation of a certain portion of the eminent domain of it. <em>Searight v. Stokes, </em>3 <em>How. </em>180. But what was meant by the phrase on the other side, \u201c the free right of transit\u201d over such a highway ? Although the company was incorporated by a public statute of the State, and is what is usually denominated a corporation for public uses, and the road itself a public improvement, yet the road itself was after all, but the private and absolute property of the company, and no one could use it free, or without its consent and without paying the company for any benefit derived from the use of it. All persons, both in and out of the State, in that respect stood in the same relation to it,as much so as if it were the sole and absolute property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>of any private citizen. <em>Gray v. Clinton Bridge, Am. Law Rgr. </em>Jan. 1863, <em>p. </em>149.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeo\">It is not denied that the State has the right to tax the road or any other property of the company within its limits, hut every tax so imposed is indirectly and ultimately paid by the passengers and shippers over it. And even, conceding that the tax in question is a direct tax on the passengers over the road of the defendants, where is practically the difference between the two cases ? But the tax is, in fact, a tax, not on the passengers directly, but on the franchise of the company as a common carrier of passengers for hire, and on that particular department of its business directly, to be measured and graduated according to the amount of business done in that line, at the rate of ten cents for every passenger carried on the road, or any part of it within the limits of the State. It was, therefore, in point of fact, neither a tax on inter-State commerce in the true sense and meaning of the implied prohibition contended for on the other side, nor was it, as he had before shown, he thought, an act to regulate such commerce within the proper meaning and construction of the clause of the constitution referred to. But even if the evident purpose of the act had been unquestionably to regulate commerce among the States, it would still not have been in conflict with that clause of the constitution which merely confers upon Congress the power to regulate it, without conflicting with some act of Congress previously enacted to regulate it, because the executory power of Congress to regulate it, without having been exercised and executed by it, and in the only way in which Congress could exercise the power, or regulate it, that is to say, by a law of Congress duly enacted and approved by the President on the subject, could not possibly constitute <em>per se, </em>or in itself practically speaking, any regulation whatever in regard to the matter. Practically that provision of the constitution is wholly inoperative and silent, until Congress has proceeded in due form to act under the power and to prescribe some regulation on the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ject; but which had never been done in relation to domestic commerce or commerce among the States, at least. <em>O. M. R. R. Co. v. Wheeler, </em>1 <em>Black </em>286. This is also recognized by all the members of the Court with the exception of two of the Judges; in the case of <em>Crandall v. Nevada, </em>6 <em>Wall. </em>35; and that until Congress acted under the power and prescribed regulations, the several States have concurrent power and authority to regulate even foreign commerce between them and other countries. The majority of the court rested their decision in that case on entirely new and original grounds, and upon which no other case had ever before been decided in the Supreme Court of the United States. But the Nevada act upon which it was made, was in terms a tax on passengers, and was further obnoxious to objection on the ground that it was particularly invidious and discriminating in its character, as between citizens of the other States and the citizens of that State, who wore entirely exempt from .the tax, except wheti going out of it. No one was taxed, however, under it on going into, or traveling about any where within its limits ; but every person going entirely through the State, or once in was going out of it, was liable to a capitation tax therefor of one dollar. The primary object of such an act, with such discriminations in it, is palpable. It was, as far as it could effect such a purpose, first,to prevent its own citizens from leaving it, and in the next place, to keep every body there who once went into <em>it; </em>and as such it was evidently designed to be a direct restriction on that kind of inter-state commercial intercourse, and was an act to regulate, rather than to tax that kind of commerce to raise revenue. And in that view it was even unconstitutional and void with reference to its own citizens, for under the commercial clause of the constitution, no State has the power to restrain its citizens from leaving it or going out of it into another State, any more than it has the power to prohibit the citizens of other States from, going into it. Our common citizenship under another clause of the constitution, would also forbid either of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>restrictions. In the case of the <em>Erie R. R. Co. v. New Jersey, </em>4 <em>Am. Law Regr. Feb. </em>1866, <em>p. </em>238, the act in question imposing a transit duty upon passengers and freight carried by companies doing business in the State, but not incorporated by the legislature of it, was held to be unconstitutional, not because it incidentally affected commerce between that and other States, but because it discriminated in favor of the citizens of their own, and against citizens of other States. But in the act now before this court, the discrimination is just the reverse of that, for as the tax is the same whether the travel is entirely through the State, or between any two stations on the road within the limits of it, however near they may be to each other, and such travel is almost entirely by our own citizens, it is practically a discrimination against the citizens of this, and in favor of the citizens of other States. In the <em>Passenger Cases, </em>7 <em>How. </em>492, Chief Justice Taney had prescribed the true test, after all, by which this vexed question was to be determined, and that was this : if you can find any thing in an act to indicate a design to interdict, or to ruinously affect the commerce of the States, then he was free to say that it should be considered and declared to be inoperative and void. And in the case of <em>Thompson v. U. P. R. R. Co., </em>9 <em>Wall. </em>579, the following rule was pronounced in the opinion of the Judges that if the act is directed against the business of the company, and makes no provision for, and gives no direction as to how it is to be collected, or whether it was to be paid to the company by any body else or not, and although practically paid in the end by the passenger, yet it is no more paid by him than the wages'of the engineer who runs the engine is paid by him. And so we say in this case, and will cheerfully abide the application of either of these tests to it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-3\">Bates, Chancellor,</author>\n<p id=\"ABg\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The Supreme Court of the United States have decided in <em>Crandall v The State of Nevada, </em>6 <em>Wallace, </em>35, that the several States of the Union have not the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>power to impose a tax upon inter-state travel. In this conclusion the Supreme Court was unanimous. The authority of the decision is not impaired by the fact that the judges assigned different grounds for their respective opinions. Some of them considering that such a tax is a regulation of commerce, and prohibited to the State Legislatures by what is known as the commercial clause of the Federal Constitution, and others, (who constituted the majority of the Court,) holding that the tax is an infringement of the right of the Federal Government to the service of its citizens, free from all restrictions upon their facilities for travel. Also an infringement of the citizen\u2019s right of free transit between all parts of the common ( country, as a right inherent in a national citizenship and (protected by the constitution. The rule adjudged in the FTevada case is the supreme law of the land, and obligatory upon this Court. Waiving, therefore, a discussion of the grounds of that decision, we proceed directly to the main question in controversy, that is, whether according to the true construction of the act of August 11th, 1864, the tax is imposed upon the business of the carrier, measured by the number of passengers transported, or whether upon the passenger, to be collected for the State by the carrier. If it be the. latter, then under the ruling of the Supreme Court, the act must be held invalid so far as it operates upon persons entering into, departing from, or passing-through the State. With respect to its operation upon persons traveling between different points within the State, no question is made. It may as well be observed at this point, that no argument in support of the act can be drawn from the fact that it operates as well upon our own citizens traveling wholly within the State, as upon the citizens of other States passing into or through its territory. If the Legislature have not the constitutional power to tax a particular class of passengers, plainly that power cannot be derived by including under the tax law another class of passengers who may constitutionally be taxed. Legislative acts to the validity of which the question of discrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ination becomes material, are those which deal with a subject matter fully within the constitutional power of the Legislature of a State, but deal with it in a mode affecting unequally its own citizens and the citizens of other States-, contrary to that clause of the Federal Constitution which secures to the citizens of each State \u201call privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States.\u201d\u2014(Art 4, Sec. 2d.) As if citizens of other States should be placed upon an unequal footing with our own citizens under laws for the administration of public justice, or touching the descent of real estate, or the distribution of the personal estate of intestates; or, as if in the taxing of lands situated within the State, non-resident real estate owners were taxed more heavily than our own citizens holding lands. But in the present case the Supreme Court having decided that inter-state travel is beyond the taxing power of the State, the only question is whether this act undertakes to tax the forbidden subject-matter; and it is quite immaterial whether the act also operates upon travel within the State, a subject-matter under State control.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">We will now examine the provisions of the act of 1864. It is true that the tax is declared to be,a tax upon the carrier, that he is required to pay it into the State Treasury, and he is to pay it at all events, whether it be in fact collected out of the passenger or not. The provision is, (Sec. 1.) that \u201cevery person, corporation, or association or company \u201cof persons not a corporation, engaged, or that may here- \u201c after engage in the business of transporting or carrying \u201cpassengers by steam power, whether on land or water, in, \u201cthrough, upon, over or across any portion of this State, or \u201c within the territorial limits of the same, shall on the first \u201c day of October next, and thereafter monthly, on the first \u201c day of each month, or within five days thereafter, pay \u201c into the hands of the State Treasurer, for the use of the \u201c State, a tax at and after the rate of ten cents for every \u201c passenger so transported within this State during the \u201c month then just ended.\u201d Did the act stop here, or add only such provisions as should be requisite for ascertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the number of passengers and for enforcing payment by the carrier of the ten cents per head, then the tax might be treated as one imposed upon the carrier. But there are other provisions in the act, by the operation of which the tax although in terms levied upon the carrier, was nevertheless in the contemplation of the legislature and under the authority of the act, to be drawn from the passenger, so as to leave no actual charge upon the business of the carrier. This makes it in substance and effect a tax upon the passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Let us look closely into these provisions:\u2014First,observe the 4th Section. This section confers authority for collecting the tax in all cases out of the passenger; that is, it confers the power to do so upon a class of corporations previously.restricted by their charters as to the amount of tolls to be charged for the carriage of passengers ; and it recognizes the power and sanctions its exercise on the part of all other corporations and carriers which had not been so restricted. The section runs thus:\u2014\u201cIncase there be \u201c in the charter of any corporation liable to the provisions \u201c of this act, any clause or provision so restricting the \u201c amount of toll to be charged for the transportation ot <em>\u201c </em>passengers, as that this act would according to the <em>\u201c </em>present rate of charges by the said corporation, operate \u201c unjustly against it, then it is hereby declared and enacted \u201c that the said corporation shall have the right to increase \u201c the said toll to the amount of the tax herein provided \u201cfor.\u201d How, the manifest purpose of this provision and its direct effect is to carry the tax over from the carrier on whom the first section left it, to the passenger. It declares that to leave a corporation disabled by reason of any existing restriction upon its power to charge tolls, from adding the ten cents to its fares, would \u201c operate unjustly against it, \u201d and so, striking away all such restrictions, it leaves all carriers armed with authority and having its express sanction to draw the tax out of the passenger, as being his proper charge or burden, and not theirs. The want of power in a corporation to collect the tax from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the passenger would, indeed, \u201c operate unjustly\u201d against the corporation, if it was the passenger who was intended to bear the tax, but certainly not so, if the tax was considered the carrier\u2019s own burden. In the latter case plainly the injustice to be prevented would be, not the absence of power in some corporations to collect the tax from the passenger, but the exercise of such a power by any corporation ; and in order to keep the burden where, upon the plaintiff\u2019s theory, it was intended to rest, the act should have extended to all carriers the restriction against adding it to their fares, rather than have removed it from those already subject to it. It is impossible not to see disclosed on the face of this act, that the proposed tax was expected to raise a gross sum too large to be borne by the railroad corporations under the then existing rates of fare which had been adjusted to the ordinary cost of transportation, and hence the care manifested to connect with the exaction of the tax from the carrier authority for its collection out of the passenger\u2014this power being a part of the machinery devised by the act for raising the revenue. The position of the carrier under this law is substantially that of one to whom public taxes are farmed out, an'd who undertakes by contract to advance to the Government a required revenue, with power by suit or distress to collect the like amount out of those on whom the tax is laid. The only imaginable difference is, that in the case of taxes farmed out the obligation to account to the Government is voluntarily assumed by contract, and not imposed by law as upon the carrier under this act; also that different means are provided for raising the tax out of those ultimately chargeable with it; 'but the mode of collection under this act is none the less effectual, but far more so than by suit or distress, for the tax is exacted from the passenger before he is allowed to enter a car or steamboat.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">Another provision of this act very significant that under its operation the passenger was to be the taxable, and the carrier a collecting- agent only, is that clause of Sec. 1. which excludes soldiers and sailors of the U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>from among the number of passengers with respect to whom the carrier is required to make return and pay the ten cents per head. We cannot read this clause otherwise than as an exemption of these two classes'of passengers from a burden imposed upon passengers generally, a burden to which it was felt to be improper or inexpedient to subject the transportation made at that period, of large bodies of soldiers and sailors in the service and defence of the Federal Government. Considered as a tax upon passengers, there were cogent reasons for exempting from the burden of it these classes of passengers, or the United States Government as chargeable on their account; but upon the theory that this was a tax upon the business of the carrier, the number of passengers being taken merely as a measure of the business, no satisfactory reason can be assigned for exempting this branch of the business, unless soldiers and sailors were carried without charge, but which does not appear as a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Still another clause of the act bearing to the same conclusion, is that proviso of the first section which imposes only one tax in respect of a passenger traveling over several connected rail roads, and charges the payment of that one tax upon the company which first receives the passenger. If the tax be considered as laid upon the passenger, to be paid for the privilege of making one journey by the public modes of travel within the States, this is a provision both just and convenient; but it is not reconcilable with the theory that this is a tax levied upon the railroad company for the privilege of exercising a public employment, in which aspect it should equally attach to each company excercising such privilege, whether the passenger conveyed by it was received from another company or not. Nor is this clause satisfactorily accounted for, consistently with the theory of the plaintiff, by the suggestion made <em>arguendo </em>that all the rail road companies then operating within the State were under the management of one corporation, the defendant in this cause. Our railroad system at the passage of this act embraced three compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>nies then operating, viz:\u2014 this defendant, the Delaware Rail Road Company, and the Junction &amp; Breakwater R. R. Co., besides some other roads, projected but not constructed. Of the three Companies then operating, the Delaware Railroad was managed by this defendant as lessees under a lease which kept the business and interests of the two companies as separate and distinct as if the Delaware Railroad Company were operating its own road. The Junction &amp; Breakwater Railroad was operated by this defendant, the Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore R. R. Co., under contract. Between this defendant and the two Railroad Companies referred to, there was no consolidation of business or interests, and the arrangement between them afforded no sufficient reason for exempting either of the companies from a tax intended to be laid upon the business of railroad transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">Passing now from the consideration of particular clauses in the act to a view of it in its entire scope and bearing, we are unable to discern wherein its operation upon the passenger differs from that of an act which should in direct terms levy the tax upon the passenger, and require the carrier to collect it, and pay it into the State Treasury, after the frame of the Revada Act; and when we speak here of its operation upon the passenger, we refer not to any mere incidental and remote- consequence of the act, hut to the result contemplated by and provided for in the act itself. It matters nothing whether the tax be in terms imposed upon the passenger to be collected by the carrier, or he imposed upon the carrier with power, given or recognized and sanctioned\" to collect it out of the passenger. The difference is one of phraseology merely, not varying in the least degree its effect upon the passenger. Either way there is to he exacted from him, under authority of law, over and above the ordinary charge for the carrier\u2019s service, ten cents for the use of the State, to pass it is true through the hands of the carrier, but without becoming any charge upon the carrier\u2019s business, unless it be volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>tarily so made by a waiver of the power to collect it out of the passenger, a very remote possibility. IsTow, it need hardly be said that the Legislature cannot enlarge its powers by mere phraseology ; that a revenue measure so constructed as to draw the required revenue ultimately out of the passenger, cannot be rendered valid by calling the payment of it a tax upon the carrier whose whole connection with it is to pass it into the Treasury of the State. dSTo form of words can save a statute which in its effect deals with a prohibited subject-matter. If constitutional limitations might be thus evaded, they would become wholly illusory and worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">It is important here to notice with what care the Supreme Court of the United States in applying the limitations of the Constitution to legislative acts, have always looked into the substance and effect of such acts, quite beyond their form or phraseology. We may take a few illustrations: In <em>Brown v. Maryland, </em>12 <em>Wheat. </em>444, the State law required the importer to take out and pay for a license to sell imported goods, and the question was whether such a requirement was in conflict with that clause of the constitution of the United States which prohibits a State from laying any impost or duty on exports or imports. It was argued that this was not a tax upon the article imported, but upon the occupation of the importer; that the State had unquestioned power to tax all occupations, and that this act by its direct effect did nothing more. C. J. Marshall thus emphatically refutes the argument. \u201cIt is impossible,\u201d he says, \u201cto conceal \u201c from ourselves that this is varying the form without vary- \u201c ing the substance. It is treating a prohibition which is \u201c general, as if it were confined to a particular mode of \u201c doing the forbidden thing.\u2019 \u2018 All must perceive that a \u201c tax on the sale of any article imported only for sale, is a \u201c tax upon the article itself.\u2019 * * * \u2018It must add to \u201c the price of the article, and be paid by the consumer or \u201c by the importer himself in like manner as a direct duty \u201c on the article itself.\u2019 \u2018This the State has not a right to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201c because it is prohibited by the constitution.\u201d In <em>Almey </em>v. <em>The State of </em>California, 24 <em>How. </em>169, the question was whether a stamp duty on bills of lading for gold and silver transported from that State was a tax on exports. The Supreme Court so held, C. J. Taney thus expressing himself. \u201c But a tax or duty on a bill of lading, although differing in form from a duty on the article shipped, is in \u201c substance the same thing.\u201d Speaking of the necessity of some such instrument as a bill of lading to commercial transactions the chief justice adds, \u201c a bill of lading there- \u201c fore, or some equivalent instrument of writing is invar- \u201c iably associated with every cargo of merchandise exported to a foreign country,and consequently a duty upon \u201c that is in substance and effect, a duty on the article \u201c exported.\u201d In the <em>Passenger Cases, </em>7 <em>How. </em>283, one of the questions was, whether a provision in a statute of Massachusetts requiring the master, owner, consignee or agent of any vessel engaged in foreign commerce, to pay on account of every alien passenger landed a certain sum into the Treasury of the city or town where the vessel should land, was a tax upon commerce. The majority of the Court so held, and Mr. Justice Grier (p. 188,) with his characteristic force, thus asserts the duty of the court upon such questions, to consider the effect, rather than the form of legislative acts. \u201cIt is\u201d he says, \u201ca just and well \u201c settled doctrine, that a State cannot do that indirectly, \u201c which she is forbidden by the constitution to do directly. \u201cIf she cannot levy a duty or tax from the master or \u201cowner of a vessel engaged in commerce graduated on \u201c the tonnage or admeasurement of the vessel, she cannot \u201c effect the same purpose by merely changing the ratio \u201c and graduating it on the number of masts or of marines, \u201c the size and power of the -steam engine, or the number \u201c of passengers which she carries. We have to deal with \u201c things, and we cannot change them by changing their \u201c names. Gan a State levy a duty on vessels engaged in \u201c commerce, and not owned by her own citizens, by chang- \u201c ing the name from a duty on tonnage to a tax.on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201c master; or levy an impost upon imports by calling it a \u201c charge on the owner or super-cargo, and justify this \u201c evasion of a great principle by producing a dictionary or \u201c a <em>dictum </em>to prove that a ship captain is not a vessel, nor \u201c a super-cargo an import?\u201d In the Hevada case the tax was levied in terms upon the passenger, so that no question was entertained by the court as to the construction of the Hevada statute. Lest, however, the judgment of the Court should be supposed to rest upon the directness of the statute, they say; (p. 39,) \u201c we should be very reluc- \u201c tant to admit that any form of words which had the effect \u201c to compel every person traveling through the country \u201c by the common and usual modes of conveyance, to pay a \u201c specific sum to the State, was not a tax upon the right \u201c thus reserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\">We have in the <em>Passenger Gases </em>a construction given by the Supreme Court to a law of like structure with that before us. One of the statutes drawn into question in those cases was a health law of Hew York, by which the master of every vessel arriving in the port of Hew York from a foreign port, was required to pay to the health commissioner a certain sum for himself and for each passenger ; and by a subsequent section of the law a right was given to the master \u201c to demand and recover from each person the sum paid on his account.\u201d In the opinions rendered in those cases, both by Judges of the majority and by those dissenting, this tax is treated as a tax on the passenger, the difference between the Judges being whether or not as such, it was a regulation of commerce in conflict with the commercial clause of the Constitution. This construction of the Hew York Act is especially observable in the opinions of Justice McLean, <em>p. </em>404, Justice Wayne, <em>p. </em>411, 412, 421,.Justice Catron, <em>p. </em>444, 448, and C. J. Taney, 483. The Chief Justice says of this law, \u201c the tax is imposed on the passengers in this case\u201d \u201c clearly and distinctly; for although the captain who lands\u201d \u201cthem is made liable for the collection, yet a right is\u201d \u201c expressly secured to him to recover it from the pas-\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201c senger.\u201d Now, comparing the New York law with the act under consideration, it will be seen that they are in substance the same. In both the tax is to be raised by the same sort of operation, with two incidental differences only ; these being rather the more stringent upon the passenger under our law. Under the New York law the master of the vessel was required first to pay the tax, with the right afterward to sue the passenger. While under our act the carrier is empowered to collect the tax before paying it over, and to collect it by means far more effectual than suit. This course of decisions indicates it as the settled judgment of the Supreme Court that statutes are to be construed, as well upon questions of constitutional power as for other purposes, according to their substance and effect, without regard to mere form or phraseology. Applying this test to the act before us, we consider that it taxes the passenger rather than the carrier, and under the rule of the Nevada case we must hold it to be inoperative and void, so far as it affects passengers entering into, departing from, or passing through the State.</p>\n<author id=\"b199-3\">Gilpin, Chibe Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">I fully concur in the judgment of the Court as announced by the Chancellor, that the act of the General Assembly of this State of the eleventh of August, 1864, entitled \u201cAn Act to raise revenue for the State,\u201d in so far as it applies to the transportation of passengers through, from, into, or out of this State, is unconstitutional and void. Rulings which have been made sustaining State Laws in regard to police, the preservation of health, bridges and other matters of a local nature, are evidently exceptional in their character, and cannot be ' considered as of controlling authority in a ease like this. The Act of Assembly in question is clearly and expressly a tax law, a law to raise revenue for the use of the State, a law imposing \u201c a tax at and after the rate of ten cents \u201c for every passenger\u201d transported within the State, and requiring the same to be paid into the hands of the State Treasurer for the use of the State. It is specifically a tax to be applied to general State purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>But it has been contended that this tax is in terms, imposed on the company in respect to its business as a common carrier, and not on passengers transported by it; and that the intention of the Legislature to impose the burden upon the business of the company is made clearly apparent by the language of the act itself, which expressly declares that every person, corporation, or company engaged in the business of transporting or carrying passengers by steam power, shall pay to the State Treasurer, for the use of the State, a tax at and after the rate of ten cents for every passenger so transported, blot that the passenger, but that the company shall pay the tax, the aggregate amount of which shall be measured and determined by the number of passengers transported. Such, in brief, is the argument of the counsel for the plaintiff on the question of construction, and their reading and interpretation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">blow, I beg to remark that on considering the act with the view of determining its true construction, we must look beyond its phraseology to the substance and real meaning underlying the mere letter of the act. If I were to confine myself to- the language merely of the first clause of the first section, disconnected from the proviso of that section, and also from the provisions of the fourth section, I might perhaps, if it were not for the \u00a1Nevada case, hold the tax to be a tax upon the business of the company, and not upon the passengers. But when I find, as I do, upon reading the proviso, that where on the same occasion the passenger travels over several connecting roads belonging to different companies, only one tax of ten cents is required to be paid for traveling over all the connecting roads, and that this tax is to be paid by the company upon whose road the journey began, thus entirely exempting from taxation all the other connecting roads in the State, over which the passenger may travel in the course of his journey; and that, in ascertaining the aggregate amount of the tax to be paid, <em>\u201c </em>all persons carried who \u201c are soldiers or sailors of the United States,\u201d are to' be omitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>from the estimate of the number of passengers actually carried: and when, in addition to this, I consider that by the fourth section of the act, the company is expressly authorized to increase its charge for transportation, \u201c to the amount of tax,\u201d beyond what the passenger would otherwise have been required to pay, thus making the passenger actually pay the tax before commencing his journey, I am forced to the conclusion that it cannot properly be held to be a tax on the business of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">To be properly a tax on business, as such, it would seem to me, that it should be laid or assessed, either on the entire business operations of the company, or on the results of its whole business, or on all its business of a particular class or description, without exception or exemption. \u00a1Now, there is no reference whatever contained in the act, to the general business of the company. On the contrary, it refers solely and exclusively to persons, to the transportation of passengers, not of passengers generally, but of passengers other than soldiers and sailors of the United States. Personality, therefore, thus limited to but part of a class, though a large one, and nothing else in respect to business, runs through the whole act. It is a tax at and after the rate of ten cents for every passenger transported, except that in estimating the number of passengers, soldiers and sailors of the United States carried over the road shall not be counted. All other persons transported are to be counted, and the tax to be levied has respect to them alone. Certainly the business of the company includes, as well the carriage of \u201c Soldiers and Sailors of the United States,\u201d as of all other persons. The former are passengers transported for hire as well as the latter, and if it be a tax on the business of transportation, why should soldiers and sailors of the United States be omitted in estimating or counting the number of passengers carried over the road ? We are told, however, that the act provides for payment of the tax by the company. And so it does. But then, as the tax is required to be paid by that company alone on whose road the passenger begins his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>journey, exempting from taxation all the other connecting roads in the State, over which he may travel in the course of his journey, and as by the fourth section of the act, the company is expressly authorized to increase its charge for transportation \u201c to the amount \u201c of the tax,\u201d and thus to exact payment of the tax from the passenger before permitting him to begin his journey, it is manifest that the true meaning of the act, as well as its practical operation and effect, is to impose the tax on the passengers. But it is unnecessary to consider this branch of the subject any further. Even if I entertained serious doubts as to the true construction of the act, I should feel' myself bound by the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>Orandall v. The State of Nevada, </em>6 <em>Wall. </em>35. That decision, as I understand it, disposes of this case. It decides that a State cannot directly or indirectly tax persons for passing through or out of the State, and that the act of the State of Nevada imposing a tax on railroad and stage companies for every passenger carried out of the State by them, was a tax on the passenger, and not a tax on the business of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">After a careful examination of the provisions of the act of the State of Nevada, I confess myself unable to distinguish it upon principle, from the act of this State now under consideration. If there be any difference between them other than in phraseology, I think it is rather in favor of the Nevada Statute. It seems to me, however, that the decision of the constitutional question involved Hm the Nevada Case, was placed by the majority of the Court upon grounds somewhat new and peculiar, and as might have been expected, not altogether satisfactory to _the judicial mind of the country. And while I do not presume to say that the decision cannot be sustained on the- grounds upon which they have preferred to place it, yet I can not but think they might have based it upon ground much more stable and satisfactory, namely, upon the solid ground of the commercial clause of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Now, if the commercial clause be struck out from the body of the constitution, what particular section, provision, or clause of that instrument can he specified and invoked as a limitation upon, or as a negation of the power of the States to tax passengers for the privilege of passing through their respective territories ? I confess I know of none. And hence if no other provision of the constitution can be pointed out as affording protection against State interference or obstruction to the free intercourse of the citizens of our common country among the several States, it strikes me as being perfectly obvious, that the commercial clause must have greatly influenced the minds of the judges in their consideration of the Nevada Case, because the great principle of supreme sovereignty in regard to commerce or intercourse embodied in that clause, and as I think, to be found no where else, manifestly underlies all the reasoning upon which the majority of the Court have seen fit to place their judgment. And surely if this be so, it would, at least, have been safe and in accord with previous judicial interpretation,to have placed their decision squarely upon the commercial clause. If power to regulate commerce means power to reg\u00e1late the intercourse of the citizen among the several States, the right of every citizen to free transit, would appear to come within both the letter and spirit of this grant of power, and to be fully protected against State interference. And if this be so, I beg respectfully to ask where was the necessity for resorting to the uncertain and debatable ground of the implied powers of the Federal Constitution ? Here is an express grant of power covering the whole subject, why then, look beyond this for something else that is shadowy and indefinite ? And what is more vague and debatable than the doctrine of the implied powers of the Constitution ? Moreover, does not the fact of the grant of an express power to regulate commerce, that is to say, to regulate intercourse among the several States, which is complete and plenary in itself, seem to amount to a negation of the existence of an implied power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>in regard to the same subject matter ? I am aware that the majority of the Court may have found themselves embarrassed by conflicting <em>dicta, </em>and want of harmony of views among the Judges in several former cases, for it is certainly true, as they say in the recent case of <em>Hinson v. </em>Lott,\u2014 Wall\u2014, that \u201c the question of the nature of the <em>\u201c </em>power to regulate commerce, and how far that power is <em>\u201c </em>exclusively vested in Congress, has always been a diffi- \u201c cult one, and has seldom been construed with unanimity.\u201d Thus conceding, however, that it has sometimes been construed with unanimity. But although it is unfortunately too true, that since the year 1827 the Supreme Court has been generally more or less divided in opinion upon the question of the nature and extent of the power to regulate commerce, yet it has never been decided, even by a divided court, that the power was not exclusively vested in Congress. On the contrary, we have the authority of the case of <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>9 <em>Wheat. </em>1, decided in the year 1824, in which it was unanimously settled upon the most solemn deliberation, Chief Justice Marshall delivering the opinion of the Court, and Mr. Justice Johnson concurring in a separate opinion, that the power to regulate commerce is vested exclusively in the Government of the United States. The same doctrine substantially was held in 1827, in the case of <em>Brown v. The State of Maryland, </em>12 <em>Wheat. </em>419. And notwithstanding the differing opinions of the Judges which, as I have said, most unfortunately afterward divided the Court upon this question, the doctrine settled in <em>Gibbons v. Ogden </em>as to the exclusive nature of the power, has never been overruled by any subsequent decision. The case of the <em>City of New York v. Miln, </em>11 <em>Peters, </em>136, can not he considered as having shaken the authority of <em>Gibbons v. Ogden. </em>Indeed, the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Barbour, and reported in (11 Peters, 102,) as the opinion of the Court\u2014a divided Court at best\u2014never had at any time the sanction of a majority of the Court, except in a single particular which did not in any wise impair the authority of <em>Gibbons v. Ogden. </em>All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that was said in that opinion in regard to the power of Congress to regulate commerce, and especially the declaration that \u201cpersons were not the subject of commerce,\u201d was said without the concurrence of a majority of the Court. It was not the intention of the Court in that case to modify in any respect whatever the doctrine settled and expressed in the opinions delivered in the cases of <em>Gibbons v. Ogden </em>and <em>Brown v. Maryland: </em>see Mr. Justice Wayne\u2019s opinion in the Passenger Cases, 7 <em>How. </em>429, 430, 431, 432, 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">Under the circumstances it seems to me that it would have been quite as safe to have placed the decision in the Nevada Case upon the solid ground of the commercial clause, supported by the maturely considered and unanimous judgment of Chief Justice Marshall and his learned and able associates in the case of <em>Gibbons v. </em>Ogden, as to have placed it, as they did, upon the uncertain and debatable ground of the implied powers of the Federal Constitution, supported only by the mere <em>dictum </em>of the venerable Chief Justice Taney contained in the concluding paragraph of his dissenting opinion in the <em>Passenger Cases. </em>You may say indeed that this <em>dictum </em>contains a great principle in regard to the citizens of the States as members of the Union\u2014and I concede it\u2014yet still you find this same principle clearly and firmly embodied in the commercial clause, as the shield and protection of the citizen, and as \u2022a denial of the right of the States to obstruct or interfere with free transit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
