Raymond Lee Organization, Inc., Appellant.</parties>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AL0K\">Order of preliminary injunction, Supreme Court, New York County, entered April 27, 1973, unanimously modified, in the exercise of discretion, as set forth in this memorandum, and otherwise affirmed, without costs and without disbursements. Plaintiff-respondent, formerly an officer of defendant-appellant corporation, severed his relation therewith after an affiliation of some five years\u2019 duration, during which his name and connection and activity with the company had been featured in various brochures, pamphlets and other writings used for advertising purposes, inclusive of reproductions of letters of commendation. It has been contended by plaintiff that defendant has continued to use and distribute these writings in connection with its business, conveying the impression thereby of plaintiff\u2019s continued association with defendant. The sweeping preliminary injunction which has been granted goes far beyond what is required to protect plaintiff from irreparable harm. Therefore we modify the order to strike the injunctive language of the second decretal paragraph commencing with the words \u201c preliminarily enjoined\u201d and through the three subdivisions (a) through (c), and substitute the following: \u201cpreliminarily enjoined from using plaintiff\u2019s name in any writing, a fair reading of which conveys a meaning that plaintiff presently is connected in any capacity with defendant.\u201d At the argument, both sides indicated a readiness for early trial, which we direct to be held as speedily as possible. Either party may apply at Trial Term accordingly. Concur \u2014 Markewich, J. P.-, Nunez, Lane, Steuer and Capozzoli, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
