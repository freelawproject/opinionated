The structure is currently used as an office, and the addition was to consist of office space and two residential apartments. The site plan was approved, \"subject to [the respondent, Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Babylon] granting the associated variances\u201d. Accordingly, the petitioner submitted an application to the Zoning Board for a use variance and a relaxation of the parking requirement from 30 to 26 spaces. No action was taken on the application for over three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The petitioner brought the instant proceeding to compel the Zoning Board to hear his application. In ordering that relief, the Supreme Court determined that the proposed mixed residential and office use was permitted in the subject \"E\u201d Business District, so that no use variance was required. The appellants claim that the court improperly usurped the Zoning Board\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We note that subsequent to the entry of the judgment in the instant proceeding, the Town Board of the Town of Babylon, on September 12, 1989, amended the subject ordinance, Town of Babylon Code \u00a7 213-130, to specifically prohibit residential uses in an \"E\u201d Business District.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">It is a \"general rule that the law as it exists at the time a decision is rendered on appeal is controlling\u201d <em>(Matter of Alscot Investing Corp. v Board of Trustees, </em>64 NY2d 921, 922). For that reason alone, reversal of the judgment insofar as appealed from is mandated. We note that a review of the record does not disclose any bad-faith delay by the town in rendering a decision <em>(cf., Matter of Hatcher v Planning Bd., </em>111 AD2d 812, 813). We note that a statutory stay has been in effect pending this appeal <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5519 [a] [1]).</p>\n<judges id=\"AUN\">Kunzeman, J.
