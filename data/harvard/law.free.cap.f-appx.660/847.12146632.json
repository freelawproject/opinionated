Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion argued, among other things, that his appointed counsel provided constitutionally deficient assistance by failing to file a notice of appeal. After careful consideration, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Williams\u2019s motion without conducting an evidentiary hearing. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s denial of his motion and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Williams pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to manufacturing 500 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A). His plea agreement contained an appeal waiver that excepted three different grounds for appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\">(a) the ground that the sentence exceeds the ... applicable guidelines range as determined by the [district c]ourt pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines; (b) the ground that the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum penalty; or (c) the ground that the sentence violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Plea Agreement at 12-13 (Doc. 8-1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (emphasis omitted). The district court sentenced Williams to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Williams did not file a direct appeal. He later filed a \u00a7 2255 motion claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel for a variety of different reasons, one of which was that his counsel disregarded his express instructions to file a direct appeal. The district court denied this motion without an evidentiary hearing, and we granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether it erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing on a \u00a7 2255 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n.5 (11th Cir. 2002). Evidentiary hearings must be held on \u00a7 2255 motions \u201c[u]nless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). The scope of review is limited to the issues specified in the certificate of appealability. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">\u201c[I]f the petitioner alleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, then the district court should order an evidentiary hearing and rule on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 714-715 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] petitioner need only allege\u2014not prove\u2014reasonably specific, non-conelusory facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715 n.6. \u201cMoreover, the court should construe a habeas petition filed by a pro se litigant more liberally than one filed by an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715. \u201cHowever, a district court need not hold a hearing if the allegations are patently frivolous, based upon unsupported generalizations, or affirmatively contradicted by the record. <em>Winthrop-Redin v. United States, </em>767 F.3d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">At the outset, Williams has alleged facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief. Williams contends that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to file a notice of appeal on his behalf despite being requested to do so. The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>reasonably effective legal assistance. <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 476, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). And in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the Supreme Court established a two-prong test for determining whether a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel. That test requires a defendant seeking relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel to demonstrate \u201c(1) that counsel\u2019s performance failed to meet an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that the defendant\u2019s rights were prejudiced as a result of the attorney\u2019s substandard performance.\u201d <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 791 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">By now, \u201c[i]t is well-settled that a lawyer who disregards instructions from his client to appeal has acted in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790 (internal quotation marks omitted). If. an attorney fails to file an appeal that his client wants filed, we presume prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 792. \u201cAccordingly, to satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, a defendant who shows that his attorney has ignored his wishes and failed to appeal his case need only demonstrate that, but for the attorney\u2019s deficient performance, he would have appealed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Here, Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion alleged facts that, if true, would have entitled him to relief. Williams\u2019s motion alleges that he instructed his defense counsel to file a direct appeal on his behalf and that his counsel failed to do so. And although Williams signed a plea agreement with an appeal waiver, he did not waive <em>all </em>of his appellate rights; Williams was still permitted to appeal in certain limited circumstances. As such, the waiver did not relieve counsel of the duty to file an appeal at Williams\u2019s request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 793-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">The government argues, however, that even if Williams had alleged facts sufficient to merit relief, those facts were \u201cbased upon unsupported generalizations,\u201d \u201caffirmatively contradicted by the record,\u201d or so \u201cpatently frivolous\u201d that an evidentiary hearing was not required. <em>Winthrop-Redin, </em>767 F.3d at 1216 (internal quotation marks omitted). We disagree. Williams\u2019s allegations were not based upon unsupported generalizations. His \u00a7 2255 motion contained a sworn statement that he asked his counsel to appeal his sentence and his counsel failed to follow his instructions. Nor was his motion affirmatively contradicted by the record. Indeed, \u201c[t]his was not a case where the issue[] raised by [Williams\u2019s] motion [was] conclusively determined either by the motion itself or by the \u2018files and records\u2019 in the trial court. The factual allegations ... related primarily to purported occurrences outside the courtroom and upon which the record could, therefore, cast no real light.\u201d <em>Machibroda v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 494-95, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Williams\u2019s allegations were also not patently frivolous. To be sure, there were plenty of reasons to doubt their veracity. For one, Williams\u2019s counsel submitted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>affidavit stating that he had discussed whether to appeal with Williams and that Williams had elected not to do so. For another, and as the district court observed, Williams had made several other unrelated claims that were directly contradicted by the record, raising substantial questions about his credibility. Finally, at the time when Williams would have filed a notice of appeal, he was attempting to obtain a reduction in his sentence by cooperating with the government; filing a notice of appeal may have jeopardized those efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">-Ultimately, however, none of these concerns renders Williams\u2019s allegations patently frivolous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Williams\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit stating that Williams decided not to appeal his sentence, Williams himself filed a sworn statement to the contrary, and \u201cwe have held that contested fact issues in [\u00a7 ] 2255 cases cannot be resolved on the basis of affidavits.\u201d <em>Friedman v. United States, </em>588 F.2d 1010, 1015 (5th Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the fact that the record indicates Williams may have been untruthful with respect to his other claims does not render an eviden-tiary hearing unnecessary. That Williams may have been untruthful as to other matters does not definitively prove that he was untruthful as to the issue at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">And even if appealing may have jeopardized Williams\u2019s efforts to obtain a reduced sentence by cooperating with the government, that does not render his ineffective assistance of counsel allegations pateiitly frivolous. Perhaps Williams believed that an appeal would bear more fruit than his ongoing attempts to cooperate with the government. Or perhaps Williams believed the government would allow him to continue his cooperation notwithstanding his appeal. Although the fact that Williams was cooperating with authorities before sentencing perhaps suggests the possibility that he may not have been rationally inclined to request an appeal, that conclusion is, at this point based solely on speculation. And because actual proof is not required until the evidentiary hearing, such speculation cannot be a proper basis for the district court to deny him a hearing. <em>See Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 715 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The district court abused its discretion by denying Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing because his allegations were reasonably specific and supported, not affirmatively contradicted by the record, and not patently frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-16\">. At sentencing, Williams challenged the application of a career offender enhancement to his sentence, arguing that the enhancement was improper in light of <em>Johnson v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number><em>States, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Although he did not include this claim in the \u00a7 2255 motion at issue here, he has subsequently sought relief based on <em>Johnson </em>before this Court by requesting authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. A panel of this Court denied that motion as premature because Williams\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 motion remained pending. He then moved in this case to remand or, in the alternative, expand his certificate of appealability. If, on remand, the district court concludes that Williams\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance and that Williams is consequently entitled to file an out-of-time appeal, then Williams would be free to challenge his career offender enhancement as part of that appeal. For this reason, Williams\u2019s motion for remand or, in the alternative, expansion of his certificate of appeal-ability is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-13\">. \"Doc.\u201d refers to the docket entry in the district court record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">. To reiterate, Williams may be entitled to relief under <em>Strickland </em>regardless of whether or not he ultimately would have been likely to prevail on his appeal. Williams can satisfy Strickland\u2019s deficient performance prong by demonstrating that his counsel .ignored his request to appeal. <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>433 F.3d at 792. He can satisfy the prejudice prong by proving that, absent his attorney\u2019s deficient performance, he would have appealed. <em>Id. </em>Thus, at this stage, it is not necessary to decide whether his appeal would have had merit or whether it would have fallen within one of the exceptions to his appeal waiver. Williams need only allege that he had the right to appeal, his counsel disregarded that right, and that he would have appealed absent his counsel\u2019s conduct. <em>See id. </em>He has done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">. The government also notes that Williams did not file his \u00a7 2255 motion until a full year after receiving his sentence. This delay, the government argues, supports the conclusion that Williams never asked his attorney to file a direct appeal because, had he done so, he would have sought \u00a7 2255 relief sooner. But even if evidence of Williams\u2019s delay in filing his \u00a7 2255 motion implies that he never requested an appeal, it is not so compelling that it renders his allegations to the contrary patently frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b868-15\">.
