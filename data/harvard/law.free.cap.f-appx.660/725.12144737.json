(\u201cSequoia\u201d) filed an amended complaint against Sylvia L. Warren and Donald Warren Sr. (\u201cthe Warrens\u201d), seeking to foreclose on a property. Sequoia argued that the Warrens defaulted on a note to which Sequoia claims to have been assigned. After a one-day bench trial, the district court concluded that Sequoia failed to establish that it owned the note and thus dismissed the action without prejudice because Sequoia lacked standing. Sequoia now appeals the district court\u2019s orders awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the Warrens and denying Sequoia\u2019s amended motion for reconsideration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as several other of the district court\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">When attorneys\u2019 fees are authorized, we review the district court\u2019s decision to award fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Davis v. Nat\u2019l Med. Enters., Inc., </em>253 F.3d 1314, 1318 (11th Cir. 2001). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s ruling upon a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment and a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from a final judgment. <em>Solutia, Inc. v. McWane, Inc., </em>672 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir. 2012); <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">Sequoia argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the Warrens. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">In diversity cases such as this one, the right to attorneys\u2019 fees is determined by reference to state law. <em>See All Underwriters v. Weisberg, 222 </em>F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir. 2000). The Warrens seek attorneys\u2019 fees under a Florida statute providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>that, \u201c[i]f a contract contains a provision allowing attorney\u2019s fees to a party when he \u25a0 or she is required to take any action to enforce the contract, the court may also allow reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the other party when that party prevails in any action, whether as plaintiff or defendant, with respect to the contract.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.105(7). The award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 57.105(7) is mandatory for the prevailing party. <em>Holiday Square Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Tsetsenis, </em>820 So.2d 450, 453 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The note and, mortgage at issue in this case provided that the holder/lender would be entitled to \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d incurred in enforcing those agreements. Because both agreements contained a provision allowing for the holder/lender to collect attorneys\u2019 fees in enforcing them, the Warrens as the borrowers may receive attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 57.105(7) because they prevailed when the district court dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Sequoia contends that the district court should not have awarded attorneys\u2019 fees because the Warrens failed to preserve their claim for fees. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2) gives the district court the authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees after a party makes a motion, \u201cunless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(A). Sequoia\u2019s argument rests on the assumption that the Warrens\u2019 requested attorneys\u2019 fees are a type of damages. However, under Florida law, \u201cthe recovery of attorney\u2019s fees is ancillary to the claim for damages.\u201d <em>Cheek v. McGowan Elec. Supply Co., </em>511 So.2d 977, 979 (Fla. 1987). As the Florida Supreme Court explained, \u201c[a] contractual provision authorizing the payment of attorney\u2019s fees is not part of the substantive claim because it is only intended to make the successful party whole by reimbursing him for the expense of litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Florida, attorneys\u2019 fees authorized pursuant to a contract \u201cmay be presented for the first time after final judgment pursuant to a motion for attorney\u2019s fees\u201d and are not subject to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>Florida law thus did not require the Warrens to plead attorneys\u2019 fees before trial or to prove them at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Because the attorneys\u2019 fees in this case are not damages, the Warrens needed only to comply with Rule 54 and the district court\u2019s local rules. Rule 54(d) requires a party seeking attorneys\u2019 fees to file a motion \u201cno later than 14 days after the entry of judgment.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B)(i). The district court\u2019s local rules require all claims for costs or attorneys\u2019 fees to be \u201cpreserved by appropriate pleading <em>or </em>pretrial stipulation\u201d and to be reasserted \u201cby separate motion or petition filed not later than fourteen (14) days following the entry of judgment.\u201d M.D. Fla. Local R. 4.18 (emphasis added). The Warrens complied with these requirements when they included their request for attorneys\u2019 fees in their answer to Sequoia\u2019s complaint and made a timely request for attorneys\u2019 fees after the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Sequoia\u2019s remaining arguments focus on how the district court calculated the fee award in this case. The district court calculated reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees using the \u201clodestar\u201d method, taking \u201cthe number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Sequoia disputes both the number of hours expended and the hourly rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Sequoia claims that the district court erred in awarding the Warrens attorneys\u2019 fees without hearing expert testimony regarding the reasonableness of the Warrens\u2019 attorneys\u2019 hourly rate. However, Sequoia failed to raise this argument either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>in its objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation or in its motion for reconsideration of the order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. We generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal in civil cases. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331-32 (11th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, we decline to consider Sequoia\u2019s argument about the reasonableness of the fees because Sequoia raised it for the first time on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Sequoia also argues that the district court erred in calculating the amount of fees it awarded. Sequoia objects to the time Warren\u2019s attorney billed for consultations with a non-attorney, Richard Cant-well, who previously was sanctioned for illegally providing tax advice. But the Warrens hired Cantwell as their agent and instructed their lawyer to communicate directly with Cantwell regarding the case. Sequoia points to no authority that prevents a lawyer from charging for time spent communicating with a client\u2019s agent. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the Warrens, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Sequoia argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its amended motion for reconsideration of the orders dismissing the case and awarding the attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sequoia\u2019s motion either under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 or 60. <em>See Livernois v. Med. Disposables, Inc., </em>837 F.2d 1018, 1020 (11th Cir. 1988) (stating that \u201cthis Court will characterize a motion as one under Rule 59 or Rule 60, depending on the type of relief requested.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">First, Sequoia\u2019s motion was untimely under Rule 59. A party may alter or amend a judgment under Rule 59, but that motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). \u201cA court must not extend the time to act under\u201d Rule 59(e). Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2). Sequoia filed its motion for reconsideration 30 days after the order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and nine months after the order dismissing the action. Although Sequoia argues that it should benefit from an additional three days for service by mail per Rule 6(d), we have held that the three-day extension is inapplicable to service deadlines under Rule 59(b), which is identical to the service provision under 59(e). <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1113-14 (11th Cir. 1993). Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the motion for reconsideration as untimely under Rule 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Second, Sequoia provided insufficient support to prevail under Rule 60. Under Rule 60(b)(6), a party may receive relief from a judgment or order for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief\u2019 that is not enumerated in Rule 60(b)(1)\u2014(5). Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(6). \u201cAn appeal of a ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion ... is narrow in scope, addressing only the propriety of the denial or grant of relief and does not raise issues in the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Nw. Nat. Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir. 1999). \u201c[I]t is not enough that a grant of the [Rule 60(b) motion] might have been permissible or warranted; rather, the decision to deny the motion[ ] must have been sufficiently unwarranted as to amount to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Swim-Tech Corp., </em>722 F.2d 677, 680 (11th Cir. 1984). \u201cIt is well established, however, that relief under this clause is an extraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Af\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Sequoia failed to establish that its circumstances were so extraordinary to entitle it to relief from the orders dismissing the case and awarding the attorneys\u2019 fees. In fact, Sequoia makes no argument as to why we should vaeate the district court\u2019s order other than the legal arguments it made in district court. Because we find no extraordinary circumstances, \u201cwe cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion to deny the motion on the basis of that section.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We affirm each of the appealed orders of the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\">. Sequoia styled this motion as an \u201camended motion for reconsideration and/or alter/amend orders\" under Fed. R. Civ. P, 59 and 60. We will refer to it as the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-12\">. Previously this Court dismissed as untimely Sequoia's appeal of the district court\u2019s orders denying Sequoia\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing Sequoia\u2019s case, and directing the clerk to return the original note to Sequoia\u2019s counsel. We also dismissed several claims as premature, although those claims are now before us because we consolidated this case with another case making timely claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-21\">.As we write for the parties, we set out only what is necessary to address Sequoia's arguments,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">. Sequoia appeals the district court's denial of Sequoia\u2019s motion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, which the district court discussed in the order denying the motion for reconsideration. We need not address that issue, however, because it is moot. <em>See Reich v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>102 F.3d 1200, 1201 (11th Cir. 1997) (\u201cA case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Sequoia also contends that the district court judge should have recused herself because her spouse was opposing counsel in another action involving Sequoia. Sequoia admits that it is raising this issue for the first time on appeal. Almost four months after the district court dismissed the case, Sequoia provided notice to the district court judge about the potential conflict but specifically did not seek recusal. Because Sequoia failed to seek recusal in the district court, we review the district court\u2019s implicit decision not to recuse <em>sua sponte </em>only for plain error. <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir. 1983). Sequoia\u2019s contention that the district court judge was biased because of her spouse\u2019s connection to a separate case is insufficient to create a \"significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the district court judge did not plainly err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>recuse herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-20\">Sequoia further appeals several of <em>the </em>district court's orders either granting the Warrens\u2019 motions for leave to reply or denying Sequoia\u2019s motions for leave to reply. We affirm each of these orders based on the district court's inherent authority \"to exercise its managerial power to maintain control over its docket.\u201d <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, Fla., </em>358 F.3d 859, 864 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
