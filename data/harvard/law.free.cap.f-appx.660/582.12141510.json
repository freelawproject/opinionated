Lucero, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b601-23\">Retiree, Inc., filed suit against Dana An-spach and Sensible Money, LLC, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>breach of a confidentiality agreement. Following a bench trial, the district court ruled in favor of Retiree, entered a permanent injunction, and awarded Retiree $500,000 in liquidated damages. Defendants now appeal. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Retiree is a retirement-planning firm specializing in decumulation\u2014the process of efficiently drawing down retirement assets. As described by Retiree principal William Meyer, the company attempts to extend asset longevity by coordinating five elements: (1) asset allocation, which refers to the mix of stocks and bonds in a portfolio; (2) tax efficiency, which looks to increase the after-tax amount of assets; (3) asset location, which concerns the placement of investments in particular accounts; (4) withdrawal sequencing, which refers to the order of account withdrawals; and (5) Social Security claiming strategies. Retiree spent more than three years developing its \u201cbig model\u201d\u2014an Excel spreadsheet coordinating the five elements, which includes more than 800 rows of tax calculations. The company has also developed a simplified \u201cQuiekStart\u201d model which generates free client reports showing side-by-side comparisons of various decumulation strategies.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Anspach is a Certified Financial Planner and has earned a Retirement Management Analyst designation from the Retirement Income Industry Association (\u201cRILA\u201d). Since 2008, she has authored a popular retirement-planning blog. In early 2011, she was a principal of Wealth Management Solutions (\u201cWMS\u201d), a financial planning and investment advisory firm. According to Meyer, decumulation was not Anspach\u2019s niche practice at WMS, although she was familiar with the decumulation concepts identified above.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">In February 2011, Meyer contacted An-spach and the two began considering merging Anspaeh\u2019s portion of WMS\u2019 practice into Retiree. In March 2011, Anspach left WMS. She signed a Confidentiality, Non-Compete and Invention Ownership Agreement (the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d) with Retiree. In the Confidentiality Agreement, Anspach acknowledged that she would receive \u201cConfidential Information,\u201d which was defined as \u201ccertain confidential and proprietary information concerning, without limitation, trade secrets, software products, software designs, specifications, processes, plans, or other ideas or inventions relating to the financial services industry.\u201d Anspach agreed that she would \u201cnot use the Confidential Information other than for the purposes of [her] business with [Retiree]\u201d and would \u201cnot disclose, publish or otherwise reveal any of the Confidential Information received from [Retiree] to any other party whatsoever except with the specific prior written authorization of [Retiree].\u201d The Confidentiality Agreement also contained a liquidated damages provision requiring Anspach to pay Retiree $250,000 for each violation. During her affiliation with the company, she received' access to documents Retiree considered confidential and proprietary, including the QuiekStart spreadsheet. She was not provided access to the \u201cbig model,\u201d although Meyer showed her portions of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Shortly after leaving WMS, however, Anspach decided against joining Retiree. She instead formed a new company called Sensible Money. In February 2012, Retiree filed suit alleging Anspach and Sensible Money had breached the Confidentiality Agreement by using Retiree\u2019s Confidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Information and by disclosing that Confidential Information to third parties. Retiree sought both injunctive relief and damages. The district court held a preliminary injunction hearing followed by a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">At those proceedings, Meyer testified that as of 2011 very few retirement advis-ors focused on decumulation, and that none efficiently coordinated Retiree's five elements. Meyer repeatedly stressed that the trae value of the Retiree model was the ability to coordinate these five components. He conceded that each individual element is simple to understand, but testified only Retiree (and perhaps one other competitor) was able to comprehensively coordinate all five factors. Meyer also testified that interactions between the components made Retiree\u2019s process exponentially more complex. For example, withdrawal sequencing strategies appearing optimal when viewed in isolation might result in more Social Security income being subject to taxation, and maximizing tax efficiency in turn requires proper asset location. However, Meyer acknowledged that many aspects of Retiree\u2019s complex methodology were in the public sphere because, for example, Retiree principals authored publications explaining portions of the model. But Meyer suggested that the publications were generally limited to case studies, and disclosed only limited information on the underlying methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">To support Retiree\u2019s use claim, Meyer compared Anspach\u2019s spreadsheets from before and after her association with Retiree. He noted that the \u201cpre-Retiree\u201d spreadsheet contained several of An-spach\u2019s annotations identifying gaps in her model\u2014in particular that \u201ca tax calculation needs to be developed,\u201d and that the document should show \u201cideal allocation based on an algorithm that needs to be defined/developed.\u201d Further, Meyer observed that the pre-Retiree spreadsheet lacked Social Security strategies. Meyer then offered Anspach\u2019s more sophisticated \u201cpost-Retiree\u201d spreadsheet, which allowed An-spach to coordinate Social Security benefits and -withdrawal sequencing to minimize taxes. The post-Retiree spreadsheet also included information regarding the proper amounts to draw from taxable and tax-deferred accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Anspach further developed her post-Retiree spreadsheet by the time of trial. In June 2013, she authored a document describing her new \u201cSpreadsheet 2.0\u201d and identifying \u201ckey differentiators\u201d that \u201cmake it different from current planning projection models.\u201d Anspach stated that Spreadsheet 2.0: (1) allows users \u201cto see which years you have tax opportunities in a way that no other tool does\u201d; (2) \u201c[ajccu-rately incorporate[s] the taxation of Social Security\u201d; and (3) has \u201c[t]he ability to tie withdrawal strategy to a specific investment allocation by account type.\u201d Meyer testified that the spreadsheet disclosed to Anspach does each of these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Anspach\u2019s testimony differed sharply from Meyer\u2019s. She stated that although planners use different terms and methods, the industry standard is for every financial planner to advise clients in coordinating the five elements Meyer identified. She denied that her spreadsheets use Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information, claiming she obtained her information from commercially available software. And she distinguished her spreadsheets from Retiree\u2019s by averring that hers could not automatically coordinate tax and Social Security information.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">As to Retiree\u2019s disclosure claim, Meyer testified that Anspach presented her post-Retiree spreadsheets at RILA events. An-spach denied promoting her spreadsheet at the events, arguing that she only presented client reports which resulted from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>model. Retiree also argued that a book Anspach published included case studies which constituted disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The district court found that Anspach violated the Confidentiality Agreement \u201cby appropriating the processes and methodology that underlay Retiree\u2019s software and practices.\u201d It rejected Anspach\u2019s position that Retiree\u2019s methods were commonplace, noting that after Anspach began calling \u201cnotably similar methodologies and processes her own,\u201d she herself described them as \u201cnovel, unique and cutting-edge in the industry.\u201d The differences between An-spach\u2019s pre- and post-Retiree spreadsheets, the court found, was \u201ccompelling\u201d circumstantial evidence that Anspach used Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information. It noted that Anspach was able to develop a spreadsheet similar to Retiree\u2019s in just six months, while Retiree\u2019s process took several years. The court also held that An-spach disclosed Confidential Information to Retiree\u2019s competitors. It awarded $500,000 in liquidated damages ($250,000 each for the use and disclosure breaches), and entered a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Anspach and Sensible Money moved to alter or amend the judgment. The district court granted the motion in part. It clarified that the damages award was entered only against Anspach, not Sensible Money. The court also set forth the terms of its permanent injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Defendants shall be permanently enjoined from using their Post-Retiree Spreadsheets/Excel Models and shall remove all material on their website that was created using these spreadsheets/models, in particular their case studies page and The Free Report. Defendants are further enjoined from utilizing their Post-Retiree Spreadsheets/Excel Models in presentations, speaking engagements, books, and articles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The court defined \u201cPost-Retiree Spreadsheets/Excel Models\u201d as any \u201cspreadsheet or Excel model that utilizes this methodology that was shown to Anspach during her affiliation with Retiree.\u201d The court described Retiree\u2019s appropriated methodology as \u201cintegrat[ing] all of the [five] factors and allowing] a client to see, in real-time, how changing variables would affect their financial picture.\u201d The court otherwise denied defendants\u2019 motion, and they timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">\u201cIn an appeal from a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Brantley, 510 F.3d 1256, 1260 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted). The parties agree that substantive Kansas state law governs this diversity case. See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Anspach first contends that the Confidentiality Agreement is unenforceable. Whether a contractual provision is enforceable is a question of law we review de novo. See Riley v. Kingsley Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., 969 F.2d 953, 956 (10th Cir. 1992). \u201cIn Kansas, it is well recognized that a restrictive covenant in an employment contract will only be applied to the extent it is reasonably necessary under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d Puritan-Bennett Corp. v. Richter, 235 Kan. 251, 679 P.2d 206, 210 (1984). \u201c[O]nly a legitimate business interest may be protected by a noncompetition covenant. If the sole purpose is to avoid ordinary competition, it is unreasonable and unenforceable.\u201d Weber v. Tillman, 259 Kan. 457, 913 P.2d 84, 89 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>As the Kansas Supreme Court has noted, many jurisdictions hold that businesses possess a legitimate interest in protecting \u201cthe special training of employees, trade secrets, confidential-business information, loss of clients, good will, reputation, seeing that contracts with clients contin\u00fae, and referral sources.\u201d Id. at 91. Kansas Courts have held that businesses may validly protect not only trade secrets, but other confidential information through contract. In Kansas, the \u201claw is clear that an ex-employee may be enjoined from disclosing confidential material and trade secrets gained in the course of his or her employment.\u201d Farmers Grp. v. Lee, 29 Kan. App.2d 382, 28 P.3d 413, 419 (2001); see also E. Distrib. Co. v. Flynn, 222 Kan. 666, 567 P.2d 1371, 1378 (1977) (\u201cThe existence of trade secrets as evidence of enticing customers from a former employer is sometimes relevant, but not' essential, to injunctive relief in a suit brought for breach of covenant not to compete.\u201d); Heatron, Inc. v. Shackelford, 898 F.Supp. 1491, 1500 (D. Kan. 1995) (\u201cKansas courts have long recognized the employer\u2019s right to maintain confidentiality of trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information pertaining to the employer\u2019s business practices as an interest entitled to protection.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The policy behind enforcing such confidentiality clauses is to bar an employee from \u201cobtaining] an unfair competitive advantage.\u201d Weber, 913 P.2d at 92. But contractual provisions that \u201crestrict communication of ideas in general\u201d are impermissible. Puritan-Bennett, 679 P.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Anspach argues the Confidentiality Agreement is overbroad, relying on Puritan-Bennett. There, the court held that a clause prohibiting a former employee from using \u201cany information connected with any aspect of the Company\u2019s business\u201d was unenforceable. 1\u215b Similarly, the Confidentiality Agreement in this case barred use or disclosure of \u201cother ideas or inventions relating to the financial services industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Although this clause is overbroad, it does not render the entire Confidentiality Agreement unenforceable. In Puritan-Bennett, the Kansas Supreme Court held that \u201c[s]trict enforcement\u201d of the confidentiality clause at issue \u201cwould unreasonably infringe upon appellant\u2019s right to earn a living.\u201d Id. But the court nevertheless enforced the provision to the extent reasonable, enjoining the former employee \u201cfrom disclosing information relating to Puritan-Bennett\u2019s research, development, production or sales techniques of gaseous and chemical aircraft emergency oxygen equipment.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The district court below effectively did the same. It determined that Retiree had developed a \u201cunique methodology ... which is embodied and expressed through [its] spreadsheet\u201d and that Anspach \u201cappropriate[d] the processes and methodology that underlay Retiree\u2019s software and practices.\u201d The court made clear that it was not barring Anspach from using spreadsheets, tax and Social Security planning software, or other ideas or inventions related to the financial services industry in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>general. Instead, the court enjoined the use of Retiree\u2019s process and methodology by limiting its injunction to the use of a coordinated spreadsheet that provided live updates based on changing variables, such that a client could compare various strategies\u2019 outcomes in real time.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">As to this limited universe of information, we agree with the district court that the Confidentiality Agreement is enforceable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the district court found, \u201cthe processes and methodology that underlay Retiree\u2019s software and practices\u201d fall within the definition of \u201cConfidential Information\u201d in the Confidentiality Agreement. This is true even omitting the overbroad \u201cother ideas or inventions\u201d clause. Meyer testified that Retiree restricted access to those methods and processes and required confidentiality agreements from anyone given access. He also testified that Retiree was in negotiations with other companies to license Retiree\u2019s services or invest in Retiree\u2019s intellectual property for millions of dollars. The steps taken by Retiree to protect its spreadsheet model, combined with Anspach\u2019s own words describing the model\u2019s novelty, convince us that the information used by Anspach was within the enforceable ambit of the Confidentiality Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Similarly, that portions of Retiree\u2019s methodology use public information does not render the Confidentiality Agreement unenforceable. Even a \u201ctrade secret can exist in a combination of components, each of which, by itself, might be in the public domain. A knowledge of the best combination of processes or systems of combination of elements may amount to a trade secret.\u201d Mann v. Tatge Chem. Co., 201 Kan. 326, 440 P.2d 640, 647 (1968). While affiliated with Retiree, Anspach learned valuable confidential information regarding coordination of decumulation strategies. And her spreadsheets changed quickly and dramatically after her relationship with Retiree terminated. In making her new spreadsheets, Anspach used information that she had contractually agreed not to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Of course, the line between \u201cordinary competition\u201d and \u201cunfair competitive advantage,\u201d Weber, 913 P.2d at 92, is difficult to draw. So too is the line between \u201cconfidential business information,\u201d id. at 91, and \u201cideas in general,\u201d Puritan-Bennett, 679 P.2d at 211. Nevertheless, granting due deference to the district court\u2019s factual findings, see Weyerhaeuser, 510 E.3d at 1260, we conclude that the restrictions of the Confidentiality Agreement enforced by the district court were \u201creasonably necessary under the facts and circumstances of the particular case\u201d and thus permissible, Puritan-Bennett, 679 P.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Anspach also argues that the district court erred in finding that she breached the Confidentiality Agreement by using and disclosing Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information. We review these factual findings for clear error. Weyerhaeuser, 510 F.3d at 1260. \u201cWe will reverse for clear error only if the district court\u2019s finding was without factual support in the record or we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d United States v. Martinez-Jimenez, 464 F.3d 1205, 1209 .(10th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">As to Retiree\u2019s use claim, Anspach contends Retiree failed to present necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>evidence indicating she misappropriated Retiree\u2019s formulas or algorithms. She further argues that the differences between her post-Retiree models and Retiree\u2019s spreadsheets demonstrate that she did not use proprietary information. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Anspach\u2019s argument that her spreadsheets lacked the specific formulas contained in Retiree\u2019s spreadsheets is unavailing. The district court expressly found that Anspaeh did not adopt the specific formulas from Retiree\u2019s spreadsheets, but that she nevertheless appropriated \u201cthe processes and methodology that underlay Retiree\u2019s software.\u201d As described supra, Retiree\u2019s methods are within the scope of an enforceable agreement regardless of whether Anspaeh copied particular spreadsheet cells. And after her affiliation with Retiree, Anspaeh described several features that her \u201cSpreadsheet 2.0\u201d shared with Retiree\u2019s spreadsheets as \u201cdifferent from current planning projection models.\u201d Thus, Anspaeh herself stated that the methods she adopted\u2014which were nearly identical to Retiree\u2019s methods\u2014were novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The court further found that Anspaeh was able to develop a spreadsheet far more sophisticated that the one she used prior to her affiliation with Retiree in only six months, and concluded this was strong circumstantial evidence that she used Retiree\u2019s methods. Anspaeh counters that her spreadsheet was not as sophisticated as Retiree\u2019s. Specifically, she notes that her post-Retiree spreadsheet was not fully integrated. The district court acknowledged that Anspach\u2019s models were not as detailed, but concluded that her ability to \u201creplicate parts of Retiree\u2019s spreadsheet\u201d in \u201can abbreviated time\u201d led to the conclusion that Anspaeh used Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information. We are not left with a firm conviction that these findings are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We reach the opposite conclusion as to Retiree\u2019s disclosure claim. The district court found that Anspaeh disclosed \u201cconfidential information to Retiree\u2019s competitors, including software providers Finance Logix and Social Security Timing.\u201d But Retiree states in its briefing that reference to these companies is \u201cmisplaced,\u201d and that Retiree introduced evidence about the Finance Logix-Social Security Timing transaction merely \u201cto show the reasonableness of the $250,000 liquidated damages number.\u201d Retiree instead argues that Anspaeh disclosed Confidential Information at conferences and in her book.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Meyer testified that Anspaeh \u201cpresented her Excel model\u201d at several RILA conferences. He did not claim to have attended these conferences, instead stating that \u201cit was written up in the RILA newsletter.\u201d But the newsletter was not introduced. Nor are we directed to any witness testimony contradicting Anspach\u2019s account of her presentation. Anspaeh testified that she showed \u201cclient reports, stuff you would show to a client, just as an example of one way to lay out the information\u201d at the conferences. She stated that she \u201cwasn\u2019t promoting [her] Excel model.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Meyer\u2019s bare-bones testimony that he learned from a newsletter that Anspach presented her model is insufficient to support a finding that Anspaeh disclosed Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information. A factfinder cannot \u201cengage in a degree of speculation and conjecture that renders its finding a guess or mere possibility.\u201d Sunward Corp. v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., 811 F.2d 511, 521 (10th Cir. 1987) (quotation omitted). Merely displaying client reports would not constitute disclosure of Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information. As Meyer conceded, client reports are \u201cin the public domain\u201d and thus \u201cnot confidential.\u201d Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tiree itself provides free client reports to the public, and Retiree\u2019s principals have published papers containing client case studies. Simply, client reports demonstrating that Retiree can coordinate various elements are not protectable; rather \u201chow to do it, how these things are coordinated\u201d is. See Puritan-Bennett, 679 P.2d at 211 (covenants that \u201crestrict communication of ideas in general\u201d are unenforceable). Without any substantive evidence that An-spach disclosed to conference attendees how Retiree\u2019s methodology operates, the record contains insufficient evidence that she disclosed protectable information at the conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Retiree contends that Anspach disclosed Confidential Information in a book she authored. But the portions of Anspach\u2019s book Retiree cites merely offer a case study discussing various decumulation scenarios for a hypothetical couple. The case study shows the results of implementing various methods Anspach appropriated from Retiree, but does not disclose how to coordinate the various elements. Again, such case studies are not protectable\u2014and Retiree itself similarly makes case studies publicly available. Meyer also claimed that Anspach disclosed Confidential Information by' recommending that her readers use commercially available Social Security calculators. The idea of incorporating Social Security strategies, however, is a general idea, and does not comprise Confidential Information about Retiree\u2019s methods. See id. Moreover, referring readers to a commercially available calculator that does not use Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information does not disclose any protectable information. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that Anspach disclosed Retiree\u2019s protectable information was without factual support in the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Lastly, defendants argue that the district court\u2019s permanent injunction fails to \u201cstate its terms specifically .,. and ... describe in reasonable detail\u2014and not by referring to the complaint or other document\u2014the act or acts restrained or required.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d). Whether an injunction is sufficiently specific is a legal question we review de novo. Reliance Ins. Co. v. Mast Constr. Co., 159 F.3d 1311, 1316 (10th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\u201c[A]n injunction cannot be so general as to leave the party open to the hazard of conducting business in the mistaken belief that it is not prohibited by the injunction and thus make him vulnerable to prosecution for contempt.\u201d Jd. (quotation omitted). \u201cRule 65(d) requires only that the enjoined conduct be described in reasonable, not excessive, detail\u2014particularly in cases ... when overly precise terms would permit the very conduct sought to be' enjoined.\u201d Id. In assessing whether an order complies with Rule 65(d), we construe the district court\u2019s language \u201cin light of the injunctive order as a whole.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The district court enjoined defendants from \u201cusing their Post-Retiree Spreadsheets/Excel Models\u201d and \u201cutilizing their Post-Retiree Spreadsheets/Excel Models in presentations, speaking engage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ments, books, and articles.\u201d It defined \u201cPost-Retiree Spreadsheets/Excel Models\u201d to include any \u201cspreadsheet or Excel model that utilizes this methodology that was shown to Anspach during her affiliation with Retiree.\u201d And it explained that Retiree\u2019s methodology was a \u201cmodel that coordinated the five factors set out in\u201d a prior order<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in a manner that \u201cintegrate^] all of these factors and allow[s] a client to see, in real-time, how changing variables would affect their financial picture.\u201d We hold that this explanation adequately puts defendants on notice of the conduct that is prohibited, and that which is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Defendants relatedly challenge the injunction\u2019s lack of a temporal limitation. Retiree observes that in assessing the reasonableness of a non-competition covenant, Kansas courts consider whether \u201cthe time and territorial limitations contained in the covenant reasonable.\u201d Id. However, Kansas courts have enforced non-disclosure agreements without any temporal limitation. See Puritan-Bennett, 679 P.2d at 211-12 (enforcing non-disclosure agreement prohibiting disclosure of contractually protected information \u201cduring my employment or at any time thereafter\u201d), Because this case concerns a nondisclosure agreement rather than a non-compete covenant baring all competition, the indefinite term is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s award of $260,000 in damages on Retiree\u2019s disclosure claim. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment in all other respects and REMAND for modification of the damages award consistent with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ue consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-5\">. In Puritan-Bennett, the Kansas Supreme Court noted that agreements that restrict more than \"purely trade secrets, have been held unreasonable.\u201d 679 P.2d at 211. But in the same decision, the court held that \u201c[t]he question of trade secret disclosure is not determinative of appellees\u2019 right to have the noncompetition covenant in force.\u201d Id. at 212. We thus do not read Puritan-Bennett as establishing a rule that only trade secrets are protectable by contract. See Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Malinowski, 787 P.2d 742, 1990 Kan.App. LEXIS 66, at *3 (Kan. Ct. App. 1990) (unpublished) (in Puritan-Bennett, the Kansas \"Supreme Court also held that valid purposes of covenants not to compete are not only to protect trade secrets, but also to prevent an employee from using the expertise learned from his or her former employer to a competitor\u2019s benefit\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\">. We acknowledge that Meyer made over-broad claims about the Confidential Information in his testimony, stating for example that free reports issued to clients without a confidentiality agreement were confidential. But we review the district court\u2019s orders, not the claims of Retiree\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-5\">. We also note that regardless of Retiree's concession, Anspach\u2019s involvement in the Finance Logix and Social Security Timing transaction would not support a finding that Anspach disclosed Confidential Information. Retiree cited Anspach\u2019s statement that Finance Logix would be rolling out a feature to incorporate Social Security taxation thanks to her. Anspach testified that she recommended a commercially available social security calculator offered by Social Security Timing to a Finance Logix principal, Again merely referring a company to commercially available software does not constitute disclosure of Retiree\u2019s Confidential Information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">, The \"prior order\u201d identifies the five factors discussed supra. Defendants do not argue that the injunction violates Rule 65(d) by \"referring to the complaint or other document,\u201d see Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d), and any such challenge is waived, see Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 679 (10th Cir. 1998) (\"Arguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
