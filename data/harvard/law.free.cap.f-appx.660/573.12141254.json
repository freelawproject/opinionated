Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">Plaintiff Yung-Kai Lu, a citizen of Taiwan, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his lawsuit alleging tort and contract claims against the University of Utah and several of its officials claiming they wrongfully failed to renew his doctoral-studies scholarship after the expiration of its contractual term. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the dismissal of Lu\u2019s second amended complaint for substantially the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">Because the district court dismissed Lu\u2019s amended complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we must \u201caccept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and view these allegations in the light most favorable to [him],\u201d <em>Casanova v. Ulibarri, </em>595 F.3d 1120, 1124 (10th Cir. 2010) (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s order thoroughly and accurately sets forth Lu\u2019s allegations; thus, our summary is brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-20\">The University entered into a written agreement with Lu in May 2010, agreeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>to give him a scholarship in return for Lu\u2019s agreement to be a teaching assistant (the contract). The contract specified that scholarships and teaching assistant appointments are limited to \u201cone academic year at a time\u201d and that Lu\u2019s appointment was \u201ca nine-month appointment beginning August 16, 2010, and ending May 15, 2011.\u201d R. Vol. I, at 287. Despite this limitation, Lu alleges that University Assistant Music Director Donn Schaefer verbally promised him that as long as he maintained a 3.00 GPA, the assistantship and scholarship would be renewed for the full three years Lu studied for his doctorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In April 2011, Schaefer told Lu the contract wouldn\u2019t be renewed because the University lacked sufficient funding. But according to Lu, defendant Robert Baldwin, the Director of Orchestral Activities and of Graduate Studies, told Lu the contract wouldn\u2019t be renewed because defendant Miguel Chuaqui, Interim Director of the School of Music, reported that Lu had been rude. Lu complained to defendants Lori McDonald, Dean of Students, and Charles Wight, Former Dean of the Graduate School. Lu didn\u2019t re-enroll for the next academic term and his failure to enroll was reported to immigration officials by McDonald and defendant Chalimar Swain, Director, International Center. As a result Lu\u2019s visa wasn\u2019t extended, resulting in his deportation to Taiwan. After his deportation, Lu filed an ethics complaint with the University\u2019s Internal Audit Department. Defendants Charles Piele and Michael Goodrich, University Audit Managers, investigated the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Lu\u2019s complaint against the University and University officials in their official capacities (collectively, the defendants) alleged they breached the contract and verbal promises. Lu also alleged tort claims for slander and for dereliction of unspecified duties, claiming the defendants made false statements about his job performance, gave inaccurate information to immigration officials, and failed to timely or properly investigate his complaints. His complaint also mentioned the Taiwan Relations Act and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The defendants moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6), asserting that the court lacked jurisdiction over the claims and that Lu\u2019s complaint failed to state any plausible claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">In granting the defendants\u2019 motion, the district court found Lu\u2019s tort claims -barred under both the Eleventh Amendment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Utah Governmental Immunity Act (UGIA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, the court concluded Lu failed to allege any plausible breach of contract claims given the contract\u2019s unambiguous language as to the term of the contract. Additionally, the court reasoned that Utah\u2019s parol evidence rule and statute of frauds barred any verbal promise to extend Lu\u2019s appointment for three years. Finally, the district court ruled that Lu lacked any plausible claim under the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), Taiwan Relations Act, the International Covenant on Eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>nomic, Social and Cultural Rights or any other international treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo. <em>Casanova, </em>595 F.3d at 1124. To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted .as true, \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Because Lu proceeds pro se, we construe his complaint liberally, but pro se parties are \u201cnot relieve[d] ... of the burden of alleging sufficient facts on which a recognized legal claim could be based.\u201d <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Lu raises numerous issues on appeal. First, he argues the district court erred in failing to evaluate his claims under the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA). But we won\u2019t consider this argument because Lu never raised an APA claim or issue before the district court. <em>See Turner v. Pub. Serv. Co. of Colo., </em>563 F.3d 1136, 1143 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cAbsent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Next, Lu contends the UGIA is unconstitutional and doesn\u2019t apply to claims alleging violations of the Utah Constitution. Within this claim of error, Lu argues the defendants\u2019 actions violated the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as provisions of the Utah Constitution and state criminal code provisions. Again, we won\u2019t consider these arguments as they aren\u2019t based on any claim asserted in his complaint. Moreover, Lu cites no authority supporting his assertion that the UGIA is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"A4IC\">Lu also challenges the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment, arguing his suit against the defendants is not a suit against the State of Utah. As the district court explained, however, it is well-settled that the University of Utah is considered an \u201carm of the state\u201d entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>Watson v. Univ. of Utah Med. Ctr., 75 </em>F.3d 569, 574-75 (10th Cir. 1996), as are its officials acting in their official capacity. <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. at 169, 105 S.Ct. 3099.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">[3] Alternatively, Lu contends the individual defendants are not entitled to immunity under the UGIA because their actions were not undertaken in the exercise of a governmental function. We disagree. Lu\u2019s allegations relate to actions taken by the individual defendants in the exercise of a governmental function. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-102(4)(a)-(b)'(broadly defining \u201c[g]overnmental function\u201d as \u201ceach activity, undertaking, or operation of a governmental entity\u201d or of \u201ca department, agency, employee, agent, or officer of a governmental entity\u201d). Lu additionally argues the defendants aren\u2019t entitled to UGIA immunity because they didn\u2019t act in good faith. But the cases Lu relies upon are inapposite as they involve the doctrine of qualified immunity\u2014not the UGIA immunity at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"AGC3\">Next, Lu challenges the dismissal of his breach of contract claims. He argues Utah\u2019s parol evidence rule<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> doesn\u2019t apply because the contract was an incomplete integrated contract. Contrary to Lu\u2019s suggestion, the contract contained a complete, final expression as to the length of Lu\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>scholarship and teaching assistant appointment. <em>See Tangren Family Tr. v. Tangren, </em>182 P.3d 326, 330 (Utah 2008) (defining an integrated agreement as \u201ca writing ... constituting a final expression of one or more terms of an agreement\u201d and holding that an agreement reduced to writing is \u201cconclusively presumed\u201d to contain \u201cthe whole of .the agreement between the parties\u201d). Thus, the district court correctly ruled Utah\u2019s parol evidence rule would bar admission of any pre-contract verbal agreement to extend the appointment past May 15,2011.</p>\n<p id=\"AuoK\">Citing language in the contract limiting doctoral students to three-year teaching assistant appointments, Lu argues the district court erred in applying the statute of frauds<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to bar his breach of contract claim. But the language Lu relies on does not bind the parties to renewing the appointment for three years; instead, it simply states the outside limit on such reappointments. Thus, the district court correctly ruled that evidence of a verbal agreement to renew his appointment for two years after the May 2011 termination date would be barred by Utah\u2019s statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"AYmA\">Further, because the- contract unambiguously terminated the appointment on May 15, 2011, and made no representation or promise regarding renewal, we reject Lu\u2019s arguments that he is entitled to relief under the principles of good faith and fair dealing or promissory estoppel. <em>See Young Living, </em>266 P.3d at 817 (holding covenant of good faith and fair dealing can\u2019t be invoked if it creates \u201cobligations inconsistent with express contractual terms\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Youngblood v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>158 P.3d 1088, 1095 (Utah 2007) (\u201cWhen a party knows or should have known reliance [on a statement] would be in error, the party cannot reasonably rely on the misrepresentation as a matter of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">Next, Lu challenges the defendants\u2019 assertion that his claims are barred by his failure to file a notice of claim as required by the UGIA. The parties dispute whether Lu filed the claim notice, but the district court didn\u2019t resolve the dispute and instead simply assumed for purposes of the motion to dismiss that Lu properly filed his claim notice. Because we agree with the district court that the defendants were entitled to UGIA immunity, we also decline to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AljQ\">Lu additionally contends that the district court should have ruled that UGIA immunity is waived for 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims. But as the district court correctly noted, Lu\u2019s complaint doesn\u2019t assert or plausibly allege a \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"A-s\">Lu also complains that the district court dismissed his complaint because it wasn\u2019t well-written. However, the district court didn\u2019t cite this as a reason for dismissing Lu\u2019s complaint. Moreover, we are satisfied from our review of the record that the district court liberally construed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"A8dd\">Lu next challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that he can\u2019t proceed under the ACTA. But the district court correctly ruled that Lu\u2019s slander and so-called \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d tort claims don\u2019t qualify as torts committed in violation of international law or any treaty of the United States, including the Taiwan Relations Act, as required to invoke juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>diction under the ACTA. <em>See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 725, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"AZM\">Finally, Lu asserts the district court should have considered whether the Utah State attorneys representing the defendants had an ethical conflict of interest. Lu presents no factual or legal basis for this argument, and we find it without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"Ana\">Having found no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lu\u2019s complaint, we affirm the dismissal for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its order dated October 7, 2015. Lu\u2019s motion for appointment of pro bono counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-5\">.
