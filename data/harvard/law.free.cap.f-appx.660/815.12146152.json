Hunt, Pro Se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b834-16\">Before JORDAN, JULIE CARNES, and EDMONDSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b834-17\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">Kevin Hunt, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his March 2015 Rule 60(b) motion, which the district court construed as a motion for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the denial of his October 2015 motion for a reduced sentence, and the denial of his December 2015 motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">On appeal, Hunt argues that the district court improperly construed his first motion, nominally a Rule 60(b) motion, as a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The government, however, argues that Hunt\u2019s appeal is untimely for the district court\u2019s November 2015 order, which dismissed Hunt\u2019s first and sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>ond motions. Hunt asserts that his appeal is not untimely because he received no notice of the district court\u2019s final order until 21 January 2016 and that his appeal was timely filed for that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We typically review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir. 2003). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir. 2009). Furthermore, we review jurisdictional issues, like whether an appeal is timely, <em>de novo. United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Proceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are criminal in nature. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir. 2003). So, a criminal defendant appealing the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion must file the notice of appeal in the district court no later than 14 days after the challenged order is entered on the docket. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). The deadline in Rule 4(b) for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal case is not jurisdictional, and the government can waive an objection to an untimely notice of appeal. <em>Lopez, </em>562 F.3d at 1312-13. Nevertheless, if the government properly advances the issue of timeliness, then \u201cwe must apply the time limits of Rule 4(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">A notice of appeal filed by a <em>pro se </em>prisoner is deemed filed on the date when the prisoner delivers it to prison authorities or places it in the prison mail system. Fed. R. App. P. 4(c)(1). Absent contrary evidence, we will assume that a prisoner delivered a filing to prison authorities on the day the prisoner signed it. <em>Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir. 2001) (applying the prisoner mailbox rule in the context of a motion to vacate). Except as provided in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), the clerk\u2019s failure to give notice of an order does not affect the time to appeal or relieve a party\u2019s failure to appeal within the allowed time. Fed. R. Crim. P. 49(c). And a Rule 4(b) extension was unavailable here: notice of appeal filed outside of permissible extension period. We may not extend the time to file an appeal, except as authorized in Rule 4. Fed. R,App. P. 26(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The district court did not err in construing Hunt\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion\u2014 which raised sentencing issues\u2014as a motion for a reduced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Rule 60(b) could offer no relief in a case, like this one: the motion raised a merits-based issue, attacking Hunt\u2019s criminal sentence. <em>See Fair, </em>326 F.3d at 1318. Therefore, both Hunt\u2019s first and second motions were criminal in nature, giving him 14 days to file his appeal timely. <em>See id.; </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). Timeliness in a criminal case is not jurisdictional: but when the government raises the issues of timeliness, we must enforce it. <em>See Lopez, </em>562 F.3d at 1312-13. Here, Hunt delivered his notice of appeal to prison authorities on 28 January 2016\u2014well past the 14-day requirement. Therefore, we dismiss his appeal, on the district court\u2019s November 2015 order, as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">Hunt also argues that the district court erred in denying his third motion\u2014basically a duplication of his earlier efforts\u2014for a reduced sentence, filed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), pursuant to Amendment 599 of the sentencing guidelines. He asserts that he is impermissibly subject to a five-year increase in his sentence because he received a five-year enhancement to his 'maximum term of imprisonment for bank robbery for using a firearm and he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>ceived a five-year consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), for the same firearm conduct. Hunt argues that this is the same kind of double-counting prohibited under Amendment 599. Hunt also notes that his career offender guideline level was determined, in part, by the statutory maximum for armed bank robbery and contends that he was impermissibly sentenced above the maximum .sentence permitted for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1303. Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 3582(e)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir. 2012) (quotation omitted). Still, because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir. 2000) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">\u201cThe grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are quite narrow.\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir. 2012). For a defendant to be eligible for such a reduction, the Sentencing Commission must have amended the Sentencing Guidelines, that amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and the amendment must also be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) &amp; comment. (n.l(A)). But a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized if an amendment does not lower the applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision. U.S.S.G. 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Amendment 599 may serve, when applicable, as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB.10(d). Amendment 599 took effect on November 1, 2000. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 599. Amendment 599 provides, in pertinent part, that where a defendant is convicted of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) offense for using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime, the defendant cannot also receive a base offense level guideline enhancement in the underlying offense for his use of a firearm during the commission of that offense. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1344-45 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201cAmendment 599 was enacted in order to clarify under what circumstances a weapons enhancement may properly be applied to an underlying offense,\u201d when a defendant was also convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and it was adopted to prevent duplicative punishment for the use of firearms in one criminal event. <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1179-80 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The district court was correct in concluding that Amendment 599 was inapplicable to Hunt because the Amendment did not lower Hunt\u2019s guideline range. Amendment 599 applies to sentencing guidelines enhancements and does not impact on a statutorily enhanced maximum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 599. Hunt was sentenced as a career offender and did not receive a weapons guidelines enhancement that would be impacted by Amendment 599. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Amendment 599 did not give the district court discretion to determine whether a maximum sentence was incorrectly decided, because maximum sentences are not amended guideline ranges and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not <em>de novo </em>resentencing hearings. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. The district court lacked the discretion to reconsider Hunt\u2019s maximum sentence or whether Hunt\u2019s consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) constituted impermissible double-counting. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we affirm the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
