Marshall asserts two issues on appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we address in turn. After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">\n<em>A. ALJ\u2019s discrediting of medical opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">Marshall argues the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred by discrediting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>opinions of her treating psychiatrist, Dr. Kevin Winders, and psychopharmacologist, Dr. Patrice Butterfield, and by instead crediting the evaluation of an examining psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas Pedigo.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Medical opinions are always considered when determining whether an applicant qualifies for disability benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(b). Factors that increase the weight of a medical opinion include, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the source of the opinion examined or treated the applicant, the length and nature of the relationship between the source and the applicant, whether the evidence supports the source\u2019s opinion, and the degree of consistency between the opinion and the record as a whole. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">An ALJ must give a treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201csubstantial or considerable weight\u201d unless there is good cause not to do so. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2011); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) (providing a treating source\u2019s opinion is given controlling weight if it is supported by medically acceptable techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence). Good cause exists when a treating physician\u2019s opinion is not supported by the evidence, the evidence supports a different conclusion, or the treating physician\u2019s opinion is conclusory or inconsistent with his own medical records. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179; <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir. 2004) (finding \u201cgood cause\u201d where treating physician\u2019s assessment conflicted with his treatment notes and the applicant\u2019s admitted daily activities). The ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for disregarding a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. The ALJ must also state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The ALJ had \u201cgood cause\u201d for rejecting Dr. Winders\u2019 opinions because his medical opinions that Marshall could not sustain gainful activity were inconsistent with his own treatment records. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. Dr. Winders\u2019 statements in his impairment questionnaire that said Marshall was incapable of gainful employment and did not have good days were inconsistent with his treatment notes that indicated that Marshall was \u201cdoing fairly well,\u201d \u201cdoing okay,\u201d and \u201cdoing good.\u201d The ALJ specifically noted these inconsistencies, as well as Dr. Winders\u2019 repeatedly assessing Marshall with global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores indicating only mild limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Additionally, there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for the ALJ to reject Dr. Butterfield\u2019s opinion because the GAF scores of 40 and findings that Marshall was markedly limited were not consistent with the rest of the medical evidence, including Marshall\u2019s reported daily activities. <em>See id. </em>While Dr. Butterfield twice determined that Marshall had a GAF score of 40, Dr. Pedigo assessed Marshall a GAF score of 65, and Dr. Winders gave Marshall GAF scores between 55 and 75.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the disparity in Dr. Butter-field\u2019s GAF scores and Drs. Pedigo\u2019s and Winders\u2019 consistent GAF scores showed an inconsistency between Dr. Butterfield\u2019s opinion and the rest of the record evidence. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. The ALJ noted that Butterfield\u2019s GAF score was inconsistent with the rest of the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ord evidence, as well as Marshall\u2019s self-reported activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">Further, it was not improper for the ALJ to discount Dr. Butterfield\u2019s opinion because he believed that Dr. Butterfield was trying to help Marshall obtain benefits, even though he did not give independent reasons for this perceived bias beyond his other \u201cgood cause\u201d for rejecting Dr. Butterfield\u2019s opinion. He did, however, note that Dr. Pedigo, unlike Dr. Butter-field, rendered his opinion before Marshall applied for benefits and thus could not have been biased by her application. Marshall\u2019s argument the ALJ mischaracter-ized her daily activities also fails because the ALJ only noted her daily activities as one of the inconsistencies between the level of ability that Dr. Butterfield\u2019s GAF score indicated and the rest of the medical evidence, rather than relying on them solely to determine her level of impairment. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in discounting the opinions of Drs. Winders and Butterfield as they both were internally inconsistent and inconsistent with the rest of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Marshall\u2019s argument the ALJ gave improper weight to Dr. Pedigo\u2019s opinion fails because the ALJ must consider medical opinions when determining whether a claimant qualifies for disability benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(b). First, Marshall\u2019s argument that Dr. Pedigo did not render an \u201copinion\u201d because he did not address her functional capacity fails because the ALJ did not extrapolate Dr. Pedigo\u2019s opinion as to Marshall\u2019s functional capacity. He instead relied solely on Dr. Pedigo\u2019s account of Marshall\u2019s performance during her evaluation, her self-reported daily activities, GAF score of 65, and ADHD diagnosis. Second, the ALJ properly accorded Dr. Pedigo\u2019s opinion increased weight over other medical evidence because he was an examining source and the ALJ discredited the only treating sources\u2019 opinions. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c). Finally, the ALJ correctly noted that Dr. Pedigo\u2019s opinion was the only one rendered before Marshall applied for benefits. Therefore, the ALJ did not err in giving weight to Dr. Pedigo\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Accordingly, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decisions to discount Drs. Winders\u2019 and Butterfield\u2019s opinions and to credit Dr. Pedigo\u2019s opinion. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">\n<em>B. Severity of impairment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Marshall further contends the ALJ erred by discrediting her testimony at the hearing. When a claimant attempts to establish disability through his or her own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms, we apply a \u201cpain standard\u201d test, which requires: (1) evidence that the claimant has an underlying medical condition; and either (2) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition; or (3) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir. 2002). The \u201cpain standard\u201d test is also applicable to other subjective symptoms. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir. 2005). The ALJ must give specific reasons for disbelieving the claimant\u2019s subjective-symptom testimony. <em>Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir. 1991). We will not disturb a credibility finding that is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Marshall\u2019s testimony to the extent it was inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s determination of Marshall\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ALJ explained his reasons for discounting Drs. Winders\u2019 and Butterfield\u2019s opinions, which supported Marshall\u2019s testimony but were inconsistent with their own treatment notes and the other record medical evidence. Further, the ALJ stated that Marshall\u2019s performance in Dr. Pedigo\u2019s evaluation, Dr. Pedigo\u2019s assessed GAF score of 65 and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder diagnosis, and the daily activities Marshall reported to Dr. Pedigo were not consistent with her claimed severity of disability, The ALJ noted Marshall had chosen to stop taking her medicine in favor of her art and had not followed the recommendations of her Vocational Rehabilitation counselor, even though they may have helped. The ALJ reasoned she had taken regular-education classes, with the exception of math, and had graduated high school with a diploma, indicating she had been able to maintain attention and concentrate. Finally, the ALJ explained Marshall had been able to volunteer registering voters, indicating she had been able to maintain some level of social functioning, concentration, persistence, and pace. Accordingly, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Marshall\u2019s subjective-symptom testimony. <em>See Holt, </em>921 F.2d at 1223; <em>Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1562.</p>\n<p id=\"AUW\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AdPc\">The district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of SSI and CIB is</p>\n<p id=\"AN3Y\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">. Marshall waived her argument the ALJ erred by failing to make explicit credibility findings as to her mother\u2019s testimony, as she did not preserve that argument by raising it in the district court. <em>See Stewart v. Dept. of Health and Human Serv's, </em>26 F.3d 115, 115 (11th Cir. 1994) (explaining we will not consider an issue the Social Security claimant failed to raise and preserve in the district court). Marshall only argued the ALJ erred in discrediting her own testimony, which was consistent with her mother\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we decline to consider this argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-18\">. We review the ALJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence and its application of legal principles <em>de novo. Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005). When the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner's final decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">. It was not improper for the ALJ to consider the GAF scores in determining that Dr. But-terfield\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with the rest of the evidence because the ALJ was not using the GAF scores to determine whether Marshall met one of the Listings.
