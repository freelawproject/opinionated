Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b629-26\">Steven Carmichael Warren, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct ' his sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1)(B) (requiring a COA to appeal an order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">A grand jury returned an indictment charging Mr. Warren with (1) carrying a firearm during and in relation to and in furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); (2) armed robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2118(a), (d); and (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), and 924(e). ROA, Vol. I at 8-9; <em>see also United States v. Warren, </em>737 F.3d 1278, 1281 (10th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Mr. Warren pled guilty to the armed-robbery count, and the Government dismissed the others. The plea agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">3. Application of the Sentencing Guidelines. The parties are not requesting imposition of an advisory guideline sentence. There is no agreement between the parties as to the sentence to be imposed. The defendant is free to ask the Court to impose whatever sentence he wants. Likewise, the government is free to ask the Court to impose whatever sentence it deems appropriate. The parties understand this agreement binds the parties only and does not bind the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">ROA, Vol. I at 21. The agreement also stated the Government would recommend a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. The Government did so at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The presentence report listed Mr. Warren\u2019s previous convictions, \u201cincluding an earlier federal felony conviction for armed bank robbery, a felony conviction for the sale of a PCP-laced cigarette, a felony conviction for child abuse, and over a dozen misdemeanor convictions\u2014the majority of which involved violent conduct.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>737 F.3d at 1281. Based on Mr. Warren\u2019s prior convictions, the district court determined he qualified as a career criminal. The total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI resulted in a United States Sentencing Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. The Government sought an upward variance to 300 months in prison. Mr. Warren\u2019s counsel argued that the district court\u2019s career-criminal ruling \u201calready [took] into account all of [Mr. Warren\u2019s] criminal conduct\u201d and that the court should not use the convictions as a basis for the upward variance. ROA, Vol. I at 118, 126-27. The district court- granted the Government\u2019s upward variance based on a number of factors, including Mr. Warren\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Mr. Warren challenged his sentence on direct appeal; this court affirmed. <em>Warren, </em>737 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">He then brought a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing his plea counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to (1) object to the purported untimeliness of the Government\u2019s request for an upward variance, (2) request an evidentiary hearing at sentencing, (3) object to the district court\u2019s consideration of prior convictions as a basis for the upward variance (i.e., double counting his criminal conduct), (4) object to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation for the variance, and (5) assert the Government breached the piea agreement. He also argued his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these arguments on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">The district court rejected each argument in a thorough and well-reasoned order. Mr. Warren now seeks a COA on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>third and fifth issues, arguing his plea counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AvT\">A. <em>Legal Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Mr. Warren may not appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion without a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). To obtain a COA, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), and show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Mr. Warren seeks a COA on two issues involving ineffective assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes a right to effective representation. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We first consider whether \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Mr. Warren must show that his attorney\u2019s \u201crepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We then consider prejudice by asking \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (applying the <em>Strickland </em>standard in the plea context). \u201c[T]o satisfy the \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Mr. Warren first argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the district court relied on his prior convictions as a basis for both the career-criminal classification and the upward variance. The district court rejected this argument because Mr. Warren\u2019s counsel raised the issue at the sentencing hearing and urged the court not to consider the prior convictions in ruling on the variance. The district court concluded that \u201ccounsel\u2019s argument on double counting was well within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 187. For substantially the same reasons given in the district court\u2019s order, we conclude that no reasonable jurist could debate the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Next, Mr. Warren contends his counsel was ineffective for failing to argue the Government breached the plea agreement insofar as it required the Government to move for a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. In denying the \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court concluded there was no breaeh because the Government fulfilled its obligation under the plea agreement to recommend the reduction. The court further noted the plea agreement \u201cexplicitly permitted both parties to ask for a non-guideline sentence including any sentence that they deemed appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. For substantially the same reasons stated by the district court, we conclude the district court\u2019s rejection of Mr. Warren\u2019s argument is beyond debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">We deny Mr. Warren\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b629-16\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App, P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
