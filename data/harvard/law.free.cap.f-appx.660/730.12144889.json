The district court issued a certificate of appealability on Cooper\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective during the plea bargaining process. On appeal, Cooper argues that the district court erred in determining that his counsel was not constitutionally ineffective and requests that his case be reassigned to a different judge on remand. Cooper argues that his counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance when he advised Cooper to reject a plea based on: (1) his belief that the specific judge assigned to the case would ignore the mandatory minimum specified in the plea agreement and sentence Cooper to more than forty years; and (2) his belief that Cooper had a viable public authority defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that, at the time counsel advised Cooper to reject the plea offer, he had no specific \u25a0information about Cooper\u2019s criminal history, had not seen or reviewed any of the discovery in the case, and had no understanding of the evidence against Cooper. Furthermore, it is undisputed that Cooper did not have a viable public authority defense. We therefore conclude that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that Cooper was prejudiced by that deficient performance. We vacate and remand, but do not grant Cooper\u2019s request for reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">Cooper first argues that his counsel, Michael Walsh, rendered deficient perform-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>anee not only because his advice to Cooper was objectively unreasonable, but also because he had not sufficiently familiarized himself with the facts and law of the case when he gave that advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">To state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a prisoner must satisfy the two-pronged test outlined in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under Strickland, a prisoner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. Id. Performance is deficient when it falls below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and is \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d Johnson v. Sec\u2019y, DOC, 643 F.3d 907, 928 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotations omitted). Review of counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential, and we presume that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\u201cIn any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. \u201c[Strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d Id. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">An attorney\u2019s decision to limit his investigation \u201cmust flow from an informed judgment.\u201d Baxter v. Thomas, 45 F.3d 1501, 1514 (11th Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted). It is not per se deficient performance for an attorney to rely on his client\u2019s statements concerning his criminal history instead of independently running a criminal records check. See United States v. Pease, 240 F.3d 938, 941-42 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam). Rather, whether reliance on a client\u2019s statement of his own criminal history constitutes deficient performance is fact-specific. Id. at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">\u201cWhen a lawyer fails to conduct a substantial investigation into any of his client\u2019s plausible lines of defense, the lawyer has failed to render effective assistance of counsel.\u201d McCoy v. Newsome, 953 F.2d 1252, 1262-63 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (quotation omitted) (alteration adopted). And \u201c[t]he failure of an attorney to inform his client of the relevant law clearly satisfies the first prong of the Strickland analysis^] as such an omission cannot be said to fall within the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d Finch v. Vaughn, 67 F.3d 909, 916 (11th Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted) (alteration adopted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">When ineffective advice leads a defendant to reject a plea offer, the defendant must show that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that: (1) the plea offer would have been presented to the court; (2) the court would have accepted its terms; and (3) the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer\u2019s terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that were imposed. Lafler v. Cooper, \u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1385, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012). To show the first element, the defendant must demonstrate that he would have accepted the plea, and that the government would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening circumstances. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">The parties stipulated to the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>facts of the underlying criminal t\u00f3al.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties agreed that Cooper initially retained Stephen Rogers to represent him. The government proposed a plea offer in which it agreed to dismiss the remaining counts in the indictment if Cooper pleaded guilty to Count 1. In addition, the government agreed to file a statutory sentencing enhancement pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 for only one of Cooper\u2019s prior convictions, rather than for multiple convictions. This compromise would have resulted in Cooper facing a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years, rather than a mandatory life sentence. The plea agreement also contained a stipulation that \u201cthe parties would jointly recommend that, for purposes of sentencing, the quantity of narcotics attributable to [Cooper] was at least 150 grams but less than 500 grams of crack cocaine.\u201d The parties also agreed that Cooper would receive a 3-level sentencing enhancement for his managerial role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The stipulated facts further indicated that Rogers met with Cooper and reviewed the terms of the proposed plea agreement with him. At that meeting, Cooper indicated that he was \u201clikely going to accept\u201d the plea offer but wanted time to consult with his family. Because the deadline was fast approaching, Cooper executed the plea agreement and gave it to Rogers with the understanding that Rogers would submit it if Cooper did not change his mind about accepting the plea offer after speaking with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Following Cooper\u2019s meeting with Rogers, a fellow inmate suggested that Cooper speak to attorney Michael Walsh about his case. Cooper met with Walsh and informed him about the proposed plea agreement. Walsh \u201cstrongly advised\u201d Cooper to reject the offer, because Walsh was \u201cconfident\u201d that, despite the agreement, \u201cJudge Moore would sentence him to \u2018forty plus years.\u2019 \u201d At the evidentiary hearing, Walsh testified that based on his experience with this District Judge, the applicable Guidelines, the amount of drugs involved, and \u201cthe evidence you were saying you had,\u201d he thought Cooper was \u201cgoing to get railed,\u201d Walsh testified that he \u201cthought Judge Moore would have launched [Cooper] and that he would go to prison for three decades or more based upon his priors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">According to the parties\u2019 stipulated facts, at the time Walsh made those statements to Cooper, \u201che had not seen or reviewed any of the discovery in the case and was unfamiliar with the evidence against [Cooper].\u201d Rogers testified that he attempted to transfer thousands of pages of evidence and numerous recordings to Walsh, but Walsh would not accept any discovery until his financial arrangements with Cooper were finalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">The parties also stipulated that, during the initial meeting between Walsh and Cooper, Walsh learned that Cooper had been working as a confidential informant for the police department, and, \u201c[without reviewing any of the discovery in the ease and without an understanding of the underlying evidence against [Cooper] ..., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Walsh advised [Cooper] that he had a viable \u2018public authority\u2019 defense.\u201d Walsh also testified that he believed that the police officers who were supervising Cooper\u2019s work as a confidential informant were \u201cdirty.\u201d He conceded that \u201cdirty\u201d cops do not have the authority to tell people to commit crimes, so Cooper therefore was not working under real public authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Based on Walsh\u2019s advice, Cooper fired Rogers and hired Walsh, effectively rejecting the plea offer. Soon after that, Walsh filed a notice of appearance and a notice of a public authority defense. Only after Cooper rejected the plea agreement and worked out his financial arrangements with Walsh did Walsh receive a copy of the discovery. When the deadline for accepting the government\u2019s plea offer expired, the government filed a statutory sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 851 based on two of Cooper\u2019s prior convictions, thus increasing his statutorily mandated minimum sentence to life imprisonment. Cooper proceeded to trial relying on the public authority defense, was convicted of all counts, and was sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Walsh testified that Cooper \u201cat all times wanted to plead guilty.\u201d Cooper corroborated this assertion, testifying that \u201che always desired and intended to plead guilty,\u201d and that \u201che never wanted to proceed to trial.\u201d However, he did so based upon Walsh\u2019s advice that the District Judge would sentence him harshly even with a plea agreement and that he had a viable public authority defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">After an evidentiary hearing, the government informed the magistrate judge that it could not legitimately argue that Walsh\u2019s performance was not deficient, or that Cooper was not prejudiced by the deficient performance. The magistrate judge concluded that Cooper had established both deficient performance and prejudice, and entered a report and recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) proposing that the district court grant Cooper\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and that the government reoffer the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The district court held its own hearing on Cooper\u2019s claim. During a colloquy with Cooper\u2019s appointed counsel, the district court suggested that Walsh was being \u201c[v]ery conveniently truthful after the fact\u201d about his deficient advice to Cooper. The district court suggested that Walsh was \u201cfall[ing] on the sword for his client\u201d so that \u201cthe client gets the benefit of the attorney\u2019s professed ineffectiveness.\u201d The district court ultimately adopted the findings of fact contained in the R&amp;R. But, after concluding that it was not clear that Cooper would have accepted the plea offer presented by the government, the district court held that counsel\u2019s performance was not so deficient as to constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">The district court erred in finding that Cooper\u2019s trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective during the plea bargaining process. As a threshold issue, we reject the government\u2019s argument that Walsh\u2019s performance should be judged starting on the day that he filed his notice of appearance because he could not be ineffective before he had officially been retained. Walsh gave legal advice to Cooper about his case prior to entering a notice of appearance. The stipulated facts demonstrate that Cooper relied on Walsh\u2019s advice in rejecting the plea offer. The fact that Walsh delayed filing a notice of appearance until he and Cooper worked out their financial arrangements is not fatal to Cooper\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Walsh performed deficiently in at least three separate ways. First, Walsh\u2019s decision not to investigate Cooper\u2019s criminal history did not flow from an informed judgment. See Baxter, 45 F.3d at 1514. Rather, Walsh\u2019s decision not to investigate stemmed from his refusal to review any discovery before he had been paid for his services. Furthermore, his advice was outside the range of professional competence. See Johnson, 643 F.3d at 928. Strategic choices, such as whether to reject a plea offer, must be based on a thorough investigation of the law and facts relevant tp the plausible options before the defendant. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. A general knowledge of the Sentencing Guidelines and the fact that Walsh was \u201cexperienced\u201d is not an adequate substitute for actual investigation of the law and the defendant\u2019s criminal history.' While general experience may inform the advice counsel gives a defendant, it is not the basis for knowing a defendant\u2019s actual legal exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Second, Walsh\u2019s advice concerning a public authority defense was unreasonable. Reliance on the apparent authority of a police officer to empower covert activity is a mistake of law and -does not excuse criminal conduct. See Baptista-Rodriguez, 17 F.3d at 1368 n.18. Walsh conceded that he believed the police officers Cooper was working with were \u201cdirty.\u201d If he believed that, he should have known that Cooper did not have a \u201cviable\u201d public authority defense. The government correctly points out that \u201cin cases involving \u2018perceived governmental authority,\u2019 the defendant piay argue his innocent intent as a means to persuade the jury that the prosecution has not met its burden of proving his criminal intent.\u201d United States v. Alvarado, 808 F.3d 474, 486 (11th Cir. 2015). In other words, Cooper could have argued his innocent intent to \u201ceffectively backdoor the [public authority] defense by testifying that he genuinely believed that the criminal acts he performed were done at the direction ... of an appropriate governmental agency.\u201d Id. However, the trial transcript makes clear that Walsh was not arguing that Cooper acted with innocent intent; he was pursuing the meritless argument that Cooper acted under actual public authority. Thus, the advice Walsh gave Cooper about the public authority defense, upon which Cooper relied in deciding to go to trial, was plainly wrong. Walsh\u2019s failure to inform Cooper that the relevant law precluded his public authority defense fell outside the range of professionally competent assistance. See Finch, 67 F.3d at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Finally, Walsh rendered deficient performance by failing to conduct any research on the public authority defense before offering Cooper legal advice on the subject. Walsh did not testify that he was familiar with the public authority defense based on his prior experience or that he researched it after being contacted by Cooper. Yet, he advised Cooper that it applied to his case. \u201cWhen a lawyer fails to conduct a substantial investigation into any of his client\u2019s plausible lines of defense, the lawyer has failed to render effective assistance of counsel.\u201d McCoy, 953 F.2d at 1262-63 (quotation omitted) (alteration adopted). For these reasons, the district court erred in holding that Cooper failed to establish deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Cooper also established that he was prejudiced by Walsh\u2019s deficient performance. First, the plea offer would have been presented to the court\u2014the parties stipulated that, but for Walsh\u2019s ineffective assistance, Cooper would have accepted the plea agreement. In addition, there is no indication that the government would have withdrawn the plea. In fact, since the government agreed before the district court that Cooper was prejudiced and that the proper remedy was to reoffer the plea agreement, there is every indication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>the government would not have withdrawn the plea. Second, there is no indication that the court would not have accepted its terms. Finally, under the terms of the plea agreement, Count 2 would have been dismissed and Cooper would have been subject to a mandatory minimum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, with a Guideline range of 240-293 months rather than a mandatory life sentence. Because Cooper has shown both that Walsh rendered deficient performance and that he was prejudiced by that performance, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Cooper next argues that the District Judge, who presided over both Cooper\u2019s underlying criminal case and his \u00a7 2255 case, engaged in conduct that gives rise to the appearance of impropriety or a lack of impartiality in the minds of reasonable members of the public. For this reason, he requests reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We have the authority to order reassignment of a case to another district judge as part of our supervisory authority over the district courts in this Circuit. United States v. Torkington, 874 F.2d 1441, 1446 (11th Cir. 1989) (per curiam). Reassignment is appropriate where the trial judge has engaged in conduct that gives rise to the appearance of impropriety or a lack of impartiality in the mind of a reasonable member of the public. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We consider at least three elements in determining whether to reassign a case to a different judge based on the original judge\u2019s actions at trial where there is no indication of actual bias: (1) whether the original judge would have difficulty putting his previous views and findings aside; (2) whether reassignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of justice; and (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to gains realized from reassignment. Id. at 1447. We normally expect the district judge to put his previous views and findings aside, although that expectation might be unreasonable in a second or third appeal. United States v. Shaygan, 652 F.3d 1297, 1318-19 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"A_N\">Reassignment is not necessary in this case. It is true that the circumstances of this case are unusual; Judge Moore entered an order that was contrary to the parties\u2019 agreement and to their stipulated facts. Beyond that, his statements on the record suggesting that he believed that Walsh was lying about his ineffectiveness in order to allow Cooper to secure habeas relief are troubling. However, considering the government\u2019s statement that Walsh\u2019s testimony had changed radically from pre-hearing interviews to the actual hearing, Judge Moore\u2019s actions and statements are not without some basis in the record. Furthermore, this is the first appeal on Cooper\u2019s motion to vacate, and we normally expect the district court to put his previous views and findings aside on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-10\">. Under the public authority defense, \"the defendant seeks exoneration based on the fact that he reasonably relied on the authority of a government official to engage him in a covert activity.\u201d United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, 17 F.3d 1354, 1368 n.18 (11th Cir. 1994). The validity of this defense hinges on \"whether the government agent in fact had the authority to empower the defendant to perform the acts in question.\u201d Id. \"[RJeliance on the apparent authority of a government official is not a defense in this circuit, because it is deemed a mistake of law, which generally does not excuse criminal conduct.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-5\">. The government points out several conflicts between the testimony at the evidentiary hearing on Cooper\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and the parties\u2019 stipulated facts. However, the government cannot now argue that the stipulated facts are incorrect, because it has already admitted those facts to be true, See Christian Legal Soc'y Chapter of the Univ. of Cal., Hastings Coll. of the Law v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, 677-78, 130 S.Ct. 2971, 2983, 177 L.Ed.2d 838 (2010) (\"[Fjactual stipulations are formal concessions ... that have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need for proof of the fact.\u201d (quotation omitted) (alteration in original)). The district court was bound by the factual stipulations, as is this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
