Phillips, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">Our jurisdiction to hear bankruptcy appeals is limited to appeals from final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees entered by the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1) (2012), A district court\u2019s order is not final if it remands to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings. <em>Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp. v. Banks (In re Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp.), </em>956 F.2d 935, 937 (10th Cir. 1992). We must determine whether the district court\u2019s order reversing the bankruptcy court\u2019s order is final. Because the district court remanded for significant further proceedings, we lack jurisdiction under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1) and dismiss this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">This case presents an appeal involving the bankruptcy estate of C.W. Mining Company, a former coal-mining operator in Utah. Rhino Energy LLC and Castle Valley Mining LLC (collectively referred to as Rhino) purchased certain assets from the bankruptcy estate, including leases with C.O.P. Coal Development Company and ANR Company, Inc. (collectively referred to as COP). After COP claimed that Rhino defaulted under those leases, Rhino filed an adversary proceeding in C.W. Mining Company\u2019s bankruptcy, seeking a declaratory judgment defining its obligations to COP.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response, COP filed seven counterclaims against Rhino.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Though Rhino sought summary judgment on its claims, the bankruptcy court did not resolve any claims on summary judgment. Instead, it dismissed four of Rhino\u2019s claims and all of OOP\u2019s counterclaims for lack of jurisdiction. Specifically, the bankruptcy court dismissed claims three through six in Rhino\u2019s amended adversary complaint. The bankruptcy court did not dismiss Rhino\u2019s first and second claims, which sought a declaratory judgment regarding the amount of royalties owed to COP.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In reversing the bankruptcy court, the district court held that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Rhino\u2019s claims and OOP\u2019s counterclaims. Thus, the district court remanded this case to the bankruptcy court to consider Rhino\u2019s summary-judgment motion on the merits. Rather than accept the district court\u2019s remand to litigate in the bankruptcy court, COP filed this appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s ruling that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to resolve the issues before it. In response to OOP\u2019s notice of appeal, Rhino filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the district court\u2019s order is not final.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Because the district court remanded for significant further proceedings, the district court\u2019s order is not a final appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1). Also, the collateral-order doctrine does not apply because the district court\u2019s order is ultimately reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">Our jurisdiction extends only to appeals from final orders of the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1). If the district court\u2019s order is not final, we must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Strong v. W. United Life Assurance Co. (In re Tri-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Valley Distrib., Inc.), </em>533 F.3d 1209, 1214 (10th Cir. 2008). To determine whether an order is final, we must consider whether the district court remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings. <em>State Bank of Spring Hill v. Anderson (In re Bucyrus Grain Co., Inc.), </em>905 F.2d 1362, 1365 (10th Cir. 1990). A district court remands for significant further proceedings when a bankruptcy court must decide claims in the first instance. <em>Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp., </em>956 F.2d at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Here, we do not have jurisdiction because the district court remanded for significant further proceedings. The bankruptcy court dismissed the claims and counterclaims in the adversary proceeding for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction without ruling on the merits of the claims. The district court reversed the bankruptcy court, concluding that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over Rhino\u2019s claims and OOP\u2019s counterclaims. \u201c[A] district court order reversing and remanding a bankruptcy court\u2019s order dismissing an adversary proceeding for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not a final order for purposes of \u00a7 158(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201c[significant further proceedings will be had in the bankruptcy court [because] the court must decide [the] claims in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Tri-Valley Distrib., Inc., </em>533 F.3d at 1214 (explaining that when a bankruptcy court dismisses for lack of jurisdiction, and the bankruptcy appellate panel reverses, the panel\u2019s order is not final because significant further proceedings will occur in the bankruptcy court).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The procedural posture of this ease is similar to that in <em>Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp., </em>956 F.2d at 937. There, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to the debtor on a judgment-lien issue, but concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the remaining claims. <em>Id. </em>The district court determined that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the claims and reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of the claims. <em>Id. </em>Like COP in this case, the defendant in <em>Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp., </em>appealed the district court\u2019s order to this court. We dismissed the appeal and stated that the district court\u2019s reversal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction was not a final appealable order under \u00a7 158(d). <em>Id. </em>at 937, 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">As in <em>Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp., </em>COP and ANR appeal from a district court order reversing and remanding a bankruptcy court\u2019s order dismissing an adversary proceeding for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Like in <em>Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp., </em>significant further proceedings will occur in the bankruptcy court because it must decide claims in the first instance. Therefore, just as we held in <em>Cascade Energy </em>&amp; <em>Metals Corp., </em>the district court\u2019s order is not final, meaning we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Appellants also argue that we should exercise our discretion to hear this appeal under the collateral-order doctrine. But the collateral-order doctrine does not apply because the district court\u2019s order is ultimately reviewable on appeal. To qualify as a collateral order, \u201cthe order must conclusively determine the disputed question ..., resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Tri-Valley Distrib., Inc., </em>533 F.3d at 1215 (quoting <em>In re Magic Circle Energy Corp., </em>889 F.2d 950, 954 (10th Cir. 1989)). We have explained that an \u201c[a]ppellant[\u2019]s remedy is to challenge the bankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction by bringing an appeal from the final judgment ultimately rendered by that court.\u201d <em>Cascade Energy &amp; Metals Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>956 F.2d at 987 (quoting <em>Magic Circle, </em>889 F.2d at 954). Therefore, because the order is effectively reviewable on appeal, the collateral-order doctrine is inapplicable,</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Rhino\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is GRANTED and this appeal is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">.
