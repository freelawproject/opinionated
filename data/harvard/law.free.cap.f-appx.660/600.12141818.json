Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">Celebrity Attractions, Inc., appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying its request for preliminary injunctive relief in a dispute over its presentation of a Broadway show season. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">Celebrity \u201cpresent[s] live theatrical entertainment in seven cities in a four-state region.\u201d Aplt. App., Yol. IV at 834. It has produced Broadway show seasons for over twenty years in the Thelma Gaylord The-atre inside Oklahoma City\u2019s Civic Center Music Hall. The Oklahoma City Public Property Authority operates the Music Hall under a long-term lease from the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>of Oklahoma City. Fundraising for renovating and operating the Music Hall is handled by the Civic Center Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Performances at the Music Hall are scheduled several years in advance. In January of the year set for a particular performance, the Authority typically issues a permit to use the Music Hall, and then enters into a box office agreement with the permittee addressing ticketing services.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In January 2015, the Authority issued a use permit to Celebrity for the 2015-16 season. Both the permit and the accompanying box office agreement gave the Civic Center box office, \u201cwhich is part of the [Authority,] ... the sole and exclusive right to sell, handle, distribute, or otherwise disburse all admission tickets.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. I at 37; <em>see also id., </em>Vol. Ill at 666. But the box office agreement designated Celebrity as \u201cthe Primary Box Office for season ticket renewals,\u201d and it gave Celebrity \u201cfull authority to sell season, group and individual tickets for the listed event.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. Ill at 668. Further, the box office agreement provided that (1) \u201c[a]ll account information collected for storage and use on [the Civic Center box office] ticketing system, is considered the intellectual property of [the Civic Center box office] and the ... Authority\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe [Authority\u2019s general manager or his designee] retains the right to access information for use in the promotion of upcoming events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In June 2015, in order to fundraise, operate, and renovate the Music Hall, the Foundation agreed with the City and the Authority to (1) co-present \u201cone annual national touring \u2018Broadway Show5 season\u201d beginning with the 2016-17 season; and (2) exercise a right of first refusal to present or co-present \u201csingle night, full week and split week Broadway show performances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690. The Music Hall\u2019s manager notified Celebrity of the agreement, explaining that \u201cno additional season permits [would] be issued to Celebrity,\u201d that \u201call tentative Broadway dates [would] be transferred to the ... Foundation,\u201d and that the Foundation would be seeking a co-presenter for the 2016-17 season. <em>Id. </em>at 711. The Foundation notified past patrons of the Broadway show series that it was in the process of \u201cselecting] a new co-presenting partner.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. II at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Celebrity applied to be a co-presenter, but wasn\u2019t selected. Nevertheless, on September 24, 2015, it requested a permit to. present six Broadway shows at the Music Hall for the 2016-17 season. Celebrity explained that it \u201cbegan making commitments to Producers and Booking Agents to present these shows four ... years ago\u201d and that it was \u201cimperative that a permit be issued\u201d so \u201cthat the shows will go on as planned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333. The Authority denied Celebrity\u2019s request, stating that \u201c[b]ased on th[e] [presentation] agreement, the tentative dates discussed with Celebrity ... for the 2016-2017 Broadway Show Series have been released to the Foundation and therefore no permit can be issued.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. Ill at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">In response, Celebrity filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against the Authority and the Foundation. Celebrity asserted against both defendants free-speech and equal-protection claims. Against the Authority, Celebrity additionally alleged claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Against the Foundation, Celebrity added claims for trade-secret misappropriation and interference with prospective economic advantage. For relief, Celebrity sought, among other things, a preliminary injunction compelling the Authority to issue a use permit for the 2016-17 season and prohibiting the Foundation from using its customers\u2019 information. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>court denied injunctive relief, prompting this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">I. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">We review the denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion, \u201cex-amin[ing] the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and reviewing] its legal determinations, de novo.\u201d <em>Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City, </em>348 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2003). \u201cTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must [show] four factors: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood that [it] will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips, in [its] favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.\u201d <em>RoDa Drilling Co. v. Siegal, </em>552 F.3d 1203, 1208 (10th Cir. 2009). When, as here, preliminary injunctive relief would compel \u201cthe nonmoving party to take affirmative action,\u201d the moving party must make \u201ca heightened showing of the four factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">II. Compelling the Issuance of a Use Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">A. Irreparable Harm</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The district court concluded that Celebrity was not entitled to injunctive relief because it had not made a heightened showing of irreparable harm, as it could adequately be compensated with monetary damages for losing the opportunity to present the 2016-17 Broadway show season. <em>See </em>Crowe <em>&amp; Dunlevy, P.C. v. Stidham, </em>640 F.3d 1140, 1157 (10th Cir. 2011) (stating that \u201ceconomic loss is usually insufficient to constitute irreparable harm\u201d). Nevertheless, Celebrity argues its inability to promote the 2016-17 season will result in lost goodwill and damages to its reputation and that these losses are difficult to measure 'monetarily and thus are irreparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Granted, irreparable harm may be \u201cbased upon evidence suggesting that it is impossible to precisely calculate the amount of damage plaintiff will suffer.\u201d <em>Equifax Servs., Inc. v. Hitz, </em>905 F.2d 1355, 1361 (10th Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). But Celebrity doesn\u2019t cite any such evidence. And as the district court noted,, \u201cdamage to a corporation\u2019s business reputation will, at some point, translate into, lost bookings, lost business opportunities .., and, ultimately, into lost profits,\u201d which are subject to measurement given Celebrity\u2019s \u201ctrack record in multiple markets and [its] long, history\u201d promoting Broadway shows. Aplt. App., Vol. IV at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">We agree with the district court that Celebrity has not established a heightened showing of irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted. Athough that determination is conclusive regarding injunctive relief on Celebrity\u2019s common-law claims to compel issuance of a use permit, it does not end our inquiry regarding Celebrity\u2019s free-speech claim. This is so because there is a presumption of irreparable harm for the loss of First Amendment freedoms. <em>See Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (plurality opinion); <em>Cmty. Commc\u2019ns Co., Inc. v. City of Boulder, </em>660 F.2d 1370, 1376 (10th Cir. 1981). Thus, we next consider whether Celebrity has met its burden to show success on the merits of its free-speech claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>B. Free Speech</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">\u201cTo determine when and to what extent the Government may properly limit expressive activity on its property, the Supreme Court has adopted a range .of constitutional protections that varies depending on the nature of the government property, or forum.\u201d <em>Verlo v. Martinez, </em>820 F.3d 1113, 1129 (10th Cir. 2016). There are \u201cthree types of speech fora: the traditional public forum, the designated public forum, and the nonpublic forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Traditional public fora are places like streets and parks, which \u201cby long tradition have been open to public assembly and debate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A designated public forum is \u201cgovernment property that has not traditionally been regarded as a public forum [but which] is intentionally opened up for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1141 (internal quotation marks omitted). A nonpublic forum is government property that is not by tradition or designation a forum for public discourse. <em>See id. </em>at 1129. \u201c[T]he Supreme Court has also recognized that the government can create a \u2018limited public forum\u2019 by allowing selective access to some speakers or some types of speech in a nonpublic forum, while not opening the property sufficiently to become a designated public forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1129 n.6 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\u201cBecause the nature of the forum dictates the standard of scrutiny with which restrictions on speech are reviewed, courts typically begin the analysis of a challenge to restrictions on speech involving government property by identifying the nature of the forum involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1129. Here, the district court characterized the Music Hall\u2019s Thelma Gaylord Theatre as a limited public forum rather than a designated public forum because the theater</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aut\">is not open to all forms of expression in the sense that, for example, a public library is open to the receipt of information by virtually any means.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Rather, the performance hall, at least in recent years, has been substantially devoted to large scale productions involving what [Celebrity] refers to as the \u201chigher arts\u201d\u2014ballets, symphonies, Broadway shows, and the like. The facility is not open on an indiscriminate basis to anyone, or any entity, which wants to put on a play or music presentation. The city has historically used a permitting process which, by design, focuses on the productions of the resident artists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Aplt. App., Vol. IV at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Celebrity disputes the district court\u2019s characterization of the theater, arguing it is a designated public forum. Celebrity relies on <em>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 788, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985), where the court held that a charity drive aimed at federal employees qualified as a nonpublic forum. In so holding, the Supreme Court contrasted the charity drive with the \u201cmunicipal auditorium and .-.. city-leased theater\u201d found to be \u201ca public forum\u201d in <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975). <em>Cornelius, </em>473 U.S. at 803, 105 S.Ct. 3439. But Celebrity\u2019s reliance on <em>Cornelius </em>and <em>Southeastern Promotions </em>is misplaced in that both cases predate the Supreme Court\u2019s delineation of limited public fora as a distinct type of government property. <em>See Doe v. City of Albuquerque, </em>667 F.3d 1111, 1130 (10th Cir. 2012) (observing that \u201cthe Supreme Court has only recently clarified the terminology of \u2018designated\u2019 and \u2018limited\u2019 public fora\u201d (citing <em>Christian Legal Soc\u2019y Chapter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>of the Univ. of Cal. v. Martinez, </em>561 U.S. 661, 130 S.Ct. 2971, 177 L.Ed.2d 838 (2010), and <em>Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, </em>555 U.S. 460, 129 S.Ct. 1125, 172 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009))). Indeed, <em>Cornelius </em>identified the universe of fora as only \u201cthe traditional public forum, the public forum created by government designation, and the nonpublic forum.\u201d 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439. Moreover, at least one Circuit court views <em>Southeastern Promotions </em>as indicating that \u201ccity-leased theaters\u201d are limited public fora. <em>See Hotel Emps. &amp; Rest. Emps. Union v. City of N.Y. Dep\u2019t of Parks &amp; Recreation, </em>311 F.3d 534, 545 (2d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In any event, this court has offered \u201cthree non-exhaustive factors to consider in determining whether the' government has created a designated public forum\u201d instead of a limited public forum: (1) the forum\u2019s purpose; (2) the extent of the forum\u2019s use; and (3) the government\u2019s intent in opening the forum to the public. <em>Doe, </em>667 F.3d at 1129. As the district court found, the purpose of the Thelma Gaylord Theatre is to serve as a venue for large scale productions of art forms like ballets, symphonies and Broadway shows. That purpose indicates a selective design as to the speakers and types of speech allowed at the theater, which suggests a limited public forum, <em>see Verlo, </em>820 F.3d at 1129 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As to the second factor, the extent of the forum\u2019s use is limited. The theater is not open to all speakers indiscriminately. Even speakers engaged in the art forms listed above must seek a permit to use the theater. Further, the permitting process is largely focused on groups \u201cthat offer season show packages,\u201d as that \u201cis the best method to reduce the financial risk and to secure the number of attendees necessary ... to break even or make a profit.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. Ill at 646, 647-48. This limited access is inconsistent with the general access to a designated public forum. <em>See Doe, </em>667 F.3d at 1129 (identifying a designated public forum as one with \u201cgeneral access to, or indiscriminate use of, the forum\u201d (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Seattle Mideast Awareness Campaign v. King Cty., </em>781 F.3d 489, 496 (9th Cir. 2015) (\u201cThe defining characteristic of a designated public forum is that it\u2019s open to the same indiscriminate use and almost unfettered access that exist in a traditional public forum.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">As to the third factor\u2014the government\u2019s intent in opening the property to the public\u2014the Authority operates the theater under lease from the City \u201cto bring year-round, world class entertainment, by offering the best of ballet, theatre, Broadway, chorus, and orchestra and to develop a revenue stream needed to maintain, operate and upgrade the [venue].\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. III at 645. This factor, like the others, weighs in favor of finding the Thelma Gay-lord Theatre to be a limited public forum as it has been opened for use by only \u201ccertain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of certain subjects.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>561 U.S. at 679 n.11, 130 S.Ct. 2971 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Nevertheless, Celebrity contends the theater qualifies as a designated public forum because it is not used \u201cexclusively\u201d for the limited range of artistic expression noted above, Aplt. Opening Br. at 15, and because the lease requires the Authority to \u201cprovid[e] <em>public </em>events, facilities and accommodations for entertainment purposes,\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at 271 (emphasis added). But we are not persuaded that these points have any significant bearing on the requisite forum analysis. Instead, we conclude the theater\u2019s overarching purpose, the extent of its use, and the government\u2019s intent in opening it to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>show \u201cselective access to some speakers or some types of speech\u201d\u2014the hallmarks of a limited public forum. <em>See Verlo, </em>820 F.3d at 1129 n.6 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The next step of the constitutional analysis requires that we assess whether the challenged speech restriction is \u201creasonable and viewpoint-neutral.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>561 U.S. at 679 n.11, 130 S.Ct. 2971 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Shero v. City of Grove, </em>510 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cAny government restriction on speech in a limited public forum must only be reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and be viewpoint neutral.\u201d). Celebrity doesn\u2019t address the district court\u2019s application of this standard. Instead, Celebrity addresses only the strict-scrutiny standard applicable to designated public fora. <em>See Verlo, </em>820 F.3d at 1133 n.8 (\u201cGovernment restrictions 'on speech in a designated public forum are subject to the same strict scrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Consequently, Celebrity has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s conclusion that selection of the Foundation and a co-presenter\u2014instead of Celebrity\u2014to produce Broadway show seasons is reasonable and viewpoint-neutral. <em>See Solis, </em>589 F.3d at 1135 n.5 (observing that the failure to raise an issue in an opening brief waives that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Because Celebrity hasn\u2019t shown a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its free-speech claim, and because it hasn\u2019t otherwise demonstrated irreparable harm from the denial of a preliminary injunction, we conclude the district court didn\u2019t abuse its discretion in denying Celebrity\u2019s request for injunctive relief compelling the issuance of a use permit for the Thelma Gay-lord Theatre.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">III. Prohibiting the Use of Subscriber Information</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">Celebrity maintains that the Foundation misappropriated its customers\u2019 subscriber information and contacted them in violation of Oklahoma\u2019s Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 78 Okla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 86-94. Under the act, \u201c[ajctual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined\u201d for a \u201creasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 87(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">The district court concluded that Celebrity failed to show it was likely to prevail on the merits,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> given the box-office agreement\u2019s provision that \u201c[a]ll account information collected for storage and use\u201d on the ticketing system (1) \u201cis considered the intellectual property of [the Civic Center box office, which is part of the Authority] and the [Authority]\u201d; and (2) may be used by the Authority or a designee for promoting upcoming events. Aplt. App., Vol. Ill at 667. Celebrity argues that because it \u201cserve[s] as the Primary Box Office for season ticket renewals,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 668, it exclusively owns the subscriber information. Aplt. Opening Br, at 34-35 (stating that \u201cthe only \u2018use\u2019 for which season ticket subscriber [information] was stored on the [ticketing] system as far as the [Authority] was concerned was an occasional attempt by the [Authority] to sell something <em>other than </em>season tickets\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>But the box-office agreement isn\u2019t amenable to such a tortured interpretation. First, it broadly confers ownership of \u201c[a]ll account information\u201d on the Authority regardless of who collected, stored, and used it. <em>See </em>Aplt. App., Vol. Ill at 667. Second, even if Celebrity is the \u201cprimary\u201d source for season ticket renewals, that doesn\u2019t mean it is the exclusive source. Indeed, both the use permit and the box-office agreement give the Authority \u201cthe sole and exclusive right to sell, handle, distribute, or otherwise disburse <em>all </em>admission tickets,\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. I at 37 (emphasis added); <em>see also id., </em>Vol. Ill at 666. Under these circumstances, we construe the contractual language to mean that, at most, both Celebrity and the Authority own the subscriber information collected and stored through the ticketing system. And as an owner, the Authority can\u2019t be liable for utilizing information it owns. <em>See </em>78 Okla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 86(2) (defining misappropriation as the acquisition, disclosure, or use \u201cof a trade secret of another\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In sum, we conclude that the district court didn\u2019t abuse its discretion in denying preliminary injunctive relief prohibiting the use of ticket subscriber information.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order denying preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir, R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R, App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\">.
