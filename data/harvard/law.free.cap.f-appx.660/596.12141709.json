Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b614-26\">Miguel Escribano Faure, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (requiring a COA to appeal an order denying a \u00a7 2255 motion). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AzlC\">A. <em>Plea Agreement and Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-28\">The Government charged Mr. Faure with violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) by dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tributing a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine. The district court appointed counsel to represent Mr. Faure.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On February 10, 2014, Mr. Faure signed a plea agreement in which he \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d waived his right to \u201c[a]p-peal or collaterally challenge his guilty plea [and] sentence\u201d and to \u201c[ajppeal [or] collaterally challenge ... his sentence as imposed by the Court and the manner in which the sentence is determined.\u201d Dist. Ct. Doc. 27 at 6. The agreement stated, \u201cBy signing this agreement, defendant acknowledges that he has discussed its terms with his attorney and understands and accepts those terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11,</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The district court held a plea hearing on March 5, 2014. Mr. Faure stated that he understood he was under oath at the hearing. The court told Mr. Faure, \u201cIf I or anyone else should say or do anything here this morning that you do not fully understand or if at any time you have any questions, I want you to interrupt and ask me your question and we will go no further until I have fully answered your question.\u201d Dist. Ct. Doc. 84 at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The court then asked Mr. Faure to look at the waiver provisions in the plea agreement, followed by this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">THE COURT: First of all, you\u2019re waiving your right to appeal or challenge in any other way your guilty plea and your conviction and any rulings made by the Court. Secondly, you\u2019re giving up or waiving your right to appeal or challenge in any other way the sentence imposed by the Court and the manner in which the sentence is determined as long as that sentence is within or below, the advisory guideline range applied by the Court in this case. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiJM\"><em>Id. </em>at 15. When the court asked whether Mr. Faure had any questions about the waivers, he responded, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. When the court asked whether Mr. Faure \u201cagree[d] with these waivers,\u201d Mr. Faure answered, \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">B. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">After the plea hearing but before sentencing, the district court granted Mr. Faure\u2019s request to appoint substitute counsel. At the sentencing hearings, new counsel objected to various enhancements and cross-examined the Government\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">The district court concluded the total offense level was 39 and that the United States Sentencing Guidelines range was 360 to 480 months in prison. It imposed a sentence of 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">C. <em>Section 2255 Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">Mr. Faure filed a \u00a7 2255 motion with the district court, arguing his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by (1) representing him despite a conflict of interest, (2) failing to investigate \u201cthe facts and law\u201d and advise Mr. Faure about potential sentence enhancements, ROA, Vol. I at 30, (3) failing \u201cto interview and call rebuttal witnesses at sentencing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 32 (capitalization altered), and (4) \u201cfailing to properly explain the waivers in the plea agreement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33 (capitalization altered),</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Mr. Faure also moved for an evidentiary hearing, urging the court to hear testimony from four witnesses who submitted affidavits and declarations in his support. He asserted the affidavits and declarations would show that the Government\u2019s witnesses at the sentencing hearing testified falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">Mr. Faure submitted his own affidavit that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-18\">4. At no time did [counsel] ever explain to me that I could not file a 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>motion as part of my plea agreement. In fact, he stated that I could appeal certain sentencing issues and raise ineffective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">5. I did not even know what a 2255 motion was at that time, nor, did I know what collateral challenges were. He never explained to me what they were. He just said sign right there, you can file a 2255 and certain appeal issues on sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 41-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The district court rejected Mr. Faure\u2019s arguments and denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, the request for an evidentiary hearing, and a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ae-\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Mr. Faure may not appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 application without a COA. 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). To obtain a COA, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), and show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether .,. the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Mr. Faure argues (1) he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to collaterally attack his sentence, (2) his counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, and (3) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing. We deny a COA because reasonable jurists could not debate the district court\u2019s rejection of these arguments and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">1. Yalidity of Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">In his plea' agreement, Mr. Faure waived his right to collaterally attack his guilty plea and sentence. He now contends he should not be bound by the waiver because counsel failed to adequately explain the terms of the plea agreement and the Government attempted to deceive him by using the term \u201ccollateral challenge\u201d in the agreement. Aplt. Br. at 9. His affidavit states that he did not know what a collateral attack was at the time of the plea, counsel did not explain the collateral attack waiver, and counsel told him that he \u201ccan file a 2255 and certain appeal issues on sentencing,\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 41-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">\u201c[A] waiver of collateral attack rights brought under \u00a7 2255 is generally enforceable where the waiver is expressly stated in the plea agreement and where both the plea and the waiver were knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Cock<em>erham, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir. 2001). Mr. Faure argues he can bring a collateral attack because he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">When considering whether a defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to bring a collateral attack, (1) \u201cwe examine whether the language of the plea agreement states that the defendant entered the agreement knowingly and voluntarily,\u201d and (2) \u201cwe look for an adequate Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 colloquy.\u201d <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir. 2004). \u201cThe [criminal] defendant bears the burden to demonstrate that her waiver was not knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>500 F.3d 1206, 1210 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">The language of the plea agreement and the colloquy indicate that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Faure knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to collaterally attack his sentence. Mr. Faure signed a plea agreement that said he \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d waived his right to \u201ccollaterally challenge\u201d his sentence.'Dist. Ct. Doc. 27 at 6. The agreement stated that Mr. Faure \u201cacknowledges that he has discussed [the agreement\u2019s] terms with his attorney and understands and accepts those terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">At the plea hearing, the district court gave him an opportunity\u2014and encouragement to interrupt the colloquy\u2014to ask questions about anything he did \u201cnot fully understand.\u201d Dist. Ct. Doc. 84 at 3. Mr. Faure stated under oath that he understood he was \u201cwaiving most of [his] appeal rights\u201d and \u201cgiving up or waiving [his] right to appeal or challenge in any other way the sentence imposed by the Court and the manner in which the sentence is determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. Those \u201c[s]olemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Mr. Faure\u2019s post hoc, self-serving affidavit does not sway our analysis that \u201clooks primarily\u201d to the agreement and the colloquy. <em>Smith, </em>500 F.3d at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">On this point, we cannot say that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 475, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">2. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Mr. Faure argues his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in two ways. First, he argues counsel represented him despite a conflict of interest and \u201crefused to perform basic defense functions\u201d like interviewing and subpoenaing favorable witnesses that would \u201ccounter the lies government counsel pursued to increase [the] sentence.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Second, he contends counsel failed to \u201cinvestigate the government\u2019s case or interview any of petitioner\u2019s witnesses, or offer any objections to [the] additional' guideline enhancements Mr. Faure did not agree to, outside the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. He argues that the district court would have rejected the Government\u2019s proposed enhancements if his attorneys would have called \u201cpetitioner\u2019s witnesses\u201d to testify at the sentencing hearing and made \u201cproper objections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Mr. Faure\u2019s waiver of his right to collaterally attack his sentence is \u201cgenerally enforceable\u201d unless the \u201c\u00a7 2255 petition [is] based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims challenging the validity of the plea or the waiver. Collateral attacks based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims that are characterized as falling outside that category are waivable,\u201d <em>Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d at 1183, 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Here, . Mr. Faure\u2019s ineffective assistance claims focus on his attorneys\u2019 alleged failures related to sentencing. He does not challenge \u201cthe validity of the plea or the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187. The district court\u2019s rejection of the claims is therefore beyond debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">3. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">Lastly, Mr. Faure argues the district court abused its discretion by denying an evidentiary hearing. Section 2255(b) directs district courts to hold evidentiary hearings \u201c[u]nless the motion and the flies and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d \u201cWe review the denial of an evidentiary hearing in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Clingman, </em>288 F.3d 1183, 1187 n.4 (10th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Mr. Faure does not argue that an evi-dentiary hearing would' have supported a challenge to the validity of the plea agreement or waiver. Although unclear, it appears that Mr. Faure contends the heaping would support the ineffective assistance of counsel challenge that he waived. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in determining the \u201crecord conclusively shows that Mr. Faure is not entitled to relief, and there is no need for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We deny Mr. Faure\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-16\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
