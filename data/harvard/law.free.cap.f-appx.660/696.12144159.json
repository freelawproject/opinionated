Tymkovieh, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">In this adversary proceeding, Larry Ivan Behrends appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs and denying his cross-motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs sought a determination that a debt to them, reflected, in an arbitration award and confirmed in a Denver District Court judgment, was non-dischargeable. Because we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court properly concluded that the damages awarded against Behrends based on his violations of securities laws were nondis-chargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(19), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In 2010, plaintiffs filed a Statement of Claim with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The Claim named two securities broker-dealers and Behrends as respondents. It alleged they had unlawfully sold plaintiffs \u201c$623,560.53 worth of five highly speculative securities offerings which [they] represented as suitable for retirees like Claimants who were looking for safe income producing investments.\u201d Aplt. App. at 47. The Claim charged that the offerings \u201cwere non-exempt public securities offerings conducted in violation of state and federal securities laws\u201d which were \u201cthe subject of SEC enforcement actions for fraud in the sale of securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It asserted legal claims against all of the respondents, including Behrends, for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, violation of the Colorado Securities Act, violation of the Texas Securities Act, and negligence. Plaintiffs requested arbitration of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Behrends filed a pro se answer to the Claim in which he contested plaintiffs\u2019 claims and asserted various affirmative defenses. But he did not appear at the scheduled arbitration hearing. On the day of the hearing, at the arbitration panel\u2019s request, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel placed a telephone call to Behrends, \u201cwho indicated he knew about the hearing, but had decided not to show up because he believed there was no point to being there or defending the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83. The broker-dealer respondents also did not appear at the hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arbitration panel found that Behrends knew about the hearing, had been given proper notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard, but chose not to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">At the hearing, the arbitration panel ' \u201crequire[d] ... Claimants [to] prove both liability and damages, which they did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The panel then issued its written Award, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">1. <em>The Panel found multiple violations of the Colorado state and federal securities laws (as defined in Section 3(a)(k7) of the SEC Act of 193k).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\"><em>2. </em>Respondents Capwest Securities and Behrends are jointly and severally liable for and shall pay to Claimants Virginia Cooley-Linder and Darrell F. Linder $285,485.96 in compensatory damages, inclusive of pre-judgment interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">3.

Respondent Behrends is solely liable for and shall pay to Claimants Virginia Cooley-Linder and Darrell F.

Respondents Capwest Securities and Behrends are jointly and severally liable for and shall pay to Claimants Virginia Cooley-Linder and Darrell F. Linder $375.00 as reimbursement for the nonrefundable portion of the initial claim filing fee previously paid by Claimants to FINRA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">9. Any and all relief not specifically \u25a0 addressed herein is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">10. <em>The arbitrators have provided, an explanation of their decision in this award. The explanation is for the information of the parties only and is not precedential in nature.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 83-84 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Behrends later filed his underlying Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy courtgranted plaintiffs relief from the automatic stay, and plaintiffs subsequently filed an action in Denver state district court to confirm the FINRA award. Beh-rends neither opposed confirmation of the FINRA award nor appealed the district court\u2019s judgment confirming the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Plaintiffs then filed this adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court, seeking to have the debt declared nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(19). Section 523(a)(19) contains two requirements. First, to be non-dischargeable, the debt must be for \u201c(i) the' violation of any of the Federal securities laws ..., any of the State securities laws, or any regulation or order issued under such Federal or State securities laws; or (ii) common law fraud, deceit, or manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(19)(A). Second, the debt must result from,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">(i) any judgment, order, consent order, or decre\u00e9 entered in any Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">(ii) any settlement agreement entered into by the debtor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">(iii) any court or administrative order for any damages, fine, penalty, citation, restitutionary payment, disgorgement payment,- attorney fee, cost, or other payment owed by the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-15\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 523(a)(19)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">The bankruptcy court found both requirements met. The court also determined that collateral estoppel barred it from reconsidering the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 FINRA claim. Accordingly, it granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Behrends\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-17\">Behrends appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"AT2\">.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">\u201cWhether a debt is dischargeable in bankruptcy under \u00a7 523 is a question of law subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Tripodi v. Welch, </em>810 F.3d 761, 766 (10th Cir. 2016). \u201cThe burden is on the creditor to show a debt is nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a).\u201d <em>Okla. Dep\u2019t of Sec. ex rel. Faught v. Wilcox, </em>691 F.3d 1171, 1174 (10th Cir. 2012) (citing <em>Grogan v. Garner, </em>498 U.S. 279, 283, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-20\">\n<em>A. Debt Stemming From Violation of Securities Laws\u2014\u00a7 523(a) (19) (A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-21\">Behrends argues that this condition is not met because plaintiffs failed to prove that the arbitration panel actually litigated the issue of whether he violated the securities laws. In his view, plaintiffs must satisfy all of the traditional requisites for appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>cation of collateral estoppel, including proving that the issue resolved by the finding was \u201cactually litigated\u201d in the prior proceeding, in order to use the finding of a securities violation contained in a prior judgment such as the arbitration award. In order to give a prior judgment collateral estoppel or issue preclusion effect for purposes of nondischargeability, the prior judgment must generally satisfy state-law preclusion principles. <em>See </em>2 Michael S. Coffman, Lance Miller <em>&amp; </em>Howard J. Stein-berg, <em>Issue Preclusion (Collateral Estoppel), </em>2 Bankr. Litig. \u00a7 13:89 (2d ed. July 2007 <em>&amp; </em>Aug. 2016 Update). But the argument fails here because, to satisfy \u00a7 523(a)(19), it is not necessary to show that the securities violation was \u201cactually litigated\u201d as understood in state issue preclusion cases. In enacting \u00a7 523(a)(19), Congress departed from the common-law understanding of collateral estoppel and issue preclusion principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Section 523(a)(19)(B)(i) permits a determination of nondischargeability based on <em>\u2018\u2018any </em>judgment,\u201d (emphasis added). Consistent with this broad language, we have held that a court may give preclusive effect to a default judgment that otherwise satis-f\u00edes the requirements of \u00a7 523(a)(19), <em>see Tripodi, </em>810 F.3d at 766-67.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is true even when state law would otherwise bar the use of collateral estoppel because the plaintiff failed to prove an issue was actually litigated in the prior proceeding. Section 523(a)(19) preempts such state-law requirements. <em>See, e.g., Paik v. Lee (In re Lee), </em>536 B.R. 848, 859 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2015) (\u201cCongress clearly intended to alter the \u2018actually litigated\u2019 requirement of the issue preclusion analysis so that a. settlement agreement has a preclusive effect not otherwise available.\u201d (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)); Voss <em>v. Pujdak (In re Pujdak), </em>462 B.R. 560, 577-78 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2011) (\u201cSouth Carolina\u2019s traditional approach to collateral estoppel, requiring that the matter be \u2018actually litigated,\u2019 is altered in \u00a7 523(a)(19) actions ... because collateral estoppel is a common law creature [that] can ... be preempted by Congressional action.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to Behrends\u2019s argument based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to produce transcripts or other evidence of the proceedings to show which issues were \u201cactually litigated\u201d by the arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tration panel, there is no bar to using the arbitration award here.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Behrends also argues that the arbitration panel\u2019s findings are insufficient to show a securities law violation because it is not possible to determine from the award such factors as: (1) which securities laws he violated; (2) which acts or omissions were the bases for the alleged violations; (3) which facts support the amount of damages awarded; and (4) what standard of proof the panel applied. In this proceeding, however, all that is required is a determination that the award satisfied the requirements for nondischargeability described in \u00a7 523(a)(19). <em>Cf. Meyer v. Rigdon, </em>36 F.3d 1375, 1382 (7th Cir. 1994) (considering, as a legal matter, whether default judgment satisfied requirements for nondischarge-ability detailed in \u00a7 523(a)(ll)). An examination of the Claim reveals that those requirements were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Behrends\u2019s failure to defend means that he admitted all the facts plaintiffs asserted in their Claim. <em>See Tripodi, </em>810 F.3d at 766-67 (stating debt resulting from default judgment stemmed \u201cfrom a violation of securities laws as set forth\u2014and deemed true\u2014in [the defaulted] complaint\u201d). In their Claim, plaintiffs asserted that Beh-rends \u201crecommended, solicited, sold and over-concentrated [plaintiffs\u2019] assets in several highly speculative, illiquid private placements\u201d that were not at all suitable for them. Aplt. App. at 49. These private placements \u201cwere required to be registered and were sold to [plaintiffs] in violation of Colorado and Texas securities laws governing the sale of unregistered securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Claim further asserted that the respondents made misrepresentations and omitted material facts in connection with their solicitation and sale of the securities to the plaintiffs. It specifically alleged that these actions and/or omissions violated Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 11-51-301, 11-51-501(1)(b), and 11-51-501(1)(c). Finally, the panel\u2019s award against Behrends was less than the total amount of damages sought against him in the Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">To be sure, \u201ceven in default, a defendant is not prohibited from challenging the legal sufficiency of the admitted factual allegations.\u201d <em>Tripodi, </em>810 F.3d at 765. Here, however, Behrends does not argue that the admitted facts were insufficient as a matter of law to establish the required securities law violations. Moreover, although plaintiffs included other causes of action in their Claim, the arbitration panel explicitly stated (tracking the language of \u00a7 523(a)(19)(A)) that it found numerous violations of federal and Colorado state securities laws. The panel provided no other specific reason for its award.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Finally, Behrends complains that the arbitration panel\u2019s award states that it is \u201cfor the information of the parties only and ... not precedential in nature.\u201d Aplt. App. at 84.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that this language does not preclude the use of the arbitration award\u2019s findings and judgment in a proceeding between the parties to determine dischargeability of the debt. To hold otherwise would frustrate the plain meaning of the statute, \u00a7 523(a)(19)(B), which does not require a published, precedential decision but permits the use of <em>\u201cany </em>judgment,\u201d or for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>matter, <em>\u201cany </em>settlement agreement entered into by the debtor,\u201d whether or not incorporated into a precedential decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\">In sum, under these circumstances, we find no basis for reversing the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that the arbitration panel\u2019s award met the requirements of \u00a7 523(a)(19)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">\n<em>B. Debt Memorialized in Judicial Order-\u00a7 523(a)(19)(B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">As Behrends concedes, <em>see </em>Aplt. Opening Br. at 13, the order of the District Court for Denver County, Colorado confirming the arbitration award and entering judgment thereon qualifies as a judicial order memorializing the debt. It therefore satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 523(a)(19)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to plaintiffs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.T and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">.

Section 523(a)(19) was adopted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, <em>see Okla. Dep\u2019t of Sec., </em>691 F.3d at 1175, and serves the broad remedial purpose of \"hold[ing] accountable those who violate securities laws after a government unit or private suit results in a judgment or settlement against the wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Tripodi, </em>810 F.3d at 767 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting S. Rep. No. 107-146, at *16 (2002)). <em>See also </em>Coffman, et al., <em>Section 523(a)(19): Securities Violations, </em>2 Bankr. Litig. \u00a7 13:67 (\"The policy underlying [\u00a7 523(a)(19)] is to hold parties accountable who violate securities laws and to give collateral estoppel effect to judgments finding the presence of securities fraud,\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">. The district court applied Colorado\u2019s law of collateral estoppel, accepting Behrends\u2019s argument that \"the effects of collateral estoppel on a judgment of a state court must be determined by the law of the forum in which the prior judgment was rendered.\u201d Aplt. App. at 13. We previously adopted a three-part test for determining whether collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of factual issues in dis-chargeability actions under \u00a7 523(a), making such findings binding on the bankruptcy court where \u201c(1) the issue to be precluded is the same as that involved in the prior state action, (2) the issue was actually litigated by the parties in the prior action, and (3) the state court\u2019s determination of the issue was necessary to the resulting final and valid judgment.\u201d <em>Klemens v. Wallace (In re Wallace), </em>840 F.2d 762, 765 (10th Cir. 1988). Because both the Colorado and <em>Wallace </em>tests include the element of actual litigation, and because \u00a7 523(a)(19) modifies the requirement in either case, we need not determine whether the Colorado test for collateral estoppel governs this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. Debtor argues that the \"FINRA scheme of non-precedential remedies specifically permitted the re-litigation of the issues addressed\u201d under the rule in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 84 (1982). Aplt. Opening Br. at 15. He fails to show that he made this argument to the district court. Accordingly, we decline to address it. <em>See, e.g., PHL Variable Ins. Co. v. Sheldon Hathaway Fam. Ins. Tr. ex rel.
