However, the January 27, 2010 order is not properly on appeal, and in any case, Lopez failed to raise this argument in his motion for reconsideration. Therefore, the argument is abandoned, and after careful review of the briefs and relevant parts of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">\u25a0 The Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) \u201cprovides the exclusive civil procedures for the United States ... to recover a judgment on a debt.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001(a)(1), Pursuant to the FDCPA, \u201c[a] court may issue a writ of garnishment against property ,.. in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest and which is in the possession, custody, or control of a person other than the debtor, in order to satisfy the judgment against the debtor.\u201d \u00a7 3205(a). Among the procedural requirements provided in the Act, the United States must serve the writ on both the garnishee and the debtor. \u00a7 3205(c)(3). The garnishee must file a written answer to the writ under oath. \u00a7 3205(c)(4). Once the garnishee files its sworn written answer to the writ,' \u201cthe judgment debtor or the United States may file a written objection to the answer and request a hearing,\u201d \u00a7 3205(c)(5). \u201cThe court shall hold a hearing within 10 days after the date the request is received by the court, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, and give notice of the hearing date to all the parties.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">In the instant case, Lopez was convicted in the Southern District of Florida and sentenced to life imprisonment on October 29,1993. The judgment also included a fine in the amount of $25,000 plus statutory interest due immediately. DE 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">More than sixteen years later, the Government applied for a Writ of Garnishment against Lopez on November 10, 2009. DE 414. The application stated that, as of November 6, 2009, Lopez had paid only $925.00 of the $25,000 fine and that the balance of the judgment remained due. DE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>414:1. The application further named the BOP as garnishee and stated the \"United States\u2019 belief that the BOP Inmate Trust Account for Lopez had in its \u201cpossession, custody or control, property or assets in which defendant has a substantial nonexempt interest.\u201d DE 414:2. The writ was issued on the same day. DE 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The BOP filed an answer to the writ of garnishment on December 4, 2009. DE 416. The answer stated that the present value of Lopez\u2019s Trust Fund Account was $54,088.11 and that there was a hold of $45,000.00 on the account, which had been placed at the direction of agency counsel and the BOP\u2019s Special Investigative Service. DE 416:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Lopez, appearing <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cMotion to Dissolve Writ of Garnishment and Remove Lien\u201d on January 7, 2010. In the Motion, Lopez stated that he \u201c[did] not dispute the existence of the fine impose by the Court on October 29, 1993\u201d but \u201cexpressly denie[d]\u201d that the Government was entitled to garnish his prison account to satisfy the judgment. DE 417:2. Specifically, Lopez argued that the application for a writ of garnishment suffered from numerous procedural deficiencies, and, among other things, that the account contained \u201cmostly\u201d funds derived from insurance proceeds paid to cover damages caused to his house by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma which were \u201cprobably exempt from garnishment under federal and State of Florida law.\u201d See DE 417:2-4. For these reasons, Lopez requested the district court to issue an order dissolving the writ of garnishment and removing the lien placed on his prison account or, \u201cin the alternative, scheduling an evidentiary hearing on the matter.\u201d DE 417:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">The Government filed a response requesting the district court deny Lopez\u2019s motion on January 20, 2010. DE. 419. The Government\u2019s response made no reference to Lopez\u2019s alternative request for a hearing. On January 27, 2010, without the benefit of a hearing, the district court denied Lopez\u2019s motion. DE 420. The district court\u2019s order did not address Lopez\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Subsequently, as relevant here, Lopez filed a motion on February 2, 2010 captioned \u201cMotion to Vacate or Stay the Court\u2019s January 27, 2010 Order,\u201d DE 422, and another motion on March 3, 2010 captioned \u201cMotion for Reconsideration and/or Clarification of the January 27, 2010 Order.\u201d DE 426. Neither of these motions raised the issue of. an evidentiary hearing. On April 30, 2010, Lopez filed another motion captioned \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Request for Expedite Evidentiary Hearing,\u201d but that motion requested only a hearing to determine whether the interim freezing of the funds in his prison account was lawful. It did not, as in the January 7, 2010 motion, request a hearing on the merits of the FDCPA garnishment order. DE 433, The district court denied that motion on May 4, 2010, DE 434, and Lopez filed an interlocutory appeal of the denial in this Court on June 17, 2010. DE 437. Lopez\u2019s appeal was dismissed by this Court on August 23, 2014 following Lopez\u2019s motion for voluntary dismissal. DE 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Following the dismissal of Lopez\u2019s appeal, the Government filed a motion requesting an order on the distribution of the funds in Lopez\u2019s inmate trust account. DE 445. The district court granted that motion on April 7, 2015. DE 449. Lopez then filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the district court\u2019s disbursal order on April 21, 2015. DE 450. The Motion for Reconsideration made no request for an evidentiary hearing. On April 24, 2015, the district court denied Lopez\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration. DE 451. Lopez then filed the Notice of Appeal in the instant case, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>which he gave notice of his appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \u201cfrom the final judgment order entered in this case on April 24, 2015.\u201d DE 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">On appeal, Lopez argues that the dis-' trict court abused its discretion in issuing the January 27, 2010 garnishment order because it applied the wrong law. Specifically, Lopez argues that the district court\u2019s January 27, 2010 order violated 28 U.S.C. 3205(c)(5) by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing as requested in Lopez\u2019s January 7, 2010 Motion to Writ of Garnishment and Remove Lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">We have no opportunity to decide whether the district court erred in its January 27, 2010 garnishment order because that order is not properly on appeal. The only order appealed by Lopez is the district court\u2019s April 24, 2015 order denying his Motion for Reconsideration of the district court\u2019s April 7, 2015 order granting the Government\u2019s Motion for an Order to Disburse the Funds that are Subject to the Writ of Garnishment. Moreover, Lopez did not raise the issue of an evidentiary hearing in the Motion for Reconsideration that was denied by the order currently on appeal. Therefore, the issue is abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Because Lopez raises no arguments challenging the district court\u2019s April 24, 2015 order\u2014the only order on appeal here\u2014we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-8\">. We do not consider the merits of the district court\u2019s January 27, 2010 order granting the Government's motion for a disbursement of funds from Lopez\u2019s inmate trust account for lack of jurisdiction. DE 420. Under 28 U.S.C. 2107(b)(1), in cases where one of the parties is the United' States, we lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a district court order unless a notice of appeal is filed within sixty days after the entry of the order being appealed. Lopez failed to meet this requirement with regard to the district court's January 27, 2010 order because Lopez never filed a notice of appeal of that' order. The notice of appeal filed in the instant case gave notice of appeal only of the district court\u2019s April 24, 2015 order denying Lopez's motion for reconsideration. DE 452. For these reasons, we do not review Lopez\u2019s claims as they relate to the January 27, 2010 order granting the Government\u2019s motion for a disbursement of funds from Lopez's inmate trust account. Rather, we analyze only. Lopez\u2019s arguments as they relate to the district court's denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
