Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b645-25\">Plaintiff Alma Rubi Chavez-Torres appeals the district court\u2019s order granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>summary judgment in favor of defendants, the City of Greeley, Colorado, and Greeley Police Officer Erin Gooch, in her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging malicious prosecution. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">On February 8, 2012, a woman attempted to cash a fraudulent check at a bank but quickly left when a bank employee began to investigate, leaving behind the forged check and a driver\u2019s license. The forged check was made payable to Alma Rubi Chavez-Torres, and the driver\u2019s license belonged to Chavez-Torres. The next day, Officer Gooch went to Chavez-Torres\u2019s home and arrested her for forgery and possession of a forged instrument. Chavez-Torres, who spoke little or no English, denied any involvement in the check forgery. However, at a hearing on February 10, 2012, a judge found probable cause to charge her. Chavez-Torres remained in jail until March 28, 2012, when the prosecutor dismissed the charges against her, citing an inability to prove her guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Chavez-Torres then brought this \u00a7 1983 action against the defendants alleging malicious prosecution. To prevail on a Fourth Amendment \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim, a plaintiff must show the following five elements: \u201c(1) the defendant caused the plaintiffs continued confinement or prosecution; (2) the original action terminated in favor of the plaintiff; (3) there was no probable cause to support the original arrest, continued confinement, or prosecution; (4) the defendant acted with malice; and (5) the plaintiff sustained damages.\u201d <em>Novitsky v. City of Aurora, </em>491 F.3d 1244, 1258 (10th Cir. 2007). The defendants first moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The district court dismissed some claims,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but concluded the complaint plausibly alleged a malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Defendants then moved for summary judgment, asserting Officer Gooch had probable cause to arrest Chavez-Torres. Officer Gooch\u2019s affidavit noted that both of the two items left at the bank were linked to Chavez-Torres and that when Officer Gooch interviewed Chavez-Torres, Chavez-Torres avoided eye contact and her hair appeared newly colored, possibly to \u25a0 change her appearance. Officer Gooch had previously reviewed the video from the bank\u2019s camera, which, though grainy and of low resolution, led her to conclude the perpetrator shared the same gender, race, hair color and length, and approximate size as Chavez-Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">In response, Chavez-Torres alleged there were significant physical differences between her and the description of the perpetrator. Further, she alleged Officer Gooch failed to review still photos from the video or arrange a line-up for bank employees, and didn\u2019t arrange for a Spanish-English interpreter, thus, she couldn\u2019t answer Officer Gooch\u2019s questions or provide the names of alibi witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">The district court granted summary judgment to defendants because Chavez-Torres failed to meet her burden to demonstrate either that Officer Gooch lacked probable cause to arrest her or that Officer Gooch acted with malice, two of the required elements of a malicious prosecution claim. Chavez-Torres moved for relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), which the district court denied. She now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the' same legal standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Twigg v. Hawker Beechcraft Corp., </em>659 F.3d 987, 997 (10th Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>ClearOne Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Bowers, </em>643 F.3d 735, 754 (10th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On appeal, Chavez-Torres first argues that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether Officer Gooch had probable cause to arrest her. She also challenges the district court\u2019s malice ruling, arguing that she relied on the district court\u2019s earlier Rule 12(b)(6) ruling in not presenting any evidence that Officer Gooch acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We have held that malice, in the context of malicious prosecution, requires evidence of intent, not mere negligence. <em>See Novitsky, </em>491 F.3d at 1258-59 (ruling evidence of misstatement in arrest report was insufficient evidence of malice when plaintiff failed to show misstatement was intentional rather than negligent or inadvertent); <em>Fletcher v. Burkhalter, </em>605 F.3d 1091, 1095 (10th Cir. 2010) (stating malice in \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claims \u201crequires intentional or reckless disregard of the truth\u201d). We have also said that \u201cwe use the common law elements of malicious prosecution as the starting point\u201d for the analysis of a \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim. <em>Novitsky, </em>491 F.3d at 1257 (internal quotation marks omitted). Colorado, where this incident occurred, defines \u201cmalice\u201d in state malicious prosecution claims as \u201cany motive other than a desire to bring an offender to justice.\u201d <em>Suchey v. Stiles, </em>155 Colo. 363, 394 P.2d 739, 741 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Chavez-Torres argues she didn\u2019t present any evidence of malice because the district court had previously ruled in its Rule 12(b)(6) order that her complaint plausibly alleged malice. But Chavez-Torres fundamentally misunderstands the distinction between a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and a Rule 56 summary judgment motion. The court\u2019s role at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage is \u201cnot to weigh potential evidence that the parties might present at trial, but to assess whether the plaintiffs complaint alone is legally sufficient to state a claim for which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, at the summary judgment stage, \u201c[f]or dispositive issues on which the plaintiff will bear the burden of proof at trial, [s]he must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts so as to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [her] case in order to survive summary judgment.\u201d <em>Cardoso v. Calbone, </em>490 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). In short, the Rule 12(b)(6) ruling didn\u2019t reheve Chavez-Torres of her burden to present evidence that Officer Gooch acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We note that the defendants didn\u2019t raise any argument related to malice in their motion for summary judgment. The rules do permit a court to grant a summary judgment \u201cmotion on grounds not raised by a party,\u201d but only \u201c[a]fter [first] giving notice and a reasonable time to respond.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(2). Here, nothing in the record indicates the district court gave Chavez-Torres this required notice. But Chavez-Torres doesn\u2019t assert this Rule 56(f)(2) error as a basis for reversal on appeal; her opening brief makes no mention of Rule 56(f)(2) and she makes only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>passing reference to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(3) in her reply brief. Appellants are required to identify their appeal arguments in their opening brief, Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(a), and consistent with this requirement, we routinely decline to consider arguments not raised, or inadequately presented, in an appellant\u2019s opening brief. <em>Bronson v. Swensen, </em>500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Significantly, given the district court\u2019s sua sponte malice ruling, Chavez-Torres didn\u2019t use her Rule 60(b) motion to lodge any Rule 56(f)(2) objection to the lack of notice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, as here, Chavez-Torres argued only that she didn\u2019t present evidence of malice because she believed she could rely on the Rule 12(b)(6) ruling that she had plausibly alleged malice in her complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, even if the district court erred by granting summary judgment on the malice element without giving Chavez-Torres notice and an opportunity to respond, Chavez-Torres waived this argument by failing to pursue it before the district court or raise it on appeal prior to her reply brief. <em>See McKenzie v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>761 F.3d 1149, 1154-55 (10th Cir. 2014) (refusing to consider arguments not raised in the district court or first raised in a reply brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Regarding the malice element, Chavez-Torres has made only conclusory, unsupported allegations that Officer Gooch was motivated primarily by a desire to finish her investigation quickly and that the Greeley Police Department created a culture that stressed clearing a case and making an arrest rather than charging the right person. But these conclusory allegations are insufficient at summary judgment stage. Rather, evidence \u201cmust be based on more than mere speculation, conjecture, or surmise[, and unsubstantiated allegations carry no probative weight in summary judgment proceedings.\u201d <em>Cardoso, </em>490 F.3d at 1197 (bracket omitted). Chavez-Torres also repeats her allegations that Officer Gooch conducted a flawed investigation and used Chavez-Torres\u2019s children as interpreters. To the extent she may be arguing that malice can be inferred from a lack of probable cause, we agree with the district court for the reasons it specified that Chavez-Torres failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude Officer Gooch lacked probable cause to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Given the absence of any evidence that Officer Gooch acted with malice, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">. Chavez-Torres does not appeal the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-5\">. Because Chavez-Torres is represented by counsel, her appellate briefs are not afforded a liberal construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\">. In any event, we note that we will not reverse based on a lack of notice under Rule 56(f) \"if the losing party suffered no prejudice from the lack of notice.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Weld Cty., </em>594 F.3d 1202, 1214 (10th Cir. 2010). Further, unlike a situation in which no motion for summary judgment has been filed and the court sua sponte grants judgment, we are less inclined to find prejudice when a motion for summary judgment has been filed. <em>Cf. Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>653 Fed.Appx. 598, 608-09, 2016 WL 3457619 at *9 (noting when a motion has been filed, \u201c 'the judge already is engaged in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and the parties have been given the opportunity to present evidence designed either to support or refute the request for entry of 'summary judgment\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>10A </em>Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2720 (3d ed. 1998)).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\">.Chavez-Torres attached to her Rule 60(b) motion an amended affidavit, adding new allegations, none of which was newly-discovered evidence and most of which were simply conclusory, unsupported allegations. We do not consider these new allegations, as a Rule 60(b) motion is not an appropriate vehicle to advance new supporting facts that were available but not raised at the time of the original argument. <em>Cashner v. Freedom Stores, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 572, 577 (10th Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
