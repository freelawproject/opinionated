Adelson against O\u2019Keeffe. The district court granted O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s application and denied Adelson\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">O\u2019Keeffe is a journalist based in Hong Kong. O\u2019Keeffe is currently being sued for libel in Hong Kong by Adelson. Adelson\u2019s Hong Kong libel action is based on a 2012 Wall Street Journal article O\u2019Keeffe co-wrote about Adelson, in which Adelson was described as a \u201cscrappy, foul-mouthed billionaire from working-class Dorchester, Mass.\u201d In his Hong Kong libel action, Adelson alleges that the article\u2019s description of him as \u201cfoul-mouthed\u201d is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Seeking evidence in the United States that Adelson is in fact \u201cfoulmouthed,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe filed her application in the district court in the Southern District of Florida so she could depose and obtain documents from Nikita Zukov, an architect who had worked with Adelson in 1989. While Zukov. did not object to the subpoena, Adelson filed a motion to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">The district court denied Adelson\u2019s motion to quash. In so doing, the district court found, as a magistrate judge had before it, that the statutory requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 were met and that the discretionary factors identified in Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241, 124 S.Ct. 2466, 159 L.Ed.2d 355 (2004), weighed in favor of granting O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s application. The district court further determined, contrary to the magistrate judge, that the evidence O\u2019Keeffe sought from Zukov\u2014that he witnessed Adelson use foul language when they worked together\u2014was relevant and noncumulative and was not sought as part of a fishing expedition or a campaign of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">II. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">Under \u00a7 1782, a district court may order discovery from a person residing in the United States for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the district court\u2019s order may prescribe the practice or procedure for taking the discovery, if the order does not do so, the discovery is taken \u201cin accordance with the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Id. To that end, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1), the \u00a7 1782(a) applicant may seek discovery of any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense. See Application of Consorcio Ecuatoriano De Telecomunicaciones S.A. v. JAS Forwarding (USA), Inc., 747 F.3d 1262, 1272 (11th Cir. 2014); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">\u201cA district court has the authority to grant an application for judicial assistance if the following statutory requirements in \u00a7 1782(a) are met: (1) the request must be made \u2018by a foreign or international tribunal,\u2019 or by \u2018any interested person\u2019; (2) the request must seek evidence, whether it be the \u2018testimony or statement\u2019 of a person or the production of \u2018a document or other thing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: (3) the evidence must be \u2018for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal\u2019; and (4) the person from whom discovery is sought must reside or be found in the district of the district court ruling on the application for assistance.\u201d In re Clerici, 481 F.3d 1324, 1331-32 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting in part \u00a7 1782(a)) (footnote omitted). Here, Adelson does not dispute that all four statutory requirements are met and that the district court had the authority to grant O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s \u00a7 1782(a) application.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">If \u00a7 1782(a)\u2019s four requirements are met, the district court may, but is not required to, provide assistance. Id. at 1332. The district court, in exercising its discretion, considers the four factors noted by the Supreme Court in Intel: \u201c(1) whether \u2018the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding,\u2019 because \u2018the need for \u00a7 1782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant\u2019; (2) \u2018the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign government or the court or agency abroad to U.S. federal-court judicial assistance\u2019; (3) \u2018whether the \u00a7 1782(a) request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or the United States\u2019; and (4) whether the request is otherwise \u2018unduly intrusive or burdensome.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 1334 (quoting in part Intel, 542 U.S. at 264-65, 124 S.Ct. at 2483).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">\u201cWhether, and to what extent, to honor a request for assistance pursuant to \u00a7 1782 has been committed by Congress to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d United Kingdom v. United States, 238 F.3d 1312, 1318-19 (11th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review for an abuse of discretion is \u201cextremely limited and highly deferential,\u201d and \u201cis identical to that used in reviewing the district court\u2019s ordinary discovery rulings.\u201d Id. at 1319. To the extent the district court\u2019s decision is based on an interpretation of law, our review is de novo. Id. at 1319 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">In this case, Adelson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by granting O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s \u00a7 1782(a) application. For the reasons given by the magistrate judge, all the Intel factors weighed in favor of granting the application. On appeal the only factor Adelson argues is the fourth Intel factor. Given that Zukov has not objected to the subpoena and Adelson does not explain how the request is overly broad, we cannot say that O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s requested discovery is either unduly burdensome or intrusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">' Adelson contends that O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s requested discovery is \u201can improper \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 based entirely on speculation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>As the district court explained in its April 26, 2016 order, however, O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s request is not based on speculation, but rather upon her counsel\u2019s personal conversations with Zukov, in which he indicated that he personally witnessed, and had a clear memory of, Adelson using foul language during their business interactions. Thus, Adelson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s request, which is limited to Adelsoris use of foul language during his business interactions with Zukov, is not a fishing expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Adelson alternatively argues that, even if all the Intel factors favor granting O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s application, the district court nonetheless abused its discretion because Zukov\u2019s testimony about Adelsoris foul language in 1989 is irrelevant. For the reasons outlined in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned April 26, 2016 order, Zukov\u2019s testimony is relevant to the core issue, raised by Adelson himself in his Hong Kong libel action, that is, whether Adelson has the general character trait of being foul-mouthed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s April 26, 2016 order sustaining O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s objections and setting aside the magistrate judge\u2019s order and denying Adelsoris motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-8\">. Section 1782(a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-9\">The district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation. The order may be made pursuant to a letter rogatory issued, or request made, by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the application of any interested person and may direct that the testimony or statement be given, or the document or other thing be produced, before a person appointed by the court. By virtue of his appointment, the person appointed has power to administer any necessary oath and take the testimony or statement. The order may prescribe the practice and procedure, which may be in whole or part the practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal, for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or other thing. To the extent that the order does not prescribe otherwise, the testimony or statement shall be taken, and the document or other thing produced, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
