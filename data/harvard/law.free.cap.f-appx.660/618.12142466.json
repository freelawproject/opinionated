Phillips, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">Paul Gonzalez initiated this action by ffling an Affidavit of .Obligation of Commercial Lien. On February 23, 2016, Gonzalez filed a Complaint. On January 26, 2016, Magistrate Judge Gordon Gallagher ordered Gonzalez to file an amended complaint clarifying his claims. On March 11, 2016, Gonzalez filed his Amended Complaint. On April 4, 2016, before the defendants were served, District Judge Lewis Babcock dismissed the action for failure to comply with the pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. Judge Babcock certified that any appeal' from his order would not be taken in good faith and denied <em>informa pauperis </em>status for any appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">Because Gonzalez is pro se, we construe his pro se pleadings liberally, but we do not serve as his advocate. <em>James v. Wadas, </em>724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir. 2013). Even reviewing Gonzalez\u2019s filings liberally, we see no valid appellate issue. For instance, in response to the pro se briefing-format\u2019s questions, \u201cDo you think the district court applied the wrong law? If so, what law do you want applied?\u201d Gonzalez writes only that \u201c[t]he District Court has forgotten tha[t] he is the one who chose to protect the People and he is the one who should know the laws and I shall not be treated like a pig.\u201d Opening Br. at 4. Thus, we see no basis for reversing the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">Gonzalez also filed a motion.to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>To be granted <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>status, Gonzalez must show \u201ca financial inability to pay the required [filing] fees and the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Leyba, </em>543 F.3d 624, 627 (10th Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir. 1997)). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>find no reasoned, nonfrivolous argument here and so we deny Gonzalez\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3m\">We affirm the district court and deny Gonzalez\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10'th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
