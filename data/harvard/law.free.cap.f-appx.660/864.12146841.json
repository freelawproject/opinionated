He raises two issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm Fernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AE1\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ahu\">\n<em>A. Procedural Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-22\">Fernandez first contends his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>the district court failed to explain why it imposed a sentence above the Sentencing Guidelines 'recommendation. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201c[The appellate court] must ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as ... failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Fernandez has the burden of demonstrating his sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir. 2010). He has not met it. The district court adequately explained its reasons for choosing a sentence outside the range set by the Guidelines, taking into due account the considerations presented by \u00a7 3553(a). It explicitly invoked \u00a7 3553(a) and stated that Fernandez\u2019s past criminality and his recidivism, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to protect the public motivated it to increase the sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court dwelt at length on Fernandez\u2019s criminal record and discussed in detail its view that the Guidelines failed to take into account the number and gravity of Fernandez\u2019s past crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322-23 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding a sentence to be reasonable where the sentencing court explained why it attached great weight to one \u00a7 3553(a) factor). Further, it acknowledged Fernandez\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and guilty plea and considered them as possible mitigating factors. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d). The record belies Fernandez\u2019s suggestion the sentencing court\u2019s explanation was inadequate. The court\u2019s thorough discussion of its reasons for its upward variance provided ample opportunity for appellate review and Fernandez\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586 (\u201c[The district court] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">\n<em>B. Substantive Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Second, Fernandez asserts his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable bearing in mind the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. A court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc). The district court did not err in any of these respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Fernandez has failed show his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as it was his burden to do. <em>See Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378. The district court reviewed Fernandez\u2019s past and concurrent criminal conduct, including his repeated DUIs, driver\u2019s license violations, sexual battery, strong-arm robberies and other thefts, and his pending state court charges. The court expressly considered the components of \u00a7 3553(a). It then varied Fernandez\u2019s Guidelines-recommended sentence upward in order to, in the court\u2019s words, \u201cprotect the public from [Fernandez\u2019s] future crimes\u201d and to \u201cprovide just punishment for an offense one after the other.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (C). Although district court gave comparatively deeper scrutiny to Fernandez\u2019s criminal record, it was free to attach great weight to any single \u00a7 3553 factor, even to the point of significant reliance on it. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 57, 128 S.Ct. 586 (approving of district court\u2019s heavy emphasis on the defendant\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation); <em>United States v. Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1327 (11th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[Significant reliance on one factor does not necessarily render a sentence unreasonable.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cThe weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court_\u201d) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">That Fernandez\u2019s sentence was set outside the Guidelines range entails no presumption of unreasonableness. <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 714, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). Further, the 60-month sentence was well below the statutory maximum of 10 years, which is another indication it was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding the sentence was reasonable in part because it was below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">In light of the above, the record does not leave a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Fernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-13\">. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v.
