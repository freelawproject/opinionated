See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Lucero, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b589-29\">David Young appeals the district court\u2019s denial of the government\u2019s motion to strike his motion for sanctions as moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Exercis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ing jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The United States filed this civil forfeiture case in 2011 against the proceeds of an alleged money laundering scheme. Young intervened and asserted his rights to some of the assets. In a separate criminal case, Young pled guilty in December 2013 to money laundering and disclosure of procurement information. As part of his plea agreement, he agreed to forfeit property which was involved in the illegal conduct\u2014including the assets for which Young had asserted rights in the civil case. The civil case was closed in March 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In October 2015, Young filed a Rule 60(b) motion bearing the civil forfeiture case number, seeking to re-open the proceedings and the return of his property. Young then filed a \u201cRequest for Relief\u2019 in this civil case expressly seeking relief from \u201cthe Court\u2019s order granting forfeiture against him on October 14, 2014.\u201d Because the October 2014 order had been entered in the criminal case, and not the civil case, the district court directed the clerk to docket the motion in the criminal case. The district court also denied the Request for Relief as moot because it did not pertain to the instant civil case, but noted that the motion remained pending in the criminal case. The court stated that Young also \u201cmistakenly filed his initial [60(b)] motion for relief in this case, but the court instructed the Clerk\u2019s office to instead file the motion in his criminal case.\u201d Subsequently, Young filed a Rule 11 motion for sanctions against the United States. The motion bore the docket number for the civil case, but was filed in the criminal docket. The United States moved to strike the motion for sanctions in both the criminal and civil cases. The district court denied as moot the government\u2019s motion to strike in this civil case because Young\u2019s motion for sanctions did not appear on the civil docket. The court further held that \u201cthere are no orders in the instant case against any property involving Mr. Young, and nothing involving Mr. Young\u2019s rights was adjudicated in this action.\u201d Thus, the court denied Young\u2019s request that all filings be docketed in this case, and not in his criminal case, and instructed him \u201cto stop filing documents in this case because there is no relief available.\u201d Young timely appealed the order denying the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Construing his pro se filings liberally, see Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991), Young argues the district court improperly filed his motion for sanctions in the criminal case rather than the civil case, thereby effectively denying the relief requested as to the civil action. We review a district court\u2019s decisions regarding a motion for sanctions and a motion to strike for abuse of discretion. Hughes v. City of Fort Collins, 926 F.2d 986, 988 (10th Cir. 1991) (motion for sanctions); Fowler Bros. v. Young, 91 F.3d 1367, 1377 (10th Cir. 1996) (motion to strike).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But Young does not offer any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>argument contesting the district court\u2019s holding that his filings will not be received in the instant case because \u201cnothing involving Mr, Young\u2019s rights was adjudicated in this action.\u201d Thus, any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasoning for denying sanctions by refusing to file the motion in the civil case is waived. See Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 679 (10th Cir. 1998) (\u201cArguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of the government\u2019s motion to strike. The government\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal is DENIED. Because Young has failed to show the \u201cexistence of a reasoned, nonfriv-olous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised,\u201d Buchheit v. Green, 705 F.3d 1157, 1161 (10th Cir. 2012) (quotation omitted), his motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ANP\">. Young's opening brief primarily argues that the district court erred in refusing to consider his Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion. But his notice of appeal did not designate the November 9, 2015 order denying the Rule 60(b) motion as moot as the appealed order. Cf. Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). Nor did \"other papers filed within the time period for filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the notice of appeal provide\u201d notice that he sought to appeal that order. Denver &amp; Rio Grande W. R.R. Co. v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 119 F.3d 847, 849 (10th Cir. 1997). We thus lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s judgment as to Young\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 210, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (\"The rule is well settled that failure to file a timely notice of appeal defeats the jurisdiction of a court of appeals.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\">. The government argues the order denying the motion to strike was not a final, appeal-able order because it did not end the civil proceedings on the merits or otherwise terminate the case. For purposes of this appeal, we construe the denial of the motion to strike as a denial of Young\u2019s motion for sanctions. A Rule 11 motion may \"be made after the principal suit has been terminated.\u201d Cooler &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp\u201e 496 U.S. 384, 396, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the denial of a Rule 11 motion is appealable. See Hughes, 926 F.2d at 988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">. We note, however, that the district court\u2019s finding that Young \"mistakenly\u201d filed his motions in the civil proceeding was clearly erroneous. See Manning v. United States, 146 F.3d 808, 812 (10th Cir. 1998) (\"This court must accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is without factual support in the record or if the appellate court, after reviewing all of the evidence, is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted), Both Young\u2019s 60(b) motion and his motion for sanctions bore the civil case number and stated that they pertained to an \"action seeking forfeiture of several assets owned by David Young and other individuals who were his co-defendants in a criminal matter.\" His 60(b) motion further noted \u201d[t]he facts giving rise to the criminal case are identical to this [civil] matter.\u201d Contrary to the district court\u2019s finding, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that Young intended to direct his filings at the civil, and not the criminal, proceedings. A court may not direct filings to the wrong case docket, only to then deny relief because the filings do not appear in the correct case docket. Nevertheless, that the court improperly docketed Young\u2019s filings in the criminal case does not affect our holding that Young waived any challenge to the court\u2019s holding that his filings cannot be docketed in this civil case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
