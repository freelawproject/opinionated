DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Asylum may be granted to an applicant who is a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aml\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The burden of proof rests on the applicant to prove refugee status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). Accordingly, in order to establish \u201crefugee\u201d status, an applicant must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of any of the protected grounds, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that one of the protected grounds will cause future persecution. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The applicant\u2019s testimony, alone, may suffice to meet the applicant\u2019s burden, \u201cif the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant\u2019s testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). However, where the IJ \u201cdetermines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, \u201c[n]o court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence ... unless the court finds ... that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Ren failed to meet his burden of proving he was eligible for asylum because of insufficient corroborating evidence. First, the record does not compel a finding that Ren\u2019s testimony was sufficiently detailed and persuasive to establish his asylum claim without more corroborating evidence. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir. 2009) (explaining to reverse factual findings by the BIA, we \u201cmust find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it\u201d). Ren\u2019s testimony had a number of inconsistencies, and although these inconsistencies did not lead the IJ to make an adverse credibility determination, they support a finding that Ren\u2019s testimony alone was not sufficiently persuasive to meet his burden of proof without corroboration. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii); <em>see also Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Second, Ren failed to provide any evidence that would corroborate the alleged persecutory acts committed against him. While he makes a very general argument in -his brief on appeal before this Court that obtaining such evidence would have been difficult, he did not assert such an argument before the BIA, thus it is unex-hausted. <em>See Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the record does not compel a conclusion that Ren met his burden of showing past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Because Ren failed to meet his burden of showing that he suffered persecution, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Ren did not show that he has well-founded fear of- future persecution. Ren\u2019s uncorroborated testimony did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>establish that he in fact suffered the mistreatment he alleges, and the documentary-evidence does not compel a finding that Ren has an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Additionally, because Ren failed to meet the standard of proof for his asylum claim, he cannot meet the higher standard of proof for withholding of removal. <em>See Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cAn applicant who cannot meet the standard for asylum cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal\u201d). Thus, we deny the petition, in part, as to Ren\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Ren did not meet his burden of proving eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal because he failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support his claims. Further, because R\u00e9n failed to exhaust his CAT claim, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">. Ren failed to exhaust his arguments regarding his CAT claim. <em>See Indrawati v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>779 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir. 2015) (\u201cA .petitioner fails to exhaust [his] administrative remedies with respect to a particular claim when [he] does not raise that claim before the BIA.\u201d). While Ren made a passing reference to the denial of his CAT claim in his brief to the BIA, he did not provide any specific arguments to support the claim, or point out how the facts showed that he would be tortured if removed to China, <em>See id. </em>(stating while a petitioner is not required to \"use precise legal terminology\u201d or provide \"a well[-] developed argument to support [his] claim,\" he \"must have previously argued the 'core issue now on appeal\u2019 before the BIA,\" and that \"[u]nadorned, conclusory statements do not satisfy this requirement\u201d (quotations omitted)). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition, in part, as to Ren\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding we lack jurisdiction to review unexhausted claims); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) ([fjinal orders of removal are reviewable only if \"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-19\">. We review both the BIA's and IJ's decisions. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (explaining where the BIA expressly agrees with the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review both decisions to the extent of the agreement). We review conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>and review findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84. We must affirm the decision \"if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
