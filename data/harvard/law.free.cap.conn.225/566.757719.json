J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agz\">The issue in this case, on certification from the United States District Court, is whether the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 52-225a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>collateral source payments apply to a claim for underinsured motorist benefits. The plaintiff, Craig Smith, has underinsured motorist coverage <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under an automobile insurance policy issued to his parents by the defendant, Safeco Insurance Company of America. He sustained serious injuries in a multicar accident resulting from the negligent conduct of two underinsured drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The plaintiff filed a four count complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking to recover under the underinsured motorist provision of the policy issued by the defendant. In response, the defendant filed a number of affirmative defenses, including a defense alleging that \u201c[a]ny recovery is to be reduced by collateral source payments made on behalf of the plaintiff.\u201d The parties thereafter stipulated that counts two through four of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint should be dismissed with prejudice. With respect to the remaining first count, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>stipulated that the defendant was paying benefits to the plaintiff, under the underinsured motorist policy, in the amount of $444,140.21, and would pay the plaintiff an additional $66,178.70 \u201c[i]f the court holds that collateral source payments are not applicable to underinsured motorists claims . . . .\u201d The District Court then certified to this court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199a and Practice Book \u00a7 4168,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the question reserved by the stipulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that collateral source payments, under \u00a7 52-225a, apply to an underinsured motorist claim to reduce the amount of the claimant\u2019s award of damages but not to diminish the amount of the coverage afforded by the underinsured motorist insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We start with the text of \u00a7 52-225a (a), which provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[i]n any civil action, whether in tort or in contract, wherein the claimant seeks to recover damages resulting from (1) personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>injury or wrongful death . . . and wherein liability is admitted or is determined by the trier of fact and damages are awarded to compensate the claimant, the court shall reduce the amount of such award which represents economic damages . . . by [unreimbursed collateral source payments in accordance with subsections (b) and (c)].\u201d Collateral source payments are defined by General Statutes \u00a7 52-225b as payments made to a claimant pursuant to health or sickness insurance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The first issue raised by the certified question is whether \u00a7 52-225a applies directly to insurance contracts so as to reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to claimants who seek recourse to underinsured motorist benefits and who have received collateral source payments. Although \u00a7 52-225a applies to actions sounding in contract, as well as to actions sounding in tort, we hold that the statute does not reach that far. The statute defines the offset for collateral source payments as reducing awards for economic damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death. A claim concerning coverage under an insurance policy does not, in common parlance, give rise to an award for damages of any kind, let alone to an award for damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death. The words used in a statute must be given their commonly approved meaning, unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 628 n.7, 609 A.2d 998 (1992); <em>Cos Cob Volunteer Fire Co. No. 1, Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>212 Conn. 100, 105, 561 A.2d 429 (1989); <em>Martone </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>207 Conn. 296, 302, 541 A.2d 488 (1988). We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 52-225a does not, on its face, create a statutory offset against the coverage provided by underinsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>This construction of \u00a7 52-225a is supported by reading the statute conjointly with other legislative mandates specifically governing underinsured motorist insurance. We presume that the legislature intends to create a harmonious and consistent body of law for statutes relating to the same subject matter. See <em>Concerned, Citizens of Sterling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>215 Conn. 474, 482-83, 576 A.2d 510 (1990); <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 575, 522 A.2d 763 (1987). With respect to underinsured motorist claims, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 and the corresponding regulation, \u00a7 38a-334-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (formerly \u00a7 38-175a-6),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>only require automobile liability insurers to provide underinsured motorist insurance, but also limit the grounds upon which such insurance may be excluded or limited. Significantly, neither the underinsured motorist statute nor the regulation authorizes a reduction in underinsured motorist coverage because of the claimant\u2019s receipt of collateral source payments. Cf. <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 152, 156, 617 A.2d 454 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The second issue is whether, even if \u00a7 52-225a does not operate to reduce underinsured motorist coverage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>it may nonetheless affect a claimant\u2019s underinsured motorist recovery by reducing the amount of the damages that the claimant may collect. We hold that the statute authorizes such a reduction in the amount of compensable damages. Under the circumstances specified in \u00a7 52-225a, a personal injury claimant who recovers an award of economic damages from a tortfeasor must have the award reduced by the amount received as collateral source payments. Under \u00a7 38a-336, underinsured motorist coverage provides insurance protection for claimants who are legally entitled to recover damages from the owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury. The public policy of \u00a7 38a-336 is to give a personal injury claimant access to insurance protection to compensate for the damages that would have been recoverable if the underinsured motorist had maintained an adequate policy of liability insurance. <em>Bodner v. United Services Automobile Assn., </em>222 Conn. 480, 499, 610 A.2d 1212 (1992); <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982). Because underinsured motorist protection is not intended to provide a greater recovery than would have been available from the tortfeasor; <em>see Bodner v. United Services Automobile Assn., </em>supra; the statutory reduction mandated by \u00a7 52-225a operates as a limitation on the amount of damages that a claimant may recover through underinsured motorist insurance. Indeed, the plaintiff acknowledges, in his brief, that the underinsured motorist insurer is entitled to a credit for collateral source payments received by the claimant insofar as such payments reduce the amount that the claimant is legally entitled to recover from the tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The relationship between \u00a7 52-225a and underinsured motorist protection turns, therefore, on the distinction between the amount of coverage and the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>damages. A claimant is entitled to the full amount of his or her underinsured motorist coverage if, after the claimant\u2019s recovery from the tortfeasor has been reduced by collateral source payments in accordance with \u00a7 52-225a, the claimant\u2019s uncompensated personal and'economic damages exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. A claimant\u2019s recourse to his or her underinsured motorist coverage is, however, limited in amount to less than his or her full coverage if the amount of the award against the tortfeasor for personal and economic damages, reduced in accordance with \u00a7 52-225a, results in uncompensated damages that are less than the full amount of the underinsured insurance coverage. In other words, while \u00a7 52-225a does not authorize collateral source payments to be deducted from a claimant\u2019s available underinsured motorist coverage, it does authorize such payments to enter into the calculation of the claimant\u2019s compensable injuries and losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The question certified by the District Court asks \u201cAre collateral source payments under [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-225a applicable to underinsured motorist claims?\u201d Our answer is that such payments are applicable, in accordance with the statute, to determine the amount of damages but not to determine the amount of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-225a provides in relevant part: \u201creduction in ECONOMIC DAMAGES IN PERSONAL INJURY AND WRONGFUL DEATH ACTIONS FOR collateral source payments, (a) In any civil action, whether in tort or in contract, wherein the claimant seeks to recover damages resulting from (1) personal injury or wrongful death . . . and wherein liability is admitted or is determined by the trier of fact and damages are awarded to compensate the claimant, the court shall reduce the amount of such award which represents economic damages, as defined in subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 52-572h, by an amount equal to the total of amounts determined to have been paid under subsection (b) of this section less the total of amounts determined to have been paid under subsection (c) of this section, except that there shall be no reduction for (1) a collateral source for which a right of subrogation exists and (2) that amount of collateral sources equal to the reduction in the claimant\u2019s economic damages attributable to his percentage of negligence pursuant to section 52-572h.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-225b defines \u201ccollateral sources\u201d as follows: \u201cFor purposes of sections 52-225a to 52-225c, inclusive: \u2018Collateral sources\u2019 means any payments made to the claimant, or on his behalf, by or pursuant to: (1) Any health or sickness insurance, automobile accident insurance that provides health benefits, and any other similar insurance benefits, except life insurance benefits available to the claimant, whether purchased by him or provided by others; or (2) any contract or agreement of any group, organization, partnership or corporation to provide, pay for or reimburse the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>of hospital, medical, dental or other health care services. \u2018Collateral sources\u2019 do not include amounts received by a claimant as a settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (a) (1) defines \u201ceconomic damages\u201d as \u201ccompensation determined by the trier of fact for pecuniary losses including, but not limited to, the cost of reasonable and necessary medical care, rehabilitative services, custodial care and loss of earnings or earning capacity excluding [compensation for physical pain and suffering and mental and emotional suffering].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\"> The uninsured motorist coverage provided by the defendant includes coverage for injuries caused by an underinsured motorist. <em>Hotkowski </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>224 Conn. 145, 151, 617 A.2d 451 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\"> The first count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendant\u2019s refusal to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim for underinsured motorist insurance was a breach of the defendant\u2019s contractual obligation.
