The defendant lived in an apartment building on Clinton Avenue in Norwalk. The apartment building had its own parking lot for its tenants, and each tenant had an assigned parking space. The defendant owned a 1983 Camaro automobile that he parked in the space, and a 1979 Plymouth van that he parked at his mother\u2019s house. He took meticulous care of both vehicles and the parking space at his apartment building. He posted a no parking sign in front of the space, and he often swept the space, painted the lines on either side of the space, and clipped the shrubbery on a nearby fence. Prior to the crime, the defendant had repeatedly complained to the apartment building\u2019s superintendent about the unauthorized use of his parking space by the guests of other tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">At approximately 12:20 a.m., on June 21,1990, the defendant returned home to find that someone had parked in his space. The defendant parked his vehicle directly behind the automobile in his space so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>other automobile could not be moved. The defendant then went inside the building to his apartment. He called 911 to complain that someone had parked in his space but the police informed him that they could not tow the vehicle because it was parked on private property. He also telephoned a friend, Carol Bakinowski, to complain that someone had parked in his space and that he did not know what he would do if \u201csomeone comes to the door and starts abusing me.\u201d While they were speaking, Bakinowski could hear a loud banging noise in the background. The defendant told her that he was banging a knife on the kitchen table.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At approximately 2 a.m., the defendant saw from his window that the victim in this case, Philip Iacozza, had parked in his space, and had returned to his automobile and was trying to back out of the parking space. When the defendant saw the victim almost back the automobile into his vehicle, he took the knife and went down to the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">After a brief verbal exchange, the defendant repeatedly stabbed the victim in the head and torso. The defendant then returned to his apartment and called the police. When police officers arrived, he stated that \u201che couldn\u2019t take it any more, that he had done it, and that he was tired of people parking in his parking space.\u201d The defendant told the officers that they could find the knife with which he had stabbed the victim in the kitchen. The officers then found a blood-stained, eight inch knife in the kitchen sink.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The state charged the defendant in an information with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). The defendant at trial did not deny that he had caused Iacozza\u2019s death, but instead claimed that: (1) he did not have the intent to cause the death of Iacozza; (2) he was not guilty because of a mental disease or defect; and (3) he had acted under the influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of an extreme emotional disturbance. The jury returned a guilty verdict and the court rendered a judgment on the information. The defendant was then committed to the Whiting Forensic Institute, but later was transferred to the Somers correctional facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial because the evidence did not establish that he had the intent to cause the death of the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, the dispositive question is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, the trier of fact reasonably could have concluded, from the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 609, 595 A.2d 306 (1991) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>223 Conn. 127, 146, 613 A.2d 211 (1992). Although \u201cthe jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 507, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>219 Conn. 596, 604-605, 594 A.2d 459 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 678, 613 A.2d 788 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The defendant was charged with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. \u201c Tn order to be convicted under our murder statute, the defendant must possess the specific intent to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11) .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>214 Conn. 77, 82, 570 A.2d 203 (1990). Ordinarily, intent can only be proved by circumstantial evidence; it may be and usually is inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct. Id. Intent to cause death may be inferred from the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death. ... Id., 82-83 .... Furthermore, it is a permissible, albeit not a necessary or mandatory, inference that a defendant intended the natural consequences of his voluntary conduct. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>219 Conn. 16, 20, 592 A.2d 149 (1991).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>supra, 678-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">On the basis of the evidence and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had intended to kill the victim. The defendant had been angry because, upon returning home from work, he discovered a vehicle parked in his parking space. He blocked the victim\u2019s vehicle from leaving and watched the space from the window to see when the driver would return. While waiting, he repeatedly banged the murder weapon against his kitchen table. As soon as he saw the victim, he left his apartment, carrying an eight inch knife, and attacked the victim. He inflicted approximately fifteen stab wounds, most in vital areas of the body. Many of the wounds were deep and reached vital organs of the victim. In light of these facts, we conclude that there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the intent to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly-denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial because the evidence established the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Conflicting evidence was introduced at trial regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state both before and after the attack on the victim. Bakinowski testified that she had known the defendant for several years and that he had a history of reacting poorly to unexpected events. She also testified concerning the defendant\u2019s repeated concern about people parking in his space, and his meticulous care of the van and automobile. Finally, she testified that the defendant, prior to the time of the murder, had become increasingly depressed, and that, during the telephone conversation just prior to the attack, he had sounded desperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The defendant\u2019s mother testified that her son had had emotional problems for many years, and had been hospitalized on several occasions, including one instance following a suicide attempt. The defendant also elicited testimony from police officers that he had been agitated and upset when they arrived at his apartment shortly after the attack. The defendant also presented his medical records and the testimony of James R. Merikangas, a neurologist and psychiatrist, who had examined the defendant for trial. Merikangas testified that it was his diagnosis that, on June 21, 1990, the defendant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that, as a result, the defendant\u2019s thinking was illogical and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The state presented testimony, however, disputing the defendant\u2019s evidence as to his degree of emotional disturbance. John Sullivan, a psychiatrist, testified for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the state that, although the defendant had difficulty controlling his anger at times, there was nothing to indicate that the defendant had been psychotic or out of touch with reality. Several police officers testified that the defendant had not appeared to be agitated or shaking, and responded to questions calmly. Moreover, one police officer testified that the defendant did not appear to be \u201cat the end of his rope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Section 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part that \u201cit shall be an affirmative defense [to the crime of murder] that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\u201d Extreme emotional disturbance \u201cis a mitigating circumstance which will reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 731, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The burden is on the defendant to prove the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>223 Conn. 273, 280, 612 A.2d 45 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra. \u201cIn the final analysis, the ultimate determination of the presence or absence of extreme emotional disturbance [is] one of fact for the trier, aided by the expert testimony of both sides, but left to its own factual determinations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 383, 590 A.2d 408 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The state concedes that there was substantial evidence that the defendant acted under an extreme emotional disturbance. The defendant, on the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>also concedes that there was some evidence suggesting that he did not act under an extreme emotional disturbance. In light of these concessions, we rely on the fundamental role of the jury as the finder of fact. In a case in which the evidence is conflicting, it is the quintessential jury function to reject or accept certain evidence, and to believe or disbelieve any expert testimony. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>216 Conn. 139, 148, 578 A.2d 1066 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 395, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The defendant, relying on our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 604 A.2d 793 (1992), argues that these evidentiary standards do not apply because the evidence of his extreme emotional disturbance was \u201ctruly overwhelming.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>supra, 268, we stated that if the judge concludes that the verdict is \u201cso clearly against the weight of the evidence ... as to indicate that the jury did not correctly apply the law to the facts in evidence . . . or were governed by ignorance, prejudice, corruption or partiality, then it is his duty to set aside the verdict. ... In such a case, [a] verdict may be set aside even if the evidence was conflicting and there was direct evidence in favor of the party who prevailed with the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) (DNA evidence suggesting that it was physically impossible for defendant to have committed offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In the present case, the defendant has not demonstrated that the jury incorrectly applied the law to the facts or was governed by ignorance, prejudice, corruption or partiality. To the contrary, there were substantial facts from which the jury could have concluded that the defendant did not act under an extreme emotional disturbance. The jury heard testimony from the state\u2019s expert witness that the defendant was not psychotic and that he was not unreasonable in desiring not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>have anyone else park in his space. Furthermore, there was ample testimony that the defendant, immediately following the attack on the victim, was not in a state of extreme emotional disturbance but instead remained calm, called the police, and understood the import of his actions. From these facts, and the jury\u2019s right to reject any or all of the defendant\u2019s evidence, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. The trial court instructed the jury on extreme emotional disturbance, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cOur statute on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance insofar as it applies to this case provides that, \u2018in any prosecution for murder, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u201cI will now discuss with you the elements of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. There are three elements to this affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\u201cFirst; the defendant\u2019s emotional disturbance was not a mental disease or defect that rises to the level of the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect as that has been defined [for] you. That is, that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>not suffering from a mental disease or defect that caused him to lack substantial capacity as a result of that mental disease or defect either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act or to adjust his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u201cSecondly; that the defendant was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress that is more than mere annoyance or unhappiness. While this emotional stress might often be caused by a sudden triggering situation, hot blood as you say, it might as well arise by virtue of a significant mental trauma caused\u2014causing a long period of brooding or dwelling on some presumed injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u201cAnd thirdly; the defendant had an extreme emotional reaction to this state as a result of which there was a loss of self control and his reason was overborne by intense feelings, such as passion or anger or distress or grief, or excessive agitation or other similar emotions. You should give consideration as to whether the intensity of these feelings was such that the defendant\u2019s usual intellectual and emotional controls failed, and that his normal rational thinking no longer prevailed at the time of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u201cAs used in this affirmative defense, the word \u2018extreme\u2019 means the greatest degree of intensity away from the norm, away from the normal or usual state for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant acted under extreme emotional disturbance as I have defined that term for you, you must also find . . . that there was a reasonable explanation . . . for any emotional disturbance suffered by the defendant at the time of the stabbing. The reasonableness of this explanation or excuse is to be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The jury deliberated for more than four days. The jury asked for reinstruction on this affirmative defense on three separate occasions. The reinstructions were, for the most part, the same as the original instruction. After the second reinstruction, the court also stated: \u201cAnd here if the evidence and the claims of the defendant, as I understand it, is that the\u2014there was a trauma causing a long period of dwelling on presumed injustice with regard to the circumstances involving himself and involving his parking\u2014allotted parking space.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">After further deliberation, the jury sought reinstruction again on extreme emotional disturbance, requesting that the trial court focus on: (1) the three factors that make up the defense and whether all three must be met; (2) the definition of the \u201cnorm\u201d and whose norm is relevant, society\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s; and (3) the reasonable person\u2019s perspective. The trial court repeated its prior instructions and also stated that the reasonableness of the explanation for the emotional disturbance must be \u201cdetermined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person; that is, a person of ordinary intellect and faculties, who finds him\u2014who would find himself in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed it to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The defendant first argues that the charge on extreme emotional disturbance was improper because the jury was instructed that the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance was to be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. The defendant contends that the jury should be instructed that the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse must be determined from his perspective rather than a reasonable person\u2019s perspective. Additionally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>defendant argues that this instruction is improper in any case in which the defendant has also raised the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect because the jury is likely to become confused about the relationship between the affirmative defenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 652-53, 588 A.2d 127 (1991), we rejected a virtually identical challenge to such an instruction. In <em>Ortiz, </em>the defendant claimed that \u00a7 53a-54a (a) required an instruction that the jury must consider the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse as determined from the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>viewpoint rather than from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as he believed them to be. Relying on our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), we concluded that the legislature intended to establish \u201c \u2018a standard that is objective in its overview, but subjective as to the defendant\u2019s belief\u2019; id. [7]; and, with regard to the objective element contained in the statute, [we stated] that \u2018the reasonable man yardstick is only used to determine the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse of the action of the defendant from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We reasoned in <em>Ortiz </em>that the defendant\u2019s challenge to the instruction, as in the present case, would \u201ceviscerate the element of objectivity that the drafters intended to preserve,\u201d and would make the inquiry entirely subjective. Id., 657. We recently affirmed <em>Ortiz </em>in <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 385, 590 A.2d 408 (1991). In the present case, the defendant has not presented any significant justification for overruling <em>Ortiz </em>other than an unsupported claim that the standard is unworkable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[A] court should not overrule its earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>Services, 209 Conn. 429, 435-36, 551 A.2d 417 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The defendant also argues that the instruction was improper because it could not be understood in conjunction with the evidence relating to his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. This argument is unpersuasive. First, the trial court carefully instructed the jury that it was to consider the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance <em>only if </em>it had first rejected the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. Furthermore, the trial court specifically instructed the jury that the extreme emotional disturbance defense \u201cis different from the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect which I explained to you earlier. . . . [TJhat affirmative defense, the defense of disease or [mental] defect is a complete defense to criminal liability and if the defendant establishes it, results in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\u201d Finally, the trial court explained that, in order for the jury to conclude that the defendant had established the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, it must find, in addition to other elements, that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s emotional disturbance was not a mental disease or defect that rises to the level of the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect as that has been defined [for] you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>After a careful review of this charge, we conclude that the instructions adequately guided the jury as to the relationship between the two defenses and their separate elements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This not a case in which only a jury \u201ccomposed of [twelve] lawyers\u201d could have adequately understood the instructions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 422, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). Although the jury requested reinstruction several times on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, we are not obligated to infer from that fact that the jury was not given adequate guidance or that the charge ultimately could not be comprehended by laypersons. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>223 Conn. 41, 44-47, 612 A.2d 749 (1992) (instructions on extreme emotional disturbance provided adequate guide to jury despite jury\u2019s request for reinstruction on defense four times). In the present case, the \u201ctrial court\u2019s instructions and reinstructions were clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>comprehensible and sufficient to provide guidance to the jury in applying the law to the facts it [found] established.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on extreme emotional disturbance because it mischaracterized the defendant\u2019s evidence in relation to this affirmative defense. In the last set of reinstructions, the court stated: \u201cI believe the evidence . . . is that the defendant is claiming not that there was a sudden triggering situation that created this unusual or overwhelming stress, but that it was trauma, mental trauma, significant mental trauma causing a long period of brooding or dwelling on some presumed injustice, and the evidence is concerning this parking space.\u201d Specifically, the defendant argues that this instruction improperly suggested that the jury was free to consider only evidence of a long period of brooding and was not free to consider the evidence suggesting a sudden provocation based on the defendant\u2019s confrontation with the victim over the parking spot. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, we do not read this instruction as containing an order, explicit or implicit, to disregard the evidence relating to a sudden triggering event, such as the defendant\u2019s confrontation with the victim regarding the parking space. First, the trial court did not tell the jury that a sudden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>incident could not have provided an adequate basis for the defense. In fact, the trial court\u2019s earlier instructions and reinstructions specifically mentioned the possibility of a sudden triggering event. Second, the trial court stated that it was only its belief that the evidence supported a \u201clong period of brooding\u201d instead of a \u201csudden triggering situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Moreover, prior to this reinstruction, the trial court had instructed the jury as to its role as the finder of fact: \u201cIf during the course of this charge I refer to certain evidence or facts, my purpose is to [allude] to them only insofar as it is necessary to make clear to you, the application of the rules of law which are relevant in this case. When I do refer to certain facts or evidence, you are not [to] assume I mean to emphasize those facts or that evidence, nor must you limit your consideration only to them.

In the context of the entire instructions and reinstructions, the trial court\u2019s statement could not have misled a reasonable juror into concluding that a sudden triggering event was not relevant to the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>supra, 409. Finally, we are not convinced that the trial court mischaracterized the defendant\u2019s evidence. Virtually all the evidence introduced by the defendant, including his past psychological history and his long-running concern about his parking space, if believed, tended to demonstrate that the defendant suffered from \u201ca mental trauma causing a long period of brooding or dwelling on some presumed injustice.\u201d On the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the defendant offered minimal evidence on the actual confrontation between him and the victim in the parking lot. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance and properly characterized the defendant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that the absence of motive or premeditation may tend to raise a reasonable doubt as to his intent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. The trial court instructed the jury at length on motive and premeditation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court charged the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>it could consider the issue of motive but that the state did not need to prove motive in order for the jury to find the defendant guilty of the offense. The trial court explained that motive may or may not be helpful in considering evidence related to the issue of intent. The trial court, however, did not instruct the jury that the absence of motive or premeditation may tend to raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s intent. The defendant never filed a request for such a charge, but did, after the instructions were given, object to the instructions on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201c[I]f the evidence warrants it and if an accurate and timely request to charge is made, the trial court must instruct the jury that a lack of evidence on motive may tend to raise a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 790, 601 A.2d 521 (1992). If, however, the state introduces evidence tending to demonstrate a motive to commit the offense, then the trial court is not obligated to give such an instruction. Id., 790-92. In the present case, the defendant did not request this charge. Moreover, the state <em>and the defendant </em>introduced substantial evidence tending to demonstrate that the defendant attacked the victim because the victim had parked in the defendant\u2019s parking space. In the context of this case, that evidence tended to prove the defendant\u2019s motive for his conduct. Consequently, the trial court properly did not instruct the jury that the absence of motive or premeditation may tend to raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to exclude testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witness on cross-examination regarding the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol prior to the crime. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>In support of the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses of mental disease or defect and extreme emotional disturbance, Merikangas testified that, at the time of the attack, the defendant suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and that the attack would not have occurred but for the defendant\u2019s mental illness. Merikangas\u2019 testimony was based on a written report, portions of which he read aloud while testifying, that he had prepared in connection with his examination of the defendant. The written report stated, in a portion that Merikangas did not read aloud, that the defendant had consumed a six pack of beer and some wine prior to returning home on the evening of the attack. This portion of the report concluded that \u201cMr. Raguseo is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic . . . who under the stress of the circumstance felt threatened and because of a defect of mind and reason exacerbated by alcohol and diabetes was substantially incapable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">On cross-examination, the state questioned Merikangas about his reliance on the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and about the alcohol\u2019s effect on the defendant\u2019s actions. The defendant objected to this line of questioning but the trial court overruled that objection. The trial court cautioned the jury, however, that it was to consider Merikangas\u2019 testimony about the defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption, not as evidence that the defendant had in fact ingested alcohol that evening, but only to evaluate Merikangas\u2019 conclusions about the defendant\u2019s ability to control his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The defendant first argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling violated Practice Book \u00a7 760<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>concerned statements made by the defendant during the course of a mental examination. The defendant\u2019s argument, however, ignores \u00a7 760\u2019s preclusion of the evidence only on the issue of guilt. In this case, as the trial court specifically instructed the jury, the statement regarding the defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption was to be considered by the jury solely to evaluate the expert witness\u2019 opinion on the defendant\u2019s mental condition. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 362 n.13, 590 A.2d 408 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The defendant next argues that the statement should have been excluded because it was an answer to a hypothetical question that was based on facts not in evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he determination of the admissibility of a hypothetical question calls for the exercise of a sound discretion as to whether the question, even [if] it does not contain all of the facts in evidence, presents the facts in such a manner that they bear a true and fair relationship to each other and to the whole evidence in the case . . . is not so worded as to be likely to mislead or confuse the jury, and is not so lacking in the essential facts as to be without value in the decision of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 77, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986). The jury \u201cwas entitled to consider the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the testimony of the expert witness. . . . It might consider also the reasonableness of his judgments about the underlying facts and of the conclusions which he drew from them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>182 Conn. 603, 610, 438 A.2d 1149 (1981). Because the state\u2019s questions sought to elicit the bases of Merikangas\u2019 testimony, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly allowed the state\u2019s expert witness to testify to an opinion on the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">John Sullivan, a psychiatrist, testified for the state to rebut the defendant\u2019s assertion of the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. A defendant can prevail on that defense if he can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that, as a result of a mental disease or defect, the defendant <em>\u201clacked substantial capacity </em>. . . either to appreciate the wrongfulness' of his conduct or <em>to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a). On direct examination, the state asked Sullivan: \u201c[D]o you have an opinion stated in terms of reasonable medical certainty whether at the time of the stabbing on June 21,1990, the defendant had the ability to choose between alternative courses of action?\u201d Over the defendant\u2019s objection, Sullivan testified that, in his opinion, the defendant had the ability to choose between alternative courses of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The defendant claims that by allowing this testimony the trial court violated General Statutes \u00a7 54-86\u00cd.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tion 54-86\u00cd prohibits an expert witness from testifying as to whether a criminal defendant did or did not have the mental state that constitutes an element of the crime charged or a defense to that crime. Section 54-86\u00cd permits, however, an expert witness to state his diagnosis of the mental state or condition of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We have construed \u00a7 54-86\u00cd narrowly in accordance with our assumption that the legislature, in enacting the statute, intended a reasonable and rational result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>216 Conn. 139, 149, 578 A.2d 1066 (1990). <em>\u201cA </em>broad construction of the statute . . . would arguably bar experts from fully testifying to their diagnoses of a defendant and to their resulting professional opinions, from which the jury could infer the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of a particular act. Jurors would thus be left without adequate expert assistance in making an informed decision upon the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s mental state, the precise issue expressly reserved to them by \u00a7 54-86\u00cd. Additionally, a defendant\u2019s ability to prove affirmative defenses involving mental state would be severely curtailed. Consequently, we do not believe that the legislature intended to proscribe expert opinion testimony with respect to a defendant\u2019s mental state so strictly as to render it an ineffective aid to the jury, or to eclipse the role of expert opinion testimony in substantiating a defendant\u2019s claim to have suffered from a certain mental condition at the time of an act alleged to be criminal in nature.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Admittedly, Sullivan\u2019s testimony closely approximated the statutory language establishing the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. In light of our narrow reading of \u00a7 54-86\u00cd, however, we conclude that the testimony was proper. The expert witness was not asked to testify as to whether the defendant \u201clacked substantial capacity . . . to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a). In the absence of testimony explicitly tracking the language of \u00a7 53a-13, the expert witness was not testifying to the ultimate issue of criminal responsibility. To hold otherwise, as noted above, would handicap criminal defendants from offering expert testimony that would directly support their assertion of an affirmative defense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Furthermore, the jury was explicitly instructed that it was \u201centitled to accept or reject in whole or in part, the evidence of the experts as to whether the defendant had a mental disease or defect.\u201d The jury was also instructed that \u201cno matter what may be the expertise of a particular witness who states an opinion to you upon a fact in the case, that opinion is still subject to review at your hands. His opinion is [in] no way binding upon you.\u201d In light of our narrow construction of \u00a7 54-86\u00cd and the lack of any evidence that the jury did not follow these instructions, we conclude that the trial court did not violate \u00a7 54-86\u00cd in overruling the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>trial that was based on evidence obtained following the defendant\u2019s commitment to the Whiting Forensic Institute (Whiting). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Following the defendant\u2019s conviction, the defendant was committed to the Whiting. During that commitment the defendant underwent extensive psychological examination. Thereafter, the defendant petitioned the court for a new trial claiming that, in the course of these examinations, new evidence regarding a frontal lobe disorder was discovered that he claimed supported his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u201cThe standard that governs the granting of a petition for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is well established. The petitioner must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) the proffered evidence is newly discovered, such that it could not have been discovered earlier by the exercise of due diligence; (2) it would be material on a new trial; (3) it is not merely cumulative; and (4) it is likely to produce a different result in a new trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>202 Conn. 429, 434, 521 A.2d 578 (1987). \u201cIt is within the discretion of the trial court to determine, upon examination of all the evidence, whether the petitioner has established substantial grounds for a new trial, and the judgment of the trial court will be set aside on appeal only if it reflects a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.; <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>190 Conn. 667, 670, 461 A.2d 1380 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s petition but concluded that the evidence of the frontal lobe disorder was not newly discovered evidence and was cumulative of evidence presented at trial. The record clearly supports this conclusion. The defendant\u2019s expert witness, Merikangas, had testified at trial that tests \u201cindicated [an abnormality] in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>frontal lobes and the varietal occipital lobes .... In other words, there are areas of abnormality within the brain that are demonstrated by the MRI scan.\u201d Moreover, the defendant had offered extensive testimony concerning his psychological history and his mental condition prior to the attack. In light of this testimony, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the defendant had failed to demonstrate the existence of newly discovered evidence and that evidence gathered from the Whiting examination was not cumulative of the evidence introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

This clearly means the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>situation under the circumstances as the defendant perceived them to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Further support for taking the defendant\u2019s unique mental and emotional perspective into account when applying the extreme emotional disturbance defense can be found in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 8-10, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), which holds that the \u201cjury should be instructed that the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s act under an extreme emotional disturbance is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person <em>in the defendant\u2019s situation </em>under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 10. In <em>Elliott, </em>this court required analysis that focused on \u201cthe norm for that individual\u201d defendant, rather than a reasonable person, in applying the extreme emotional disturbance defense. Id. The phrase \u201cin the defendant\u2019s situation\u201d requires the jury to consider not only the factual situation in which the defendant found himself (the parking space conflict), but the defendant\u2019s unique mental and emotional characteristics and the impact of these factors on his perception of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Our extreme emotional disturbance defense, as provided in \u00a7 53a-54a (a), is based on the Model Penal Code of the American Law Institute, Tentative Draft No. 9, \u00a7 201.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>supra, 8. If there is any ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 53a-54a (a), the comments accompanying the Model Penal Code clarify that the jury must consider the defendant\u2019s situation in applying the defense. The important\u2014and necessary-terms are \u201csituation\u201d and \u201ccircumstances.\u201d As the Model Penal Code comments explain, \u201c[t]he word \u2018situation\u2019 is designedly ambiguous. On the one hand, it is clear that personal handicaps and some external circumstances must be taken into account. Thus, blindness, shock from traumatic injury, and extreme grief are all easily read into the term \u2018situation.\u2019 This result is sound, for it would be morally obtuse to appraise a crime for mitigation of punishment without reference to these factors. On the other hand, it is equally plain that idiosyncratic <em>moral </em>values are not part of the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) II A.L.I., Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1980) \u00a7 210.3 (1) (b), comment, p. 62. Thus, the drafters intended the word \u201csituation\u201d to focus the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s unique mental and emotional attributes, while still allowing the jury to determine whether a reasonable person would agree that the explanation or excuse for the defendant\u2019s emotional disturbance was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Additional support for this subjective/objective test can be found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>179 App. Div. 2d 245, 583 N.Y.S.2d 234 (1992), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Casassa, </em>49 N.Y.2d 668, 404 N.E.2d 1310, 427 N.Y.S.2d 769, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 842, 101 S. Ct. 122, 66 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1980). These cases are helpful because \u00a7 53a-54a (a) is virtually identical to New York Penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Law \u00a7 125.25 (1) (a), which sets forth the New York extreme emotional disturbance defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 654 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Although <em>Ortiz </em>purportedly relied on <em>People </em>v. <em>Casassa, </em>supra, to support the conclusion that the reasonableness of the explanation or excuse for the emotional disturbance was to be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s situation, <em>Casassa </em>clearly endorses a test that is both subjective and objective and incorporates the defendant\u2019s subjective, internal idiosyncracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In <em>Casassa, </em>the New York Court of Appeals held that \u201c[i]n light of . . . the necessity of articulating the defense in terms comprehensible to jurors, we conclude that the determination whether there was reasonable explanation or excuse for a particular emotional disturbance should be made by viewing the <em>subjective, internal situation </em>in which the defendant found himself and the external circumstances as he perceived them at that time, however inaccurate that perception may have been, and assessing from that standpoint whether the explanation or excuse for his emotional disturbance was reasonable, so as to entitle him to a reduction of the crime charged from murder in the second degree to manslaughter in the first degree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Following <em>Casassa, </em>the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>supra, 241, noted that the \u201c[application of the statute governing the availability of the defense of extreme emotional disturbance entails in each case an understanding of the situation as it would have been perceived, <em>not by a perfectly sensible individual </em>but by the particular defendant at bar.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court further stated that \u201c[i]t should be stressed that the issue in this case is not whether the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>act of killing his wife was a reasonable response under the circumstances for, clearly, it was not. Rather, the issue is the reasonableness of the explanation offered for the defendant\u2019s extreme emotional reaction.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In sum, the test for determining whether the extreme emotional disturbance defense should apply is both subjective, in that it permits the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s particular eccentricities, and objective, in that the jury is asked to determine whether the <em>explanation or excuse </em>for the defendant\u2019s disturbance was reasonable in light of his subjective situation and perception of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">I can understand why the jury had difficulty applying the court\u2019s instructions\u2014having been instructed on the extreme emotional disturbance defense four times\u2014to the substantial evidence indicating extreme emotional disturbance. On the third reinstruction, the jury asked the trial court to focus on whether the definition of \u201cnorm\u201d referred to the norm for the defendant or the norm for society. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury was obviously struggling to consider the defendant\u2019s emotional or mental imbalance in its determination of the defendant\u2019s situation. The court\u2019s use of the reasonable person standard, however, effectively precluded any consideration of the defendant\u2019s emotional or mental imbalance.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The facts of this case cried out for the application of the proper extreme emotional disturbance defense. In fact, the majority notes that there was \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence to support the defense. Surely, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>not reasonable for the defendant to have such a fetish about his parking space. Nevertheless, the defendant\u2019s unreasonable fetish for his parking space, his paranoid perceptions of abuse at work connected with his belief in entitlement to parking, his history of reacting poorly to unexpected events, his increasing depression as well as his history of emotional problems, his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and past attempts at suicide\u2014 none of which was reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable person, but all of which comprised the defendant\u2019s situation\u2014should have been considered by the jury. Since the jury was unable to consider these factors, there was no reasonable explanation or excuse for the defendant\u2019s emotional disturbance precipitating the attack, and the defense became a meaningless distraction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The mental state of the defendant presented serious issues that were underscored by a report on the defendant prepared subsequent to trial by the Whiting Forensic Institute, a state institution. The report was introduced into evidence in support of a new trial, the denial of which by the trial court I believe to have been an abuse of discretion. The report indicated that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, and that he suffered from paranoid delusions and delusions of persecution. The report further indicated that the frontal lobe of the defendant\u2019s brain was damaged, which contributed to his psychosis. The majority passes over this report by stating that the doctor called by the defense testified to these abnormalities at trial. The majority fails to mention, however, that the doctor\u2019s credibility was shattered by the state during cross-examination on the matter of the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol. The Whiting report, in contrast, was prepared by agents of the state and would have been objectively placed before the jury for their evaluation without the heavy baggage of partisan advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Because the conduct of a person who has taken the life of another can rarely, if ever, be characterized as reasonable from the viewpoint of a reasonable person, the majority takes the heart out of the extreme emotional disturbance defense by upholding the \u201creasonable person\u201d instruction. By adopting the extreme emotional disturbance defense, the legislature sought to bridge the gap between insanity and cold-blooded intent to kill. The majority\u2019s interpretation eliminates this bridge and forces the jury to choose one extreme or the other.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Accordingly, I would order a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\"> See footnote 2 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\"> Now codified as Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.3 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> The jury note requesting additional instructions from the court read as follows: \u201c[Ojnce again, we need the definition of extreme emotional disturbance focusing on (\u2018really stressing on\u2019) the following: (1) The three factors that make up the charge and whether or not all three must be met. (2) Definition of \u2018norm.\u2019 Whose \u2018norm\u2019 are we comparing the action/thought process to\u2014, the \u2018norm\u2019 for the defendant or the \u2018norm\u2019 for society? (3) Emphasize a \u2018reasonable\u2019 person\u2019s perspective. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-12\"> I also take issue with footnote 3 of the majority opinion, which criticizes the defendant for raising seven issues. None of the seven issues was frivolous. Moreover, the defendant should not be put in a position of picking and choosing just to satisfy an arbitrary limit. If there are seven issues that have merit and may affect the outcome of the appeal, they should be raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
