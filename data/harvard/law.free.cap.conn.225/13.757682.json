The plaintiff, Angelita Tolly, appealed to the Superior Court from a decision of the defendant, the department of human resources, revoking her family day care home registration. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the administrative appeal because the appeal lacked a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of dismissal in a per curiam decision; <em>Tolly </em>v. <em>Department of Human Resources, </em>26 Conn. App. 938, 600 A.2d 1390 (1992); deeming the issue controlled by its three prior decisions: <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>23 Conn. App. 188, 579 A.2d 583 (1990); <em>Senie </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>22 Conn. App. 253, 576 A.2d 1312 (1990); and <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>Department of Income Maintenance, </em>18 Conn. App. 13, 555 A.2d 1007 (1989). We granted certification to appeal on the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court correctly affirm the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing a petition for administrative appeal that was properly served on all necessary parties by United States certified mail as expressly permitted by Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1), for the stated reason that no citation form was appended to the petition?\u201d <em>Tolly </em>v. <em>Department of Human Resources, </em>221 Conn. 922, 608 A.2d 687 (1992). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The facts are undisputed. On December 7,1990, the defendant issued a final decision revoking the plaintiffs family day care home registration. On January 17, 1991, the plaintiff filed in the trial court an administrative appeal challenging the validity of that decision. The administrative appeal identified the plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the defendant, the specific judicial district and location of the court, the return date, and the date and nature of the decision from which the plaintiff appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It did not contain a citation, or any language approximating a citation. Attached to the appeal was a certification executed by the plaintiffs counsel indicating that she had served the appeal by certified mail on twelve named persons, including the commissioner of human resources and the attorney general. On January 31, 1991, the plaintiffs counsel filed an \u201cAffidavit Regarding Service of Administrative Appeal Dated Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ary 16,1991,\u201d indicating that she had mailed, by postage prepaid certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the appeal to the twelve named persons, and attaching their return receipts dated January 17,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">On February 20, 1991, the defendant moved to dismiss the appeal, asserting that \u201c[t]he court has no subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to include a citation in her appeal.\u201d The trial court granted the motion on the authority of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Senie </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>supra. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The plaintiff raises several claims on appeal, all of which, however, distill into the fundamental claim that proper service of an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) does not require a citation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Both the plaintiff and the defendant agree, as do we, that whether service of process by certified mail pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) requires a citation is a matter of statutory construction. Thus, it is not persuasive that, as the plaintiff suggests, Practice Book \u00a7 49 provides that the judicial department form for a summons in a civil action \u201cshall not be used in . . . [administrative appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor is it persuasive that, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>defendant points out, Practice Book \u00a7 256 provides that, \u201c[f]or purposes of these rules, administrative appeals are civil actions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u201cIn administrative appeals, the citation is the writ of summons that directs the sheriff or some other proper officer to seek out the defendant agency and to summon it to a particular sitting of a particular court on a specified day. 1E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 18. The citation, signed by competent authority, is the warrant which bestows upon the officer to whom it is given for service the power and authority to execute its command.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McQuillan </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>216 Conn. 667, 671, 583 A.2d 633 (1990); see also <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>217 Conn. 520, 525, 587 A.2d 99 (1991) (citation is command to duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>authorized officer to summon defendant to appear in court on specific day to answer complaint); <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 408, 413, 378 A.2d 519 (1977) (citation is direction to officer to summon agency whose decision is being appealed). A proper citation, therefore, requires not only the signature of a competent authority, such as a commissioner of the Superior Court, but the direction to a competent authority, such as a sheriff, constable or indifferent person, to summon the defendant to appear in court. 1 E. Stephenson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">With this background in mind, we turn to the question of whether \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) requires a citation. Considering the text of \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1), in the context of the statute as a whole, its purpose and its legislative history, we conclude that service of process pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) does not require a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Section 4-183 (c) (1) provides: \u201cService of the [administrative] appeal shall be made by (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer.\u201d There is nothing in this plain language that suggests the need for anything more than mailing copies of the appeal in the specified manner, as the plaintiff did in this case. The text does not, either directly or by way of implication, provide for a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Furthermore, reading the statute as a whole reinforces the conclusion that no citation is required for service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1), in contrast to service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (2). See footnote 1. Section 4-183 (c) provides, in general terms, that an administrative appeal must, within forty-five days of delivery of the final decision to the person appealing, be filed with the court, and served on the agency or the attorney general and on each party listed in the decision. It further provides that such service shall be made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>one of two alternative methods: \u201cby (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, or (2) personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Personal service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (2) requires, by clear implication, a citation commanding the \u201cproper officer or indifferent person\u201d to make service \u201cin the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions.\u201d \u201cThe citation that is used to commence an administrative appeal is analogous to the writ used to commence a civil action.\u201d <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>222 Conn. 541, 542 n.l, 610 A.2d 1260 (1992). The process of serving a complaint in an ordinary civil action requires the use of a writ of summons directed to a sheriff or other authority competent to make service of process. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-45a and 52-45b. Indeed, personal service by such an authority without a writ of summons has long been regarded as a nullity, because without such a writ the sheriff is no more than a delivery person. <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>supra, 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The service required by \u00a7 4-183 (c) (2) stands in marked contrast to service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1), which specifically provides that service by certified or registered mail may be \u201cwithout the use of a sheriff or other officer.\u201d That contrast underscores the difference between service made pursuant to the two different statutory methods. Whereas service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (2) requires an authority competent to make service and, therefore, a citation, service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1), by specifically eliminating the intervention of a \u201csheriff or other officer\u201d for purposes of service, also eliminates the necessity of a citation. Indeed, because a citation requires, not only a competent signing authority, but a command by that signing author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ity <em>to a competent serving authority, </em>and because under \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) no \u201csheriff or other officer\u201d is required, it is difficult to conceive what the language of a proper citation would be under \u00a7 4-183 (c) (l).* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Absent a \u201csheriff or other officer\u201d to receive such a command, a citation would be meaningless. We do not ascribe to the legislature the intent to require the performance of a meaningless act. See, e.g., <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>169 Conn. 613, 621, 363 A.2d 1038 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The conclusion that \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) does not require a citation is buttressed by reference to \u00a7 4-183 (d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That subsection provides that a record of proper service be timely filed with the clerk of the court in either of two ways: (1) by the filing of \u201cthe sheriffs return\u201d; or (2) by the appellant\u2019s filing \u201can affidavit . . . stating the date and manner in which a copy of the appeal was served on each party and on the agency that rendered the final decision . . . .\u201d This latter method of evidencing service of process indicates a legislative awareness that, as in this case, there are instances in which no serving officer, and therefore no citation, is necessary because the appealing party herself effected service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The legislative history of \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) further supports our conclusion. As originally enacted in 1971, \u00a7 4-183 (b) simply provided that \u201c[c]opies of the petition [for review] shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record.\u201d Public Acts 1971, No. 854, \u00a7 18. In 1977, this subsection was amended to provide that the petition for review \u201cshall be served upon the agency and all parties of record <em>in the same manner as process is served in civil actions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1977, No. 77-603, \u00a7 1. Under that provision, the statute plainly required service by a sheriff or other proper authority and, therefore, a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In 1979, the legislature further amended \u00a7 4-183 (b) by eliminating the language, \u201cin the same manner as process is served in civil actions,\u201d and by adding a method of service on the agency by certified or registered mail. Public Acts 1979, No. 79-163. As a result of that legislation, subsection (b) provided in part: \u201cCopies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after mailing of such notice or, if a rehearing is requested, thirty days after the decision thereon, <em>except that service upon an agency may be made by mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 4-183 (b). Accordingly, service of process on the agency, but not on other parties to the appeal, was then permissible by certified or registered mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In 1984, however, the legislature further amended \u00a7 4-183 (b) specifically to provide that the certified or registered mail could be \u201cwithout the use of a sheriff or other officer.\u201d Public Acts 1984, No. 84-43, \u00a7 1. After that amendment, therefore, subsection (b) provided in part: \u201cCopies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>mailing of such notice [of the final decision] or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, <em>without the use of a sheriff or other officer, </em>to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-183 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The legislative history of this amendment makes clear that it was proposed and adopted in response to a decision of the Appellate Session of the Superior Court; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 712, 461 A.2d 977 (1983); that apparently was understood to hold that even the registered or certified mail service provided by the 1979 legislation required the intervention of a sheriff or other officer. In testimony before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary, Attorney Raphael L. Podolsky explained that House Bill No. 5595, which later became the 1979 public act, was intended (1) to eliminate the need for a sheriff and a citation when service by registered or certified mail was being made on the agency, and (2) to clarify that this had been the original intent of the 1979 legislation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This explanation was echoed on the floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of the legislature.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These explanations of legislative intent are, moreover, fully consistent with the language of the 1984 statutory amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 4-183 (b) remained the same until 1988. By virtue of Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, \u00a723, \u00a74-183 was amended to provide for the two alternative forms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>service now contained in \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1) and (2). See footnote 1. Significantly, that amendment did not alter the preexisting provision regarding service by certified or registered mail \u201cwithout the use of a sheriff or other officer,\u201d except to eliminate the previous limitation thereon to service by mail on the agency. Therefore, since 1988 mail service pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1), without the necessity of a sheriff or citation, has been permissible with respect to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The defendant argues that the service of process in this case was fatally flawed, nonetheless, because, although the petition referred to a return day, it contained no specific language ordering the defendant <em>to appear </em>on or before the second day after the return day. Therefore, the defendant contends that: (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this statutory appeal; or (2) in the alternative, this defect deprived the court of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Consequently, the defendant argues, its timely motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 142<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> warranted dismissal on that basis. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Prior to the 1988 amendment to the UAPA, under the case law regarding administrative appeals\u2014at least those appeals served by a sheriff, and not by certified mail\u2014the defendant might have prevailed on this argument. See, e.g., <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356-57, 514 A.2d 749 (1986) (use of improper citation form to commence administrative appeal not fatal to appeal, so long as form gives notice, inter alia, of return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>day and of \u201cthe requirement for filing an appearance\u201d). We are convinced, however, that the 1988 amendment to the UAPA requires a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In 1988, the legislature enacted a comprehensive revision of the UAPA, based upon recommendations made after nearly three years of study and review by the Connecticut law revision commission. See 31 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21,1988 Sess., p. 7320, remarks of Representative Martin Looney; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., p. 185, remarks of David Biklen, executive director of the Connecticut law revision commission; 1987 Thirteenth Annual Report of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission to the General Assembly, March, 1988, p. 31 (Law Revision Commission Report). One of the proposals of the law revision commission involved service of an appeal under \u00a7 4-183. That proposal, with minor changes, became what is now \u00a7 4-183 (c) and (d). See footnote 1; Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, \u00a7 23; Law Revision Commission Report, supra, p. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Section 4-183 (c) provides, in pertinent part, that the party appealing must, within forty-five days of delivery of the agency decision, \u201cserve a copy of the appeal\u201d on the agency at its office or the office of the attorney general. It also provides: \u201cWithin that [forty-five day] time [period], the person appealing shall also serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in the decision, <em>provided failure to make such service within forty-five days on parties other than the agency that rendered the final decision shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. </em>Service of the appeal shall be made by (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, or (2) personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>civil actions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 4-183 (d) provides in pertinent part: <em>\u201cIf the failure to make service causes prejudice to any party to the appeal or to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">These two provisions, emphasized above, appear to conflict with respect to the effect of a failure to make service on the agency. The language of \u00a7 4-183 (c), that a \u201cfailure to make such service within forty-five days on parties other than the agency . . . shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal,\u201d implies that a failure to make such service <em>on the agency will </em>deprive the court of \u201cjurisdiction over the appeal,\u201d namely, subject matter jurisdiction. This principle would be consistent with the long-standing, preexisting law that, \u201c[b]ecause the right to take an administrative appeal depends upon statutory authority . . . noncompliance with the statutory requirements of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act implicates subject matter jurisdiction and renders a nonconforming appeal subject to dismissal. <em>Tarnopol v. Connecticut Siting Council, </em>212 Conn. 157, 163, 561 A.2d 931 (1989); <em>Hillcroft Partners </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>205 Conn. 324, 326-27, 533 A.2d 852 (1987); <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>[supra, 356]; <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>197 Conn. 320, 324, 497 A.2d 48 (1985).\u201d <em>McQuillan </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The text of \u00a7 4-183 (d) provides, however, that \u201c[i]f the failure to make service causes prejudice ... to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal.\u201d This language provides that even a timely motion to dismiss will not automatically lead to dismissal; dismissal follows only if the court, after hearing, finds that prejudice resulted from the failure to make service. Section 4-183 (d) implies, therefore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>such a failure is not a matter of subject matter jurisdiction, because dismissal based only on a finding of prejudice is inconsistent with the established notion that lack of subject matter jurisdiction requires dismissal, regardless of such factors as prejudice, waiver or consent. See, e.g., <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>197 Conn. 34, 39, 495 A.2d 1034 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Statutes should be read so as to harmonize with each other, and not to conflict with each other. See, e.g., <em>Red Rooster </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 570, 620 A.2d 118 (1993). We resolve the apparent conflict between \u00a7 4-183 (c) and (d) by focusing on the language in \u00a7 4-183 (c) requiring service on the agency \u201c[wjithin forty-five days.\u201d We read that sentence as imposing a time limitation with respect to subject matter jurisdiction. If there is no service at all on the agency within the forty-five day period, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal by virtue of the clear implication of the language in \u00a7 4-183 (c), read against the background of the preexisting law. This reading of \u00a7 4-183 (c) is consistent with the recognition that \u201c[tjime limitations for taking appeals do not exist merely for the convenience of the parties but involve a strong public interest in the finality of legal proceedings. For this reason they have generally been regarded as jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 208, 440 A.2d 286 (1982) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">If, however, as in this case, there is an arguable defect in the process that was timely served on the agency\u2014 namely, a lack of specific language in the appeal directing the defendant to file an appearance on or before the second day after the return day\u2014rather than a failure to make service at all within the applicable time period, the court does not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. Under those circumstances, \u00a7 4-183 (d) applies, and the appeal is dismissable only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>upon a finding of prejudice to the agency. In this case, the defendant does not claim any prejudice, and it would be difficult to perceive any, because presumably the attorney general knew the significance of a return day stated on an administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The conclusion that the subject matter jurisdiction of the court is implicated only if there is a total failure to serve the agency within the statutory forty-five day period, and not if there is merely a defect in the document timely served on the agency, is also consistent with our established jurisprudence regarding subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 709, 579 A.2d 1 (1990), quoting <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 285, 288, 439 A.2d 997 (1981).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). The determination of whether a statutory requirement implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the court \u201cmust be informed by the established principle that every presumption is to be indulged in favor of jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. That presumption counsels that, in resolving the apparent conflict between \u00a7 4-183 (c) and (d), we construe the subject matter jurisdictional implications of \u00a7 4-183 (c) narrowly. See <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>supra (improperly executed citation does not affect subject matter jurisdiction of court).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The legislative history of No. 88-317 of the 1988 Public Acts supports this interpretation.

Those cases are not dispositive. First, in none of those cases was service made by certified mail pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c) (1). In all of those cases, service was made by a sheriff or other officer, who required a citation for his authority to make service. Second, in none of those cases were we interpreting \u00a7 4-183 (c) and (d), in the light of the comprehensive revision of the UAPA enacted by the legislature in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to that court with direction to deny the motion to dismiss, and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 provides in relevant part: \u201cAPPEAL TO supeBIOE COUET.

We do not believe, however, that by amending \u00a7 4-183 to eliminate the necessity of service by a \u201csheriff or other officer\u201d; see infra; the legislature intended nevertheless to retain such a slender remnant of the prior practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b43-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (d) provides: \u201cThe person appealing, not later than fifteen days after filing the appeal, shall file or cause to be filed with the clerk of the court an affidavit, or the sheriffs return, stating the date and manner in which a copy of the appeal was served on each party and on the agency that rendered the final decision, and, if service was not made on a party, the reason for failure to make service. If the failure to make service causes prejudice to any party to the appeal or to the agency, the court, after hearing, may dismiss the appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\"> Attorney Raphael L. Podolsky testified: \u201cThe third one I want to address is House Bill No. 5595 which is an act concerning the service of process in appeals of administrative agency decisions. This is a bill basically to correct what I believe to be an erroneous appellate session decision, interpreting a statute you passed in 1979 to accomplish a particular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u201cPrior to 1977, there were different procedures for taking appeals from different administrative agencies, and some of them when you took the appeal, you could serve the agency by mail. You basically sent [a] certified letter to the commissioner. In others, you have to have the sheriff serve. In 1977, the General Assembly attempted to make these procedures uniform and the law that they passed required sheriff service in all cases. It wasn\u2019t really noticed at the time that this changed the process, for example, serving welfare appeals. In 1979, the legislature looked at that and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>decided it had made the wrong decision. That is to say, the simpler and more efficient way was that when you\u2019re serving the agency you could serve the agency by certified mail, and you do it yourself, you don\u2019t have to pay sheriff fees for that. And the bill was adopted and that\u2019s basically what it says. If you examine the legislative history from 1979, there is no question that the intention was to dispense with the sheriff in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u201cThere are at least two superior court cases that I know of in which that interpretation was confirmed. In 1983 in the case of <em>Board of Education of the City of New Britain </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Education, </em>which is reported at 38 Conn. Supp. 712, [461 A.2d 997 (1983),] the appellate session without looking at the legislative history, ruled that the legislature could not possibly have intended to dispense with the sheriff, and thereby interpreted the statute to require that there be a citation and that the sheriff do the service. What this bill does, it restates the 1979 statute. The problem with doing nothing is it has created a great deal of confusion for administrative appeals. Because many people took administrative appeals without citing in the sheriff. Without putting a citation to the sheriff, so what\u2019s happened is, they have been faced with jurisdictional motions under the 1983 appellate case saying that they do not have the right to bring the appeal because they failed to serve the process properly and of course, at this point in time, the limit for taking the appeal is passed and it\u2019s too late to correct the mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u201cAnd it seems to me that what the legislature ought to do is treat this as a clarification of reassertion that from 1979 on, what this statute did, was to mean you don\u2019t need the sheriff for that purpose.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., pp. 396-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b46-12\"> In the Senate, Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr., stated: \u201cIt would make it clear that a sheriff or other officer is not needed to serve process on an agency in an appeal from an administrative decision. There apparently has been a court decision that has thrown into question some prior action of the legislation, so it is really clarifying what the intention was of that particular piece of legislation.\u201d 27 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1984 Sess., p. 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">In the House of Representatives, Representative Richard D. Tulisano stated: \u201c[T]he purpose of this legislation is to make it clear and acknowledge that service of process does not have to be by sheriff of an appeal from an administrative agency.\u201d 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2,1984 Sess., p. 722.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 142 provides: \u201cmotion to dismiss</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201cAny defendant, wishing to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction, may do so even after having entered a general appearance, but must do so by filing a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance. Except in summary process matters, the motion shall be placed on the short calendar to be held not less than fifteen days following the filing of the motion, unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b52-4\"> Before the Joint Standing Committee on the Judiciary, David Biklen, executive director of the law revision commission, stated: \u201cLet me just give you a couple of examples of problems that these amendments attempt to address in the UAPA. . . . [Wje\u2019ve worked on the service in [sic] filing requirements on appeal, an example of that on a state agency level the set of problems that you are now wrestling with on a local level, whereby a local and zoning appeal was dismissed for-failure to [serve] each person in that appeal. At least on the state level this act would avoid that sort of problem.\" Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., p. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Steve Frazzini, the executive director of the Hartford County Legal Aid Society, and a member of the advisory gro\u00fcp that worked with the law revision commission on the proposed revision of the UAPA, also testified before the Judiciary Committee: \u201cThose of this committee who are lawyers . . . know that the current laws . . . about appealing Administrative Agency decisions are a trap for the unwary. . . . Basically, the courts have taken the position that there\u2019s no right to appeal from Administrative Agency decisions except by statute and if the statute isn\u2019t followed in every detail, then you\u2019re thrown out of court.... The problem is that the present statute is very hard to follow .... I think it\u2019s really unfair that the appeal process is so difficult to understand and to comply with. What this bill does is it makes . . . things simpler. . . . [TJhe number of cases where appeals have been dismissed because some supposedly vital party, not the agency, but someone else [was] not served are also far too frequent. What this bill says is that if you serve the agency on time, then the authority to serve anybody else who\u2019s concerned at the time isn\u2019t critical as long as you do serve them and as long as that party isn\u2019t prejudiced by your serving them late. ... So that\u2019s the most important thing that . . . makes what you do to appeal [an] agency decision simpler and fairer.\u201d Conn. Joint Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., pp. 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">This line of criticism of our prior jurisprudence echoes that of Justice David Shea of this court: \u201cI believe this court took the wrong course many years ago when we began to treat virtually every deviation from the statutory norm as a defect that deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction and thus to be unwaivable by the parties or subject to such considerations as lack of prejudice that are applied in other proceedings. We have been traveling down this path for too long, however, to turn back at this late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>time without some legislative direction.... Consequently, much as I deplore the jurisprudential path we have taken, I am constrained to continue upon it until such time as we may be directed otherwise by legislative authority.\u201d <em>Andrew Ansaldi Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>207 Conn. 67, 75-76, 540 A.2d 59 (1988) <em>(Shea, J., </em>concurring); see <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 207-11, 440 A.2d 286 (1982) <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). We believe that, by enacting General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c) and (d), the legislature intended to heed these pleas for greater simplicity and fairness in the administrative appeal process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
