We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court in Docket No. 14460 and direct the trial court to issue an articulation in Docket No. 14459.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>These appeals arise from two separate actions. <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters </em>(Docket No. 14460) (the <em>PaineWebber </em>action) is a breach of contract action brought by PaineWebber, Inc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (PaineWebber), against Geoffrey Winters, a former PaineWebber employee, for Winters\u2019 refusal to repay a loan made to him by PaineWebber during his employment. Winters thereafter asserted twelve counterclaims against PaineWebber. PaineWebber filed a timely offer of judgment, offering to settle its breach of contract claim for $295,000. Winters neither responded to this offer nor filed an offer of judgment on his counterclaims. After a jury trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on May 15, 1989, the trial court rendered two separate judgments: for PaineWebber on the breach of contract claim in the amount of $440,000; and for Winters on five of the counterclaims,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the amount of $440,000.18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> PaineWebber then unsuccessfully moved to set aside the judgment in favor of Winters and for interest on the judgment in favor of PaineWebber pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 52-192a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>PaineWebber appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had improperly denied its motion for interest. <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>22 Conn. App. 640, 579 A.2d 545 (1990). Without disturbing the jury verdicts, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of PaineWebber\u2019s motion for interest and directed the trial court to award interest, the amount of which was approximately $245,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 656. Winters unsuccessfully sought certification to appeal to this court from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the Appellate Court\u2019s decision. <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>216 Conn. 820, 581 A.2d 1055 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Within twenty-four hours of issuance of the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment awarding PaineWebber interest on the judgment in its favor, PaineWebber filed in the trial court both a complaint for setoff of the judgments pursuant to \u00a7 52-141 and a motion for equitable setoff. The trial court denied the setoff, determining that (1) PaineWebber had filed its complaint for setoff more than twenty-four hours after final judgment, in violation of the requirements of \u00a7 52-141,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (2) PaineWebber was not entitled on equitable grounds to a setoff of the judgments. PaineWebber appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed. <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>26 Conn. App. 322, 600 A.2d 1048 (1991). We subsequently granted PaineWebber\u2019s petition for certification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winters </em>(Docket No. 14459) (the foreclosure action) is an action seeking to foreclose Winters\u2019 interest in property in Greenwich. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> PaineWebber was one of the defendants in the foreclosure action because, during the <em>PaineWebber </em>litigation, PaineWebber had secured a prejudgment attachment on this property,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> becoming the third most senior encumbrancer. After a foreclosure sale that yielded $1.1 million, the trial court ordered distribution of the proceeds to the two most senior encumbrancers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The trial court, in the foreclosure action, thereafter granted an equitable setoff of the <em>PaineWebber </em>judgments, the effect of which was to reduce the amount owed by Winters to PaineWebber from approximately $685,000, the amount of its judgment plus interest, to approximately $245,000, the amount of interest. The trial court then denied PaineWebber\u2019s motion to stay proceedings pending its appeal from the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>denial of setoff in the <em>PaineWebber </em>action. After reserving for PaineWebber a portion of the remaining foreclosure sale proceeds in order to protect PaineWebber\u2019s right to interest,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> pending this court\u2019s decision on Winters\u2019 petition for certification from the Appellate Court\u2019s award of interest in the <em>PaineWebber </em>action, the trial court ordered distribution to the fourth and fifth most senior encumbrancers, Weatherly Securities, a mortgagee, and Union Trust Company, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">PaineWebber appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s distribution order and denial of its motion for a stay, and the Appellate Court affirmed. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>26 Conn. App. 317, 600 A.2d 1046 (1991). We subsequently granted PaineWebber\u2019s petition for certification.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In these appeals, PaineWebber raises several claims seeking to achieve consistent decisions regarding setoff in the two actions. PaineWebber argues that, if the trial court\u2019s decisions regarding setoff are affirmed, PaineWebber will be obligated to pay $440,000.18, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>full judgment rendered against it in the <em>PaineWebber </em>action, even though its security in the foreclosure proceeds has been reduced to $260,000, which the trial court reserved to protect PaineWebber\u2019s right to interest on the <em>PaineWebber </em>judgment rendered in its favor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, in the <em>PaineWebber </em>case, PaineWebber claims that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s determinations that: (1) PaineWebber was not entitled to a setoff of the judgments on equitable grounds;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (2) PaineWebber had untimely filed its complaint for setoff. In the foreclosure action, PaineWebber claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s affirmance of the trial court\u2019s equitable setoff yields an unjust result and has caused extreme prejudice to PaineWebber.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The <em>PaineWebber </em>Action</p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">PaineWebber claims that its complaint for setoff was timely filed within twenty-four hours of the Appellate Court\u2019s August, 1990 judgment, in compliance with the requirement of \u00a7 52-141 that a complaint for setoff be filed within twenty-four hours of \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d PaineWebber contends, therefore, that the trial court improperly concluded that the complaint was untimely. Winters claims, on the other hand, that, to comply with \u00a7 52-141, PaineWebber was required to file its complaint within twenty-four hours of the trial court\u2019s May, 1989 judgment, and that, accordingly, PaineWebber\u2019s complaint, filed in August, 1990, was untimely. We agree with Winters that \u00a7 52-141 required PaineWebber to file its complaint for setoff within twenty-four hours of the trial court judgment, notwithstanding the subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 52-141, a defendant against whom a tort judgment has been rendered may request a court to set off that judgment against a debt owed to the defendant by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section 52-141 (b) (4) requires, however, that the complaint for setoff be filed within twenty-four hours of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d on the tort claim. The issue, therefore, is whether PaineWebber complied with the twenty-four hour filing require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ment, and this inquiry turns on whether the trial court judgment was the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4). This question is an issue of first impression in this state.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In our determination of the meaning of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the context of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4), we consider, at the outset, whether that term is ambiguous. Ordinarily, if statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for statutory construction. <em>Mercado </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>222 Conn. 69, 74, 607 A.2d 1142 (1992); <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>221 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Conn. 256, 260, 603 A.2d 399 (1992). If statutory language is ambiguous, however, the court must construe it in accordance with the statute\u2019s background and purpose, as well as with common sense. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 512-13, 613 A.2d 748 (1992); <em>Warkentin </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>223 Conn. 14, 20, 610 A.2d 1287 (1992); <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 102, 596 A.2d 374 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We are persuaded that the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d language of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4) is ambiguous. Our case law has repeatedly recognized that the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d may have different meanings in different contexts. \u201c[T]he effect of a pending appeal upon an otherwise final judgment has aptly been characterized as \u2018[o]ne of the most troublesome problems in applying the rule of finality [of judgments],\u2019 because this is an area in which \u2018[t]here are no technically precise and universally recognized rules . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Preisner v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>203 Conn. 407, 413-14, 525 A.2d 83 (1987), quoting F. James &amp; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1985) \u00a7 11.4, p. 592. \u201c[W]e have recognized that the relationship between a pending appeal and a judgment depends upon the nature of the issue that is to be addressed. Accordingly, a trial court judgment has been held to be final, despite a pending appeal, insofar as the issue was the triggering of the statute of limitations . . . the continuing validity of interlocutory alimony orders ... or the applicability of the rules of res judicata.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 414; see <em>Capalbo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>208 Conn. 480, 486, 547 A.2d 528 (1988). Finally, we note that \u00a7 52-141 itself does not define \u201cfinal judgment\u201d or otherwise give guidance as to its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">We must, therefore, construe the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4). In determining its meaning, we are guided by the rule announced in <em>Paranteau </em>v. <em>DeVita, </em>208 Conn. 515, 522-23, 544 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>634 (1988), that, for the purpose of appealability, a trial court judgment on the merits is the final judgment, notwithstanding the pendency of a postjudgment claim for attorney\u2019s fees. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-263.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In <em>Paranteau, </em>we held that a bright-line rule as to when an appeal must be taken is preferable to a retrospective consideration of whether a postjudgment claim is so integral to the judgment on the merits that that judgment is not appealable until the postjudgment claim has been decided. We noted that such a bright-line rule would promote certainty and efficiency. <em>Paranteau </em>v. <em>DeVita, </em>supra, 522-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Similarly, in cases involving \u00a7 52-141, it would be inappropriate for the timeliness of a complaint for setoff to depend upon a retrospective, artificial determination of the finality of the trial court judgment. Such a case-by-case approach would create uncertainty and confusion regarding both the procedural obligations of the litigants and the financial outcome in a case in which the defendant seeks to set off a tort judgment rendered against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">For the same reasons that we find the reasoning of <em>Paranteau </em>persuasive in this context, we decline to rely on <em>Preisner </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, in our determination of the meaning of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4). In <em>Preisner,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we enunciated a test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>for determining if a trial court judgment is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d despite a subsequent appeal: \u201cIf the trial court\u2019s judgment is sustained [on appeal], or the appeal dismissed, the final judgment ordinarily is that of the trial court. If, however, there is reversible error, the final judgment is that of the appellate court.\u201d Id., 415. \u201cThe finality of a judgment may, [therefore], depend upon the outcome of the pending appeal.\u201d Id. This test is not useful in determining the meaning of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the context of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4), however, because the parties would not know until the outcome of an appeal whether the trial court judgment or the appellate court judgment was properly considered the \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s judgment was the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4) is bolstered by the fact that construing that term to refer to the judgment rendered on appeal, as PaineWebber urges, would result in an unworkable intersection of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4) and Practice Book \u00a7 4009,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which requires an appeal from a final judgment to be filed within twenty days of the issuance of notice of that judgment. For example, upon a trial court\u2019s tort judgment in favor of the plaintiff, a defendant seeking to set off the judgment against a debt owed by the plaintiff to the defendant will not necessarily know within twenty-four hours if the plaintiff will appeal from the judgment. Moreover, until twenty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>have passed, the defendant itself will not necessarily have decided, and is not required to have decided, whether to appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">According to PaineWebber\u2019s reading of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4), therefore, the parties would know whether the trial court judgment was the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d only upon expiration of the twenty day appeal period. That statute, however, contemplates that the finality of the judgment will be known within twenty-four hours of its rendering. We, therefore, reject PaineWebber\u2019s construction, which would create an unpredictable and thereby unworkable rule. Cf. <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 649-51, 600 A.2d 1 (1991); <em>Turner v. </em>Turner, 219 Conn. 703, 712-13, 595 A.2d 297 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s May, 1989 judgments on the merits were the final judgments for purposes of \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4) and, therefore, that PaineWebber was required to file its complaint for setoff within twenty-four hours of those judgments. By filing its complaint for setoff in August, 1990, PaineWebber failed to comply with \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4). Accordingly, the trial court properly denied PaineWebber\u2019s complaint for setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">PaineWebber also contends that the trial court improperly determined that PaineWebber was not entitled to a setoff on equitable grounds. We disagree.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">This court will reverse a trial court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers only if it appears that the trial court\u2019s decision is unreasonable or creates an injustice. <em>Fel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>lows </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>217 Conn. 57, 67-68, 584 A.2d 458 (1991); <em>Godiksen </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Conn. App. 106, 109-10, 503 A.2d 617 (1986). \u201c[EJquitable power must be exercised equitably . . . [but] [t]he determination of what equity requires in a particular case, the balancing of the equities, is a matter for the discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>188 Conn. 316, 320, 449 A.2d 182 (1982). Although PaineWebber correctly notes that the denial of a legal setoff does not preclude an award of setoff on equitable grounds; <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Connecticut Life Ins. Co., </em>78 Conn. 442, 450-51, 62 A. 345 (1905); a trial court may grant an equitable setoff only to \u201cenforce the simple but clear natural equity.\u201d <em>Spurr </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>35 Conn. 172, 174 (1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In this case, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to deny PaineWebber\u2019s motion for equitable setoff. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision on the setoff issue stated: \u201cAt this time, it would be fundamentally unfair to grant [PaineWebber\u2019s] request for [an equitable] setoff. The Appellate Court has directed the trial court to award interest to [PaineWebber pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a] on the theory [that PaineWebber] has received a judgment in its favor providing for an ultimate recovery in excess of the offer of judgment which it made earlier in the proceedings. If the awards had been setoff at trial and one judgment rendered in favor of the defendant for eighteen cents, the plaintiff\u2019s claim for prejudgment interest might have been viewed in a different light by the trial court and the Appellate Court.\u201d We conclude that the trial court, before which the parties appeared, reasonably determined that PaineWebber, having decided not to seek setoff until it had secured an award of interest on the judgment in its favor, could not later seek to set off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the judgment in its favor against the judgment in Winters\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject PaineWebber\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Foreclosure Action</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">PaineWebber contends, in the foreclosure action, that the trial court improperly granted an equitable setoff of the <em>PaineWebber </em>judgments. Although the Appellate Court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion by granting an equitable setoff in the foreclosure action because the trial court had not been bound by its denial of a setoff in the <em>PaineWebber </em>action, we determine that the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is not amenable to meaningful appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant an equitable setoff. Accordingly, we remand this case for further articulation on that issue. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> see also, e.g., <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 473, 600 A.2d 310 (1991); <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>213 Conn. 686, 693-95, 569 A.2d 1126 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The trial court determined that distribution of the foreclosure sale proceeds to PaineWebber in the full amount of its <em>PaineWebber </em>judgment, without setting off the judgment in favor of Winters, would be \u201cextremely inequitable.\u201d Because PaineWebber did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>move for articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the entire record on which we could review PaineWebber\u2019s claim consists of this conclusory statement by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u201cWe have repeatedly stated that it is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide an adequate record for review. . . . Where the factual or legal basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is unclear, the appellant should file a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 164-65, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992). In the absence of a motion for articulation, it would be sheer speculation for this court to assume that the trial court exercised its equitable powers unreasonably.

Did the Appellate Court improperly affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to set off the judgments obtained by Paine Webber and by Winters in this foreclosure action when the Appellate Court simultaneously affirmed a denial of the same request for a setoff in the <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>26 Conn. App. 322, 600 A.2d 1048 (1991), matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u201c2.

Did the Appellate Court improperly fail to consider the issues of this matter with the issues of the appeal in <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>supra, when the same question of equitable setoff existed in both cases?\u201d <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>221 Conn. 911, 912, 602 A.2d 10 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b177-5\"> Although PaineWebber claims that Winters is effectively insolvent and that the foreclosure proceeds are the only asset from which PaineWebber might receive payment, Winters disputes that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> Because the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment without discussing the issue of equitable setoff, we review the trial court\u2019s disposition of this issue, rather than the Appellate Court\u2019s disposition of it. We reject PaineWebber\u2019s contention that the Appellate Court\u2019s omission constitutes \u201creversible error,\u201d because the claim receives full consideration herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"> In its brief to this court, PaineWebber acknowledged that it would withdraw its appeal in the foreclosure action if we reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s affirmance of the trial court\u2019s denial of setoff in the <em>PaineWebber </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Moreover, PaineWebber contends, in both cases, that the Appellate Court\u2019s failure to consider the merits of the two cases together was improper. We note that PaineWebber has not raised on appeal the Appellate Court\u2019s denial of its motion to consolidate the cases. We, therefore, understand this contention as a claim that the Appellate Court, having properly denied PaineWebber\u2019s motion to consolidate, was nonetheless required to consider the cases together.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">We reject such a claim. Even if the Appellate Court had considered the cases together, the Appellate Court would be entitled to reverse the trial court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers in each of the two separate cases only if that exercise was unreasonable. <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>217 Conn. 57, 67-68, 584 A.2d 458 (1991). The Appellate Court\u2019s joint consideration of the cases could not alter the fact that the two cases were tried separately in the trial court. Accordingly, even if the Appellate Court had determined, after its joint consideration of the cases, that the two decisions of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>court, taken together, created an inequity, it would not thereby have been entitled to reverse the trial court\u2019s decisions, because the trial court properly considered the cases separately. Indeed, PaineWebber neither appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to consolidate nor raised in this court or in the Appellate Court the trial court\u2019s failure to consider the cases together. PaineWebber\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court should have considered the two cases together, therefore, fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\"> PaineWebber was the defendant on Winters\u2019 counterclaims, which for the most part sounded in tort. See footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\"> We have previously decided that, at the time a judgment is rendered in the trial court, it becomes final for the purpose of triggering a statute of limitations. <em>Varley </em>v. <em>Varley, </em>181 Conn. 58, 60-61, 434 A.2d 312 (1980). <em>Varley </em>is not controlling here, however, because the twenty-four hour filing requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4) is not properly considered a statute of limitations, despite that characterization of it by the Appellate Court. <em>Paine Webber Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winters, </em>26 Conn. App. 322, 325, 600 A.2d 1048 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d as \u201c[a] statute prescribing limitations to the right of action on certain described causes of action . . . that is, declaring that no suit shall be maintained . . . within a specified period of time after the right accrued . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). The purposes of statutes of limitation include finality, repose and avoidance of stale claims and stale evidence. See <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 417, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990); <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 508-509, 542 A.2d 700 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Unlike a statute of limitations, the pleading requirement imposed by \u00a7 52-141 (b) (4) does not limit the right to bring a suit and, because of its short length, cannot have been intended to promote repose and finality or to protect against stale claims and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Finally, our decision not to characterize the twenty-four hour filing requirement as a statute of limitations is in accord with prior cases. For example, in <em>Small </em>v. <em>South Norwalk Savings Bank, </em>205 Conn. 751, 758, 535 A.2d 1292 (1988), we impliedly recognized that a five day limitation on filing posttrial motions, imposed by Practice Book rule, is not a statute of limitations: \u201cWe no more feel at liberty to disregard [the five day limitation] . . . than we do to disregard <em>an ordinary statute of limitations </em>. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Similarly, in <em>Cutting </em>v. <em>Yudkin, </em>137 Conn. 635, 637, 79 A.2d 823 (1951), we held that a statutory requirement that a bill of exceptions and writ of error be filed within forty-eight hours of judgment was not a statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-263. appeals from superior court, exceptions.

No statutory construction, therefore, was involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4009 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe party appealing shall, within twenty days, except where a different period is provided by statute, from the issuance of notice of the rendition of the judgment or decision from which the appeal is taken file an appeal in the manner prescribed by Sec. 4012.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b183-10\"> Winters contends that, in Connecticut, the right to equitable setoff exists only in contract actions and that, for that reason, the trial court properly denied PaineWebber\u2019s request to set off a debt judgment against a tort judgment. Because this contention falls outside the scope of the certified issues, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> We do not decide, however, the validity of the trial court\u2019s suggestion that PaineWebber would not have been entitled to interest under General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a if the judgments had been set off by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\"> Even if the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in the foreclosure action were affirmed, that affirmance would not render moot the issues in the <em>PaineWebber </em>appeal, for the two cases, including the facially similar claims regarding the issue of equitable setoff in each case, involve independent controversies.
