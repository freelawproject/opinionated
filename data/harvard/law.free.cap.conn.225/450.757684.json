J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiH\">The principal issue in this criminal appeal is whether a statute imposing on the defendant in a criminal prosecution the burden of establishing the defense of mental disease or defect violates the due process provisions of the Connecticut constitution. The state charged the defendant, Angelo Joyner, with one count of kidnapping in the first degree, in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tion of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A); one count of assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1); and three counts of sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury found the defendant guilty of all the crimes charged, and the trial court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of fifty years. He appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The victim and her two and one-half year old daughter lived in an apartment in New Haven. On the evening of March 2,1989, the victim invited a number of neighbors and the defendant to her apartment. After the other visitors had left, the victim asked the defendant also to leave, but he refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The defendant told the victim that he wanted to have sex with her. When she refused, he began to hit her and threatened to kill her daughter, who was asleep in an upstairs bedroom. He forced the victim to perform fellatio and penetrated her, vaginally and anally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Whenever she refused his sexual advances, he struck her again, both with his fists and with a stick, and continued his sexual assaults. As a result of the defendant\u2019s assaults, which included choking the victim, she temporarily lost consciousness. The assaults continued throughout the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Early on the morning of March 3, 1989, two police officers went to the apartment in response to a complaint of screaming. Upon their arrival, they heard a woman repeatedly crying out for help. The defendant appeared in an upstairs window, but refused the officers\u2019 request to open the door. After breaking down the door to gain entry, they told the defendant to come downstairs. The defendant first refused, threatening to kill the police officers with a gun, but he ultimately allowed the child to go downstairs and then went down himself, holding the victim. The defendant and the victim were nude and covered with blood. The victim\u2019s face was swollen to twice its normal size. She could barely speak and was gasping for breath. The defendant had no visible injuries. Police inspection of the apartment disclosed the presence of bloodstains on the furniture and on the floor of numerous rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Medical examinations of the victim revealed severe facial trauma, as well as a broken rib, and possibly a bruised kidney. The pattern of her injuries demonstrated that they had resulted from a beating and not from an accidental fall down a staircase.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The state toxicologist analyzed vaginal and anal smears taken from the victim and discovered the presence of sperm. This scientific evidence was consistent with the victim\u2019s immediate complaints of sexual assault, both to an examining gynecologist and to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The defendant did not deny his presence at the victim\u2019s apartment. Without testifying himself, he offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>a twofold defense through the testimony of his psychiatrist. On the one hand, the defendant relied on his statements to the psychiatrist that the victim was an alcohol and drug abuser and that she and the defendant had been smoking crack cocaine together on the night of the incident. The defendant claimed that their sexual relations had been consensual until the victim had become enraged at his disclosure that he was leaving her for another woman. He attributed her wounds to a fall down a flight of stairs. On the other hand, the defendant also offered the psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis that the defendant was psychotic and suffered from a schizoaffective disorder that caused him to have disturbed thinking, delusions of persecution and hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The jury found the defendant guilty as charged. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial and for acquittal and rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The defendant has raised seven issues in his appeal to this court. He maintains that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motion for acquittal of assault in the first degree; (2) imposed upon him the burden of establishing his insanity, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a), in violation of the due process provisions of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution; (3) failed to give a sua sponte curative instruction to the jury in response to a prejudicial rebuttal argument by the state\u2019s attorney; (4) admitted prior misconduct evidence; (5) refused to make an in camera inspection of privileged records of the victim; (6) permitted the state\u2019s psychiatrist to testify that the defendant had been in control of his conduct; and (7) deprived him of his constitutional right to testify. We are unpersuaded by any of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The defendant\u2019s first contention is that the state adduced insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of assault in the first degree. In its long form information, the state charged that the defendant had committed first degree assault, as defined by \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), by intentionally causing serious physical injury to the victim \u201cby means of a dangerous instrument; to wit: a piece of wood.\u201d The defendant maintains that even if the jury could reasonably have found that he had inflicted serious physical injury upon the victim, it could reasonably have determined only that he had done so with his fists and not with a wooden stick. The defendant raised this issue in the trial court by filing a motion for acquittal, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">This court\u2019s review of claims relating to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a criminal conviction is governed by a well established standard of law. \u201cWhether we review the findings of a trial court or the verdict of a jury, our underlying task is the same. . . . We first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 770-71, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosswell, </em>223 Conn. 243, 249, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 434, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992). Applying that standard in this case, we conclude that the evidence presented by the state could reasonably have persuaded the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had committed the crime of assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The stick with which the defendant beat the victim was a wooden stick ordinarily used to keep a window in the apartment shut. The defendant does not deny that the victim testified that she had been hit with this stick, or that the jury might reasonably have found the stick to be a dangerous instrument. He focuses, instead, on the victim's testimony that the majority of the beating was done with the defendant\u2019s fists. He also points to the absence of direct evidence concerning the place on the victim\u2019s body where she had been hit with the stick or the severity of these blows. Without such direct evidence, he maintains, the jury\u2019s verdict that he had inflicted serious physical injury on the victim with the stick was speculative and must, therefore, be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The term \u201cserious physical injury\u201d is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4) as \u201cphysical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ . . . .\u201d When the evidence supports a finding that a beating with fists and with a stick, in combination, caused such serious impairment to the health of a victim as to render her unconscious, it is not necessary for the victim to be able to recall with precision what blows caused her injuries. Although the victim could not remember how often the defendant had hit her with the stick, she did recall that he had hit her with the stick at least once. She also testified that the defendant had stood over her, stick in hand, while she was lying on her back, before she lost consciousness. The jury could infer from this testimony, in conjunction with its examination of the stick, which was in evidence, that the state had proved assault in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The defendant\u2019s second contention is that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>erly instructed the jury, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that he bore the burden of establishing the existence of his claimed mental disease or defect by a preponderance of the evidence. His claim is not that the trial court misconstrued or misapplied these statutes, but rather that, in making mental disease an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden of proof, \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended in 1983, violates the due process clauses contained in article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The defendant did not object at trial to the trial court\u2019s charge assigning to him the burden of proof on mental disease. We have decided to review this claim, nonetheless, because the record is adequate for us to consider it, and because it raises an important and unresolved question of state constitutional law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 238-41, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 443-44, 534 A.2d 219 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The defendant\u2019s constitutional argument rests on two overlapping rules of law allegedly mandated by the due process clauses of our state constitution. The defendant\u2019s principal but narrower contention is that our due process provisions require the state to prove sanity, once an issue about a defendant\u2019s mental status has properly been raised, because the defendant\u2019s mental status then becomes one of the elements of the state\u2019s case. His alternate but broader contention is that, regardless of whether sanity is an element of the state\u2019s case, our due process provisions incorporate principles of fairness, justice and morality that require the state to bear the ultimate burden of proof with respect to sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">To put the defendant\u2019s state constitutional contentions into perspective, it is helpful to examine briefly how federal law has dealt with the issues that he raises. As a matter of federal constitutional law, although due process requires the state to prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 204, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977); <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 698-701, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); a defendant\u2019s sanity is not an element of the state\u2019s case, so that the state need not bear the burden of proof on that issue. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 205-206; <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>343 U.S. 790, 797-99, 72 S. Ct. 1002, 96 L. Ed. 1302 (1952).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Supreme Court of the United States has not addressed any other due process challenge to the validity of statutes requiring a defendant to shoulder the burden of proof on the issue of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">As a matter of state constitutional law, we presume that the due process clauses contained in article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, incorporate the federal principle that due process requires the state to prove every element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. We presume also that our due process clauses equally incorporate the federal principle that, as a general matter, \u201c[i]t is constitutionally permissible for the state to place the burden on a criminal defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence elements which would constitute an affirmative defense but which do not serve to negate any essential element of the crime which the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>181 Conn. 426, 430, 435 A.2d 967 (1980); see also <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 85-86, 106 S. Ct. 2411, 91 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1986); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra. Bearing these propositions in mind, we must decide whether, under our state constitution, a defendant\u2019s sanity, once put into issue, must be proved by the state as an element of its case or as a result of another applicable constitutional principle. We assuredly have the authority to construe our own due process clauses to afford higher levels of protection for the individual rights of insane persons than those guaranteed by the federal constitution. Cf., e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 649-50, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 171, 579 A.2d 58 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 120-23, 547 A.2d 10 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended, is unconstitutional because, once mental status has been raised as an issue in a criminal prosecution, proof of sanity necessarily becomes an element of the state\u2019s case. We agree with the state that the legislature is not foreclosed from making insanity an affirmative defense to be proved by a defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, because we can discover no constitutional requirement that sanity be considered an essential element of the crime to be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Our analysis of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended, must take account of two well established postulates. First, in light of the established presumption in favor of a statute\u2019s constitutionality, any person attacking the validity of a lawfully enacted statute bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 269, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>196 Conn. 655, 663, 495 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 951, 106 S. Ct. 318, 88 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1985). Second, in light of established doctrines implicit in the separation of powers, the primary responsibility for enacting the laws that define and classify crimes is vested in the legislature; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>supra, 665; <em>State v. Darden, </em>171 Conn. 677, 679, 372 A.2d 99 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rao, </em>171 Conn. 600, 603, 370 A.2d 1310 (1976); and such legislative authority includes the responsibility for defining the elements of a crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>supra, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Our inquiry into the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended, must also proceed with the recognition that there is an analytic distinction between mental sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>tus as it relates to the insanity defense and mental status as it relates to intent to engage in criminal conduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>supra, 770-73; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 204, 445 A.2d 314 (1982); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>203 Conn. 212, 244-45, 523 A.2d 1306 (1987) (Peters, <em>C. J., </em>dissenting). The amended statute shifts to the defendant the burden of establishing his or her mental status only with respect to the affirmative defense of insanity. The statute does not purport to relieve the state of its continuing burden of proof with respect to mental status when mental status is implicated in the state\u2019s proof of an element of the crime, such as the defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit the crime with which he or she has been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The defendant\u2019s principal contention is that, in light of our state due process clauses, this analytic distinction between the purposes for which evidence of mental status may be adduced is irrelevant. It does not matter, in his view, that the legislature has not included sanity as an element of the crime with which he has been charged. He maintains that it is just as unconstitutional for the legislature to shift to him the burden of establishing the defense of insanity as it would be to require him to bear the burden of proof on intent. In either case, he argues, principles of due process in Connecticut mandate the conclusion that, once the issue of mental status has properly been raised, mental status, including both intent and sanity, becomes an element of the crime charged on which the state must bear the burden of proof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, the due process provisions of the Connecticut constitution on which the defendant relies, do not illuminate textually the extent to which a deep seated concern for the protection of personal freedom should be translated into a constitutional command that sanity is an essential element in the state\u2019s prosecution of a criminal defendant. Lacking textual guidance, we have looked to the available case law in reasonable temporal proximity to the adoption of the constitution of 1818 to enhance our understanding of the original intent of the constitutional framers. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 180-81, 579 A.2d 484 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Pursuing this search for historical meaning, the defendant maintains that Connecticut cases, both in the nineteenth century and more recently, have described the defense of insanity as encompassing sanity within the elements of criminal behavior. These descriptions manifest, according to the defendant, a constitutional understanding about the relationship between sanity and the elements of a crime that the legislature is powerless to overturn.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Although cases in close temporal proximity to the enactment of our constitution in 1818 would have helped to clarify the intent of the framers with regard to the defense of insanity, neither our own research nor that of counsel has uncovered any such cases. Beginning in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the case law does, intermittently, endorse the proposition that the state must prove sanity and sometimes describes such proof as an element of the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Nineteenth century Connecticut cases on insanity begin with <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>40 Conn. 136, 140 (1873), in which the court upheld an instruction that stated, in part, \u201c[i]f upon the whole evidence the jury entertain a reasonable doubt as to the prisoner\u2019s sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>soundness of mind to be responsible for his acts, it will be their duty to give him the benefit of the doubt, and so render a verdict of acquittal.\u201d Only five years later, however, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>46 Conn. 330, 337 (1878), the court stated that \u201c[t]he law presumes every person of mature years to be of sound mind and competent to commit crime. If the defence be insanity, it is to be proved substantially as an independent fact, and the burden of proof is on the accused. Upon this issue he goes forward and the state rebuts.\u201d In dictum, <em>State </em>v. <em>Schweitzer, </em>57 Conn. 532, 539-41, 18 A. 787 (1889), followed the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>supra, while <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>69 Conn. 186, 199, 37 A. 75 (1897) reverted, sub silentio, to the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, and described \u201cthe fact of the sanity of the accused [as] an element of the crime, a part of the government\u2019s case, although it is only impliedly and not in terms alleged</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In this century, it became the established pattern to place the burden of proof of sanity upon the state, once the defendant had introduced sufficient probative evidence about his mental condition to make his sanity an issue. The nature of the state\u2019s obligation was first described as putting upon the state the burden \u201c \u2018as it [has] in all other particulars\u2019 \u201d to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s sanity and responsibility at the time of his commission of the offense with which he was charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>96 Conn. 637, 639, 115 A. 85 (1921); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>134 Conn. 43, 49, 54 A.2d 585 (1947). More recently, the state\u2019s burden was described as including, as an essential element of the crimes charged, \u201cthe essential elements of the mental condition requisite to legal responsibility under our governing test.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Conte, </em>157 Conn. 209, 212, 251 A.2d 81 (1968), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 964, 90 S. Ct. 439, 24 L. Ed. 2d 428 (1969); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>594-95, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>158 Conn. 341, 355-56, 260 A.2d 587 (1969), vacated on other grounds, 408 U.S. 935, 92 S. Ct. 2856, 33 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1972). The latter decisions, however, ascribe no particular significance to their description of sanity as an \u201cessential element\u201d of the state\u2019s case, because in none of these cases was that aspect of the description an issue before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The question before us is what constitutional significance to attach to these various understandings about burdens of proof and elements of a crime. The defendant would have us take the language of the cases, especially references to sanity as an \u201cessential element,\u201d as so embedded in our Connecticut jurisprudence that due process requires continued observance of their rulings and precludes the legislature from relieving the state of its burden of proving sanity as an element of its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The state urges us, however, to view our cases from a perspective that differentiates between (1) independent facts, as to which the legislature is free to allocate the burden of proof either to the state or to the defendant, and (2) the elements of a crime, as to which due process requires the state to shoulder the burden of proof. The state regards the defense of insanity as relating to an independent fact. Accordingly, the state maintains that the legislature was empowered to shift the burden of proof with regard to that independent fact to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">We agree with the state that sanity, like the absence of drug dependency; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 608, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 166, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981); is an independent fact and not an element of any existing criminal offense. As to such an independent fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>as with regard to other affirmative defenses, the legislature has the constitutional authority to allocate the burden of proof to the defendant rather than to the state. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>supra, 611; <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 430. Other state courts interpreting their state constitutions, many of which are textually and historically similar to ours, have overwhelmingly found no constitutional impediment to such legislation. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowling, </em>151 Ariz. 230, 232, 726 P.2d 1099 (Ct. App. 1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hightower, </em>172 Ill. App. 3d 678, 692-93, 526 N.E.2d 1129 (1988); <em>Price </em>v. <em>State, </em>274 Ind. 479, 483, 412 N.E.2d 783 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>393 N.W.2d 465, 468 (Iowa 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>435 A.2d 58, 72 (Me. 1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>233 Neb. 74, 108-109, 444 N.W.2d 610 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881, 111 S. Ct. 216, 112 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1990); <em>People </em>v. <em>Kohl, </em>72 N.Y.2d 191, 197-99, 527 N.E.2d 1182, 532 N.Y.S.2d 45 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>519 Pa. 550, 566-69, 549 A.2d 503 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>512 A.2d 818, 823 (R.1.1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rough Surface, </em>440 N.W.2d 746, 758 (S.D. 1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>145 Vt. 622, 626-28, 497 A.2d 740 (1985); contra <em>People </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>165 Colo. 253, 266, 439 P.2d 741 (1968). We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended, does not violate the due process prohibition against relieving the state of its burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The defendant\u2019s alternate contention is that, regardless of whether sanity is an element of the state\u2019s case, our state due process provisions incorporate principles of fairness, justice and morality that require the state to bear the ultimate burden of proof with respect to sanity. Relying particularly on article first, \u00a7 9, the defendant argues that historical principles, including natural law as a source of common law and constitutional principles, embody ethical strictures against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>criminal responsibility when there is a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s mental status. The defendant also argues that contemporary understandings about the nature of guilt in criminal cases require an allocation of the burden of proof on insanity to the state. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Article first, \u00a7 9, provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly warranted by law.\u201d We have held that the meaning to be attributed to the phrase \u201cexcept in cases clearly warranted by law\u201d will depend on the particular liberty interest that is at stake. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 178. \u201cSuch a construction is, of course, entirely consonant with the general contours of a constitutional safeguard rooted in flexible principles of due process.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The history of article first, \u00a7 9, suggests that it incorporates no single constitutional standard for due process. Its antecedents may be found in a number of quasi-constitutional and statutory enactments dating back to the seventeenth century. See <em>State </em>v. Lamme, supra, 178-79, and references therein cited; see also B. Chapin, Criminal Justice in Colonial America, 1606-1660 (1983). The earliest reported judicial discussion of the predecessor of article first, \u00a7 9, referred to its provisions without distinguishing between statutory and constitutional constraints on governmental intrusions on personal liberty. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bulloch, </em>12 Conn. 38, 43 (1837). Regarding the defendant\u2019s claimed liberty interest, therefore, these precedents provide no support for his blanket assertion that article first, \u00a7 9, is historically rooted in constitutional guarantees protecting against defective statutory law. On the contrary, while some personal rights had their origins in the common law and in pre-1818 declarations of rights, others were created by statute. See C. Collier, \u201cThe Connecticut Declaration of Rights Before the Constitution of 1818: A Victim of Revolutionary Redefini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tion,\u201d 15 Conn. L. Rev. 87, 94 (1982). Nothing in the early declarations of rights specifically addresses the issue of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In addition to rights enumerated in the state constitution and statutes, late eighteenth century commentators referred also to natural rights as a source of the common law. See, e.g., 1 Root (Conn.), Introduction p. iv. The defendant contends that these common law principles preclude the punishment of a person whose sanity is in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">We agree with the defendant that our common law tradition provides considerable support for the proposition that insanity is a defense to criminal conduct, so that the state could not entirely eradicate such a defense from the penal code. See, e.g., 2 Z. Swift, Digest of the Laws of Connecticut (Dutton Ed. 1871) p. 384. As we have noted on other occasions, our common law history is an important source of enlightenment about the meaning to be ascribed to open-ended constitutional provisions guaranteeing due process. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 164-66, 537 A.2d 446 (1988); see also E. Peters, \u201cCommon Law Antecedents of Constitutional Law in Connecticut,\u201d 53 Alb. L. Rev. 259, 261 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">We do not agree, however, that these common law antecedents limit the power of the legislature to allocate the burden of proof with respect to insanity. Specifically, although the commentators emphasize the impropriety of punishment for a person who lacks the mental capacity and understanding that the criminal law has always required, they do not address the manner in which such lack of capacity is to be shown. More generally, the commentary does not speak to the relative primacy of inconsistent statutory and common law rules.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Contrary to our federal constitutional heritage, our constitutional tradition in Connecticut has not historically drawn hard lines of separation between constitutional, statutory and common law precepts. See E. Peters, \u201cState Supreme Courts in our Evolving Federal System,\u201d 17 Intergovernmental Perspective 21 (1991). For example, Root\u2019s introduction broadly describes \u201cThe Origin Of Government And Laws In Connecticut\u201d as follows: \u201cOur ancestors therefore as a free, sovereign, and independent people, very early established a constitution of government by their own authority; which was adapted to their situation and circumstances; and enacted laws for the due and regular administration of justice; for the propagation of knowledge and virtue; for the preservation of the public peace, and for the security and defense of the state against their savage enemies. . . . Their common law was derived from the law of nature and of revelation; those rules and maxims of immutable truth and justice, which arise from the eternal fitness of things, which need only to be understood, to be submitted to; as they are themselves the highest authority; together with certain customs and usages, which had been universally assented to and adopted in practice, as reasonable and beneficial.\u201d 1 Root (Conn.), supra. Root\u2019s description does not elevate common law rules over those enacted by the legislature and does not automatically embed common law rules in the constitution to the exclusion of statutory intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">To the extent that common law rules are \u201cderived from the law of nature,\u201d it is likely that our ancestors envisaged the possibility that natural law principles could find expression, not only through constitutional rights, but by the actions of a duly constituted and representative legislature. According to Professor Philip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>A. Hamburger, eighteenth century Americans understood natural liberty to be the freedom of individuals in the state of nature, while they recognized certain other rights, such as habeas corpus and jury rights, as existing only under the laws of civil government. P. Hamburger, \u201cNatural Rights, Natural Law, and American Constitutions,\u201d 102 Yale L.J. 907, 918-22 (1993). \u201cIn accordance with their understanding of natural law, Americans assumed that, under civil government, individuals retained only a portion of their natural liberty. They assumed that individuals retained only such natural rights as were reserved by a constitution or, much less securely, were left unimpeded by their other civil laws.\u201d Id., 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Colonial Americans understood that natural law permitted variations in civil laws \u201cto accommodate the different circumstances in which such laws would operate. Consequently, constitutions and other civil laws could restrain natural liberty in varying degrees and ways and, nonetheless, could still be said to comport with natural law.\u201d Id., 937. \u201cWhen saying that constitutions and other civil laws should be formulated to reflect natural law, Americans typically were not suggesting that natural law was a kind of constitutional law or a source for constitutional rights not protected by a written constitution. On the contrary, under modern natural rights analysis, constitutional law and natural law were quite distinct from one another and played very different roles.\u201d Id., 938. \u201cFar from being a form of constitutional law, natural law typically was assumed to be the reasoning on the basis of which individuals adopted constitutions and a means by which the people could measure the adequacy of their constitutions.\u201d Id., 940. \u201cAlthough Americans often discussed constitutional guarantees of natural rights in terms of natural law, they did not broadly incorporate natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>law into their constitutions and usually did not question the positive character of these documents.\u201d Id., 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Professor Hamburger\u2019s analysis suggests that our forebears did not understand natural law to be a source of expansive, unlimited rights that the civil law was prohibited from subjecting to substantial statutory restrictions. We are unprepared, as a constitutional matter, to translate a general concern about the injustice of imposing criminal punishment on the insane into a binding stricture on statutory reallocation of the burden of proof on insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">We are equally unpersuaded that modern views about morality in the criminal law make it unconstitutional to require a defendant to prove his insanity in accordance with the terms of \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended. Although there continues to be considerable disagreement about the appropriate public policy response to mental illness; see, e.g., A. Goldstein, The Insanity Defense (1967) pp. 15-20; G. Christie &amp; A. Pye, \u201cPresumptions and Assumptions in the Criminal Law: Another View,\u201d 1970 Duke L.J. 919, 937-38; we are not prepared to hold that the defense of insanity is so central to the issue of criminal culpability that allocating the burden of proof to the defendant, by a preponderance of the evidence, is constitutionally impermissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Our analysis of the constitutional requirements of due process in this regard is informed by the understanding that, under the state constitution, as under the federal constitution, \u201cdue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey </em>v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 178; see also <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>222 Conn. 233, 242, 610 A.2d 574 (1992); <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>213 Conn. 38, 46, 49-53, 566 A.2d 663 (1989). Borrowing the methodology of <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976), we must consider three distinct factors: \u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the [state\u2019s] interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Applying these factors to the present case, we conclude that imposing on the defendant the burden of proving his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence does not violate due process. The defendant\u2019s private interest is that his insanity defense be properly adjudicated. The risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest is that allocating the burden of proof of insanity to him, by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than to the state, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, increases the possibility that the defense may fail in circumstances where it should be accepted. Both of these factors argue in favor of the defendant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended, is constitutionally questionable. The third factor, however, cuts the other way. The defendant is much more likely than the state to be able to produce reliable evidence of his own mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>status. Although the state may have the defendant examined pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 760,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> such an examination may not level the evidentiary playing field in any particular case, because the defendant controls the contents of his disclosures to the state\u2019s psychiatrist. Furthermore, the state\u2019s psychiatrist, as a practical matter, may have more limited access than the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist to information that the defendant\u2019s family and friends may be able to provide regarding the defendant\u2019s life history. The <em>Mathews </em>analysis reveals, therefore, that \u00a7 53a-13 (a) is \u201centirely consonant with the general contours of a constitutional safeguard rooted in flexible principles of due process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We conclude, accordingly, that the trial court correctly instructed the jury in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 53a-13 (a), as amended. Our state constitution permits the legislature to determine that the defendant, rather than the state, shoulder the burden of proof on sanity when sanity is not an element in the charge against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court failed to protect his rights when the state\u2019s attorney argued, in rebuttal, that the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s demeanor in the courtroom in evaluating his insanity defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Although the defendant concededly did not object to this rebuttal argument at trial, he maintains that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement was so prejudicial that the trial court was required, sua sponte, to give the jury a curative instruction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We need not decide, in this appeal, whether the comments of which the defendant now complains would have required a judicial response had there been a timely objection at trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We adhere to our oft-repeated rule that, unless the remarks of the state\u2019s attorney implicate fundamental constitutional rights; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973); we will refuse to review unpreserved allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 289-90, 604 A.2d 793 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 509-510, 594 A.2d 906 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>214 Conn. 378, 393, 572 A.2d 944 (1990). The defendant does not argue that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks violated a fundamental constitutional right, but only that the remarks were highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Furthermore, a single questionable statement by the state\u2019s attorney does not merit plain error review under Practice Book \u00a7 4185. The injustice, if any, such a statement may manifest would not, in all probability, impair the effectiveness or integrity of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>215 Conn. 653, 666, 577 A.2d 1036 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 111 S. Ct. 756, 112 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 547, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 87-88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the state to introduce evidence of his prior misconduct in its cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist. The psychiatrist testified that, in arriving at his diagnosis that the defendant had been psychotic and had suffered from a schizoaffective disorder at the time of the assault, he had relied in part on the defendant\u2019s personal history, including two prior assaults in 1983. The state then inquired whether the psychiatrist was aware that these assaults had been so violent as to have caused brain damage to their victims. The psychiatrist acknowledged that he had known only that the defendant had severely beaten others with his fists. The psychiatrist also acknowledged that, although he had known that no insanity plea had been entered with regard to the 1983 assaults, he had not known that the defendant had not been diagnosed as having a mental disease or defect at that time. The trial court immediately instructed the jury that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct could be considered only for the limited purpose of assessing the psychiatrist\u2019s opinion, and not for a determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although not challenging the wording of the trial court\u2019s curative instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tion, the defendant had earlier taken a proper exception to this line of questioning, and moved for a mistrial, both at the time of the testimony and the next day, which the trial court denied. We agree with the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The propriety of the state\u2019s questioning is governed by <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 503 A.2d 576 (1986). In that case, we adopted the view of numerous other state courts that a plea of insanity permits an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s entire life and thus makes admissible evidence of his prior misconduct to show his mental condition, even though such evidence would ordinarily be excluded. Id., 391-92. \u201cOnce the insanity defense is asserted by a defendant the state is entitled to use relevant evidence of prior crimes to rebut it. This rule, of course, is subject to the constraint that the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 134, 486 A.2d 637 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 676, 469 A.2d 760 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>159 Conn. 169, 173, 268 A.2d 368 (1970).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 393. On appeal, the issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the evidence was admissible. Id., 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The defendant argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, did not authorize the state\u2019s inquiry in this case because, in <em>Carter, </em>the misconduct evidence related to a conviction for murder only four months prior to the incident before the court. According to the defendant, the inquiry in this case concerned events that, having taken place five years earlier, were more remote in time, and, having been graphically described, were more prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We conclude that the ruling of the trial court was not an abuse of discretion. It was relevant for the state to ask the psychiatrist how these earlier charges, which had elicited no contemporaneous assertion of mental illness, fit the psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis of the defendant as having suffered from a long-term mental illness. In light of the psychiatrist\u2019s acknowledgement that he had been aware of the existence of these charges when he had diagnosed the defendant, it was not impermissibly prejudicial to test the depth of his understanding of what allegedly had transpired. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s immediate sua sponte curative instruction served to minimize the risk of undue prejudice. The defendant cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The defendant\u2019s fifth claim is that the trial court improperly denied his request that it undertake an in camera inspection of the mental health records of the victim. The victim acknowledged that she had had several drinks on the occasion of the assaults, and her blood tests, taken immediately after the assaults, indicated a high blood alcohol content. The defendant believed, therefore, that the records might provide information useful to his cross-examination of the witness. The defendant urged the court to inspect such records, because the credibility of the victim was a central issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>According to the victim\u2019s testimony during voir dire before the court and in the absence of the jury, her mental health history included the following. In 1987, depressed about the recent death of her father and the imminent death of her mother, the victim was an inpatient in a New York hospital and received substance abuse counseling at that time. In 1988, after an assault by another man, she went to a shelter for battered women, but received neither professional counseling nor substance abuse treatment at the shelter. She had no further mental health treatment prior to the incident at issue in this case. In February, 1990, eleven months after the alleged assaults, the victim had six weeks of substance abuse treatment as an outpatient.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The trial court ruled that the records of the New York hospitalization were too remote in time to warrant inspection, and that the defendant had failed to make a sufficient preliminary showing of how the victim\u2019s mental health or alcohol treatment affected her testimonial capacity so as to warrant inspection of the records of the Connecticut shelter or of the Connecticut outpatient treatment facility. On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s finding of temporal remoteness regarding the New York hospitalization. He contends instead that, at least with respect to the victim\u2019s outpatient treatment for substance abuse, the court was required to undertake the requested inspection. We agree with the state, however, that the trial court correctly ruled that the defendant had not made the preliminary showing that our decisions have uniformly required to warrant further in camera inspection of mental health records.

Before a defendant may have access to privileged records that \u201che believes contain information that would allow him to impeach a witness\u2019 ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth, [he] must make a preliminary showing that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>supra, 505; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>D \u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 58; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 225-26; <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In this case, it was not enough for the defendant to show merely that the victim had consumed alcohol on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the night of the assault and had undergone alcohol treatment thereafter. We have never held that a history of alcohol or drug abuse or treatment automatically makes a witness fair game for disclosure of psychiatric records to a criminal defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 60; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burak, </em>201 Conn. 517, 524-25, 518 A.2d 639 (1986); see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caine, </em>366 Mass. 366, 369-70, 318 N.E.2d 901 (1974). The trial court granted the defendant complete latitude to question the victim to elicit testimony about how the records he sought might shed light on a relationship between her alleged alcoholism and her capacity to testify truthfully, but he did not do so. He neither subpoenaed the victim\u2019s substance abuse counselor, whose identity was known to him, nor did he offer any other medical or other testimony to establish a likely connection between the victim\u2019s alleged alcohol abuse and her testimonial reliability. On this record, we conclude that the trial court properly refused to conduct the requested in camera inspection of the victim\u2019s records relating to psychiatric and substance abuse treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The defendant\u2019s sixth claim is that the trial court improperly permitted the state\u2019s psychiatrist to testify that the defendant had control over his conduct. The basis of this claim is the court\u2019s ruling to uphold the state\u2019s objection to testimony by the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist that the defendant\u2019s history of mental disease or defect, schizoaffective disorder, alcoholism and drug abuse \u201csubstantially impaired his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d The defendant urges us to hold that, despite the absence of an objection at trial to the testimony by the state\u2019s psychiatrist, the trial court\u2019s inconsistent application of General Statutes \u00a7 54-86i<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> deprived the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of a fair trial. This claim is untenable, both procedurally and substantively.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">As a procedural matter, the admissibility of expert testimony is a matter of state evidentiary law that, in the absence of timely objection, does not warrant appellate review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, because it does not, per se, raise a question of constitutional significance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>216 Conn. 139, 146, 578 A.2d 1066 (1990); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 121, 622 A.2d 519 (1993). Even our ruling in <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>210 Conn. 631, 642-43, 556 A.2d 1013 (1989), which held that a series of inconsistent evidentiary rulings could be so injurious as to impair a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, arose in the context of rulings to which proper exception had been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">As a substantive matter, construing \u00a7 54-86\u00cd narrowly; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>supra, 149; the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the testimony of the state\u2019s psychiatrist did not violate the statute while the excluded testimony of the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist crossed over the line by more closely paralleling the language that the statute forbids.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the state points out, the trial court permitted the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist to give testimony that, in form, was substantially similar to that given by the state\u2019s psychiatrist. The defendant\u2019s psychiatrist informed the jury that, in his opinion, the defendant \u201chas a chronic mental illness, [and] that this is an illness that deals with his ability to think, and to make judgments, and to control himself.\u201d In addition, he was permitted to tell the jury that, in his view, the defendant\u2019s violent behavior on the night of the assaults was the product of his mental illness. Viewed in their totality, the trial court\u2019s rulings manifest a consistent approach to the mandate of \u00a7 54-86\u00cd.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to testify at trial by failing to conduct a canvass to determine, on the record, whether the defendant had knowingly and willingly waived his right to take the stand in his own behalf. Defense counsel informed the court, in the defendant\u2019s presence, that the defendant had been advised of his rights and that the defendant would not testify.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant maintains that, by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>insist on a colloquy with the defendant himself, the trial court left the defendant with the impression that it was defense counsel, and not the defendant, who should decide whether the defendant would or would not testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to reconsider our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>213 Conn. 388, 404-405, 567 A.2d 1221 (1990), in which we held that a trial judge does not have an affirmative duty to canvass a defendant to ensure that his waiver of his right to testify is knowing, voluntary and intelligent. \u201cWe do not believe that federal law contains any such procedural requirement in a case such as this where the defendant has not alleged that he wanted to testify or that he did not know that he could testify. . . . The accused must act affirmatively. While the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment may be understood to grant the accused the right to testify, the \u2018if and \u2018when\u2019 of whether the accused will testify is primarily a matter of trial strategy to be decided between the defendant and his attorney.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975). It is impossible for me to discern any meaningful difference between the intent to commit a criminal act and sanity\u2014both relate to an individual\u2019s state of mind. This becomes crystal clear when we examine what must be established in order to succeed under an insanity defense. Under \u00a7 53a-13 (a), it is a defense to a prosecution \u201cthat the defendant, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the time he committed the proscribed act . . . lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\u201d The essence of the defense is that mental disease or defect prevented the defendant from forming the intent necessary to commit the crime, because the defendant was either unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or unable to control his or her conduct. Individuals who do not have the capacity or ability to understand the nature or effects of their actions cannot possess the mens rea or criminal intent necessary to commit a crime. Even Justice Rehnquist of the United States Supreme Court has conceded that \u201cevidence relevant to insanity as defined by state law may also be relevant to whether the required mens rea was present . . . .\u201d Id., 705-706. The defense negates intent, pure and simple; sanity is therefore an essential element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Justice Brennan forcefully argued that sanity is an element of the state\u2019s case in his dissent in <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>429 U.S. 877, 97 S. Ct. 226, 50 L. Ed. 2d 160 (1976). \u201cLike the state rule invalidated in <em>Mullaney, </em>which implied malice unless the accused negated it, the plea of insanity, whether or not the State chooses tp characterize it as an affirmative defense, relates to the accused\u2019s state of mind, an essential element of the crime, and bears upon the appropriate form of punishment. Nor is it sufficient after <em>Mullaney </em>to say, as the Court did in <em>Leland </em>[v. <em>Oregon, </em>343 U.S. 790, 72 S. Ct. 1002, 96 L. Ed. 1302 (1952)], that a State may characterize the insanity defense as it chooses. We said <em>m Mullaney </em>that the requirement of <em>[In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970)] that the State prove all elements of the crime was one of substance, not limited to a State\u2019s definition of the elements of the crime . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>omitted.) Id., 880; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 616-17, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). Nevertheless, the majority of the United States Supreme Court implicitly affirmed a decision by the Delaware Supreme Court upholding, on the basis of <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>supra, the constitutionality of a statute that placed the burden of proof of insanity on the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, 878-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">It is clear that through the lens of our own state constitution, once the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental status is raised, due process requires that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not lack the capacity to commit the crime. Consequently, I would find that to the extent that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13 place the burden of proof on the defendant, they violate due process of law under the state constitution. \u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The majority concedes, as it must, that the due process clauses contained in the Connecticut constitution, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, implicitly require the state to prove every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The majority predicates its conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13 do not violate this basic tenet of constitutional law on the purported \u201canalytic distinction between mental status as it relates to the insanity defense and mental status as it relates to intent to engage in criminal conduct.\u201d Accordingly, it concludes that sanity is not an element of the state\u2019s case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>but an independent fact. I cannot accept the majority\u2019s conclusion for several reasons. Not only does the insanity defense undermine the intent necessary to commit the crime, but sanity and intent are so interrelated that sanity necessarily becomes an element of the crime. In addition, a reasonable interpretation of our state constitution requires the state to prove the defendant\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt, once the issue has been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 684-86, we concluded that this court, \u201c[i]n order to construe the contours of our state constitution and reach reasoned and principled results,\u201d should employ various approaches for its construction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Four approaches\u2014our state common law, state history, sister state precedent, and sociological considerations\u2014are particularly germane in determining whether Connecticut\u2019s due process clauses mandate that mental capacity is an element of the crime that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In our analysis, we seek to construe article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution of 1965, which are derived from article first, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10, of the Connecticut constitution of 1818.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given that the debates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>concerning the 1818 state constitution were of great significance when the constitution was amended in 1965, the historical approach to constitutional analysis requires us to ascertain the intent of the framers of the 1818 constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unfortunately, unlike the constitutional convention of 1965, the proceedings of the constitutional convention of 1818 were not recorded. Although we have the benefit of newspaper accounts of the proceedings; W. Horton, \u201cAnnotated Debates of the 1818 Constitutional Convention,\u201d 65 Conn. B.J. SI-3 (1991); the coverage of the debates was selective and virtually no reported debate exists concerning \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 (numbered \u00a7\u00a710 and 11 at the time of the debate). Id., SI-31-32, SI-86. Accordingly, in order to determine the intent of the framers, it is more illuminating to turn to the writings of the two leading scholars who had published legal writings\u2014Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift and Judge Jesse Root.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The defendant claims, and I agree, that in view of our longstanding common law tradition, which predates our state constitution, the issue of sanity is an element of the state\u2019s case. As a result, our state constitution requires the state to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. This approach to constitutional interpretation has long been recognized as a means for determining what the framers had in mind. Chief Justice Peters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>recently wrote that \u201c[sjtate courts . . . must be empowered to determine, in light of state interests and <em>state history, </em>what meaning to attribute to provisions contained in state constitutions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) E. Peters, \u201cState Constitutional Law: Federalism in the Common Law Tradition,\u201d 84 Mich. L. Rev. 583, 588 (1986). This court held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 164-66, 537 A.2d 446 (1988), that we may look to \u201cthe historical record and due process tradition\u201d in Connecticut in determining whether article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution affords greater rights than its federal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The common law provided the foundation for our unwritten constitution prior to 1818. Jesse Root, a judge of the Superior Court, wrote the following in his introduction to the 1789-1793 reports of cases: \u201cCommon law is the perfection of reason, arising from the nature of God, of man, and of things, and from their relations, dependencies, and connections: It is universal and extends to all men, and to all combinations of men, in every possible situation; and embraces all cases and questions that can possibly arise; it is in itself perfect, clear and certain; it is immutable, and cannot be changed-or altered, without altering the nature and relation of things; it is superior to all other laws and regulations, by it they are corrected and controlled; all positive laws are to be construed by it, and wherein they are opposed to it, they are void.\u201d 1 Root (Conn.), Introduction p. ix. Judge Root also noted that the common law \u201cis the Magna Charta of all our natural and religious rights and liberties, and the only solid basis of our civil constitution and privileges\u2014in short, it supports, pervades and enlightens all the ways of man, to the noblest ends by the happiest means, when and wherever its precepts and instructions are observed and followed\u2014the usages and customs of men and the decisions of the courts of justice serve to declare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and illustrate the principles of this law . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., pp. x-xi. Indeed, Chief Justice Peters has noted that \u201c[ijn Connecticut constitutional law, it is well established that several rights now denominated as constitutional had well-recognized common law antecedents.\u201d E. Peters, \u201cCommon Law Antecedents of Constitutional Law in Connecticut,\u201d 53 Alb. L. Rev. 259, 261 (1989). In addition, Chief Justice Peters has recognized that \u201cwe should cast a wider net to discover the variety of ways in which substantive rights were protected in state courts in the early years.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The common law antecedents clearly demonstrate that the issue of sanity was an element to be proven by the state. Twenty-two years before the adoption of our first formal constitution in 1818, Justice Zephaniah Swift, a leading Connecticut jurist, noted in his scholarly work on the state common law that \u201c[t]o constitute a crime, it is necessary that there should be a vicious will, and an unlawful act. Where the will is not exercised, there can be no criminality . . . .\u201d 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796) pp. 367-68. Five short years after the adoption of the constitution of 1818, Justice Swift wrote: \u201c[I]t is the reason of man that makes him accountable for his actions, and where there is no reason there is no crime . . . .\u201d 2 Z. Swift, Digest of the Laws of Connecticut (1823) p. 361 (Z. Swift, Digest). He further noted that \u201ca court, and jury must exercise a sound discretion in particular cases, <em>always acquitting where there is a reasonable doubt of capacity . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Furthermore, it is clear that in the colonial days and into the time of Swift\u2019s writings, Connecticut jurists relied upon Blackstone as a source of the common law. Blackstone classified sanity as an essential element of a crime, noting that \u201can unwarrantable act without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>vicious will is no crime at all.\u201d 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (Carey Ed. 1916), Book 4, p. 2175.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Justice Swift\u2019s writing on the law of capacity is particularly important. He was instrumental in encouraging the public and the legislature to convene the constitutional convention of 1818. Although he pursued a written constitution in order to achieve separation of powers, his participation as a leader is significant. J. Trumbull, Historical Notes on the Constitutions of Connecticut and on the Constitutional Convention of 1818 (1873) pp. 40-41.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, since Justice Swift was the chief judge and the state\u2019s leading judicial scholar at the time of the convention, his views on the law take on great significance in determining what the framers had in mind when adopting the language of the constitution. See W. Horton, \u201cConnecticut Constitutional History 1776-1988,\u201d 64 Conn. B.J. 355, 356-58 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Connecticut law has consistently provided that an individual could not be subject to punishment without the \u201cmind and capacity, reason and understanding enough to enable him to judge of the nature, character and consequence of the act charged against him, that the act is wrong and criminal, and that the commission of it will justly and properly expose him to penalty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>158 Conn. 341, 354, 260 A.2d 587 (1969), vacated on other grounds, 408 U.S. 935, 92 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Ct. 2856, 33 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1972). Although the state was initially entitled to rely on the presumption that the defendant was sane when the crime was committed, once the defendant introduced substantial evidence tending to prove insanity, \u201cthe burden rest[ed] upon the state, <em>as it [did] in all other essential elements in the case, </em>to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was legally sane and responsible at the time the offenses were committed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Conte, </em>157 Conn. 209, 212, 251 A.2d 81 (1968), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 964, 90 S.

This has always been the law of our state, rooted in constitutional precedent, until 1983 when the legislature designated the insanity defense an \u201caffirmative defense.\u201d See Public Acts 1983, No. 83-486, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The majority circumvents the longstanding history of placing the burden of proof of sanity on the state by noting that there is no temporal case law to indicate that the state bore the burden of proof on this issue prior to 1818.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In so stating, the majority ignores firmly stated common law\u2014from Blackstone to Chief Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Swift\u2014that defines sanity as an element of the crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the majority ignores the early cases that followed the constitutional convention and can rationally be presumed to have stated the traditional common law. These early cases followed Blackstone and Swift by placing the burden of proof on the issue of sanity on the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Indeed, approximately half of the jurisdictions require the state to prove the defendant\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. K. Fritz, \u201cThe Proposed Federal Insanity Defense: Should the Quality of Mercy Suffer for the Sake of Safety?\u201d 22 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 49, 54 (1984). \u201cThe presumption of sanity is merely the general assumption that, ordinarily, human beings are of sound mind. Sanity and insanity are terms applicable to the mode of operation of the mind as judged by some accepted standard of normality. But as soon as the fact of sanity is put in issue (i.e., where some evidence of mental disorder is introduced), the prevailing rule in most jurisdictions is that sanity, like any other fact, must be proved as part of the prosecution\u2019s case beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, when all the evidence is in, if there remains a reasonable doubt as to the accused\u2019s responsibility, on the ground of insanity and the tests of irresponsibility, there is a reasonable doubt upon the whole issue of his guilt, and he should accordingly be acquitted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) S. Glueck, Mental Disorder and the Criminal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(1925) pp. 41-42; see also W.

Wigmore, Evidence (4th Ed. 1981) \u00a7 2501, p. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The Colorado Supreme Court, presented with the sanity issue, held that a statute that imposed upon the defendant the burden of proving insanity by a preponderance of the evidence violated the due process provision of its state constitution. \u201cAll Colorado decisions from the beginning of territorial days to the present require application of the rule that total guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. Mental capacity to commit a crime is a material part of total guilt for there can be no crime without the mens rea.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>District Court for County of Jefferson, </em>165 Colo. 253, 265, 439 P.2d 741 (1968). The Arizona court similarly held that a statute that provided for two trials\u2014 the first to determine the issue of guilt or innocence and the second to consider the insanity defense-violated the due process provision of the state constitution. \u201cThe bifurcated trial would require the jury to find the intent or the intention solely from the circumstances connected with the offense . . . and the question of sound mind would have to be presented at the second trial which gives rise to the question of whether this is due process of law .... If an individual is insane he would not be able to intend an act, nor would he be able to premeditate or have malice aforethought.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>106 Ariz. 103, 109, 471 P.2d 715 (1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1009, 91 S. Ct. 569, 27 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">By labeling mental disease or defect an affirmative defense that the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence, the legislature and the majority of this court condone a constitutionally impermissible shift of the state\u2019s burden to prove every element of its case. This shift violates our notions of fundamental fairness by violating the time honored rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that \u201c[i]t is the duty of the Government to establish [a defendant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This notion\u2014basic in our law and rightly one of the boasts of a free society\u2014is a requirement and a safeguard of due process of law in the historic, procedural content of \u2018due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>supra, 802-803 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The defendant also claims that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13 violate principles of fairness, justice and morality that are deeply embedded in natural law and in the due process provisions of our state constitution, particularly the protections of article first, \u00a7 9, which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly warranted by law.\u201d Although the majority acknowledges that natural law principles were widely discussed in colonial America, it concludes that \u201cwe are not prepared to hold that the defense of insanity is so central to the issue of criminal culpability that allocating the burden of proof to the defendant, by the preponderance of the evidence, is constitutionally impermissible. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Natural law, which pervaded eighteenth century legal thought throughout America, including Connecticut, is but one of many factors that must be considered in interpreting our state constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Natural law theories played a role in shaping the intent of the delegates and the citizens who enacted Connecticut\u2019s charter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>liberty; accordingly, it is a necessary part of our analysis. \u201cThe framers of our state constitution, like those of the federal constitution, when drafting these clauses had in mind those fundamental [individual] rights, sometimes referred to as \u2018natural rights,\u2019 which the people took for granted as being deeply rooted in the core of liberty. Justice Zephaniah Swift . . . recognized and defended natural rights as follows: \u2018Natural rights consist in the enjoyment and exercise of a power to do as we think proper, without any other restraint than what results from the law of nature, or what may be denominated the moral law. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>40 Conn.

Christopher Collier, a professor and historian for the state of Connecticut, has noted that \u201cto Connecticut jurists, common law meant more than judicial precedent and case law; it included the natural law as well.\u201d C. Collier, \u201cThe Connecticut Declaration of Rights Before the Constitution of 1818: A Victim of Revolutionary Redefinition,\u201d 15 Conn. L. Rev. 87, 94 (1982). The Fundamental Orders (1638-1639), arguably Connecticut\u2019s first written constitution, were based upon the natural law premise that \u201c \u2018where a people are gathered together the word of God requires that to maintain the peace and union of such a people there should be an orderly and decent Government established according to God, to order and dispose of the affairs of the people at all seasons as occasion shall require.\u2019 \u201d W. Aspell, \u201cNatural Law in the Connecticut Tradition,\u201d 31 Conn. B.J. 105, 105-106 (1957). Professor Tribe, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, points out that some authorities have \u201cinsisted that an intense and widely shared adherence to natural rights ideas by the Constitution\u2019s framers led them to neglect more specific mention of rights deemed too obvious to require elabo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ration.\u201d L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 15-3, p. 1310; see also 2 C. Antieau, Modern Constitutional Law (1969) \u00a7 15:44. \u201cThe notion that governmental authority has implied limits which preserve private autonomy predates the establishment of the American republic. During the 17th and 18th centuries, there evolved an American tradition of \u2018natural law,\u2019 postdating that \u2018certain principles of right and justice . . . are entitled to prevail of their own intrinsic excellence.\u2019 \u201d L. Tribe, supra, \u00a7 8-1, p. 560; D. Farber &amp; S. Sherry, A History of the American Constitution (1990) p. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">One of the implicit principles of right and justice is the idea that moral culpability is essential to guilt. To punish for their acts those who cannot be held morally accountable would be cruel and unacceptable. 2 Z. Swift, Digest, supra, p. 362. \u201cThe formulations [of the insanity defense] come to us as part of a tradition which makes the notion of \u2018desert\u2019 or \u2018blame\u2019 central to criminal responsibility and which tries to define a class of persons who fall outside the boundaries of blame.\u201d A. Goldstein, The Insanity Defense (1967) pp. 9-10. In Connecticut, it is clear that punishment was imposed only on those individuals who freely \u201cchoose and practice evil, and . . . refuse and counteract that which is just, right and good . . . for on freedom of choosing, depends the merit or demerit of every action.\u201d 1 Root (Conn.), supra, p. xxx. The notion of blame is deeply embedded in Connecticut tradition and is implicit in our concept of liberty and fundamental fairness. To require that the defendant assume the burden of proving insanity or lack of culpability by a preponderance of the evidence violates this essential principle of due process. The defendant is forced to assume the risk on an issue that bears directly on his culpability and places him in the position of being punished when not \u201cclearly warranted by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that the framers of the 1818 constitution intended to incorporate within the constitution and its due process protections fundamental principles founded on the history of legal and moral thought. It is also significant, in assessing the framers\u2019 intent, that the inhabitants of this state were deeply religious, and that their religious convictions played an important role in shaping Connecticut law. Id., pp. xxi-xxiii. \u201cThe requirement of moral culpability for criminal condemnation reaches back to the origins of Western ethical and legal thought. . . . Hebrew law distinguished between the harmful act that was traceable to fault and that which occurred without fault. . . . The Greek moral philosophers, at least as far back as the fifth century B. C., considered the distinction between a culpable and non-culpable act to be among the \u2018unwritten laws of nature and supported by the universal moral sense of mankind\u2019 .... The same view pervaded Roman law and appears in the moral teaching of the early Christian Church Fathers. It emerges in Anglo-Saxon law no later than the twelfth century. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) American Bar Association, First Tentative Draft, Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards (1983), \u00a7 7-6.1, p. 7-271 n.3. This fundamental premise has endured and is embedded in the common law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In addition to the history and tradition leading up to our state constitution, practical and sociological concerns also compel the conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13 violate article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution. As the majority acknowledges in footnote 5 of its opinion, \u201ca jury may have difficulty in understanding the distinction between mental status as it relates to the defense of insanity and mental status as it relates to intent.\u201d The majority concludes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>nevertheless, that any confusion may be addressed by an appropriate jury instruction. I am not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Sanity is an elusive issue that has been the source of disagreement and uncertainty among legal minds and is certain to baffle jurors. To say that the jury is capable of sorting out issues of intent and culpability, especially in the emotionally charged atmosphere associated with a trial in which the defendant\u2019s sanity is at issue, is to ignore the reality of our jury system. These issues are complex not only for jurors, but for lawyers and psychiatrists as well. We should not divorce ourselves from the realities of the courtroom by underestimating the difficulty that the sanity issue presents to the average juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u201cEver since our ancestral common law emerged out of the darkness of its early barbaric days, it has been a postulate of Western civilization that the taking of life by the hand of an insane person is not murder. But the nature and operation of the mind are so elusive to the grasp of the understanding that the basis for formulating standards of criminal responsibility and the means for determining whether those standards are satisfied in a particular case have greatly troubled law and medicine for more than a century.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Baldi, </em>344 U.S. 561, 570, 73 S. Ct. 391, 97 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), overruled, <em>Ake </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 105 S. Ct. 1087, 84 L. Ed. 2d 53 (1985). Chief Justice Swift echoed this sentiment, noting that \u201c[n]o precise rule can be laid down, and a court, and jury must exercise a sound discretion in particular cases, always acquitting where there is a reasonable doubt of capacity: and though a man has some faint glimmerings of reason, yet if he does not comprehend the consequences of what he is doing, cannot distinguish between right, and wrong, and is rather actuated by a blind impulse, he cannot be considered as a moral, and accountable agent.\u201d 2 Z. Swift, Digest, supra, p. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cThe function of a standard of proof, as that concept is embodied in the Due Process Clause and in the realm of factfinding, is to \u2018instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.\u2019 <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 370 [90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368] (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring).

Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979). For me, proof that a defendant had the mental capacity to form the intent necessary to commit the crime charged is of such importance that the risk of error must fall on the state\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Given Connecticut\u2019s longstanding tradition of recognizing sanity as an element of the state\u2019s case, a tradition so fundamental that it is firmly embedded in our constitutional guarantee of due process, I would hold that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13, insofar as they place the burden of proof of insanity on the defendant after the issue of sanity has been raised, violate article first, \u00a7\u00a78 and 9 of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-11\"> See footnote 2 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-12\"> See footnote 5, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-13\">I agree with the majority that the defendant has neither adequately raised nor briefed the claim that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13 are unconstitutional as a matter of federal constitutional law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), we noted that the following tools of analysis should be considered in construing the contours of our state constitution: (1) the textual approach; (2) holdings and dicta of this court and the Appellate Court; (3) federal precedent; (4) sister state decisions; (5) the historical approach; and (6) economic/sociological considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> Article first, \u00a7 9 of the Connecticut constitution of 1818 provides in relevant part: \u201c[The accused] shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, but by due course of law. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution of 1965 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Both article first, \u00a7 10 of the Connecticut constitution of 1818 and article first, \u00a7 9 of the Connecticut constitution of 1965 provide: \u201cNo person shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly warranted by law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> \u201cThe 1818 debates are crucial for another reason.

As a result, judges relied most heavily on Blackstone and Swift. See W. Horton, \u201cConnecticut Constitutional History 1776-1988,\u201d 64 Conn.
