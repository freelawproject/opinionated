The statute establishes the procedures that govern adjudication of a defendant\u2019s competency to be tried, convicted or sentenced in criminal proceedings, once a defendant\u2019s competency has been called into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The procedural history of this case establishes that a jury found the defendant guilty of having committed the crimes of attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-54a, assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), and burglary in the first degree in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>lation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction, from which the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>28 Conn. App. 548, 557, 611 A.2d 916 (1992). We then granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>224 Conn. 907, 615 A.2d 1049 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The issue that we certified is: \u201cDid the Appellate Court correctly hold that the record was inadequate to rule whether General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d was unconstitutionally applied to the defendant?\u201d Recognizing that no issue concerning the constitutionality of the statute had been raised in the trial court, the Appellate Court refused to address the merits of the defendant\u2019s belated due process challenge in light of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>(1973), as refined by <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The Appellate Court con-eluded that the record was inadequate for <em>Evans-Golding </em>review because \u201c[t]he trial court never ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion for a competency hearing and, therefore, \u00a7 54-56d was never applied to the defendant. Without a hearing on the motion, and without findings or rulings of the trial court, there is no record to review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In this court, the defendant argues that the trial court impliedly denied his motion for a competency hearing, while the state maintains that the defendant impliedly waived his motion by failing to renew it after the trial court had apparently resolved the immediate difficulties that led to the defendant\u2019s motion. The most that can be said for the defendant\u2019s contention is that the trial court proceedings, fully described in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 551-52; are arguably ambiguous about the trial court\u2019s response to the defendant\u2019s motion. Such an ambiguity would support the conclusion of the Appellate Court that the defendant has failed to provide a record that is adequate for appellate review of his belated constitutional challenge to the validity of \u00a7 54-56d as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Because the application of \u00a7 54-56d to the defendant is a prerequisite to his due process challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, and because that issue was fully explored by the Appellate Court, it would serve no useful purpose for us to address the substantive merits of the defendant\u2019s claim. After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude, therefore, that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>See <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>220 Conn. 453, 455, 599 A.2d 380 (1991); <em>Lawler </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>212 Conn. 117, 119, 561 A.2d 128 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d provides in relevant part: \u201ccompetency to STAND TRIAL, (a) COMPETENCY REQUIRED, definition.
