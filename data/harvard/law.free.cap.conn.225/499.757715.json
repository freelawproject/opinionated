J.</author>\n<p id=\"Att\">This appeal requires us to determine whether the commissioner of motor vehicles may direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a licensed motor vehicle operator, because of a disability, to submit regular medical reports as a condition of continuing to hold an operator\u2019s license. The plaintiff, Edward Daly, who suffers from a seizure disorder, challenges the decision of the defendant, Lawrence DelPonte, commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner), to condition his holding an operator\u2019s license on his compliance with reporting requirements regarding his medical status. Both the trial court and the Appellate Court upheld the commissioner\u2019s initial suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license and the later imposition of postreinstatement medical reporting requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Daly </em>v. DelPonte, 27 Conn. App. 495, 608 A.2d 93 (1992). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff possesses a Connecticut motor vehicle operator\u2019s license, which he has held continuously since its first issuance in 1978. Until the action by the commissioner to suspend the plaintiff\u2019s license, the plaintiff had no record of any adverse administrative action regarding his license. Furthermore, the plaintiff has never been involved in any reported motor vehicle accident or other incident resulting either from his seizure episodes or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>In July, 1986, the plaintiff suffered a seizure, which resulted in altered consciousness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, beginning in October, 1986, the plaintiff began treatment and supervised care under the direction of a neurologist. The plaintiff informed the neurologist of the July, 1986 seizure and also that he had had several seizure episodes during the previous two years. The neurologist prescribed the medication tegretol to control the seizures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since 1986 the plaintiff has reported regularly to the neurologist and has complied with the prescribed medication regimen to attempt to control the seizure disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Despite these preventive measures, in July, 1987, the plaintiff suffered another seizure. The commissioner, who is the plaintiff\u2019s employer, thereafter required the plaintiff to submit periodic medical reports from his neurologist regarding his condition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the first report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>submitted in August, 1987, the neurologist indicated that the plaintiff was taking tegretol and that his blood level testing was within the proper therapeutic range. A second report in January, 1989, again indicated that the plaintiff\u2019s blood level was within the proper therapeutic range and that he continued to comply with the prescribed medication regimen. Neither the August, 1987 nor the January, 1989 report indicated any seizure activity subsequent to the July, 1987 episode. The commissioner took no action regarding the plaintiff\u2019s status as a holder of a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license until March, 1989, when he formally placed the plaintiff on medical probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The plaintiff had been free of any medical difficulties for nearly two years, until May, 1989, when he suffered his most recent seizure. A subsequent report prepared by the neurologist again found that the plaintiff\u2019 s blood level tests and medication compliance were proper. The neurologist issued an additional statement expressly concluding that the plaintiff was capable of regular full-time work, including required driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The commissioner had thus received reports of three seizure episodes of the plaintiff covering a period of thirty-three months. Concerned about the ability of the plaintiff safely to operate a motor vehicle, the commissioner forwarded the three neurological reports to the department of motor vehicles medical advisory board<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>(board) and requested the board to review the plaintiffs record. To enable the board to collect additional information regarding the plaintiffs medical status, the board recommended that the plaintiffs license be temporarily suspended. In particular, the board sought to confer with the plaintiff\u2019s neurologist in order to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>a more detailed assessment of the plaintiff\u2019s condition. Acting on this recommendation, the commissioner suspended the plaintiff\u2019s license, effective August, 1989. The notice of suspension indicated that, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-111 (a), the commissioner was suspending the plaintiffs license because the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccontinued operation of a motor vehicle would be dangerous to [the plaintiff] and others.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The plaintiff requested an administrative hearing to contest the suspension. The hearing was held on three separate dates during the fall of 1989 and dealt with the plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the suspension then in effect. Both parties focused the presentation of their evidence at the hearing solely on the basis and details of the suspension. The board heard nothing, therefore, regarding appropriate or possible recommendations for the length of the license suspension, a basis to reinstate the license, or conditions to be placed on the license upon reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The hearing officer filed his administrative decision on January 2,1990. The factual findings, which recited the facts as presented above, did not address the issues of reinstatement or conditions thereon. The hearing officer found that the plaintiff was not \u201ca proper person to hold a Connecticut operator\u2019s license\u201d and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>fore, concluded that the commissioner\u2019s suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license had been valid. The hearing officer further determined that the suspension would remain in effect until May 4, 1990, at which time the plaintiff would be eligible for reinstatement of his license. The hearing officer also ordered, however, that upon reinstatement of the license, and as a condition of reinstatement, the plaintiff would be required to submit periodic medical reports to the commissioner. Such reports would be required every three months for three years; additional reports were to be required in the event of another seizure episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The plaintiff appealed from the administrative decision to the trial court and claimed, in addition to other challenges not relevant to the certified questions in this appeal, that the commissioner\u2019s decision regarding the postreinstatement reporting requirements lacked statutory or regulatory authority and that the commissioner\u2019s decision prejudiced the substantial rights afforded to him by the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s administrative appeal, and the plaintiff appealed the judgment to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In the Appellate Court, the plaintiff reasserted his arguments that the commissioner had acted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>statutory authority and that his decisions regarding the initial suspension and postreinstatement requirements had violated the state constitution. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 496. That court rejected both of the plaintiffs challenges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Regarding the authority of the commissioner to impose postreinstatement reporting requirements, the court determined that the plaintiff was an \u201capplicant\u201d for the purpose of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-36 (e)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because, although he was already a license holder, the reinstatement following a suspension placed his license in the category of those issued to \u201capplicants.\u201d Id., 500. Because the plaintiff was, therefore, an \u201capplicant,\u201d the commissioner could properly impose medical reporting requirements as a condition of licensing. Id., 500-501. Next, the Appellate Court determined that the commissioner\u2019s decision survived the plaintiff\u2019s state equal protection challenge. Reviewing the administrative action pursuant to a strict scrutiny standard, the court concluded that the state has a compelling interest in highway safety and that the \u201creporting requirements placed on the plaintiff are both necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve this goal.\u201d Id., 506. The Appellate Court, accordingly, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal to determine whether the commissioner has statutory authority to impose postreinstatement med<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ical reporting requirements and, if so, whether his exercise of such authority in the circumstances of this case violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>223 Conn. 903, 610 A.2d 177 (1992). Although we agree with the Appellate Court that the commissioner has statutory authority to condition a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license on the licensee\u2019s reporting his or her medical status, we determine that in this case the commissioner\u2019s exercise of that authority violated the equal protection provision of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The first question before this court is whether the commissioner has the statutory authority to direct a licensed motor vehicle operator to submit periodic medical reports as a condition of the continued possession of the license. The Appellate Court concluded that the commissioner has such authority pursuant to \u00a7 14-36 (e), which provides, in part, for the issuing of licenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff challenges this conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>claiming that \u00a7 14-36 (e) authorizes the commissioner to place conditions only on a license issued to an applicant who does not already hold a Connecticut license.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The plaintiff makes a plausible argument that \u00a7 14-36 (e) addresses a category of new applicants that would not include a license holder such as the plaintiff. We need not, however, resolve this issue because other statutes confer on the commissioner the authority to condition continued possession and use of an already issued license.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Pursuant to its police powers, the legislature has given the commissioner of motor vehicles broad discretion to oversee and control the operation of motor vehicles generally. General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-3 directs the commissioner to \u201cenforce the provisions of the statutes concerning motor vehicles and the operators of such vehicles.\u201d In furtherance of this authorization, General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-111 (a) provides that the commissioner superintend the use of licenses: \u201cNo provision of this chapter [Chapter 246, \u201cMotor Vehicles\u201d] shall be construed to prohibit the commissioner from suspending or revoking any registration or any operator\u2019s license . . . or from suspending the right of any person to operate a motor vehicle in this state . . . for any cause that [the commissioner] deems sufficient, with or without a hearing. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Because of the commissioner\u2019s authority pursuant to \u00a7 14-111, the issue in this case becomes whether the authority to suspend encompasses the authority to condition the reinstatement and subsequent holding of an already issued license. Although \u00a7 14-111 does not provide specific guidance on this issue, we conclude, for three reasons, that the commissioner has such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>First, we have elsewhere recognized that the legislature\u2019s broad grant of power may be interpreted to include the conferral of such lesser included powers as are necessary to fulfill a legislative mandate. See <em>Bottone </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>209 Conn. 652, 670, 553 A.2d 576 (1989),. It is unlikely that the legislature would have authorized the commissioner to suspend operators\u2019 licenses without intending also to authorize him to employ alternatives short of suspension if such alternatives sufficiently serve the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Second, other statutes relating to the authority of the commissioner indicate that the legislature intended to confer upon him the authority to condition previously issued licenses. Because the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law, we read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter. See <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>215 Conn. 474, 482-83, 576 A,2d 510 (1990); <em>Dart &amp; Bogue Co. </em>v. <em>Slosberg, </em>202 Conn. 566, 575, 522 A.2d 763 (1987). The statutory sections that provide for the medical advisory board; see footnote 6; empower the board to \u201cadvise the commissioner on the medical aspects and concerns of licensing operators of motor vehicles\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 14-46b (a); and instruct the board to \u201cmake recommendations and offer advice on individual health problem cases referred by the commissioner and to establish guidelines for dealing with such individual cases.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-46c (6). In a similar vein, General Statutes \u00a7 14-46g provides that \u201c[a]ny person whose operator\u2019s license has been suspended, restricted or revoked or whose application for an operator\u2019s license has been denied under sections 14-46a to 14-46f, inclusive, shall have the right of appeal . . . .\u201d These sections elucidate that the legislature intended to authorize the commissioner to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cindividual cases,\u201d which, in light of the variety of recommendations that may issue from the board, will not all require complete license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In addition, the legislature\u2019s recent amendment to a related motor vehicle statute confirms the legislature\u2019s intent to confer such authority on the commissioner. We have recognized that a subsequent amendment to an existing statute may clarify the legislature\u2019s original intent. See <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 471, 556 A.2d 145 (1989). Regarding the motor vehicle statutes, the legislature amended \u00a7 14-36 (e) in 1990 to give the commissioner extensive authority to regulate the status of licenses. See Public Acts 1990, No. 90-265, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We note, finally, that a construction of the motor vehicle statutes permitting licenses to be restricted rather than suspended is in the best interests of licensed motor vehicle operators. Operators benefit by being able to retain and make use of a license, even with reporting conditions, rather than having to forfeit all use of a motor vehicle, a loss that would be particularly onerous in a society dependent on automotive transportation. It is, therefore, altogether reasonable for the legislature to allow the commissioner to make such determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner has the statutory authority to take measures, other than suspension, to supervise the use of licenses. This power includes the authority to impose postreinstatement medical reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">The decision that the commissioner has the statutory authority to impose postreinstatement medical reporting requirements on the plaintiff does not end our inquiry. We must also decide whether the manner in which the commissioner exercised his authority com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ports with the requirements of our state constitution. The plaintiff claims that the commissioner\u2019s imposition of postreinstatement medical reporting requirements in the circumstances of this case violated the state constitution\u2019s equal protection and due process clauses. We agree with the plaintiff that his right to equal protection was violated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, we must determine the standard of review by which his claim is to be governed. The Appellate Court concluded that the commissioner\u2019s action must be subjected to strict constitutional scrutiny. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 504. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">It is undisputed that the commissioner\u2019s decision to place conditions on the plaintiff\u2019s license was based on the plaintiff\u2019s status as an individual who suffers from a medical disability. Our state constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.\u201d Conn. Const., amend. XXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Although this court has not previously decided what level of judicial scrutiny is appropriate for a claimed violation of amendment twenty-one, there are a number of relevant guideposts in our past decisions. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>interpretation of our state constitution, we have often consulted the case law under the federal constitution;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> see <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 418, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988); which affords varying levels of review to equal protection claims depending upon the classes of persons protected thereby. See, e.g., <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 446, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985) (classifications based on physical or mental disability subject to rational basis scrutiny); <em>Palmore </em>v. <em>Sidoti, </em>466 U.S. 429, 433-34, 104 S. Ct. 1879, 80 L. Ed. 2d 421 (1984) (classifications based on race subject to strict scrutiny); <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S. Ct. 451, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1976), reh. denied, 429 U.S. 1124, 97 S. Ct. 1161, 51 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1977) (classifications based on gender subject to intermediate scrutiny). We have held, in accordance with the federal frame of analysis, that state action concerning social and economic regulation will survive an equal protection challenge if it satisfies a rational basis test. See <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 540, 542-43, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975). If, however, state action invidiously discriminates against a suspect class or affects a fundamental right, the action passes constitutional muster under the state constitution only if it survives strict scrutiny. See id., 542. In appropriate circumstances, we have interpreted the equal protection provisions of the state constitution differently than that contained in the federal constitution, particularly when the distinctive language of our constitution calls for an independent construction. See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 641-45, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Turning to amendment twenty-one, we conclude that its explicit prohibition of discrimination because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>physical disability defines a constitutionally protected class of persons whose rights are protected by requiring encroachments on these rights to pass a strict scrutiny test.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See generally R. Berdon, \u201cConnecticut Equal Protection Clause: Requirement of Strict Scrutiny When Classifications are Based Upon Sex, Physical Disability or Mental Disability,\u201d 64 Conn. B. J. 386 (1990). This conclusion follows from the language of the clause itself: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law . . . because of . . . physical or mental disability.\u201d In other contexts, we have held that a statutory prohibition of discrimination against designated classes of individuals makes any such discriminatory conduct \u2018suspect.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Connecticut Institute for the Blind </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>176 Conn. 88, 95, 405 A.2d 618 (1978). A constitutional provision to outlaw discrimination cannot be given a lesser effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Our conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the constitutional amendment. Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr., stated, during Senate debates about its proposal, that \u201c[w]here the court finds significant state action it will subject segregation or discrimination complaints to strict judicial scrutiny . . . .\u201d 26 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1983 Sess., p. 3170. In the House of Represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tatives, Representative Richard D. Tulisano stated that the amendment was intended to require application of strict scrutiny analysis to classifications based on physical or mental disability. 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1983 Sess., p. 3975. Similar statements were made by Representatives Christine M. Niedermeier and Naomi K. Cohen. Id., pp. 3991, 3993.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We conclude, therefore, that amendment twenty-one\u2019s protection for those possessing physical and mental disabilities identifies the members of this class as a group especially subject to discrimination and requires the application of the highest standard of review to vindicate their constitutional rights. As the Appellate Court held, that standard requires strict scrutiny of the challenged government action.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Applying a strict scrutiny standard, we must determine whether the commissioner\u2019s exercise of his authority to condition the reinstated license in this case violated the plaintiff\u2019s right to equal protection under amendment twenty-one. The plaintiff maintains that the commissioner violated this constitutional right by imposing particular conditions\u2014the submission of medical reports every three months for three years\u2014 without reference to any articulated standard justifying their imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Strict scrutiny analysis requires state action resulting in unequal treatment to be justified in two particulars. State action can survive constitutional scrutiny only if it (1) serves a compelling state interest, and (2) is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 640. In this case, the plaintiff does not dispute that the state\u2019s asserted interest in highway safety is a compelling state interest. See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>212 Conn. 176, 184, 561 A.2d 1378, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1003, 110 S. Ct. 563, 107 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The only issue before us is, therefore, whether the action taken was sufficiently narrowly tailored to serve the state\u2019s interest in highway safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The Appellate Court determined that the reporting requirements imposed on the plaintiff were both necessary to protect the public safety and narrowly tailored to achieve this goal. The Appellate Court emphasized that the plaintiff was allowed to drive during this reporting period, that the reporting period was of limited duration, and that the reporting requirements were specifically limited to facts relating to the plaintiff\u2019s neurological disorder. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The plaintiff maintains, however, that the conditions imposed by the commissioner were not narrowly tailored because they did not directly address the plaintiff\u2019s particular medical condition and circumstances. As an example of the commissioner\u2019s limited inquiry, the plaintiff points to the absence of any administrative inquiry into the prognosis for his having future seizure episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In an analogous context, in <em>Connecticut Institute for the Blind </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, we reviewed the Connecticut Institute for the Blind\u2019s general exclusion of visually impaired individuals from positions as teacher\u2019s aides. In that case, which challenged the Institute\u2019s practice as violative of Connecticut\u2019s Fair Employment Practices Act, then General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7\u00a7 31-122 through 31-128, we were required to determine whether the general exclusion was justified by a \u201c \u2018bona fide occupational . . . need.\u2019 \u201d Id., 93-96; General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 31-126 (a). We struck down the general exclusion by noting that \u201c[i]t is, however, eminently clear that the [Institute\u2019s] blanket exclusion of anyone without normal visual acuity, <em>without any effort to define </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>the specifications of the position </em>of teacher\u2019s aide <em>or to test the capacities of the complainant </em>for that position, cannot stand.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In this case the commissioner determined that the plaintiff must report his medical status every three months for three years. The record contains no evidence that this reporting requirement was narrowly tailored either to the plaintiff\u2019s condition at the time of its issuance or to his probable future condition for the designated time period. As in <em>Connecticut Institute for the Blind </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, the conditions here were imposed \u201cwithout any effort to define the specifications . . . or to test the capacities of the complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We recognize that the search for a \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d set of conditions may well leave discretion for the commissioner to choose among a number of medically reasonable responses that take into account the plaintiff\u2019s physical condition as well as the public\u2019s need for highway safety. In the face of medical disagreement about the proper treatment and prognosis for individuals suffering seizure disorders, an appropriate administrative inquiry may provide the foundation for the consideration of a number of medically responsible options. In this case, for example, the plaintiff\u2019s neurologist conceded that his own opinion regarding the plaintiff\u2019s condition was not an opinion with which all neurologists would concur. What the commissioner may not do, however, is to select a set of conditions that has no foundation whatsoever in the record. Neither the commissioner nor the hearing officer had the medical expertise to make an independent assessment of the risks posed by this plaintiff\u2019s driving and the relationship of proposed reporting requirements to minimizing that risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The essence of the plaintiffs legitimate complaint in this case lies, therefore, in the conjunction of his due process<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and equal protection rights. In this case, the commissioner initially attempted to obtain a medically sound determination regarding the plaintiffs condition. Furthermore, the commissioner properly afforded the plaintiff a hearing regarding the license suspension. The commissioner\u2019s order is constitutionally defective, however, because it lacks support from an appropriately structured administrative inquiry into the proper scope of postreinstatement conditions tailored to the condition of this plaintiff. The legislature has put into place statutory authorization for precisely such a process of inquiry. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-46a through 14-46g; footnote 6. To safeguard the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection rights, the commissioner must avail himself of these processes so as to develop a medically appropriate response to the plaintiff\u2019s seizure disorder. Without such an inquiry, which the record discloses did not occur in this case, the commissioner\u2019s imposition of reporting requirements violated the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection right to a narrowly tailored remedy to safeguard the public\u2019s interest in safe highways.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court'is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand it to the trial court with direction that the judgment dismissing the administrative appeal be reversed and that the case be remanded to the commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> The commissioner\u2019s initial suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license is not at issue in this appeal.

See General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7\u00a7 14-46c and 14-46e. As a result of No. 90-265 of the 1990 Public Acts, General Statutes \u00a7 14-46 now permits, but does not require, physicians and optometrists to notify the department of motor vehicles of patient medical problems that affect significantly a patient\u2019s ability safely to operate a motor vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\"> The medical advisory board, established in 1981; Public Acts 1981, No. 81-461; is authorized to provide to the commissioner of motor vehicles general and specific recommendations regarding motor vehicle licensing and operation.

See footnote 8. Because at the time of appeal the suspension period had elapsed, the Appellate Court held that questions involving the initial medical probation and suspension decisions were moot. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>27 Conn. App. 495, 499, 502, 608 A.2d 93 (1992). Regarding the plaintiffs claim that the trial court had improperly failed to consider the effect of the commissioner\u2019s illegal ex parte communications, the Appellate Court determined that, because the plaintiff had not sought an articulation or otherwise met his burden to demonstrate harmful error, it would \u201cnot presume that the trial court\u2019s judgment was based on a misapplication of the law.\u201d Id., 508.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\"> See footnote 11, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"><em> </em>General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-36 provides in relevant part: \u201cpersons WHO MAY OPERATE MOTOR VEHICLES; LICENSES; PENALTY. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">\u201c(e) Before granting a license to any applicant who has not held a Connecticut motor vehicle operator\u2019s license during the preceding two years, the commissioner shall require the applicant to demonstrate personally to him, his deputy or a motor vehicle inspector or an agent of the commissioner, in such manner as the commissioner directs, that the applicant is a proper person to operate motor vehicles of the class for which he has applied, has sufficient knowledge of the mechanism of the motor vehicles to ensure their safe operation by him and his satisfactory knowledge of the laws concerning motor vehicles and rules of the road. . . .
