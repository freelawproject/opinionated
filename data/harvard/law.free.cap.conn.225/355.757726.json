Murray, with four counts of criminal contempt in violation of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 985 and 986 (4). On the motion of the defendant, the trial court rendered a judgment dismissing the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>because, in its view, the legislature has abrogated the judiciary\u2019s inherent power to adjudicate a charge of contempt of court for conduct occurring outside the presence of the court. The state has appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>In March, 1990, William B. Lewis, a judge of the Superior Court, issued a temporary restraining order against the defendant, ordering him not to disclose to any person information relating to personnel matters at the Boulder, Colorado facility of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) that the defendant had obtained while serving as IBM\u2019s area counsel in Boulder. In June, 1990, Judge Lewis issued a temporary injunction against the defendant enjoining him from disclosing certain other material, referred to as \u201cthe DeRoma and Akers material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Subsequently, the state brought this four count information. The state accused the defendant of \u201ccriminal contempt\u201d in each count, and alleged in the first two counts that on March 19, 1990, and April 23, 1990, respectively, the defendant \u201cdid engage in conduct directed against the dignity and authority of the court when, in the course of a civil proceeding, he wilfully disobeyed a valid order of a judicial authority,\u201d namely, the March, 1990 temporary restraining order issued by Judge Lewis. In the third and fourth counts, the state alleged that on January 4, 1991, the defendant \u201cdid engage in conduct directed against the dignity and authority of the court when, in the course of a civil proceeding, he wilfully disobeyed a valid order of a judicial authority,\u201d namely, the June, 1990 temporary injunction issued by Judge Lewis. In all four counts, the state alleged that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal contempt [was] in violation of Connecticut common law as defined in Sections 985 and 986 (4) of the Practice Book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The defendant moved to dismiss the information pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 815 (8).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He asserted that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(1) since the enactment in 1971 of General Statutes \u00a7 51-33a, all criminal contempts of court\u2014whether in or outside the presence of the court\u2014are regulated by statute; (2) because this prosecution was not authorized by statute, it violates the separation of powers required by article second of the Connecticut constitution; and (3) insofar as Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 985 and 986 (4) authorize punishment for activity not in or critically near a court, such provisions are invalid because they go beyond the court\u2019s inherent power and beyond statutory authority, thereby violating the separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that, under the doctrine of separation of powers, the classification of crimes is a legislative function, and that the legislature had performed that function with regard to criminal contempt of court by enacting General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-33* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 51-33a.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court also reasoned that neither statute classifies as criminal the conduct proscribed by Practice Book \u00a7 986 (4), namely, \u201cdisobeying in the course of a civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>or criminal proceeding any order of a judicial authority.\u201d The trial court concluded, therefore, that \u00a7 986 (4) was unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers, and the information had to be dismissed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 815 (8). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that (1) the legislature has abrogated the court\u2019s inherent power to punish, as criminal contempt of court, conduct occurring outside the court\u2019s presence that violates a judicial order, and (2) Practice Book \u00a7 986 (4) violates the separation of powers. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We begin by noting what this appeal does not involve. Contrary to the assertion of the defendant, it does not involve the question of whether the court orders that the defendant allegedly violated applied outside Connecticut. Nor does it involve the question of whether the trial court could have imposed civil rather than criminal sanctions for contempt of court. The defendant specifically \u201cdoes not dispute a court\u2019s authority to impose civil sanctions to obtain [compliance with] its lawful orders.\u201d Furthermore, we do not consider, and express no opinion regarding, certain claims that the defendant purports to raise as alternate grounds to sustain the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 985 through 994 govern criminal contempt of court. Sections 985 and 986 govern the nature of the conduct involved, the purpose of the sanctions, and the persons who may be punished. Section 985 defines a criminal contempt of court as \u201cconduct that is directed against the dignity and authority of the court,\u201d and provides that the sanction for such conduct \u201cis punitive in order to vindicate the authority of the court.\u201d Section 986 governs who maybe punished, \u201cby fine or imprisonment or both,\u201d for criminal contempt: under subsections (1) through (3), in general terms, persons whose conduct occurs either in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct justice, and officers of the court who misbehave in the performance of their official court duties; and under subsection (4), \u201c[a]ny person disobeying in the course of a civil or criminal proceeding any order of a judicial authority.\u201d In contrast to subsections (1) and (2), therefore, subsection (4) governs conduct occurring outside the presence of the court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7991 through 994 govern nonsummary criminal contempt. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In general terms, these sections determine how such a proceeding may be prosecuted; Practice Book \u00a7 991; see footnote 4;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>may hear such a proceeding; Practice Book \u00a7 992;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the right to a jury trial in such a proceeding; Practice Book \u00a7 993;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the limits of the sanctions that may be imposed. Practice Book \u00a7 994.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">At issue in this case is the power of the trial court to act under \u00a7 986 (4) in a nonsummary fashion by punishing, as criminal contempt of court, conduct occurring outside of the court\u2019s presence, by a \u201cperson disobeying in the course of a civil or criminal proceeding any order of a judicial authority.\u201d We conclude that the court has such inherent power, and that the legislature has not abrogated it by any legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The inherent power of a Connecticut trial court non-summarily to punish, as criminal contempt of court, conduct occurring outside the court\u2019s presence, such as disobedience to a judicial order, has been recognized in an unbroken line of authority from the earliest days of our judiciary to the present. These authorities have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>also consistently recognized that this inherent power is separate and distinct from the statutes regulating the exercise of the contempt power for conduct occurring in the court\u2019s presence. See 2 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1823) pp. 358-59 (\u201cThough the statute only contemplates contempts in presence of the court, yet at common law contempts not in the presence of the court may be-punished in a summary manner .... When courts punish for contempts, committed in their presence, they must inflict a definite fine, or imprison for a certain time in the manner prescribed by the statute: but where they punish for contempts at common law, or not committed in their presence they may imprison till further order of the court . . . .\u201d); <em>Rogers Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. 121, 123 (1871) (criminal contempt for violation of injunction) (\u201cThe limitation provided for punishment of contempts in the presence of courts . . . has no application to contempts by disobedience to the orders and decrees of courts of chancery.\u201d); <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hamersley, </em>44 Conn. 393, 412 (1877) (criminal contempt for disobedience to writ of mandamus) (\u201cContempts are offences at common law against the court as an organ of public justice. The right of punishment is inherent in all courts and is essential for their protection and existence.\u201d); <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>48 Conn. 174, 196 (1880) (criminal contempt for taking property by force from judicial officer who held it for condemnation) (\u201c[T]he statute deals only with acts of contempt committed in the presence of the court, and where no process is required to bring the offender into court. It leaves all other cases of contempt to be ascertained and punished according to the course of the common law.\u201d); <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>52 Conn. 147, 156 (1884) (criminal contempt for falsely causing attorney to secure continuance) (\u201cThere are . . . acts which are in defiance of the power and dignity of the court, but which are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>actually nor constructively in its presence. . . . These . . . are not within the statute, but are defined and punished by the common law.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>80 Conn. 668, 671, 69 A. 1057 (1908) (criminal contempt for publishing newspaper articles about trial) (\u201cThe proceeding in contempt is for an offense against the court as an organ of public justice and not for a violation of the criminal law. The power to punish such offenses is inherent in courts of record, to enable them to preserve their own dignity and to duly administer justice in the causes pending before them.\u201d); <em>McTigue </em>v. <em>New London Education Assn., </em>164 Conn. 348, 353, 321 A.2d 462 (1973) (criminal contempt for violation of injunction) (\u201cIn criminal contempt the sanction is punitive in order to vindicate the authority of the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">These authorities, moreover, are consistent with the law of criminal contempt generally. In the context of a proceeding for criminal contempt based upon violations of an injunction, the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201cThat the power to punish for contempts is inherent in all courts, has been many times decided and may be regarded as settled law. It is essential to the administration of justice. The courts of the United States, when called into existence and vested with jurisdiction over any subject, at once became possessed of the power. . . . The ability to punish disobedience to judicial orders is regarded as essential to ensuring that the Judiciary has a means to vindicate its own authority without complete dependence on other Branches. If a party can make himself a judge of the validity of orders which have been issued, and by his own act of disobedience set them aside, then are the courts impotent, and what the Constitution now fittingly calls the judicial power of the United States would be a mere mockery.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Young </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., </em>481 U.S. 787, 795-96, 107 S. Ct. 2124, 95 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>2d 740 (1987);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> see also R. Goldfarb, The Contempt Power (1963) p. 9 (\u201c[t]he power of courts to punish con-tempts is one which wends historically back to the early days of England and the crown\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">These authorities belie the defendant\u2019s assertion that \u201c[tjhere is no case, and no authority, anywhere in the United States that supports an argument that a court has inherent power to impose criminal sanctions for behavior that does not actually occur in the courtroom.\u201d Unmistakably, our courts have such power, and Practice Book \u00a7 986 (4) reflects the exercise of that power.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>We likewise reject the defendant\u2019s contention that enactments by the legislature have eroded inherent judicial authority over criminal contempts occurring outside the presence of the court. Neither General Statutes \u00a7 51-33 nor General Statutes \u00a7 51-33a; see footnotes 7 and 8; affects that inherent judicial power in any way. The origins of \u00a7 51-33 go back at least to 1821. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 260, 440 A.2d 969 (1982). We have long held that this statute governs only con-tempts of court committed in the court\u2019s presence, and does not affect contemptuous conduct committed outside that presence. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>supra; <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>supra; <em>Rogers Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>supra; see also 2 Z. Swift, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Similarly, the enactment of \u00a7 51-33a in 1971 was not intended to displace the inherent power of the court to punish out-of-court contemptuous conduct. The purpose of \u00a7 51-33a was to comply with the mandate of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1971), in which the court held that due process requires, under certain extreme circumstances, that a criminal contempt be heard by a judge other than the one who was the target of the contemptuous in-court conduct. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra. Section 51-33a does not affect the court\u2019s power regarding out-of-court conduct. Like \u00a7 51-33, it leaves that power to the course of the common law, and to our Practice Book provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 986 provides: \u201c[criminal contempt]\u2014who may be PUNISHED</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201cThe judicial authority may punish by fine or imprisonment or both:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">\u201c(1) Any person who in the court\u2019s presence behaves in a contemptuous or disorderly manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">\u201c(2) Any person who violates the dignity and authority of any court, or any judicial authority, in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\"><em>\u201c(3) </em>Any officer of the court who misbehaves in the conduct of his official duties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">\u201c(4) <em>Any person disobeying in the course of a civil or criminal proceeding any order of a judicial authority.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b378-15\"> Article second of the constitution of Connecticut provides: \u201cThe powers of government shall be divided into three distinct departments, and each of them confided to a separate magistracy, to wit, those which are legislative, to one; those which are executive, to another; and those which are judicial, to another.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b378-16\"> Practice Book \u00a7 991 provides: \u201c[nonsummary criminal contempt] --NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-18\">\u201cA criminal contempt not adjudicated under Sec. 987 shall be prosecuted by means of an information.

The case shall proceed as any other criminal prosecution under these rules and the General Statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\"> The state appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). The state appealed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96, which provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the superior court, upon all questions arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the supreme court or to the appellate court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvK\">This case involves a proceeding in the trial court in which the state seeks, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 985 and 986 (4), a nonsummary adjudication of criminal contempt of court for conduct outside the presence of the court. Although such a proceeding requires most of the usual procedural protections inherent in a prosecution for a crime; see <em>Young </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., </em>481 U.S. 787, 798-800, 107 S. Ct. 2124, 95 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1987); our precedents make clear that \u201ca proceeding for [criminal] contempt, while it is of a criminal nature, is not a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>80 Conn. 668, 671, 69 A. 1057 (1908); see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>222 Conn. 591, 599, 610 A.2d 1177 (1992) (summary criminal contempt not a \u201ccriminal action\u201d within meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b, governing right to jury trial in a \u201ccriminal action\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 158 A.2d 166 (1960) (summary criminal contempt not a criminal \u201coffense\u201d within meaning of General Statutes [1958 Rev.] \u00a7 54-12, governing appeals from city court to Court of Common Pleas). On the other hand, Practice Book \u00a7 991, governing nonsummary criminal contempt proceedings; see footnote 4; provides in relevant part: \u201cThe case shall proceed as any other criminal prosecution under these rules and the General Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWu\">We need not decide in this case whether \u00a7 54-96 requires the permission of the trial court for the state to appeal from a judgment of dismissal of an information filed under \u00a7 991; or whether, to the contrary, the state has an unlimited right to appeal, equivalent to the right to appeal of an individual who has been nonsummarily adjudicated in contempt for out-of-court conduct. <em>See McClain v. Robinson, </em>189 Conn. 663, 667, 457 A.2d 1072 (1983). Such an unlimited right of appeal by the state could be supported on the ground that the purpose of an action pursuant to \u00a7 991 is not to vindicate the aims of the criminal law but \u201cto vindicate the authority of the court.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 985. This determination is unnecessary in this case, however, because if \u00a7 54-96 applies, such permission was granted; and if it does not apply, such permission was unnecessary. Compare <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 669 (sole method of review for summary adjudication of contempt is by writ of error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 815 provides in relevant part: \u201c[motion to dismiss] -MATTERS TO BE RAISED</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">\u201cThe following defenses or objections, if capable of determination with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>out a trial of the general issue, shall, if made prior to trial, be raised by a motion to dismiss the indictment or information . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\u201c(8) Claim that the law defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-33 provides: \u201cpunishment for contempt of court.

An indirect contempt, exemplified by \u00a7 986 (4), involves conduct occurring outside the court\u2019s presence, such as a refusal to comply with an injunctive decree.

Vuitton et Fils S. A., </em>481 U.S. 787, 107 S. Ct. 2124, 95 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1987), is distinguishable because the prosecution for criminal contempt in that case rested upon a federal statute. Although the prosecution in <em>Young </em>was brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 (3), which provides for criminal penalties for contempt of court, the court indicated that the power to punish for criminal contempt was an inherent judicial power, and that \u201c[t]he manner in which the court\u2019s prosecution of contempt is exercised . . . may be regulated by Congress . . . .\u201d Id., 799. Thus, contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the exercise of the court\u2019s contempt power in <em>Young, </em>as opposed to the manner of that exercise, was not dependent on the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Young </em>on the basis that it involved only the power of the court to <em>initiate </em>a criminal contempt proceeding, but not to adjudicate such a proceeding. It would be bizarre, indeed, to hold that a court has the inherent power to initiate a criminal contempt proceeding for the purpose of vindicating its authority and dignity, but that its power to continue such a proceeding to completion, and thereby accomplish that end, is dependent on legislative action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 88 S. Ct. 1477, 20 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1968), is unavailing. In <em>Bloom </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the United States constitution requires a jury trial for criminal contempt punishable by more than six months imprisonment. Although Justice Scalia, alone among the current Justices, reads <em>Bloom </em>to hold also that a court has no inherent power to punish as criminal contempt the violation of an injunction; see <em>Young </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., </em>481 U.S. 787, 823, 107 S. Ct. 2124, 95 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring); that view was specifically rejected by the majority of the court. See id., 796-97 n.8. In any event, even Justice Scalia\u2019s reading of <em>Bloom </em>would not control this case. That reading depended on Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation of the limits of the judicial power under the United States constitution. It does not control the separation of powers provision of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
