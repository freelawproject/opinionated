The plaintiff, Giuseppina Matarazzo, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing her appeal from the decision of a fair hearing officer of the department of income maintenance (department), partially denying her medicaid benefits. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The trial court found the following facts. In February, 1990, the plaintiff, who was sixty-two years old, was hospitalized because of a serious illness. Having no health care insurance, she filed an application for medicaid benefits with the department. In that application, the plaintiff, who was being assisted by her daughter, disclosed that she and her husband had a joint savings account of $9000, which represented their life savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Federal medicaid regulations require that, in order to be eligible for benefits, a married applicant have less than $2400 in assets. On the basis of information provided to them by an intake worker of the department, the plaintiff and her daughter reasonably believed that once the savings account had been reduced to less than $2400, the plaintiffs application would be approved retroactive to the filing date of the application. Consequently, the plaintiff and her daughter expected that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>medicaid would cover the medical and hospital bills incurred by the plaintiff after the filing of her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">When the plaintiffs application was finally approved on June 27, 1990, however, the department informed her that she would receive medicaid benefits only for medical expenses incurred after June 1,1990.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the plaintiff remained responsible for the substantial medical and hospital expenses, totaling approximately $150,000, that were incurred in the preceding three months even though the amount of those expenses far exceeded her available assets at any given time during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The plaintiff requested a fair hearing to contest the department\u2019s refusal to employ a \u201cresource spend down\u201d policy to determine eligibility for medicaid benefits for persons whose incurred medical expenses exceed their total assets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the plaintiff had been entitled to a resource spend down, she would have become retroactively eligible for benefits for her medical expenses incurred from the time she was hospitalized in February and filed her application for benefits. The fair hearing officer refused to address the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>tiff\u2019s argument that she was entitled to resource spend down. Instead, the officer concluded that the plaintiff was not eligible for benefits for any time prior to June 1,1990, because her marital assets had exceeded $2400 until that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The plaintiff appealed the department\u2019s partial denial of benefits to the trial court. The plaintiff claimed that both federal and state law require the department to utilize a resource spend down policy. The trial court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claims and dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the department improperly denied her medicaid benefits for her hospital and medical expenses incurred prior to June 1, 1990, because federal law obligates the department to utilize a resource spend down policy in order to determine her eligibility for medicaid benefits. To understand and address the question of whether federal law so obligates the defendant, however, requires us to wade into the \u201cSerbonian bog\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of federal and state laws regarding the medicaid system. See <em>Feld </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>424 F. Sup. 1356, 1357 (S.D.N.Y. 1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The medicaid program, established in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq., \u201c \u2018provides] federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.\u2019 <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S.

Although states participate voluntarily, a state electing to participate must develop a plan, approved by the secretary of health and human services, containing \u2018reasonable standards ... for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance . . . .\u201942 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17).\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>209 Conn. 390, 394, 551 A.2d 729 (1988). Connecticut has elected to participate in the medicaid program and has assigned to the department the task of administering the program. General Statutes \u00a7 17-134a et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cAs originally enacted, [the] Medicaid [Act] required participating States to provide medical assistance to \u2018categorically needy\u2019 individuals who received cash payments under one of four welfare programs established elsewhere in the Act. . . . The categorically needy were persons whom Congress considered especially deserving of public assistance because of family circumstances, age, or disability. States, if they wished, were permitted to offer assistance also to the \u2018medically needy\u2019\u2014persons lacking the ability to pay for medical expenses, but with incomes [or resources] too large to qualify for categorical assistance.\u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 37, 101 S. Ct. 2633, 69 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Since its enactment, the Social Security Act has undergone substantial revisions. \u201cIn 1972, Congress replaced three of the four categorical assistance programs with a new program called Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (SSI), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq. . . . Under SSI, the Federal Government displaced the States by assuming responsibility for both funding payments and setting standards of need. In some States the number of individuals eligible for SSI assistance was significantly larger than the number eligible under the earlier, state-run categorical need programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u201cThe expansion of general welfare accomplished by SSI portended increased Medicaid obligations for some States because Congress retained the requirement that all recipients of categorical welfare assistance\u2014now SSI\u2014were entitled to Medicaid. Congress feared that these States would withdraw from the cooperative Medicaid program rather than expand their Medicaid coverage in a manner commensurate with the expansion of categorical assistance. [I]n order not to impose a substantial fiscal burden on these States or discourage them from participating . . . Congress offered what has become known as the \u2018\u00a7 209 (b) option.\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>[\u00a7 209 (b)], States could elect to provide Medicaid assistance only to those individuals who would have been eligible under the state Medicaid plan in effect on January 1,1972. States thus became either \u2018SSI States\u2019 or \u2018\u00a7 209 (b) States\u2019 depending on the coverage that they afforded.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>supra, 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">States selecting the \u00a7 209 (b) option, therefore, have the right to impose more restrictive eligibility requirements than those mandated by the federal SSI program but, <em>as a limitation on that right, </em>may not adopt eligibility requirements that are more restrictive than the eligibility requirements that the state applied on January 1, 1972. See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Maintenance, </em>supra, 395. Because Connecticut has elected the \u00a7 209 (b) option; id., 395 n.4; <em>Gnutti </em>v. <em>Heintz, </em>206 Conn. 628, 633, 539 A.2d 118 (1988); it may impose more restrictive eligibility requirements than those set by the SSI program, but may not impose stricter eligibility requirements than those applied pursuant to its January 1, 1972 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In order to prevail on her federal law claim that Connecticut, as a \u00a7 209 (b) state, is obligated to apply a resource spend down rule, the plaintiff must necessarily establish that: (1) Connecticut utilized a resource spend down rule on January 1,1972; and (2) federal law does not prohibit the use of resource spend down. See footnote 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">As noted above, the fair hearing officer did not address the plaintiffs claim that she was entitled to retroactive benefits by virtue of a resource spend down rule. The trial court, however, found that the plaintiff had presented \u201cboth documentary and oral evidence tending to prove that both immediately before and after January 1, 1972, [the department] had a policy and practice of utilizing a resource spend down with respect to applicants whose assets exceeded the Medicaid limit. The testimony of case workers familiar with [the] defendant\u2019s practices, as well as [the] defendant\u2019s Uniform Policy Manual strongly suggest that had [the] plaintiff\u2019s application been considered under the practice in effect as of January 1, 1972, a resource spend down would have been utilized with respect to [the] plaintiff\u2019s excess assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In spite of this evidence, the trial court concluded that, because the plaintiff had not introduced the actual state medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972, she could not prevail on her claim. The trial court reasoned that \u00a7 209 (b), by its explicit terms, requires a state to continue to provide benefits subsequent to January 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>1972, only if that assistance was required by <em>an approved, state plan </em>in effect on that date. Consequently, the trial court concluded that it was \u201cimpossible to determine, therefore, whether the state plan then in effect required, as claimed by [the] plaintiff, the use of a resource spend down. Because the record is silent on this issue, [the] plaintiff cannot prevail [on] her claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The plaintiff claims in her brief and claimed at oral argument that she failed to enter the state plan into the record because the plan was \u201cunavailable.\u201d Although the plaintiff at oral argument represented that she had attempted to procure a copy of the plan, the record is silent as to whether the plaintiff actually sought a subpoena to compel the state to produce the plan. The plaintiff did state, however, that \u201cpeople have tried to get it\u201d but that it was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We agree with the trial court that a proper consideration of the plaintiffs claim must include an examination of the actual state plan in effect on January 1,1972. We conclude, however, that, in light of our resolution of the other issues in this appeal, justice and fair dealing require us to order a remand so that the January 1, 1972 plan can be made part of the record and considered in adjudicating the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">We recognize that the appellant ordinarily bears the burden of establishing eligibility for benefits. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>204 Conn. 672, 679, 529 A.2d 188 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>however, the department presumably<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is in possession of the state plan, a document that the department has not published, is not part of the public record, and yet is crucial in establishing whether the plaintiff is legally entitled to medicaid benefits. Although the department is, of course, entitled to claim that a given applicant is not eligible for benefits, the department has a general responsibility to act in the best interests of the state and its citizens by granting medicaid benefits to those claimants who are legally entitled to receive them. Under these circumstances, therefore, we conclude that the department cannot prevail merely because the record does not contain the very evidence that the state should make readily available to the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In light of this conclusion, we remand the case for a further factual determination of whether the January 1, 1972 plan provided for resource spend down. Such a remand, however, would be unnecessary if we were to conclude that, even if the January 1,1972 state plan so provided, the plaintiff could not prevail on her legal claims. Consequently, in the interest of judicial economy, we address them at this time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The plaintiff claims that, assuming that the January 1, 1972 plan provided for resource spend down, \u00a7 209 (b) requires Connecticut to continue to grant retroactive benefits to applicants who spend down their resources to the asset disregard level. The defendant argues, however, that even if the January 1,1972 plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>provided for resource spend down, \u00a7 209 (b) and other federal regulations do not require the defendant to utilize resource spend down. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We first note that we agree with the defendant that \u00a7 209 (b) does not authorize the state to create an alternative basis for eligibility for medicaid inconsistent with federal law, but merely permits the state to restrict the eligibility of persons who would otherwise qualify for such benefits under SSI standards. <em>Roloff </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>975 F.2d 333, 340 (7th Cir. 1992); <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Toan, </em>795 F.2d 643, 645-46 (8th Cir. 1986); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>783 F.2d 454, 459-60 (4th Cir. 1986); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Suter, </em>[1989-1 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH), \u00b637,695, p. 19,704 (N.D. Ill. 1988). This principle is incorporated into the federal medicaid regulations at 42 C.F.R \u00a7 435.121 (1991).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, \u00a7 209 (b) does not confer authority upon states to create less restrictive eligibility standards than exist nationally for SSL <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>supra, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">As noted above, however, \u00a7 209 (b) also prohibits a participating state from adopting eligibility requirements more restrictive than those utilized by the state in its January 1, 1972 plan. Thus, as long as an eligibility requirement is not more liberal than the current eligibility requirements of the SSI program, a \u00a7 209 (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>state must continue to utilize those eligibility requirements exercised in its January 1, 1972 plan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The dispositive question is, therefore, if we assume that the January 1, 1972 plan provided for resource spend down, whether the SSI program prohibits resource spend down thereby making the resource spend down standard more liberal than the eligibility requirements of the SSI program. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the SSI program does not prohibit resource spend down, and thus Connecticut must provide for resource spend down if such a standard was required by its January 1, 1972 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The plaintiff claims eligibility under the \u201cmedically needy\u201d coverage group. Connecticut, at its option, has chosen to provide medicaid benefits to the medically needy: \u201cthose whose resources [or incomes] are sufficient to cover their ordinary living expenses, but not their medical care. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (10) (C); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.300 through 435.340.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>209 Conn. 390, 394, 551 A.2d 729 (1988); see also <em>Camacho </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>786 F.2d 32, 33-34 (2d Cir. 1986). Federal regulations generally require states providing coverage to the medically needy to evaluate an applicant\u2019s resources under the same standard used to determine eligibility for benefits under the categorically needy program. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.845;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>supra, 456; <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>676 F.2d 276, 278 (7th Cir. 1982); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Suter, </em>supra, p. 19,704.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The SSI statutes; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq.; and the implementing regulations; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.200 et seq.; do not explicitly prohibit <em>or </em>provide for resource spend down in determining eligibility for SSL Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>resource spend down is not explicitly prohibited or provided for in determining eligibility for medicaid benefits under the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d or \u201cmedically needy programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The defendant contends, however, that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382 (a) (1) (B) does not allow deductions for incurred medical expenses in determining the \u201cresources\u201d of an applicant. Section 1382 (a) (1) (B) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach aged, blind, or disabled individual . . . whose resources, other than resources excluded pursuant to section 1382b (a) of this title, are not more than . . . the applicable amount . . . shall be an eligible individual for purposes of this subchapter.\u201d The resource exclusions contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382b (a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>include, for example, the value of property such as the applicant\u2019s home, other property essential to self-support, and entitlements under various assistance programs. The defendant contends that, because incurred medical expenses are not enumerated among the resource exclusions, the SSI statutes and regulations prohibit consideration of such expenses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>First, incurred medical expenses are plainly not a \u201cresource\u201d in the parlance of the regulatory scheme, but, are in fact a debt owing to a health care provider or other party for services rendered or goods provided. As a matter of common sense, such a debt would not be included among the resources or assets of the applicant. Consequently, it is of little significance that incurred medical expenses are not included among the specified resource exclusions. Resource spend down is simply a methodology<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> by which to measure those resources \u201cowned\u201d by an applicant in light of outstanding liabilities for medical expenses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Consequently, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>conclude that \u00a7 1382 (a) (1) (B), \u00a7 1382b (a), and related regulations do not prohibit resource spend down.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">This conclusion is additionally supported by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cA State plan for medical assistance must ... (17) . . . include reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan [and] . . . (C) provide for reasonable evaluation of any such income or resources, and (D) . . . provide for flexibility in the application of such standards with respect to <em>income </em>by taking into account . . . the costs . . . incurred for medical care . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Despite this broad language, the defendant argues that because \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (D) specifically provides for income spend down but not resource spend down, the statute implicitly forbids the use of resource spend down.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The overwhelming weight of authority, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ever, has concluded that, despite the lack of an explicit provision providing for resource spend down, such a method is a <em>permissible </em>standard in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for benefits. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Suter, </em>supra, p. 19,706; <em>Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yavapai County, </em>148 Ariz. 385, 388, 714 P.2d 878 (1986); <em>Hession </em>v. <em>Department of Public Aid, </em>129 Ill. 2d 535, 544 N.E.2d 751, 757 (1989); <em>Harriman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Human Services, </em>595 A.2d 1053, 1055 n.2 (Me. 1991); <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, </em>394 Mass. 466, 475-76, 476 N.E.2d 572 (1985); <em>Kempson </em>v. <em>Department of Human Resources, </em>100 N.C.

In <em>Haley, </em>the court concluded that \u201cif an application of a resource spend down is consistent with the goals of Title XIX and is reasonable, it is authorized by Title XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u201cWe next determine whether utilization of a resource spend down is consistent with the Federal statutory scheme. Title XIX was \u2018designed to liberalize Federal law under which States operate their medical assistance programs so as to make medical services for the needy more generally available.\u2019 S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1943, 2014 (hereinafter S.Rep.). To fulfill this goal, Congress sought to ensure eligibility to indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>viduals with income <em>and resources </em>which prevented eligibility for other programs when the income <em>and resources </em>were exceeded by incurred medical costs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17); S.Rep. at 2017-2020, 2147. A State must \u2018take into account only such income <em>and resources </em>as (determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary [of Health and Human Services]) are actually available to the applicant or recipient and as would not be disregarded (or set aside for future needs).\u2019 S.Rep. at 2018. A State may not \u2018require the use of income <em>or resources </em>which would bring the individual\u2019s income below the amount established as the test of eligibility under the State plan. Such action would reduce the individual below the level determined by the State as necessary for his maintenance.\u2019 S.Rep. at 2109. We conclude that, although Congress did not require the use of a resource spend down, such use is a reasonable method of evaluating resources.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 475-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The court in <em>Haley </em>further reasoned that reading Title XIX to prohibit resource spend down would frustrate the intent of Congress. \u201cThe reasonableness of applying a resource spend down to eligibility determinations is apparent when one examines the effect of eligibility determinations without a resource spend down. An eligible individual is entitled to three months\u2019 retroactive payment of medical expenses [pursuant to Massachusetts law]. . . . Without a resource spend down, an individual with excess resources who is aware of the department\u2019s policy is in a better position than the average individual who is unaware of the policy. The aware individual can actually spend down his excess resources as soon as he incurs medical expenses which, absent excess resources, would be eligible for payment. Once the resources are actually absorbed, the individual is eligible for payment of medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201cThe paradox occurs with a less sophisticated individual or an individual who is not in a condition actually to spend down resources. Upon application to the [agency], this individual would be informed that, because of excess resources, medical expenses incurred in the last three months would not be eligible for payment. This result would occur regardless of how miniscule the excess resources were in comparison to the medical expenses incurred in that three-month period.\u201d Id., 476 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The present case serves as a concrete example of the absurdity that would result from interpreting the federal scheme to prohibit resource spend down. The plaintiff has incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $150,000, and yet, at the time that her illness began, she had only $9000 in resources. The lack of resource spend down would, however, deprive her of eligibility for coverage of medical expenses that her resources are clearly inadequate to cover. We are unwilling to interpret the statute to reach a result that conflicts with Congress\u2019 intent to provide benefits for individuals whose income and resources are insufficient to meet necessary medical expenses, and that contradicts the great weight of authority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>In light of this analysis, we conclude that, if Connecticut utilized a resource spend down rule under the January 1, 1972 plan, \u00a7 209 (b) requires the department to grant retroactive benefits to the plaintiff.

Without a resource spend down rule, the applicant is not eligible for retroactive coverage of incurred medical expenses, and thus is personally responsible for paying such bills. Consequently, the plaintiff, relying on <em>Hession </em>v. <em>Department of Public Aid, </em>supra, 757, <em>Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yavapai County, </em>supra, 388, and <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, </em>supra, 475-76, contends that the department\u2019s failure to provide resource spend down requires her to deplete the assets that the legislature mandated should be retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Although we agree with the plaintiff that the resource spend down rule is a sensible method by which to determine eligibility for medicaid benefits, we disagree with her contention that resource spend down is <em>required </em>by \u00a7 17-82d (c). Nothing in the language of \u00a7 17-82d (c) suggests that the legislature intended to mandate that individuals be permitted to keep $2400 in resources.

These courts reached their conclusions based upon different state statutory and regulatory schemes. Moreover, each of the decisions relied upon statutory language in their respective jurisdictions that either explicitly provided for or strongly suggested a requirement of resource spend down. <em>Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yavapai County, </em>supra, 388-90; <em>Hession </em>v. <em>Department of Public Aid, </em>supra, 757; <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, </em>supra, 477 n.9. In light of the absence of explicit language necessitating application of resource spend down, we conclude that state law, by itself, does not <em>require </em>the department to apply a resource spend down rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> June 1, 1990, was the first day of a month in which the plaintiff and her spouse had assets of less than $2400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\"> State medicaid plans often provide that an applicant qualifies for assistance only if the applicant\u2019s resources for a given month do not exceed a preset amount, known as the \u201casset disregard.\u201d As noted above, the asset disregard in the present case was $2400. In many cases, however, although \u201can applicant may possess resources exceeding the monthly limit by a few hundred dollars, her medical bills for that month may total thousands of dollars beyond her available assets.

Indeed, the case cited above reaches virtually the same conclusion. After having decided that resource spend down is not a \u201cmethodology\u201d to measure the applicant\u2019s resources, the court states: \u201cResource spend-down measures the applicant's resources in terms of his medical expenses, so that the applicant is not found ineligible in this situation.\u201d Id., p. 19,706.

Resource eligibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ity is determined, therefore, solely by reference to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.840 through 435.843. These provisions, the defendant contends, require the state agency in determining eligibility simply to compare the applicant\u2019s resources to the asset disregard amount, and thus, to prohibit the application of a resource spend down policy. For the reasons stated above, we disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> Although not specifically relied upon by the defendant, the federal agency charged with the administration of the medicaid program, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in 1980 issued an \u201cAction Transmittal,\u201d HHS Action Transmittal 80-58, to all state agencies administering the medicaid program. This transmittal announced that HHS was taking the new position that, while Title XIX expressly allows for income spend down, neither the statute nor the rules promulgated thereunder allow for resource spend down.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Although a court ordinarily accords deference to interpretations issued by the agency charged with administering the statute; see <em>Chevron U.S.A. </em>v. <em>Natural Resource Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984); we join those courts that have concluded that the agency\u2019s interpretation in this case is not entitled to such deference. See, e.g., <em>Westmiller </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>729 F. Sup. 260, 264 (W.D.N.Y. 1990); <em>Hession </em>v. <em>Department of Public Aid, </em>129 Ill. 2d 535, 544 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>751, 757 (1989). The United States Supreme Court has concluded that an agency\u2019s interpretation is not entitled to great weight or deference if the interpretation is not made contemporaneously with the enactment of the statute and if it contradicts the position that the agency had previously taken. <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 143-44, 97 S. Ct. 401, 50 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1976). \u201cThe weight given an administrative interpretation depends in part upon the thoroughness of its consideration [and] the validity of its reasoning. <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S. Ct. 161-64, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944). Moreover, deference can be overborne if a court finds that the agency interpretation is unreasonable because it violates the letter or spirit of the statute. <em>Capitano </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>732 F.2d 1066, 1076 (2d Cir. 1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westmiller </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Because the transmittal in the present case falls within the category of administrative interpretations that the United States Supreme Court has concluded is not entitled to deference, and in light of our own reading of the relevant federal law, we reject the 1980 position of HHS. The interpretation set forth in the transmittal was announced, not contemporaneously with the enactment of the federal statute, but fifteen years after its passage, and directly contradicted a position held by the agency for the previous fourteen years. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> To prevail on this claim, the plaintiff must also establish that SSI does not prohibit resource spend down. In part I, we concluded that SSI permits resource spend down.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b359-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-82d provides: \u201cinvestigations, grant of aid. INCOME DISREGARD FOR FULL TIME STUDENTS. ASSET LIMITS, (a) The commissioner, upon receipt of an application for aid, shall promptly and with due diligence make an investigation, such investigation to be completed within forty-five days after receipt of the application or within sixty days after receipt of the application in the case of an application in which a determination of disability must be made. If an application for an award is not acted on within forty-five days after the filing of an application, or within sixty days in the case of an application in which a determination of disability must be made, the applicant may apply to the commissioner for a hearing in accordance with sections 17-2a and 17-2b. The commissioner shall grant aid only if he finds the applicant eligible therefor, in which case he shall grant aid in such amount, determined in accordance with levels of payments established by the commissioner, as is needed in order to enable the applicant to support himself, or, in the case of aid to dependent children, to enable the relative to support such dependent child or children and himself, in health and decency, including the costs of such medical care as he deems necessary and reasonable, not in excess of the amounts set forth in the various fee schedules promulgated by the commissioner of income maintenance for medical, dental and allied services and supplies or the charges made for comparable services and supplies to the general public, whichever is less, and the cost of necessary hospitalization as is provided in section 17-312, over and above hospital insurance or other such benefits, including workers\u2019 compensation and claims for negligent or wilful injury. The commissioner, subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, shall in determining need, take into consideration any available income and resources of the individual claiming assistance. The commissioner shall make periodic investigations to determine eligibility and may, at any time, modify, suspend or discontinue an award previously made when such action is necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. The parent or parents of any child for whom aid is received under the provisions of part II of this chapter, and any beneficiary receiving assistance under part III of this chapter, shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of sections 17-83e, 17-83f and 17-83g.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u201c(b) The commissioner shall disregard for six months per calendar year, any earned income of a child who is a full-time student in determining the eligibility, standard of need and amount of assistance of a family in the AFDC program.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u201c(e) No person shall be eligible for the state supplement program whose assets as defined by the commissioner exceed sixteen hundred dollars or, if living with a spouse, whose combined assets exceed twenty-four hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"Aaa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201c(d) No family shall be eligible for the aid to families with dependent children program whose combined assets as defined by the commissioner exceed one thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The asset limit of \u00a7 17-82d, applicable to the state supplement program, is incorporated into the medicaid program by General Statutes \u00a7 17-134e, which provides: \u201cextension of other public assistance provisions. All of the provisions of this chapter are extended to the medical assistance program except such provisions as are inconsistent with federal law and regulations governing Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 and this part.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\"> Similar to our interpretation of the federal statutory and regulatory scheme, we do not read General Statutes \u00a7 17-82d, by itself, as necessarily <em>-prohibiting </em>resource spend down.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
