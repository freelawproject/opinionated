Quinn III, is a covered person under the terms of an automobile liability insurance policy issued by the plaintiff, Middlesex Insurance Company (Middlesex), to the defendant\u2019s father, James J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Quinn, Jr.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the trial court\u2019s judgment vacating an arbitration award of $83,333 rendered in favor of the defendant, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>27 Conn. App. 573, 609 A.2d 1008 (1992). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to decide whether Connecticut\u2019s public policy precludes an insurer from excluding from underinsured motorist coverage, a relative of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household and who owns a car. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following undisputed facts. \u201cOn February 12, 1984, while driving a car he owned, the defendant was injured in a collision in New Haven. The defendant recovered $20,000 from the tortfeasor, the full amount of liability insurance available. The defendant\u2019s car was insured for $100,000 bodily injury liability and $20,000 uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u201cAt the time of the collision, the defendant lived with his father, whom [Middlesex] insured under two automobile liability policies covering five vehicles. Each of these vehicles was insured for $20,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. The defendant sought to aggregate these amounts and to collect $100,000 from [Middle-sex]. [Middlesex denied coverage on the basis that he is not a covered person as defined in the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>[Middlesex] . . . refused to arbitrate the dispute, the defendant sought an order compelling arbitration. The trial court, <em>Purtill, J., </em>issued such an order, which [the Appellate Court] subsequently upheld. See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>16 Conn. App. 209, 547 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 817, 550 A.2d 1085 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u201cOn February 1,1991, the arbitration panel, in a two to one decision, awarded the defendant $83,333, with the plaintiff receiving $16,666.67 credit for the amount the tortfeasor had paid. The majority found that the policy\u2019s definition with respect to resident relatives [who own a car] is invalid and that the defendant is therefore a covered person under the plan. The dissent determined that the defendant is not a covered person and that our law does not require that he be covered under the circumstances of this case. On February 19, 1991, [Middlesex] moved to vacate the arbitration award. The defendant subsequently moved to confirm it. On June 7,1991, the trial court vacated the award and denied the motion to confirm.\u201d <em>Middlesex Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>supra, 575. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 583. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant claims that public policy precludes an automobile insurer from excluding from underinsured motorist coverage a resident family member who owns a car and that the defendant is, therefore, entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under the Middlesex policy issued to his father.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>is based upon the principle of public policy that an insurer may not reduce its liability for underinsured motorist coverage by contract except to the extent that the relevant regulations expressly authorize. <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 152, 156, 617 A.2d 454 (1992). Because no regulation expressly provides for exclusion from coverage of a resident of an insured\u2019s household who owns a car, the defendant contends that Middlesex cannot exclude the defendant from underinsured motorist benefits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The Middlesex policy issued to the defendant\u2019s father is an automobile liability policy that provides underinsured motorist coverage, in addition to other coverage. Under the section labeled \u201cLiability Insurance,\u201d the insurer will \u201cpay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which the law holds you responsible because of a car accident involving a car we insure.\u201d The policy also covers \u201c[ajnyone using, with your permission, a car described on the declarations page, or any additional, replacement or substitute . . . .\u201d Under the section labeled \u201cUninsured Motorist Insurance,\u201d the policy promises to \u201cpay the damages you\u2019re legally entitled to receive from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury. We\u2019ll pay these damages for bodily injury you suffer in a car accident while occupying a car or, as a pedestrian, as a result of having been struck by an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d Additionally, the policy provides uninsured motorist benefits to \u201c[ajnyone occupying, with your permission, a car we insure . . . .\u201d The \u201cDefinitions\u201d section at the beginning of the policy, which applies to both liability and underinsured motorist insurance, states that \u201cYou, your and yourself . . . means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>a member of the family who is a resident of the household and who doesn\u2019t own a car . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Because the defendant owns his own automobile, he is clearly not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the unambiguous definition of an insured in the policy. The defendant does not argue to the contrary. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant maintains, however, that this definition of limited coverage violates public policy. We find the defendant\u2019s argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Our underinsured motorist insurance statute, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336, formerly \u00a7 38-175c, requires that \u201c[e]ach automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured motorist coverage . . . for the protection of <em>persons insured thereunder </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>panying regulation, \u00a7 38a-334-6 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that the \u201cinsurer shall undertake to pay on behalf of the <em>insured </em>all sums which the insured shall become legally entitled to recover . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Unlike the automobile liability statutes,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the uninsured motorist statute does not require automobile insurance policies to provide underinsured motorist benefits to any particular class or group of insureds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. Vincel, 452 N.E.2d 418, 424 (Ind. App. 1983). The legislature did not specifically define \u201cinsured\u201d in the context of underinsured motorist coverage. Rather, the statute requires that underinsured motorist coverage must be provided \u201cfor the protection of persons <em>insured thereunder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1). Thus, \u201cpersons insured\u201d in this statute refers to persons specified as insureds in the liability portion of the policy. There would be no violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of public policy, therefore, unless the insurance policy specifically were to limit underinsured motorist coverage in such a way as \u201cto [preclude] persons who would otherwise qualify as insureds for liability purposes.\u201d <em>Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vincel, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">If the legislature intended to mandate coverage for all resident relatives of the named insured irrespective of whether they own a vehicle, it could have expressly so provided. In the absence of clear direction from the legislature, we decline to extend public policy to require insurers to cover family members who own vehicles. Presumably, the legislature has left such coverage to be provided by the policies on the vehicles owned by those family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">This conclusion is consistent with our previous analysis and interpretation of \u00a7 38-175c, now \u00a7 38a-336, in <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 449 A.2d 157 (1982), and <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>214 Conn. 734, 573 A.2d 740 (1990). <em>In Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, we held that the plaintiff, an <em>insured </em>under his mother\u2019s automobile liability policy, was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under that policy, even though he was occupying his father\u2019s uninsured automobile when he was injured. We concluded that the public policy embodied in \u00a7 38-175c directs that an <em>insured\u2019s </em>geographical location at the time of the injury is \u201cirrelevant to recovery under the statutorily mandated coverage.\u201d Id., 250. Underinsured motorist coverage attaches to the <em>insured </em>person, not the insured vehicle. Id. We held that an insurance contract\u2019s exclusion to the contrary violated the public policy underlying uninsured motorist coverage in Connecticut because the statute requires every automobile liability policy to provide uninsured motorist coverage for the protection of persons insured there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>under. Because the plaintiff was an insured under the liability section of his mothers policy, the policy\u2019s exclusion of the plaintiff from uninsured motorist benefits violated public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, the plaintiff was a passenger in an automobile owned by the driver when it was involved in a one car accident. The plaintiff sought uninsured motorist benefits under a policy issued to the driver\u2019s father. The plaintiff argued that \u201conce a policy provides liability coverage to an insured, the underinsured motorist coverage therein is coextensive with the liability coverage.\u201d Id., 736. The liability coverage section of that policy provided that \u201c \u2018[w]e will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.\u2019 \u201d Id. A \u201ccovered person\u201d was defined in the policy as \u201c \u2018you or any family member for the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto or trailer.\u2019 \u201d Id. The plaintiff argued that under the terms of the driver\u2019s father\u2019s automobile liability policy, the driver, as a family member, was a \u201ccovered person\u201d who became legally responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries because of an automobile accident while driving \u201cany auto.\u201d Id., 736-37. Because the father\u2019s policy provided liability coverage to the driver while using any auto, the plaintiff argued that \u201cthe policy must also provide underinsured benefits to her as an occupant of that vehicle.\u201d Id., 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We concluded that the driver was not a covered person under the liability section of his father\u2019s policy because the coverage excluded \u201c \u2018any vehicle other than your covered auto which is owned by any family member.\u2019 \u201d Id. We held that an insurer does not violate public policy by limiting liability coverage to particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>vehicles. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-335 (a) and (d). Because the driver was not a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the liability section of the policy, the insurer was not liable for the injuries he caused and the plaintiff could not recover damages under the policy. Moreover, the plaintiff was not a covered person within the definition provided in the uninsured motorist section of the policy because she was neither a family member nor an occupant of a covered automobile. We concluded that there was no violation of public policy because neither the plaintiff nor the driver was insured under the father\u2019s policy. Id., 737-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The public policy behind uninsured motorist coverage, therefore, requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorist benefits to any insured under the automobile liability policy. \u201c[Ojnce an automobile liability policy is issued extending [liability] coverage to a certain class of insureds . . . uninsured motorist coverage must be offered to cover the same class of insureds\u201d; <em>State Farm Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Reaves, </em>292 Ala. 218, 223, 292 So. 2d 95 (1974); except as expressly excluded by statute or regulation. <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 377, 593 A.2d 498 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Other jurisdictions with statutes and regulations similar to those of Connecticut have also concluded that there is no violation of public policy if the person being denied uninsured motorist benefits is not an insured under the liability section of the policy. See, e.g., <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>387 So. 2d 166 (Ala. 1980); <em>France </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>380 So. 2d 1155 (Fla. App. 1980); <em>Girrens </em>v. <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co., </em>238 Kan. 670, 715 P.2d 389 (1986); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>American Family Ins. Group, </em>555 S.W.2d 579 (Ky. 1977); <em>Robertson v. Cumis Ins. Co., </em>355 So. 2d 1371 (La. App.), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>denied, 357 So. 2d 1153 (La. 1978); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>92 Mich. App. 151, 284 N.W.2d 754 (1979); <em>Famuliner v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>619 S.W.2d 894 (Mo. App. 1981); <em>Malo </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>459 A.2d 954 (R.I. 1983); <em>Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>87 Wash. 2d 70, 549 P.2d 9 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Our analysis, however, does not end here. Although we have concluded that the denial of underinsured motorist benefits to a person who is not an insured within the definition of insured in the automobile liability section of the policy does not violate the policy embedded in \u00a7 38a-336, we must also examine the definition of an insured under the policy to determine if it violates public policy. An insurer cannot limit otherwise mandated underinsured motorist coverage by labeling a forbidden exclusion as a definition. We conclude that the pertinent definition in this policy does not incorporate a forbidden exclusion and, therefore, does not violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The legislature intended to provide that every insured within the definition of that term in the liability section of the policy is entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits for the damages \u201c \u2018he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured [tortfeasing] motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 377. Section 38a-336 states that uninsured motorist coverage must be provided in every automobile liability policy for \u201cthe protection of persons insured thereunder.\u201d \u201cThe policy behind linking uninsured motorist coverage to liability coverage is to reward those who obtain insurance coverage for the benefit of those they might injure. Persons who are uninsured for purposes of liability coverage should not be protected by the public policy of this state from their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>own kind.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>471 N.E.2d 1170, 1175 (Ind. App. 1984); <em>Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vincel, </em>supra, 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The owner of an automobile is expected and required to obtain his or her own automobile insurance. General Statutes \u00a7 14-12b (a) (1). In this case, although the defendant had insurance on his car, he elected to purchase only the minimum amount of coverage. \u201cObviously, [Middlesex] ... did not intend to contract with [the defendant\u2019s] father to provide liability coverage on automobiles in the [Quinn] household for which no premium had been paid, and the company unambiguously has made that intent part of the insurance contract.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>685 F.2d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir. 1982) (interpreting Alabama law). In the absence of clear direction from the legislature, \u201c[w]e decline to extend the public policy ... to allow a member of a family to purchase one liability policy and claim total coverage thereunder for the entire family while vastly increasing the risk to his or her insurer by knowingly owning and operating a fleet of uninsured [or underinsured] vehicles upon the highways.\u201d <em>France </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 1156. The defendant is limited to the coverage he purchased on his own automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> Middlesex\u2019 application to vacate the arbitration award also named James J.

Although occupants of a vehicle may have their own liability coverage, which would entitle them to uninsured motorist benefits; see <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); the insurance commissioner has designated \u201coccupants\u201d as a class of persons who may receive more extensive uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">We note that the regulation does not limit uninsured motorist coverage to occupants who do not own a car. Therefore, had the defendant been an occupant of an automobile insured under the Middlesex policy, Middlesex concedes that coverage would be mandated. See footnote 5. Indeed, Middlesex argued in this court that had the defendant been an occupant of an automobile insured under its policy, to preclude the defendant from coverage on the basis of his ownership of an automobile would have been a violation of public policy as set forth in \u00a7 38a-334-6 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
