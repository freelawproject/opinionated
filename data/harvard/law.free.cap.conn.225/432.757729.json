The defendants, the zoning board of appeals for the town and borough of Colchester (board) and Robert Bourassa, its chairperson, appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court granting the plaintiffs a writ of mandamus ordering the board to issue a certificate approving the plaintiffs\u2019 site plan application for the construction of an asphalt plant on their property. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>27 Conn. App. 412, 606 A.2d 725 (1992). We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The relevant facts upon which the Appellate Court relied are set forth in its opinion. \u201cOn August 3,1988, at a regular meeting of the Colchester planning and zoning commission (commission), the commission interpreted the town\u2019s zoning regulations to allow an asphalt plant as a permitted use on the land involved under \u00a7 12.2-12 of the Colchester zoning regulations. On June 5,1989, the plaintiffs submitted an application to the commission for a Class 2 site plan approval for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>construction of an asphalt plant on their property. On August 2,1989, the commission held a public hearing on the application. On August 10, 1989, the commission denied the application. Although not stipulated to by the parties, the record reveals that the reasons for the denial were (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with a regulation requiring department of environmental protection approval prior to submitting the plan, and (2) their failure to present sufficient information about traffic volume and controls, the protection of groundwater, and the protection of neighboring property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u201cOn September 1,1989, the plaintiffs filed an application with the board, appealing from the denial of its site plan application by the commission. Shortly after the appeal was filed with the board, the commission determined at its meeting on September 6,1989, that asphalt plants \u2018were no longer allowed in Colchester.\u2019 No notice of the commission\u2019s intention to reconsider its prior interpretation of the regulations, namely, that such plants were a permitted industrial use, was given to either the plaintiffs or the public prior to the meeting, nor was its outcome promulgated by publication. The reinterpretation occurred more than one year after the commission had originally determined that an asphalt plant was a permitted use in an industrial zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u201cOn October 24, 1989, the board notified the plaintiffs that a public hearing would be held on the appeal application on November 9,1989, and duly advertised the public hearing in a local newspaper. On November 3, 1989, the board notified the plaintiffs that the public hearing had been canceled. Although not stipulated to by the parties, the letter sent by the board to the plaintiffs and contained in the record stated that the board felt that the commission\u2019s action of September 6, 1989, had left it with no jurisdiction to act on the appeal. The board did not hold a public hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 application, nor did it render a decision on that application. The plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus to compel the board to issue a certificate approving their site plan application and be ordered to sustain the appeal filed with it by the plaintiffs. The trial court granted the plaintiffs the relief requested.\u201d <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 413-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The first certified question is: \u201cDoes the \u2018automatic approval\u2019 doctrine applicable to a zoning commission that fails to issue timely decisions on site plan or subdivision applications under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) and 8-26,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also apply to a zoning board of appeals that fails to hold a hearing on an appeal under General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (a)?\u201d <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>222 Conn. 911, 608 A.2d 694 (1992). We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (a) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, in all matters wherein a formal petition, application, request or appeal must be submitted to a zoning commission, planning and zoning commission or zoning board of appeals under this chapter and a hearing is required on such petition, application, request or appeal, such hearing shall commence within sixty-five days after receipt of such petition, application, request or appeal and shall be completed within thirty days after such hearing commences. All decisions on such matters shall be rendered within sixty-five days after completion of such hearing. The petitioner or applicant may consent to one or more extensions of any period specified in this subsection, provided the total extension of any such period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>shall not be for longer than the original period as specified in this subsection, or may withdraw such petition, application, request or appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">It is undisputed that the board did not hold a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal within sixty-five days after its receipt of their application. It is also undisputed that the board, believing that it had no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal because of the zoning commission\u2019s action, canceled the public hearing on the appeal by letter within sixty-five days of the receipt of the plaintiffs\u2019 application and never rescheduled it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The Appellate Court agreed with the trial court that the time requirements of \u00a7 8-7d (a) could be satisfied only by the commencement of a public hearing within sixty-five days after the receipt by the board of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and that the failure of the defendant board to hold such a hearing resulted in the automatic approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 site plan application, approval of which had been denied by the zoning commission. The Appellate Court, relying principally on <em>Vartuli </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 363-64, 472 A.2d 336 (1984), and <em>Carr </em>v. Woolwich 7 Conn. App. 684, 695, 510 A.2d 1358, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 804, 513 A.2d 698 (1986), concluded that the language in \u00a7 8-7d (a) is mandatory rather than directory, and ordained that automatic approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 site plan application must follow from the failure of the board to hold a timely hearing. <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>supra, a coastal site plan review was required under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-109. Section 22a-109 (g) provided: \u201cThe coastal site plan review required under this section shall be subject to the same statutory requirements as subsections (a) and (b) of section 8-7d for the purposes of determining the time limitations on the zoning commission in reaching a final decision.\u201d Section 8-7d (b), the applicable section in <em>Vartuli, </em>provided: \u201c[A] decision on an application for approval of such site plan shall be rendered within sixty-five days after receipt of such plan.\u201d We determined that \u00a7 8-7d (b) was \u201cfurther implemented by General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g), under which \u2018[ajpproval of a site plan [by a zoning commission] shall be presumed unless a decision to deny or modify it is rendered within the period specified in section 8-7d. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 358-59. We concluded: \u201cReading the three sections together compels the conclusion that . . . the legislature has expressly made approval of a coastal development plan mandatory upon failure to disapprove an application within the specified time period.\u201d Id., 362. We also noted in <em>Vartuli </em>that \u00a7 8-7d (b) requires an applicant\u2019s consent for an extension of the statutory time period, thus leading to an inference that the time limits contained in \u00a7 8-7d (b) are mandatory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Section 8-7d (a) contains similar consent language. The consent language in \u00a7 8-7d (a), the Appellate Court determined, required an inference that the time limits of \u00a7 8-7d (a) are mandatory in this case. It consequently concluded that the board\u2019s failure to comply with those time limits resulted in the automatic approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 application. <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The defendants contend that the statutes and cases relied on by the Appellate Court relate only to commissions and do not mandate that the automatic approval doctrine apply to the Colchester zoning board of appeals as a consequence of its cancellation of the public hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. They argue that because neither \u00a7 8-7d (a), nor \u00a7 8-7, the statute governing zoning appeals, contains provisions expressly requiring that the inaction of a zoning board of appeals result in the automatic approval of an application, we should not interpret \u00a7 8-7d (a) to require that the Colchester board\u2019s cancellation of the plaintiffs\u2019 hearing result in the automatic approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 application. The defendants assert that it is not the role of the judiciary to supply omissions in the statutes and that, if the legislature had intended that the failure of a zoning board of appeals to hold a hearing within sixty-five days was to effect the automatic approval of an application, it would simply have said so in \u00a7 8-7 as it has in \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) and 8-26 regarding zoning and planning commissions respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Section 8-3 (g), which specifically applies to zoning commissions, provides in pertinent part: \u201cApproval of a site plan shall be presumed unless a decision to deny or modify it is rendered within the period specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>in section 8-7d.\u201d Section 8-26, which applies to planning commissions, provides in pertinent part that the failure of a commission to act on a subdivision application within the time limits prescribed in \u00a7 8-26d \u201cshall be considered as an approval.\u201d Section 8-7d (a), however, contains no provision expressly mandating automatic approval of a site plan application that is the subject of an appeal, nor does \u00a7 8-7, which incorporates the time limits of \u00a7 8-7d, contain any such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 550, 235 A.2d 643 (1967), we held that a decision by a zoning board of appeals that had been rendered beyond the applicable time period, did not result in the automatic approval of the appellant\u2019s application. <em>Donohue, </em>however, construed \u00a7 8-7 prior to its amendment in 1977, an amendment that incorporated the time limits of \u00a7 8-7d into \u00a7 8-7. Prior to 1977, \u00a7 8-7 provided in pertinent part that \u201c[s]aid board shall decide such appeal within sixty days after the hearing.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1966) \u00a7 8-7. We concluded, in <em>Donohue, </em>that \u00a7 8-7 related to procedure and was directory and not mandatory. We noted, in support of our conclusion, that the \u201cstatute contains nothing which expressly invalidates a belated decision or which inferentially makes compliance therewith a condition precedent.\u201d <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 554; see also <em>Morningside Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>162 Conn. 154, 157, 292 A.2d 893 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The first certified question requires us to revisit <em>Donohue </em>to determine whether the automatic approval doctrine applies to a zoning board of appeals for its failure to hold a public hearing in view of the present statutory scheme of \u00a7 8-7d (a) that includes language of consent and prescribes time limits, and is now contained in \u00a7 8-7d (a) and incorporated in the present \u00a7 8-7. To resolve this difficult question, we must recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>cile two conflicting lines of reasoning. On the one hand, we held, in <em>Vartuli, </em>that the failure of a zoning commission to act within the time constraints of \u00a7 8-7d (b) resulted in the automatic approval of an application for a coastal management act site plan by a zoning commission, principally because of the mandatory language in \u00a7 8-26, but in part also because \u00a7 8-7d (b) contained language requiring the applicant\u2019s consent for an extension of the statutory time period. We reasoned in that case that the language requiring the applicant\u2019s consent to an extension of time permitted the inference that the time constraints in the statute were mandatory. Section 8-7d (a) contains similar language requiring an applicant\u2019s consent for an extension of the time limits contained in the statute, suggesting that the time limits in \u00a7 8-7d (a) are mandatory and that the board\u2019s failure to comply with them resulted in the automatic approval of the plaintiff\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">On the other hand, applicable tenets of statutory construction counsel us to ascribe significance to the absence, in \u00a7 8-7d (a), of the explicit provisions for automatic approval found in \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) and 8-26. It is a principle of statutory construction that a court must construe a statute as written. <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 690, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987). \u201cCourts may not by construction supply omissions . . . or add exceptions merely because it appears that good reasons exist for adding them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State ex rel. Kennedy </em>v. <em>Frauwirth, </em>167 Conn. 165, 168, 355 A.2d 39 (1974); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>202 Conn. 629, 640, 522 A.2d 795 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1977 Buick Automobile, </em>196 Conn. 471, 485, 493 A.2d 874 (1985). \u201cThe intent of the legislature, as this court has repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 325, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981). \u201c Tt is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the legislature.\u2019 <em>Duart </em>v. <em>Axton-Cross Co., </em>19 Conn. Sup. 188, 190, 110 A.2d 647 (1954).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 163 n.4, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984). It is also a tenet of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed to be aware of existing statutes. <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416-17, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.12. Because \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) and 8-26 expressly provide for the automatic approval of applications when a zoning commission or planning commission do not act within prescribed time periods, it can be inferred that had the legislature intended that the failure of a zoning board of appeals to hold a hearing within sixty-five days results in automatic approval, the legislature would have so provided. <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>supra, 417. Moreover, if a mandate for automatic approval is to be inferred from the consent language in \u00a7 8-7d (a), that construction would render the specific automatic approval language in \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) and 8-26 \u201cmere surplusage and such an interpretation has been proscribed by this court.\u201d <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>208 Conn. 576, 583 n.9, 546 A.2d 243 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Our most recent case addressing the application of the automatic approval doctrine to zoning boards of appeals appears to have resolved the tension that exists between the consent language of \u00a7 8-7d and the rules of statutory construction. In <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>223 Conn. 171, 177, 610 A.2d 1301 (1992), we determined that because the Coventry zoning board of appeals had failed to publish adequate notice of a hearing, the hearing and subsequent revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s permit were invalid. We then addressed \u201cthe consequences that flow from a zoning board\u2019s invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>hearing and subsequent ruling on an appeal from a decision of a zoning enforcement officer.\u201d Id. On that issue we stated: \u201cWhile the board\u2019s failure to give proper notice of its public hearing nullified its subsequent actions, that default had no further automatic consequences. <em>Even if a failure to give proper notice were deemed the equivalent of a failure to take timely action within the time constraints of \u00a7 8-7, that statute, contrary to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) or 8-26, does not make inaction tantamount to approval either of the challenged zoning permit or of the challenged appeal. </em>\u2018The statute contains nothing which expressly invalidates a belated decision or which inferentially makes compliance [with time constraints for board decisions] a condition precedent.\u2019 <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 554.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">To paraphrase the conclusions of the court in <em>Keopke, </em>it would be inappropriate to permit the plaintiffs in the present case to obtain their site plan approval solely because of the board\u2019s impression, even if mistaken, that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The plaintiffs were initially denied site plan approval by the zoning commission because of safety and environmental concerns. Without a clear statutory mandate to do otherwise, those concerns should be addressed rather than automatically ignored. \u201cThe rationality of land use planning procedures is strengthened by the disposition of zoning appeals on their merits. <em>Caserta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>[219 Conn. 352, 362, 593 A.2d 118 (1991)].\u201d Id., 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the language in <em>Koepke </em>that militates against their position is dictum. Moreover, they assert that <em>Koepke </em>was based on <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, a decision that is no longer applicable to the issue of automatic approval because <em>Donohue </em>was decided prior to 1977, before \u00a7 8-7 was amended. The amendment to \u00a7 8-7 now links the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>position of matters before the zoning board of appeals directly to the time periods set forth in \u00a7 8-7d. This statutory change, the plaintiffs assert, makes Koepke\u2019s reliance on <em>Donohue </em>misplaced, thus rendering <em>Koepke </em>\u2019s dictum an inaccurate statement of the current law because, prior to 1977, \u00a7 8-7 did not contain the language now present in \u00a7 8-7d (a) requiring the applicants\u2019 consent for the extension of the prescribed time limits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Although the factual predicate in <em>Koepke </em>was inadequate notice of a public hearing, <em>Koepke </em>directly confronted the issue of the failure of the board to take timely action within the time constraints of \u00a7 8-7d. <em>Keopke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 178-79. Furthermore, a resolution of that issue was necessary to our decision in <em>Koepke </em>because we declared the hearing \u201cvoid,\u201d a declaration that equated the hearing in <em>Koepke </em>with no hearing at all having been held, the exact situation in this case on appeal. Moreover, to the extent that <em>Donohue </em>is cited for the proposition that automatic approval is not expressed in, or to be inferred from, the present statutory scheme embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 8-7 and 8-7d as it relates to zoning boards of appeals, reliance on <em>Donohue </em>is not misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The plaintiffs also argue, citing <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>supra, 362, and <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Woolwich, </em>supra, 691-92, that if this court does not apply the automatic approval doctrine, an inconsistent body of law will be created because, in all other instances of land use decision-making, the automatic approval doctrine applies because of either \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) or 8-26. Moreover, the plaintiffs contend that the legislature clearly intended that the time limits applicable to all land use agencies be uniform.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We noted in <em>Vartuli, </em>however, that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>issue of continued appellate jurisdiction is of course not identical with the issue of timely response to initial land use applications.\u201d <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>supra, 361. Zoning boards of appeals do not perform the same functions as zoning commissions. Zoning boards of appeals do not adjudicate initial land use applications, but review those already acted upon by a municipality\u2019s zoning commission or enforcement officer. The defendant board in this case, after duly advertising the public hearing in a local newspaper, notified the plaintiffs by letter that the public hearing originally scheduled was canceled. The board canceled the hearing because it believed, apparently in good faith and relying on the advice of counsel, that the commission\u2019s action of reinterpreting its regulations regarding asphalt plants had left the board with no jurisdiction to act on the plaintiffs\u2019 site plan application, and no choice but to cancel the hearing. The board\u2019s appellate function is not advanced by the substitution of an automatic approval for a decision of an appeal on its merits. <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Consistent with our opinion in <em>Koepke, </em>therefore, we conclude that a zoning board of appeals is not subject to the automatic approval doctrine because it fails to hold a public hearing within the time limits contained in \u00a7 8-7d (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is unnecessary, therefore, to address in depth the second certified question concerning whether the \u201cautomatic approval\u201d doctrine applies when a zoning board of appeals timely issues a decision that it would not hold a hearing because it believed It lacked jurisdiction to do so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We answer both certified questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to remand the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the defendant board in order to allow the board to conduct a hearing on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Does the \u2018automatic approval\u2019 doctrine apply when the zoning board of appeals timely issues a decision that it would not hold a hearing because it believed it lacked jurisdiction?\u201d <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>222 Conn. 911, 911-12, 608 A.2d 694 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-26 applies to planning commissions rather than zoning commissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b459-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (a) expressly provides that in order to invoke the time constraints in that subsection, it must first be determined whether a \u201chearing is required on such petition, application, request or appeal. . . .\u201d The parties dispute whether a hearing was in fact required to be held by the board on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Section 17.1 of the Colchester zoning regulations, however, provides that \u201c[a]ny person may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, or decision made by the Commission or the Zoning Enforcement Officer related to the enforcement of these Regulations.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 also states that one of the duties of a zoning board of appeals is that it shall \u201chear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement or decision made by the official charged with the enforcement of this chapter . . . .\u201d The defendants contend that nowhere in \u00a7 17.1 or General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 is it stated that the board must hold a hearing when a party has alleged an error in a decision made by the zoning commission. The contention that neither provision requires a public hearing would render these provisions empty shells. These provisions clearly require that a right to an appeal embraces a right to a meaningful appeal in which a public hearing is held. Such a public hearing was required under the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b460-5\"> Although the Appellate Court in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Woolwich, </em>7 Conn.

And lastly, that the decision must be rendered within 65 days after the public hearing is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u201cThis bill would also permit extensions of each of the uniform time periods specified but only where the applicant consents to such extension and in no event could an extension exceed twice the time period specified.\u201d 20 H.R.
