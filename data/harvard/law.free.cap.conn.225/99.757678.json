The defendant, the department of labor, employment security division, determined in an administrative ruling that the plaintiff should be characterized as an employer paying taxable wages within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 (a) (1) (B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and should, therefore, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>assessed unemployment tax. The trial court, however, agreed with the plaintiff that the nurses were not employees within the meaning of the statute, but rather were independent contractors. The trial court, therefore, sustained the plaintiffs appeals challenging the assessments. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Our examination of the record on this appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The parties agree that the test that determines liability for unemployment tax in the circumstances of this case is the \u201cABC test\u201d contained in \u00a7 31-222 (a) (1) (B) (ii). See <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>216 Conn. 237, 246, 579 A.2d 497 (1990). In a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision, the trial court determined that the plaintiff had proven its entitlement to an exclusion from the tax by satisfying each of the three elements of the ABC test and thus proving that it was not an employer. <em>Daw\u2019s Critical Care Registry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>42 Conn. Sup. 376, 622 A.2d 622 (1993). Because that memorandum of decision fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>states and meets the arguments raised in the present appeals, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on that issue. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. See, e.g., <em>Loeb </em>v. <em>Al-Mor Corporation, </em>224 Conn. 6, 7, 615 A.2d 149 (1992); <em>Bannon </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>217 Conn. 457, 458-59, 586 A.2d 596 (1991); <em>Einbinder </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>217 Conn. 240, 242, 584 A.2d 1188 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 provides in relevant part: \u201cdefinitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201c(a) (1) \u2018Employment,\u2019 subject to the other provisions of this subsection, means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201c(A) Any service, including service in interstate commerce, and service outside the United States, performed under any express or implied contract of hire creating the relationship of employer and employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">\u201c(B) . . . subject to the other provisions of this subsection, [any] service performed ... by any of the following . . .
