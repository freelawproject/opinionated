J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQY\">The issue in this appeal is whether an unpaid subcontractor seeking to recover on a payment bond furnished for a public construction contract has adequately complied with the notice requirements contained in General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alleging nonpayment for materials supplied to the worksite, the plaintiff, Okee Industries, Inc., doing business as Hardware Specialities, Inc. (subcontractor), brought an action against the defendant Jon Butler Building and Remodeling (general contractor) and the named defendant, National Grange Mutual Insurance Company (surety).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing, the trial court rendered summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>judgment in favor of the surety, from which the subcontractor appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record establish the following facts. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-41,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the surety executed a payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>bond for a state financed construction project in East Windsor, naming the general contractor as principal and designating the suppliers of labor and materials as the beneficiaries of the bond. According to its complaint, the subcontractor supplied hardware items for the project in accordance with its contract with the general contractor, but remains unpaid to the extent of $37,742.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">After unsuccessfully demanding payment from the general contractor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the subcontractor sent written notice of its claim to the surety on six separate occasions. Even though only one of these notices was sent by certified or registered mail, the notices were timely and adequately apprised the surety of the substance of the subcontractor\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The surety refused to pay the subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In the subcontractor\u2019s action against the surety for breach of the surety\u2019s obligations under the payment bond, the trial court concluded that the subcontractor was not entitled to enforce its right to payment under the bond because it had failed to serve timely notice on the general contractor, as required by \u00a7 49-42 (a). Because the statute requires a claimant to give proper notice both to the principal on the bond and to the surety, the court granted the surety\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the subcontractor\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The subcontractor, in its appeal from the judgment, does not dispute that \u00a7 49-42 (a) makes compliance with the statutory notice requirements a precondition to its recovery on the surety bond. <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>174 Conn. 219, 224, 384 A.2d 378 (1978); <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Dahm, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>159 Conn. 563, 565, 271 A.2d 55 (1970). The subcontractor\u2019s obligation to give notice to the general contractor of its claim on a payment bond, even if the subcontractor and the general contractor have a direct contractual relationship, was added by an amendment to the statute in 1987. Public Acts 1987, No. 87-345, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u00a7 49-42 (a) now expressly provides that any \u201cperson who has furnished labor or material . . . may enforce his right to payment under the bond <em>by serving a notice of claim </em>within one hundred eighty days after the date on which he . . . furnished the last of the material for which the claim is made, <em>on the surety that issued the bond and a copy of the notice on the contractor named as principal </em>in the bond.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute thus permits the surety to assert as a defense to an action on the bond not only a lack of timely notice to the surety itself, but also a lack of \u201ca copy of the notice\u201d to the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The issue before us, therefore, is whether the subcontractor, after having repeatedly notified the surety in writing of a claim for payment in the amount of $37,742.90, adequately gave \u201ca copy of the notice\u201d to the general contractor. The statutory requirement would have been met, on its face, if the subcontractor, in one of its timely written notices of claim to the surety, had appended a legend indicating that a copy was being sent to the general contractor, and had then proceeded to forward a copy as indicated. In this case, however, the subcontractor instead sent a letter that, although timely, was the mirror image of what the statute contemplates. On July 9, 1990, the subcontractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>wrote a letter to the general contractor, challenging the general contractor\u2019s calculation of the amount remaining unpaid and demanding immediate payment by the general contractor. At the bottom of this letter, the subcontractor appended a notation indicating that a copy was being sent to the surety.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Whether the July 9,1990 letter meets the statutory requirement that the general contractor be served with <em>\u201ca </em>copy of the notice\u201d that a claim is being asserted against the surety depends upon an assessment of how the letter fits into two somewhat conflicting lines of cases. On the one hand, as the surety notes, \u00a7 49-42 is a statutory cause of action that had no antecedents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>at common law. \u201cThe statute having created the cause of action and prescribed the procedure, the mode of proceeding is mandatory and must be strictly complied with.\u201d <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Dahm, </em>supra, 565; <em>New Britain Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>113 Conn. 1, 7-8, 154 A. 147 (1931); <em>Wickes Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Currier Electric Co., </em>25 Conn. App. 751, 757, 596 A.2d 1331 (1991). On the other hand, as the subcontractor notes, \u00a7 49-42 is a remedial statute enacted to provide security for workers and materials suppliers unable to avail themselves of the protection of a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 477-79, 542 A.2d 692 (1988). Because \u201c[t]he statutory requirement of a bond is designed to protect and benefit those who furnish materials and labor to the contractor on public work, in that they may be sure of payment of their just claims, without defeat or undue delay . . . such statutory provisions are to be liberally construed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks <em>omitted.) American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra, <em>227; International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc., </em>151 Conn. 325, 333, 197 A.2d 638 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">We have not often applied maxims of strict construction and liberal construction to one and the same statute. As modern jurisprudence counsels, the explanation for this apparent paradox is found in an examination of the underlying fact patterns in the relevant cases. We have relied on the rule of strict construction when the issue was whether the claimant\u2019s notice complied with the specific time requirements of the statute. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Dahm, </em>supra, 566; <em>New Britain Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>supra; <em>Wickes Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Currier Electric Co., </em>supra, 759. We have, however, relied on the rule of liberal construction when the issue was the eligibility for statutory coverage of a particular class of subcontractors; <em>American Masons\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra; or a particular type of supplier of materials. <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc., </em>supra, 333-36. In other words, if the statute itself imposes specific constraints, we have held these constraints to be mandatory; if the statute leaves room for construction, we have construed its requirements liberally in order to implement the statute\u2019s remedial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Because \u00a7 49-42 was patterned after federal legislation popularly known as the Miller Act; 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a through 270d; we have regularly consulted federal precedents to determine the proper scope of our <em>statute. American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 223-24; <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Dahm, </em>supra, 567-68; <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc., </em>supra, 332-34. The federal precedents, like our own, counsel liberal construction of statutory requirements other than those relating to specific time constraints. As the Supreme Court of the United States observed in <em>Fleisher Engineering &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Hollenbeck, </em>311 U.S. 15, 18, 61 S. Ct. 81, 85 L. Ed. 12 (1940), \u201ca requirement which is clearly made a condition precedent to the right to sue must be given effect, but in determining whether a provision is of that character the statute must be liberally construed so as to accomplish its purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>Following Fleischer, </em>the lower federal courts, except in cases involving the timeliness of notice, have eschewed the rule of strict construction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>observed in <em>United States ex rel. Hopper Bros. Quarries </em>v. <em>Peerless Casualty Co., </em>255 F.2d 137, 143 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 831, 79 S. Ct. 51, 3 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1958): \u201cIt may be that Congress thought the procedural requirements it prescribed for laborers and materialmen to enforce the right to sue for their pay which is accorded them by the Miller Act were so plain, simple, and easy to comply with that there would seldom be questions about them. But experience is to the contrary and the courts are continually called on to determine whether one deviation or another from the strict letter of the Act necessitates denial of the protection to laborers and materialmen, which the Act aims to provide. The doctrine to which the courts are unanimously committed is that the protection of the laborers and materialmen is the dominant purpose of the Act and a liberal construction of its procedural provisions must be resorted to when necessary to effectuate that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Of specific relevance to the present case are the federal precedents that have relied on a standard of substantial performance rather than strict compliance when construing statutory notice requirements dealing with the service of notice and with the contents of notice. <em>Fleischer </em>held that the statutory requirement for service of notice should not be enforced in light of undisputed evidence that the notice had actually been given and received. <em>Fleisher Engineering &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Hollenbeck, </em>supra, 19; see also <em>Coffee </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Gordon, </em>157 F.2d 968, 969-70 (5th Cir. 1946) (delivery effective if by hand rather than by mail). Numerous decisions of federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>courts of appeals have similarly held a timely written notice to be sufficient despite technical deficiencies in its contents if notice in fact was actually given and received. See, e.g., <em>United States ex rel. San Joaquin Blocklite </em>v. <em>Lloyd E. Tull, Inc., </em>770 F.2d 862, 865-66 (9th Cir. 1985) (joint construction curing defects in two separately deficient letters); <em>United States ex rel. Honeywell, Inc. v. A &amp; L Mechanical Contractors, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 383, 386 (4th Cir. 1982) (contents of notice sufficient if \u201csubstantially accurate\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Kelly-Mohrhusen Co. </em>v. <em>Merle A. Patnode Co., </em>457 F.2d 116, 117 (7th Cir. 1972) (verbal communication augmenting deficient written notice); <em>United States ex rel. Jinks Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>452 F.2d 485, 488 (5th Cir. 1971) (joint construction curing two incomplete letters); <em>Liles Construction Co. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Stabler Paint Mfg. Co., </em>415 F.2d 889, 891 (5th Cir. 1969) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In light of the federal cases adopting a liberal construction of statutory requirements relating to notices that, although timely, are imperfectly worded, we conclude that the subcontractor complied with the notice requirements of \u00a7 49-42 (a) in the circumstances of this case. The apparent function of the statutory requirement that the contractor be served with \u201ca copy of the notice\u201d to the surety is to alert the contractor of the surety\u2019s impending involvement in the fiscal management of the project. The adequacy of the notice-giving function of the July 9,1990 letter was confirmed in this case by conversations held on August 2, 1990, within the statutory 180 day notice period, at a meeting between representatives of all three parties. At this meeting, the general contractor manifested its awareness of the fact that a notice of a claim had been given to the surety. The fact that the general contractor had received actual notice at the proper time persuades us that the imperfections of the letter fall within the cat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>egory of deviations that are insubstantial in the absence of demonstrated prejudice. See <em>Fleisher Engineering &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Hallenbeck, </em>supra; <em>United States ex rel. Kelly-Mohrhusen Co. </em>v. <em>Merle A. Patnode Co., </em>supra; <em>School Board of Palm Beach County ex rel. Major Electrical Supplies of Stuart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Vincent J. Fasano, Inc., </em>417 So. 2d 1063, 1066 (Fla. App. 1982); <em>Keller Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Lydig Construction Co., </em>57 Wash. App. 594, 599-600, 789 P.2d 788 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Our decision to permit a subcontractor to sue on a surety bond despite its failure to comply precisely with the notice requirements of \u00a7 49-42 (a) is consistent with the emerging law elsewhere. We have used a substantial compliance test to assess the sufficiency of the contents of a statutory notice under other remedial statutes, such as our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-294; see, e.g., <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corporation, </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992). Furthermore, the legislature has recently adopted revisions to article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code designed to limit the ability of a surety, in the absence of a showing of prejudice, to avoid paying its obligations under the bond by relying on insubstantial deviations from the contractual relationships between the underlying parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although article 3 governs only those suretyship transactions that arise in the context of parties to a negotiable instrument; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-102; its provisions are being seriously considered as the basis for broader proposals for a new Restatement of the Law of Suretyship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The subcontractor in this case is suing to recover from the surety under the precise circumstances for which \u00a7 49-42 was enacted. Unless the subcontractor can pursue its remedy on the surety bond, its contribution to a public works project will remain uncompensated because of the general contractor\u2019s bankruptcy. The surety was paid to provide security against that very risk. In the absence of specific statutory instructions to the contrary, we conclude that the subcontractor\u2019s insubstantial deviation from the notice requirements of \u00a7 49-42 does not defeat its right to look to the security that the legislature intended to provide for laborers and materials suppliers at public worksites.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-42 provides in relevant part: \u201cenforcement OF RIGHT TO PAYMENT ON BOND. SUIT ON BOND, PROCEDURE AND JUDGMENT, (a) Every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under the provisions of section 49-41 and who has not been paid in full therefor before the expiration of a period of ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which the claim is made, may enforce his right to payment under the bond by serving a notice of claim within one hundred eighty days after the date on which he performed the last of the labor or furnished the last of the material for which the claim is made, on the surety that issued the bond and a copy of the notice on the contractor named as principal in the bond. The notice of claim shall state with substantial accuracy the amount claimed, the name of the party for whom the labor was performed or to whom the materials were furnished and shall provide a detailed description of the bonded public project for which the labor or materials were provided. . . . The notices required under this section shall be served by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid in envelopes addressed to any office at which the surety, principal or claimant conducts his business, or in any manner in which civil process may be served. If the surety denies liability on the claim, or any portion thereof, the claimant may bring action upon the payment bond in the superior court for such sums and prosecute the action to final execution and judgment. )&gt;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> The first count of the complaint was an action against both defendants for breach of their respective contractual obligations. The second count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the complaint was an action against the surety for allegedly engaging in unfair claim settlement practices in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6) and in unfair trade practices in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b. In the trial court, the subcontractor conceded that it could not recover on the second count of its complaint if the first count were barred by its failure to comply with the notice requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 49-42. Because the trial court found that the subcontractor had failed to comply with these notice requirements, the trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the surety. For this reason, this appeal addresses only the first count of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 provides: \u201cpublic structures, bonds for protection of employees and materialmen, (a) Before any contract exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars in amount for the construction, alteration or repair of any public building or public work of the state or of any subdivision thereof is awarded to any person, except a design professional, as defined in section 4b-55, that person shall furnish to the state or the subdivision a bond in the amount of the contract which shall be binding upon the award of the contract to that person, with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the officer awarding the contract, for the protection of persons supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract for the use of each such person, provided no such bond shall be required to be furnished in relation to any general bid in which the total estimated cost of labor and materials under the contract with respect to which such general bid is submitted is less than twenty-five thousand dollars or in relation to any sub-bid in which the total estimated cost of labor and materials under the contract with respect to which such sub-bid is submitted is less than fifty thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u201c(b) Nothing in this section or sections 49-41a to 49-43, inclusive, shall be construed to limit the authority of any contracting officer to require a performance bond or other security in addition to the bond herein referred to, except that no such officer shall require a performance bond in relation to any general bid in which the total estimated cost of labor and materials under the contract with respect to which such general bid is submitted is less than twenty-five thousand dollars or in relation to any sub-bid in which the total estimated cost of labor and materials under the contract with respect to which such sub-bid is submitted is less than fifty thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"> The general contractor filed for bankruptcy on December 4, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> The legal sufficiency of these notices to the surety is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\"> Number 87-345, \u00a7 2 of the 1987 Public Acts made a number of changes to General Statutes \u00a7 49-42.
