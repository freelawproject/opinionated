The plaintiff claimed that he was so entitled and that he had been wrongfully deprived of his seat on the board by the defendants, the election officials of the town of Southington. He subsequently filed a complaint pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-328 to enforce his claim to office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that the defendants had correctly interpreted the Southington town charter and had properly awarded one of two vacancies on the board of finance to a candidate who had received fewer votes than the plaintiff. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>On November 5, 1991, a general election for municipal offices was held in the town of Southington. Included were contests for two six year terms and one truncated unexpired term on the Southington board of finance. The Southington board of finance consists of six members who serve six year terms. Two of the six members of the board run for reelection on a staggered basis every two years. 24 Spec. Acts 589, No. 153, \u00a7 1 (1945), see footnote 5; Southington town charter \u00a7 202 (e), see footnote 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In 1991, of the three members of the board whose seats were not contested in the November election, two were Democrats and one was a Republican. A Democrat, Christine A. Shanley, was elected to fill the unexpired term on the board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board at that point had as members three Democrats and one Republican.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">A Republican candidate, Leonard Marcheselle, received the highest number of votes in the election from among the five candidates for the two six year terms on the board. The next highest number of votes was obtained by the plaintiff, who is a Democrat. The third highest number of votes was garnered by Jeanne C. Carey, a Republican.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The defendant election officials, Juanine S. DePaolo, the Southington town clerk, and Susan Elshire, the election moderator, declared Marcheselle, who received the highest number of votes, elected to one of the two six year terms on the board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point the board had a complement of three Democrats and two Republicans. The defendants then declared Carey, the Republican, who had received the third highest number of votes in the election, the winner of the second six year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>term on the board, rather than the plaintiff, who had received the second highest vote total.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defendants claim that they were required to award the second full term to Carey rather than the plaintiff by \u00a7 2 of Special Act No. 411 (1931), as amended by \u00a7 1 of Special Act No. 153 (1945). Those special acts, the defendants contend, mandate that the Southington board of finance be bipartisan and that it be composed of three members of each of the two leading political parties. They argue, therefore, that they had no choice but to declare Carey, rather than the plaintiff, the winner of the second full term on the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Section 2 of Special Act No. 411 (1931) established a six member board of finance for Southington, the board to be composed of three members of each of the two leading political parties receiving the highest number of votes in an annual election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1 of Special Act No. 153 (1945) amended \u00a7 2 of Special Act No. 411 to provide for staggered six year terms for the members of the board, two seats to be contested every two years. Special Act No. 153 did not, however, contemplate a change in the bipartisan nature of the board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1 of Special Act No. 153 provided in pertinent part that, once staggered terms were estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>lished: \u201cBiennially thereafter, each of the leading political parties shall nominate not fewer than two candidates to hold office for a term of six years from the date of their election and until their successors have been elected and have qualified, to be voted for at such biennial election. No person at such election shall vote for more than two members of said board. Of the total number of members so voted for, the one receiving the highest number of votes on each of the tickets of the two leading political parties shall be elected to said board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The plaintiff and the defendants stipulated that Special Act No. 411 created a six person bipartisan board of finance for the town of Southington. They also agree in their briefs that the effect of Special Act No. 153 was to create staggered six year terms for members of the board but that Special Act No. 153 did not purport to and was not intended to change the bipartisan composition of the board. The plaintiff claims, however, that both special acts were superseded in 1966, when Southington adopted a town charter pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Home Rule Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-187 through 7-201. See <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>178 Conn. 81, 85, 420 A.2d 1160 (1979). He points out that the Southington charter incorporated \u00a7 9-167a of the General Statutes, the minority representation statute, as \u00a7 204 of the charter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He maintains that as a result, pursuant to \u00a7 204 of the charter, a municipal board comprised of six members may have a maximum of four members of the same political party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>fore, that in 1991, the Southington board of finance was no longer required to be bipartisan but could properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>have seated four members of a single political party. He argues that, consequently, the charter and the results of the November, 1991 election, wherein he received the second highest number of total votes, dictate that he be declared the winner of the full six year term on the board that he contends was erroneously awarded to the Republican, Carey. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim requires that we construe \u00a7 204 of the Southington town charter in the context of the charter as a whole \u201cwith a view toward reconciling its parts in order to obtain a sensible and rational overall interpretation.\u201d <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>207 Conn. 441, 451, 541 A.2d 1226 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 355, 538 A.2d 185 (1988); <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984). Section 1102 of the Southington town charter provides in relevant part: \u201cAs of the effective date of this Charter all General Laws and Special Acts applying to the town, all ordinances and bylaws of the town, and all rules and regulations of commissions, boards, departments and agencies of the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>shall continue in force, except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter, until they are amended or repealed by ordinance of the council or the appropriate body having jurisdiction. All Special Acts or parts of acts relating to the town inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter are repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The plaintiff does not claim that Special Acts Nos. 411 and 153 have been expressly amended or repealed by the town council or another appropriate body. He argues, rather, that Special Acts Nos. 411 and 153 have been repealed by implication because they are inconsistent with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 9-167a, the minority representation statute, that has been incorporated into the Southington town charter via \u00a7 204 of the charter. The plaintiffs claim that the Special Acts are inconsistent with the charter and have been repealed by implication is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Section 204 of the Southington charter incorporated \u00a7 9-167a of the General Statutes into the charter in its entirety. Subsection (e) of \u00a7 9-167a provides: \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to repeal, modify or prohibit enactment of any general or special act or charter which provides for a greater degree of minority representation than is provided by this section.\u201d Consequently, Special Acts Nos. 411 and 153, which provide greater minority representation than General Statutes \u00a7 9-167a, are not inconsistent with the Southington charter but in fact have had their lives extended by the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Moreover, several tenets of statutory construction militate against the plaintiffs position. It is well established that repeal of the provisions of a prior legislative enactment by implication is not favored. <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>199 Conn. 294, 305, 507 A.2d 92 (1986); <em>Southern Connecticut Gas </em>Co. v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>191 Conn. 514, 521, 468 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>574 (1983); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ulichny, </em>185 Conn. 145, 153, 440 A.2d 885 (1981); <em>Hirschfeld </em>v. <em>Commission on Claims, </em>172 Conn. 603, 606, 376 A.2d 71 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Repeal by implication will not be inferred if legislative acts can be reconciled and given concurrent effect. <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>supra, 306; <em>Shanley </em>v. <em>Jankura, </em>144 Conn. 694, 702, 137 A.2d 536 (1957). That Special Acts Nos. 411 and 153 can be reconciled and given concurrent effect with the provisions of the charter is manifest. The Special Acts, relating to the election of the members of the board of finance, not only do not conflict with the provisions of the charter but the charter, by its terms, explicitly contemplates their continued existence and efficacy as long as they provide for greater minority representation than required by \u00a7 204 of the charter. At the same time, \u00a7 204 is effective to establish, by charter, minimum minority representation on boards and commissions generally, as provided in \u00a7 9-167a, to ensure that their political makeup conforms to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Furthermore, Southington election officials have, since the charter became effective in 1966, continued to consider Special Acts Nos. 411 and 153 the operative law concerning the composition of the board of finance. Consequently, they have routinely required the election of a bipartisan board from the time of the enactment of Special Act No. 411 in 1931, until 1991, when the present controversy arose. Indeed, the plaintiff himself received the benefit of that interpretation of the Special Acts and the charter in the municipal election in 1985, when he was declared the winner of a seat on the board of finance despite having received fewer votes than two Republican candidates. \u201c[T]he interpretation of provisions of a city charter by the city council or other town authorities has been given considerable weight by courts construing and applying such provisions. See <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>178 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Conn. 509, 518, 423 A.2d 156 (1979); see also <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>114 Cal. App. 3d 939, 945-46, 170 Cal. Rptr. 875 (1981); <em>Van Cleve </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>216 Minn. 500, 508, 13 N.W.2d 467 (1944); <em>Morey Engineering &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>St. Louis Artificial Ice Rink Co., </em>242 Mo. 241, 261-62, 146 S.W. 1142 (1912); 2 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. 1979) \u00a7 9.22, p. <em>686.\u201d Pepe v. New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 291, 524 A.2d 629 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Finally, a radical departure from the long established policy of having a bipartisan board of finance will not be inferred without a clear indication that such a result was intended. <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 481, 542 A.2d 692 (1988); <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 527, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979); <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 667, 103 A.2d 535 (1954). There is no discernible indication that the voters of Southington intended the demise of bipartisanship on the board of finance by adopting the charter in 1966. In fact, every indication in the charter is to the contrary. See Southington town charter \u00a7 1102 and \u00a7 204 (incorporating General Statutes \u00a7 9-167a [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In order to support his position the plaintiff places great reliance on subsection (g) of \u00a7 202 of the Southington charter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That subsection of \u00a7 202 concerns the election of members of the board of water commissioners and explicitly mandates that that board shall consist of six members, only three of whom shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>be members of any one political party. On the other hand, the plaintiff notes, \u00a7 202 (e) of the charter states only that two members of the board of finance shall be elected biennially for a term of six years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He argues that if the drafters of the charter had intended that the board of finance remain bipartisan after the adoption of the charter, they would have used language similar to that used in \u00a7 202 (g) in drafting \u00a7 202 (e). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Just as compelling an interpretation of subsections (e) and (g) of \u00a7 202 of the charter as that espoused by the plaintiff, is that the board of water commissioners was reconstituted as bipartisan by the charter when previously it had not been bipartisan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The drafters of the charter, on the other hand, may well have believed that such language was unnecessary to establish the bipartisan composition of the board of finance because \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 1102 of the Southington charter continued the existence and validity of Special Acts Nos. 411 and 153 that had already provided for a bipartisan board of finance. Further, there is nothing in the charter to which we have been directed or that we could locate to indicate that the number of members of the board of finance or the method of their selection was changed from that provided in Special Act No. 153. The drafters of the charter therefore apparently assumed the continued efficacy of Special Act No. 153 to maintain the membership of the board at six members serving staggered six year terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 9-328. contests and complaints in election OF MUNICIPAL OFFICERS AND NOMINATION OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.

In any action brought pursuant to the provisions of this section, the complainant shall send a copy of the complaint by first-class mail, or deliver a copy of the complaint by hand, to the state elections enforcement commission. If such complaint is made prior to such election or primary, such judge shall proceed expeditiously to render judgment on the complaint and shall cause notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>hearing to be given to the secretary of the state and the state elections enforcement commission. If such complaint is made subsequent to such election or primary, it shall be brought within ten days of such election or primary to any judge of the superior court, in which he shall set out the claimed errors of the election official, the claimed errors in the count or the claimed violations of said sections.

Such judge shall, on the day fixed for such hearing and without unnecessary delay, proceed to hear the parties. If sufficient reason is shown, he may order any voting machines to be unlocked or any ballot boxes to be opened and a recount of the votes cast, including absentee ballots, to be made. Such judge shall thereupon, if he finds any error in the rulings of the election official or any mistake in the count of the votes, certify the result of his finding or decision to the secretary of the state before the tenth day succeeding the conclusion of the hearing. Such judge may order a new election or primary or a change in the existing election schedule. Such certificate of such judge of his finding or decision shall be final and conclusive upon all questions relating to errors in the ruling of such election officials, to the correctness of such count, and, for the purposes of this section only, such claimed violations, and shall operate to correct the returns of the moderators or presiding officers, so as to conform to such finding or decision, except that this section shall not affect the right of appeal to the supreme court and it shall not prevent such judge from reserving such questions of law for the advice of the supreme court as provided in section 9-325. Such judge may, if necessary, issue his writ of mandamus, requiring the adverse party and those under him to deliver to the complainant the appurtenances of such office, and shall cause his finding and decree to be entered on the records of the superior court in the proper judicial district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The defendants claimed that the trial court improperly denied their motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint under General Statutes \u00a7 9-328 for lack of jurisdiction because of the failure of the plaintiff timely to serve certain parties.
