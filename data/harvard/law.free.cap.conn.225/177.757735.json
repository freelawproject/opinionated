The plaintiff, John Pratt, alleged that his automobile \u201cstruck a large patch of ice extending across the southerly travel portion of the road causing the plaintiff to lose control of his vehicle, which crossed over the north bound lane, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>skidded off the road and collided with a tree . . . .\u201d He also alleged that as a result of the accident he suffered serious injuries, including a brain injury that has rendered him quadriplegic. On March 24,1987, he furnished the town with written notice of the accident. Thereafter, the plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> instituted this action against the town and the other defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The town moved to dismiss the count pertaining to it on the ground that the notice it had received was defective. The notice incorrectly stated that it was being given pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-465,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the municipal employee indemnification statute. It failed to make reference to the correct statute, General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the municipal highway defect statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The trial court held that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the notice requirement of \u00a7 13a-149, which is a condition precedent to recovery, and granted the motion to dismiss the action against the town. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. We transferred the matter to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We recently held pursuant to the Tort Reform Act of 1986<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cthat an action under the highway defect statute, \u00a7 13a-149, is a plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy against a municipality or other political subdivision \u2018for damages resulting from injury to any person or property by means of a defective road or bridge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 192, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). Therefore, a town may not be held liable for damages caused by highway defects under \u00a7 7-465 (a), since this would allow a plaintiff to circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 13a-149 by suing a municipal employee and seeking indemnification from the town. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Under \u00a7 13a-149, the plaintiff must provide statutory notice within ninety days of the accident in order for an action to lie for damages caused by a defective highway that the town must maintain. \u201c[T]he notice which the statute prescribes comprehends five essential elements: (a) written notice of the injury; (b) a general description of that injury; (c) the cause; (d) the time [and date], and (e) the place thereof.\u201d <em>Marino </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>120 Conn. 577, 579, 182 A. 225 (1935). In its motion to dismiss, the town failed to claim that the above five essential elements were not included in the notice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The town\u2019s only claim is that the notice was insufficient as a matter of law to support an action under the highway defect statute because it incorrectly cited \u00a7 7-465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>rather than \u00a7 13a-149. The trial court concluded that the incorrect citation was the equivalent of giving no notice to the town. If this were the case, the plaintiff would be barred from recovery. See <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 198 (\u201c[t]he plaintiff who fails within ninety days to provide the municipality with the statutorily required notice will be barred from any recovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the notice required by \u00a7 13a-149 was not given simply because the plaintiff\u2019s written notice made reference to a different statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>First, there is no statutory requirement that the notice specify the statute relied upon to support the cause of action. Additionally, the town advances no practical reason why we should import such a requirement by judicial gloss. Furthermore, and more importantly, the town does not claim that it was misled or otherwise prejudiced by the plaintiffs mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In determining whether the notice is sufficient, we must look to the purpose of the statute. <em>Sizer </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>113 Conn. 145, 157-58, 154 A. 639 (1931); <em>Bassin v. Stamford, </em>26 Conn. App. 534, 539, 602 A.2d 1044 (1992). The purpose of the notice requirement is not to set a trap for the unwary or to place an impediment in the way of an injured party who has an otherwise meritorious claim. Rather, the purpose of notice is to allow the municipality to make a proper investigation into the circumstances surrounding the claim in order to protect its financial interests. <em>Wethersfield </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co., </em>145 Conn. 368, 372, 143 A.2d 454 (1958). More specifically, as we recently stated in <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 198, the \u201cstatutory notice assists a town in settling claims promptly in order to avoid the expenses of litigation and encourages prompt investigation of conditions that may endanger public safety, as well as giving the town an early start in assembling evidence for its defense against meritless claims.\u201d We find that the notice given in this case served those purposes, notwithstanding the fact that it misstated the statutory section upon which the claim was predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Finally, it is not without significance that the legislature provided a liberal saving clause in order to validate the content of a defective notice. Section 13a-149 provides that no notice \u201cshall be held invalid or insufficient by reason of an inaccuracy in describing the injury or in stating the time, place or cause of its occurrence, if it appears that there was no intention to mislead or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>that such town, city, corporation or borough was not in fact misled thereby.\u201d Although it is limited in terms of the types of defects covered, this clause demonstrates that the legislature intended that compliance with the notice requirement be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff. See <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>210 Conn. 721, 728, 557 A.2d 116 (1989) (citing <em>Johnson v. Sikes, </em>56 Conn. 589, 596 [1888], in recognition that \u201ca very liberal construction is given to saving statute\u201d); <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 276, 545 A.2d 530 (1988) (a court should consider a statute as a whole, reconciling its separate provisions so that a reasonable overall interpretation is achieved).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The legislature\u2019s intention that \u00a7 13a-149 should be liberally construed is made even clearer when this statute is compared with General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144, the state highway liability statute. The latter statute requires the same content for statutory notice as the municipal highway liability statute\u2014a description of the injury, the cause, and the time and place\u2014but it does not provide a saving clause. This court recently held in <em>Bresnan </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>224 Conn. 23, 26 n.3, 615 A.2d 1040 (1992), that the state highway notice requirement must be strictly construed since \u00a7 13a-144, unlike \u00a7 13a-149, does not contain a saving clause. A necessary corollary to this is that the municipal highway notice requirement should be liberally construed since it, unlike \u00a7 13a-144, does contain a saving clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The town also argues that the notice was legally insufficient because the plaintiff\u2019s original complaint sought damages based upon nuisance as well as negligence against the town.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since \u00a7 13a-149 provides an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>exclusive remedy, the town argues, the inclusion of a nuisance claim strengthens the conclusion that the plaintiff was proceeding under \u00a7 7-465 rather than \u00a7 13a-149.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The town cites no authority to support the claim that the plaintiffs allegation of nuisance somehow carved into stone the nature of the notice. The fact remains that every essential element of the notice required under \u00a7 13a-149 was furnished to the town, and that only some of those elements are required in an action for indemnification under \u00a7 7-465.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We refuse to invalidate the plaintiff\u2019s notice as a matter of law merely because the plaintiffs complaint sought damages pursuant to the alternative theory of nuisance. See <em>Dreier </em>v. <em>UpJohn Co., </em>196 Conn. 242, 245, 492 A.2d 164 (1985) (\u201c[ujnder our pleading practice, a plaintiff is permitted to advance alternative or even inconsistent theories of liability against one or more defendants in a single complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The trial court also dismissed the complaint because the plaintiff failed to allege both that the town \u201chas a., <em>statutory </em>duty to maintain the roads in Old Saybrook,\u201d and that he \u201csent statutorily required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>notice under\u201d \u00a7 13a-149. (Emphasis in original.) The town has not, however, pursued either of these reasons to sustain the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action against it, so we will not consider them. We note in passing that a motion to dismiss is not designed to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint in terms of whether it states a cause of action. That should be done, instead, by a motion to strike; see <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>194 Conn. 635, 640, 484 A.2d 934 (1984); the practical difference being that if a motion to strike is granted, the party whose pleading is stricken is given an opportunity to replead in order to avoid a harsh result. Id.; see also Practice Book \u00a7 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-11\"> Because of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address the named plaintiffs additional claim that the trial court erred in failing to follow the law of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\"> Suzanne Wilson, the mother of John Pratt, was joined as a plaintiff in the action seeking damages against the town in a separate count. That count was stricken by the trial court and is not at issue before this court. References to the plaintiff are to the named plaintiff, John Pratt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> The plaintiff also sought damages against the defendants Willi J. Benoit and Toni Benoit, who were in possession and control of property adjoining the public highway at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s accident. The third count of the complaint alleged that these defendants developed their property in such a way as to divert the flow of water from their property onto the highway, thereby creating a nuisance that resulted in the injury to the plaintiff. The fourth count alleged negligence against these defendants for diverting the water and creating a dangerous condition on the highway. In the fifth count, the plaintiff\u2019s mother alleged nuisance and negligence against these defendants and sought recovery of past and future medical expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-465 makes municipalities liable for certain damages caused by their employees to third parties in the course of their duties as employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 provides: \u201cAny person injured in person or property by means of a defective road or bridge may recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair. ...
