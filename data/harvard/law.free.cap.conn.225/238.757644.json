On December 30,1971, the defendant John C. Van Gilder, a neurosurgeon, performed an operation on the plaintiff, Arthur L. Robbins, at the defendant Yale-New Haven Hospital (hospital), in New Haven. On August 17, 1984, Robbins commenced this action by serving Van Gilder, the hospital, and the defendant Yale University (medical school)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with a complaint returnable on September 18, 1984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The final version of Robbins\u2019 complaint was in three counts. The first count was against all the defendants. In that count, Robbins alleged that Van Gilder, as a member of the hospital\u2019s neurosurgical staff, was an employee of the hospital, and was an employee of the medical school as an associate professor of neurosurgical medicine. Robbins alleged that Van Gilder had been negligent in the operation he performed on Robbins on December 30, 1971, \u00e1nd had caused Robbins serious and permanent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In the second count, also against all three defendants, Robbins alleged that Van Gilder had failed to inform him of Van Gilder\u2019s negligence. He further alleged that Van Gilder\u2019s failure so to inform him, and that Van Gilder\u2019s repeated assurances to him that he would fully recover, had fraudulently concealed from him the fact that he had suffered actionable harm. Robbins further alleged that, as a result of that fraudulent concealment, he did not discover and could not have reasonably discovered that he had suffered actionable harm until he received a letter, dated August 2,1982, informing him that the December 30, 1971 operation had been performed negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The third count was against the hospital only. In that count, Robbins alleged that the hospital had failed to inform him that the operation had been negligently performed and that he had suffered actionable harm. He also alleged that the hospital had failed to monitor its staff and had failed to have a reporting system regarding the negligence of its staff that would have informed him that he had suffered actionable harm. He further alleged that the hospital had been engaged in a continuous course of conduct, consisting of treatment of him for the injuries he had suffered in the December 30, 1971 operation, and that, as a result, the statute of limitations governing his cause of action does not begin to run until that course of conduct ceases.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The defendants all pleaded the statute of limitations as a special defense, as well as denying the essential allegations of the complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In reply, Robbins alleged that: (1) the defendants should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations because, due to their negligence, he had suffered brain damage that affected his ability to understand completely the nature and extent of what had happened to him, and to understand whether he could have had a claim for damages against the defendants; (2) the statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-584,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would be unconstitutional if applied to him; and (3) as to Van Gilder, the statute of limitations had been tolled in part pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-590.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On these pleadings, the case was tried to a jury in February and early March, 1991. At the end of the plaintiffs case and at the end of all the evidence, the defendants moved for directed verdicts in their favor. The trial court, <em>D. Dorsey, J., </em>reserved decision on these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The trial court submitted to the jury five special interrogatories, described and discussed infra. In its instructions to the jury, the trial court ordered the jury to return verdicts for the defendants on the second and third counts, for the following reasons. With respect to the second count, based on fraudulent concealment, the trial court stated that the claim \u201cis subsumed in the plaintiff\u2019s reply to the statute of limitations defense . . . that [the] defendants fraudulently concealed [the] plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. It would only confuse you if I left the Second Count in the case and the removal does not, in fact, prejudice the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">With respect to the third count, alleging independent negligence against the hospital and a continuous course of treatment by the hospital to overcome the statute of limitations defense, the trial court stated that the independent negligence claim failed for lack of expert testimony. With respect to the continuing course of treatment allegation, the court stated that \u201c[t]his claim is also subsumed in plaintiff\u2019s reply to the special defense of the defendant. This states the defendant continuously treated the plaintiff on or about December, 1971, and through and beyond July, 1984. Here again, permitting this to remain would cause confusion. Its removal from the complaint will not prejudice the defense since my instruction put this claim as well as fraudulent concealment in proper perspective under the reply. Therefore I\u2019m directing you to return a defendant\u2019s verdict on the Third Count.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On March 11, 1991, the jury returned a verdict on the first count (1) in favor of the plaintiff, in the amount of $1,550,000, against Van Gilder and the medical school, and (2) in favor of the hospital.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>to that count, however, the jury also answered the five special interrogatories submitted to it as follows: (1) Van Gilder was negligent in connection with the surgery he performed on Robbins on December 30,1971; (2) Van Gilder\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of Robbins\u2019 injuries and the damages claimed by Robbins; (3) Van Gilder was an agent of <em>the hospital </em>in connection with the surgery; (4) the claims of Robbins as to negligence and damages in connection with the performance of the surgery <em>were barred </em>by the statute of limitations; and (5) Robbins had <em>not </em>proven by clear, precise and unequivocal evidence that Van Gilder had fraudulently concealed the fact that Robbins \u201chad suffered some form of actionable harm during the course of the surgery on December 30, 1971, so as to toll or suspend the statute of limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>diet and the interrogatories conflicted with each other, therefore, in at least the following ways: (1) the verdict found Van Gilder and the medical school liable to Robbins, despite the specific findings that Robbins\u2019 claim was barred by the statute of limitations and that Robbins had not proven that Van Gilder had fraudulently concealed the cause of action; and (2) the verdict found the medical school, but not the hospital, liable as Van Gilder\u2019s principal, despite the specific finding that Van Gilder had been the agent of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">After the clerk read the verdict and inquired of the jury whether it was their verdict,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court directed the clerk to read the interrogatories and answers. The trial court thereupon informed the jury that it could not accept the verdict because the verdict was inconsistent with the answers to the interrogatories regarding the statute of limitations, and returned the jury to the deliberation room for reconsideration of its verdict and its answers to the interrogatories.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Van Gilder, the medical school and the hospital then moved for directed verdicts in their favor, upon the basis of the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories, and Robbins moved that the court accept the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of those answers. After the court denied the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict, Van Gilder and the medical school moved for a mistrial upon the basis of the jury\u2019s confusion. The court took no action on Robbins\u2019 motion to accept the verdict, or on Van Gilder\u2019s and the medical school\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">At that point, the jury submitted the first of what would ultimately be five written questions or other communications to the court. This first question asked: \u201cWhy does an award for negligence have to be combined with fraudulent concealment^] We thought they were two separate issues. We were awarding for negligence exclusive of fraudulent concealment.\u201d Van Gilder and the medical school thereupon renewed their motion for a directed verdict and, after the court denied that motion, renewed their motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The jury then submitted the second question to the court: \u201cWhat constitutes medical fraud?\u201d At that point all three defendants\u2014Van Gilder, the medical school and the hospital\u2014moved for a mistrial. The trial court then returned the jury to the courtroom and reinstructed it, in response to the jury\u2019s first question, on the issue of the statute of limitations and the relationship between that issue and the issue of fraudulent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>cealment. In the course of those instructions, moreover, the court explained why the jury\u2019s answer to the interrogatory regarding Van Gilder\u2019s agency was inconsistent with its verdict.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court then provided the jury with new verdict forms and a clean set of the same interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">At that point the jury submitted the following request: \u201cTo reconsider medical fraud we would like our second question answered.\u201d The court then, again, returned the jury to the courtroom and reinstructed it on the relationship between the statute of limitations defense and issue of fraudulent concealment of a cause of action. The defendants then renewed their motions for a directed verdict and, in the alternative, a mistrial. The court denied these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The jury then submitted the following statement to the trial court: \u201cWe understood that the statute of limitations was barred if the lawsuit was brought within two to three years after discovery[.] We believe discovery is 1982.\u201d The defendants again renewed their motions for a mistrial. The court then returned the jury to the courtroom once again and, after informing the jury that its note was not in the form of a question, read the statute of limitations; see footnote 5; to the jury. The court then instructed the jury that \u201cI don\u2019t know what your question is, from reading this [note]. If you have a question you\u2019ll have to write it out.\u201d The jury orally informed the court: \u201cBy reading the statute you answered the question.\u201d The court then adjourned for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The next day, March 12, 1991, began with the fifth of the jury\u2019s written communications to the court: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201cCould we have a copy of the law on fraud? [2] If we can\u2019t we would like to here [sic] you (the judge) talk about the law on fraud again? [3] Could we also here [sic] about the statute of limitations? Or a copy of?\u201d The defendants then renewed their motions for a directed verdict. The plaintiff urged the court to follow the procedure provided in General Statutes \u00a7 52-223.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendants objected to that procedure, and again renewed their motions for a directed verdict or, in the alternative, suggested that \u201cthe judgment has to be made at this point that this situation is so far out of control and that there just isn\u2019t any judicial way to resolve it, here and now, other than by way of a mistrial.\u201d The court then stated that \u201cI have given consideration to the verdict forms, to the interrogatories, the series of questions from the jury. And I am convinced that the jury is hopelessly confused.\u201d The court, therefore, declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Thereafter, the parties filed the following written motions: (1) the plaintiff moved for judgment against the defendants in the amount of $ 1,550,000, in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict; (2) the defendants moved for a directed verdict notwithstanding the failure of the jury to return a verdict, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 321;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (3) the defendants moved for judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>accordance with their motions for a directed verdict, based upon the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories regarding the statute of limitations. In a written memorandum of decision, the trial court denied all the motions, maintaining its order of a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The parties thereafter took the following appeals to the Appellate Court, which we transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). Van Gilder and the medical school filed an appeal, Docket No. 14453, claiming that the trial court improperly (1) denied the motions for summary judgment; see footnote 4; (2) denied their motions for a directed verdict made at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence; and (3) denied their posttrial motions for judgment. In response, Robbins argues that: (1) a denial of a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal after a full trial on the merits; see <em>Greengarden </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>13 Conn. App. 550, 552, 537 A.2d 1043 (1988); and (2) Van Gilder\u2019s and the medical school\u2019s second and third claims are not reviewable \u201cfor lack of a final judgment,\u201d based upon the authority of <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>211 Conn. 631, 560 A.2d 960 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Robbins filed an appeal, Docket No. 14454, claiming that: (1) the trial court should have granted his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to accept the jury\u2019s verdict and should not have ordered a mistrial; and (2) the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories regarding the statute of limitations did not affect the validity of its verdict because (a) there was no basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that the jury was hopelessly confused, (b) those answers can be harmonized with the verdict, and (c) the three year statute of repose contained in \u00a7 52-584 is unconstitutional as applied to Robbins in this case. In response, the defendants argue that: (1) the trial court was not obligated to accept the verdict; (2) the trial court correctly determined that the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories were inconsistent with the verdict; and (3) \u00a7 52-58\u20194 is constitutional as applied to Robbins.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The hospital filed an appeal, Docket No. 14455, claiming that the trial court should have granted its motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to reach a verdict because: (1) there was no evidence that Van Gilder had been the agent of the hospital; (2) the evidence clearly showed that Robbins\u2019 cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations and that there was no fraudulent concealment by the hospital; and (3) the court properly directed verdicts in favor of the hospital on counts two and three. Robbins responds that: (1) the trial court\u2019s denial of the hospital\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to reach a verdict are not reviewable for lack of a final judgment, under <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>supra; and (2) the issues related to counts two and three remain in the case, nevertheless, because the trial court\u2019s action in directing the verdicts was based upon its determination that the same factual and legal issues were contained in the first count and the defense thereto, and the defendants moved for the mistrial that the court ultimately ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Having trekked this tortuous procedural path, we turn to the question of whether, at its end, there is a final judgment upon which our jurisdiction may rest. We conclude that there is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>supra, 632, the trial court declared a mistrial after some of the jurors informed the court that they could not disregard certain depositions that had inadvertently and improperly been given to them during their deliberations. The defendants then moved for judgment in accordance with their previous motions for a directed verdict. The trial court denied these motions, and the defendants appealed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">This court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final judgment. We held that the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to return a verdict is not a final judgment upon which an appeal may be based. Id. We stated that, in that case, the order denying the motion \u201c[left] in effect the declaration of a mistrial, and a second trial in the normal course of events will follow. No rights of the parties have been yet determined.\u201d Id., 635; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (.1983); <em>Prevedini </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 287, 292, 320 A.2d 797 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In <em>Gold, </em>we also recognized that the granting by the trial court of a motion to set aside a verdict and to grant a new trial <em>is </em>an appealable order. That decision, however, is <em>not </em>appealable because such an order is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of the principal appeal statute; General Statutes \u00a7 52-263;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but because that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>statute specifically provides for an appeal from such an order as an alternative to the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d basis of appeal. <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>supra, 637. We also recognized in <em>Gold </em>that \u201cthe granting of a motion for a new trial, which opens the judgment previously rendered, does not qualify as a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In <em>Gold, </em>moreover, the defendants argued that permitting an appeal at that procedural point might conserve judicial resources by avoiding the necessity of a second trial. Id., 638. We reasoned, however, that: (1) \u201c[t]he legislature, by creating specific alternatives to a final judgment as a basis for appeal, has implicitly rejected other grounds for departing from the final judgment rule\u201d; and (2) \u201c[t]he fact that a second trial will ordinarily entail additional expense to the parties does not measure up to the circumstances we have heretofore regarded as having such a serious effect upon the rights of the parties that an appeal is warranted.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Applying the reasoning of <em>Gold </em>to the facts of this case compels the conclusion that there is no basis for an appeal. As in <em>Gold, </em>the trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial will lead to a second trial. Thus, there is no final judgment under \u00a7 52-263 because \u201c[n]o rights of the parties have been yet determined.\u201d Id., 635. As in <em>Gold, </em>the parties can offer no specific statutory basis, other than the final judgment rule embodied in \u00a7 52-263, for an appeal. As in <em>Gold, </em>the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to reach a verdict did not provide the basis for an appeal. Indeed, Robbins implicitly recognized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>applicability of <em>Gold </em>by arguing in his brief that the defendants\u2019 claims were not reviewable for lack of a final judgment. What Robbins failed to recognize, however, was that the same sauce he attempted to spread on the defendants\u2019 goose also necessarily graced his own gander.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, as <em>Gold </em>recognized, these proceedings produced no more of a final judgment for purposes of an appeal than would have an order, opening a judgment previously rendered, entered upon a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Robbins suggests that <em>Gold </em>is distinguishable because, unlike <em>Gold, </em>in this case the jury returned a verdict. We think that this is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 312<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> strongly suggests that ordinarily a general verdict and the answers to its accompanying interrogatories are inseparable. The purpose of the interrogatories is to explain or limit the verdict. Id. The interrogatories are to be \u201canswered and delivered to the clerk as a part of the verdict.\u201d Id. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he court will not accept a verdict until the interrogatories which are essential to the verdict have been answered.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">As the trial court recognized, the verdict and the answers irreconcilably conflicted with each other. Furthermore, the court made three efforts, by twice rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>structing the jury and by rereading the statute of limitations to the jury, to dispel the jury\u2019s obvious confusion. These efforts, however, yielded only continuing confusion\u2014described by the trial court as \u201chopeless\u201d\u2014 as evidenced by the jury\u2019s questions and other communications. Although the trial court retained discretion to follow the procedure provided by \u00a7 52-223; see footnote 12; it was not required to do so. This hopeless confusion, rendering the jury unable to. return a verdict and answers that were consistent with each other despite the court\u2019s repeated instructions, was functionally equivalent to the <em>Gold jury\u2019s </em>inability \u201cto disregard certain depositions inadvertently given to the jury during their deliberations, despite the court\u2019s instructions to do so.\u201d <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>supra, 632. Undey these circumstances, therefore, the trial court\u2019s conduct must be regarded as having vitiated this verdict, and the verdict must be regarded as a nullity. Consequently, this case was in the same posture as <em>Gold: </em>the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to return a verdict. Id., 635.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Robbins also suggests that dismissing this appeal, in which the trial court declared a mistrial after a \u201cverdict,\u201d albeit internally inconsistent, had been returned, will be unwise precedent. He argues that such a holding will permit some future, less conscientious trial judge to declare a mistrial after the jury has returned a perfectly valid verdict, simply because the trial judge may disagree with the verdict, without the ability of the parties to rectify such an injustice on appeal. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>First, we are not prepared to indulge in the speculation that any Superior Court judge would engage in such an extreme departure from the basic norms of judicial conduct. We know of no case in which that has happened, we doubt that any judge would read this opinion as an invitation to do so, and we doubt that it ever will occur. We decline to carve out an exception to our ordinary rules of appellate jurisdiction solely upon the basis of such an unlikely risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Second, the fear implicit in that argument has no basis in the record of this case. Here, the trial court had, at the least, a plausible basis for its conclusion that the verdict was invalid and that the jury could not be relied upon to return a more intelligible verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Third, even if that very unlikely event ever did occur, it would not necessarily go unremedied. If there were such a valid verdict returned that the trial court inexplicably ignored by declaring a mistrial, the party whom the verdict favored would be entitled to raise as a claim of error, on appeal from the second trial, the trial court\u2019s failure to render judgment on that verdict, \u201cif the second trial should result in a judgment against [him].\u201d <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>supra, 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The defendants argue that the directed verdicts on the second and third counts provide a jurisdictional basis for their appeals. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">It is clear from this record that the trial court directed those verdicts, not because it perceived there to be insufficient evidence on those counts, but because it believed that the same factual and legal issues were being litigated under the first count, the special defense of the statute of limitations and the reply of fraudulent concealment. Furthermore, the defendants repeatedly moved for a mistrial, which the trial court ultimately granted. A mistrial leads to a new trial, not to an appeal. Id., 637. They cannot now be heard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>complain about the new trial, without an intervening appeal, that they repeatedly sought by their motions. Finally, the first count of the complaint is directed against all the defendants. Even under the defendants\u2019 argument, that count remains to be retried. Thus, their rights have not yet been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The appeals are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In this opinion Callahan, Katz and F. X. HenNESSY, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> We directed the parties to discuss at oral-argument the question of whether there is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> The claim against Yale University was based upon the fact that Van Gilder had been, at the time of the operation, an associate professor of neurosurgical medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine. The parties have, therefore, termed this claim as one against the medical school. We do likewise, and refer herein to the defendant university as the medical school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\"> Also named as defendants were neurosurgeons Joan L. Venes and Daniel C. Good, and nurse anesthetist Patricia Baron. The case was ultimately withdrawn against Venes, Good and Baron, and they are not involved in this appeal.

If you find the defendant Dr. John Van Gilder was negligent in connection with the performance of the surgery on the plaintiff on December 30,1971, was such negligence the proximate cause of the injuries and damages claimed by the plaintiff in paragraphs 12,13 and 14 of Count One of the Substituted Amended Complaint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">Answer (NEGLIGENT) YES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">3.

Are the claims of the plaintiff as to negligence and damages in connection with the performance of the surgery on December 30, 1971, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>set forth in Count One of the Substituted Amended Complaint, barred by the statute of limitation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">Answer YES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">5. Did the plaintiff prove by \u2018clear, precise and unequivocal evidence\u2019 that the defendant Dr. John Van Gilder fraudulently concealed the fact that the plaintiff had suffered some form of actionable harm during the course of the surgery on December 30,1971, so as to toll or suspend the statute of limitations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">Answer NO\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> The clerk asked: \u201cLadies and Gentlemen of the jury, is this your verdict so say you all?\u201d The jury answered \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\"> The court instructed the jury: \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, I can\u2019t [accept] your verdict because there is a complete inconsistency between the interrogatories and the verdict forms. And the inconsistency consists of the fact that you found that the action was tolled by the statute of limitations, which means that it was barred by the statute of limitations. And then\u2014the only way then that it could\u2014that you could find that the plaintiff could recover would be if you found fraud. If you found that there was no fraud, then you could not allow any verdict for the plaintiff. So, I cannot [accept] your verdict form under those circumstances. That is why the interrogatories were submitted to you, to determine whether you had considered all of the elements of negligence, approximate [sic] cause, statute of limitations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>fraud and agency. Secondly, if you found that you\u2014that Dr. Van Gilder was the agent of the Yale-New Haven Hospital, you would have to logically, and consistently find that the Hospital was also responsible. And under those circumstances you found just the opposite. So, I am going to ask you to go back and reconsider your verdict in this particular case, in view of the interrogatories and I am going to ask you to reconsider the whole thing the interrogatories as well, as well as the verdict. But, again, if the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, there can be no recovery unless there\u2014unless fraud was proven. So, I\u2019ll send you back to reconsider.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> None of the parties raises any question regarding the legal propriety, accuracy, clarity or completeness of the trial court\u2019s original instructions on the statute of limitations, or regarding the reinstructions by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-223 provides: \u201cjury may be three times returned TO CONSIDER verdict.

The issue raised by the majority on its own is quite simple. Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial after the jury returned a verdict that the trial court refused to accept? I dissent, not because I would necessarily end up with a different bottom line on the merits, but because the issue of jurisdiction could be important in other cases in which the trial court refuses to accept a verdict and then declares a mistrial. I believe that we do have jurisdiction and should reach the merits of the case as briefed by the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In this medical malpractice case, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, Arthur L. Robbins, against two defendants, John C. Van Gilder and the Yale University School of Medicine, in the amount of $1,550,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The verdict was acknowledged by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>jurors in open court. The trial court, over the objection of the plaintiff, refused to accept the verdict because it was of the opinion that the verdict conflicted with the jurors\u2019 answers to certain interrogatories. The jury was reinstructed, furnished with additional verdict and interrogatory forms, and directed to continue deliberations. After the jury requested further instructions on the statute of limitations and fraud, the trial court found that the jury was \u201chopelessly confused\u201d and declared a mistrial, over the plaintiff\u2019s objections. The plaintiff\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that the trial court should have accepted the verdict and that the case should be remanded to the trial court with direction to accept the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">This case differs substantially from <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>211 Conn. 631, 560 A.2d 960 (1989), upon which the majority relies. In <em>Gold, </em>there was no jury verdict. The trial court merely declared a mistrial after it became aware of the jury\u2019s exposure to improper evidence. In the present case, the jury rendered a verdict. As a result, if this court concluded that the trial court should have accepted the verdict, it could reinstate the verdict and remand the case with instructions to accept and record the verdict. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 471, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980) (this court ordered that the jury verdict be reinstated and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment). In <em>Gold, </em>unlike the present case, a new trial would have been required because there was no verdict and therefore nothing to reinstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">I concede that this case does not fall within the precise bounds of the exception to the final judgment rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983) (\u201c[a]n otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ing, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them\u201d). I believe, however, that <em>Curdo </em>should be modified to allow an appeal in those situations in which there is a verdict upon which a judgment may be predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Indeed, I discern no practical difference between our jurisdiction to hear an appeal when the court sets aside a verdict; General Statutes \u00a7 52-228b; e.g., <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>209 Conn. 450, 551 A.2d 1227 (1988); <em>Palomba </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>208 Conn. 21, 543 A.2d 1331 (1988); and when a trial court refuses to accept a verdict rendered by a jury and declares a mistrial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We should view our subject matter jurisdiction through the lens of the twenty-first century. To take such a narrow view of our subject matter jurisdiction, as the majority does, no.t only defies logic but burdens the parties with the enormous expense of relitigating an issue when relitigation may not be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> I agree with the majority that subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, by the parties or the court. \u201cThe issue of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time including on appeal. Once brought to the attention of the court, regardless of the form of the motion, it must be acted upon. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985). <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>204 Conn. 551, 556-57, 529 A.2d 666 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 294, 297, 608 A.2d 1181 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\"> The jury found the issues in favor of the third defendant, Yale-New Haven Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-12\"> Footnote 17 of the majority opinion states that I suggest that the trial court should \u201chave accepted the verdict and then set it aside so as to create a viable appeal.\u201d Apparently, the majority reads a different dissent because my dissent does not include such a statement nor does it suggest such a charade.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
