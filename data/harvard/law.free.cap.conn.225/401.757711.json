J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">The sole issue in this case, on certification from the United States District Court, is whether, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-572e,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an alleged tortfeasor is, as a matter of law, discharged from liability to an injured party by virtue of a general release agreement executed by the injured party that purports to release not only a specifically named tortfeasor, but also all other potentially liable parties, for consideration paid by the named tortfeasor. The plaintiff, Kenneth Sims, filed a product liability action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleging that the defendants, Honda Motor Company, Ltd., Honda Research and Development, Ltd., American Honda Motor Company, Inc., and Freedom Corporation, doing business as Freedom Honda, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were liable for injuries that Sims sustained while riding a Honda motorcycle. Honda filed an amended answer and asserted special defenses alleging, inter alia, that Sims\u2019 claim was barred because Sims, in his settlement with another tortfeasor in the motorcycle accident, had executed a general release of all potential tortfeasors. Sims denied the allegations made in the special defenses, and Honda thereafter moved for summary judgment on the basis of the release. The District Court subsequently certified to this court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u00a7 4168,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> several questions relating to the effect of the release. We accepted the certified questions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and now hold that the effect of the release depends upon the contracting parties\u2019 intent regarding the release of other potentially liable parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The District Court record reveals the following facts, which were alleged by Sims in his complaint or stipulated to by the parties. In 1986, Sims purchased a new Honda motorcycle. On May 29,1987, while riding the Honda motorcycle, Sims was struck by a vehicle owned and operated by Emanuel Byrd. As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, Sims\u2019 left leg was amputated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>above the knee. Sims also suffered severe shock to his nervous system, severe pain, mental anguish, nervousness and permanent scarring.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">After the collision, Sims, represented by counsel, entered into negotiations with Byrd\u2019s insurer, and subsequently executed a release of claims that Byrd\u2019s insurer had prepared. The release provided that Sims would receive $50,000 from Byrd and his insurers in consideration for Sims\u2019 agreement to \u201crelease, acquit and forever discharge\u201d Byrd and his insurers, as well as \u201cany and all\u201d other parties, from \u201cany and all\u201d claims arising out of the May 29,1987 collision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Honda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>was neither a party to the negotiations that led to the execution of the release, nor did it contribute to the consideration given to Sims.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In response to Honda\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the District Court, the attorney who had represented Sims in the negotiations with Byrd\u2019s insurers filed an affidavit stating that the product liability action against Honda had been under consideration at the time Sims had executed the release. The attorney also stated that he had never intended that Sims would release Honda from liability by signing the release. Sims also filed an affidavit in the District Court stating that, when he had signed the release, he had had no intention of releasing Honda from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In his brief in this court, Sims claims that the release is not effective to discharge Honda from liability as a matter of law because, under \u00a7 52-572e, only those tortfeasors expressly named in a release are discharged from liability, unless the releasing party manifestly intended to release unnamed tortfeasors. Sims contends, therefore, that the language, \u201cany and all other persons, firms and corporations,\u201d in the release that he executed is ambiguous as to whether it releases Honda and, accordingly, that it must be construed in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Honda claims, on the other hand, that the language of \u00a7 52-572e does not require a release to designate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>expressly those tortfeasors that the parties sought to discharge from liability. Honda asserts, therefore, that the language in question is effective to release it from liability. Honda also contends, in the alternative, that the language of the release must be interpreted in light of the parties\u2019 intent and that the release executed by Sims must, as a matter of law, be held effective to discharge Honda, a potential tortfeasor known to Sims at the time he executed the release.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The certified issue is one of first impression in this court, although it has been addressed in other jurisdictions and in one published Superior Court decision. We conclude that a general release like that signed by Sims, which provides for the release of \u201cany and all other persons, firms and corporations,\u201d discharges only those joint tortfeasors whom the contracting parties actually intended to be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">At common law in Connecticut, a release of one joint tortfeasor operated as a release of all joint tortfeasors. <em>See Dwy </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>89 Conn. 74, 77, 92 A. 883 (1915). \u201cThe traditional rationale given for this rule was that where two or more tortfeasors acted in concert to cause an injury, the act of one became the act of all and a single cause of action, with each participant being liable for the entire loss sustained by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Neves </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>769 P.2d 1047, 1049 (Colo. 1989). This common law rule was widely criticized by courts and commentators as unjust because it served as a trap for unknowing plaintiffs, barring them from suing addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tional tortfeasors and, in some cases, from obtaining fall relief for their injuries. See, e.g., <em>McInnis </em>v. <em>Harley Davidson Motor Co., </em>625 F. Sup. 943, 947 (D.R.1.1986) (applying Rhode Island law); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad, </em>299 Ark. 232, 239-40, 773 S.W.2d 78 (1989); <em>Bjork </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corporation, </em>702 P.2d 146, 152-54 (Wyo. 1985); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 49, p. 333; R. Satter, \u201cChanging Roles of Courts and Legislatures,\u201d 11 Conn. L. Rev. 230, 236 (1979); see also <em>Fulmore </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 353, 354, 574 A.2d 1337 (1989) <em>(.Berdon, J.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In 1969, the Connecticut legislature abrogated the common law rule by enacting General Statutes \u00a7 52-572e, which derives from the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Public Acts 1969, No. 69-143. Section 52-572e provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) A release by the injured person, or his legal representative, of one joint tortfeasor does not discharge the other tortfeasors <em>unless, and only to the extent, the release so provides.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">As the Illinois Supreme Court noted regarding a statute similar to \u00a7 52-572e, \u201c[t]he legislature intended to abolish the common law rule that produced an <em>involuntary </em>discharge of joint tortfeasors.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Alsup </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>101 Ill. 2d 196, 201, 461 N.E.2d 361 (1984). Moreover, the Illinois court held that, if a general release were construed to discharge all tortfeasors regardless of whether their release had been contemplated by the contracting parties, \u201can important purpose of the [statute] would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>thwarted by the unintended release of persons who were strangers to the release contract.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 52-572e reflects a legislative preference for preserving an unknowing injured party\u2019s opportunity to seek relief from responsible tortfeasors and a policy against enforcing an injured party\u2019s involuntary discharge of responsible tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The primary issue in this case is one of contract interpretation: does the general release executed by Sims provide for the release of Honda within the meaning of \u00a7 52-572e?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In jurisdictions with statutes similar to \u00a7 52-572e, courts interpreting releases with all-inclusive language, like that in the release executed by Sims, have generally taken one of three approaches, none of which appears to have captured a majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Some courts have adopted a \u201cflat bar\u201d rule, holding that, as a matter of law, a release \u201cprovides\u201d for the discharge of all potential joint tortfeasors if it purports to discharge not only the named tortfeasors, but also any and all other parties. See, e.g., <em>Mussett </em>v. <em>Baker Material Handling Corporation, </em>844 F.2d 760, 762 (10th Cir. 1988) (applying Oklahoma law); <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>676 F. Sup. 106, 107 (W.D. Va. 1987) (applying Virginia law); <em>Doganieri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 F. Sup. 1093, 1097 (N.D. W. Va. 1981) (applying West Virginia law); <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>253 Md. 7, 9-10, 251 A.2d 600 (1969); <em>Battle </em>v. <em>Clanton, </em>27 N.C. App. 616, 621, 220 S.E.2d 97 (1975), cert. denied, 289 N.C. 613, 223 S.E.2d 391 (1976); <em>Hasselrode </em>v. <em>Gnagey, </em>404 Pa. 549, 552-53, 172 A.2d 764 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>(1961). The \u201cflat bar\u201d rule yields a broad construction of both the \u201cso provides\u201d language of the statute and the \u201cany and all\u201d language of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Most \u201cflat bar\u201d courts hold that, because a release purporting to discharge all other parties from liability is unambiguous, it must be construed with reference only to the language used and not to any extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. See <em>Mussett </em>v. <em>Baker Material Handling Corporation, </em>supra, 762; <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 107; <em>Doganieri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 1097; <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>supra, 10; <em>Hasselrode </em>v. <em>Gnagey, </em>supra, 552. Reading the language within the four corners of the agreement, these courts determine that the parties manifested their intent, as a matter of law, that the release discharge all potential tortfeasors from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In adopting the \u201cflat bar\u201d rule under Virginia law, the District Court for the Western District of Virginia noted that the unnamed joint tortfeasor is not necessarily freed from liability for the injured party\u2019s damages. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 107-108. The court held that, despite the release\u2019s discharge of the nonsettling joint tortfeasor\u2019s liability to the injured party, the nonsettling joint tortfeasor may nonetheless be liable to the settling joint tortfeasor for contribution. The <em>Reynolds </em>court concluded that the \u201cflat bar\u201d rule would thus hasten payment to the injured party, leaving the liable parties to litigate their respective faults afterward. Id., 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">We decline to adopt the \u201cflat bar\u201d approach because it perpetuates the inequities of the common law rule and contravenes the legislative preference, expressed in \u00a7 52-572e, for preserving the opportunity of an unknowing injured party to seek relief. By presuming that the actual intent of parties was fully incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>into the release, the \u201cflat bar\u201d rule precludes \u00e1n injured party from seeking further relief from a nonsettling joint tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">A second group of courts has adopted a \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule under which, as a matter of law, a general release discharges only those tortfeasors that are expressly identified. See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad, </em>supra, 240; <em>Alsup </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>supra, 201; <em>Aid Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis County, </em>426 N.W.2d 631, 633 (Iowa 1988); <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Cianchetti, </em>1 Ohio St. 3d 231, 235, 439 N.E.2d 417 (1982); <em>Bjork </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corporation, </em>supra, 163; see also <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>665 S.W.2d 414, 419 (Tex. 1984) (adopting the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule in the absence of a statute similar to \u00a7 52-572e). Courts adopting this rule generally hold that naming the released parties is not necessary if those parties are sufficiently described with terms such as \u201cemployees\u201d or \u201cthe driver of the car.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad, </em>supra; <em>Aid Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis County, </em>supra, 633-34; <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Cianchetti, </em>supra. This approach yields a narrow construction of both the release and the statute\u2019s \u201cso provides\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Adoption of the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule is generally supported by reference to the historical development of the law of releases. Courts adopting the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule generally conclude that interpreting a general release to discharge from liability all tortfeasors, whether named in the release or not, would, in effect, perpetuate the inequity of the common law rule. See, e.g., <em>Alsup </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>supra, 201; <em>Aid Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis County, </em>supra, 634; <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Cianchetti, </em>supra, 235. Moreover, \u201cspecific designation\u201d courts base their adoption of this approach on their determination that this rule provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the best means of ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent. See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad, </em>supra, 240; <em>Bjork </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corporation, </em>supra, 162-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">We reject the \u201cspecific designation\u201d approach because, in our view, it reads \u00a7 52-572e more expansively than the legislature intended. This approach interprets \u00a7 52-572e as effectively prohibiting general releases, rather than merely abolishing the automatic legal effect of a release of one tortfeasor. Because the \u201cspecific designation\u201d approach does not seek to ascertain the parties\u2019 actual intent, but simply replaces the legal construct of the common law rule with another legal presumption, this approach is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s choice not to prohibit general releases per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Moreover, we note that courts adopting the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule appear to view the question of the effect of the release as one of statutory interpretation: what does \u201cprovide\u201d mean? We consider the certified issue to raise instead a question of contract interpretation: to what did the parties agree?<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For these reasons, we reject the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Other courts have taken a third approach to the construction of general releases: the \u201cintent\u201d rule. Rather than presume that the parties\u2019 intent was fully expressed within the four corners of the release or that, despite the broad language of the release, the parties did not intend it to discharge all joint tortfeasors from liability, these courts consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent to determine the scope of the release. See, e.g., <em>McInnis </em>v. <em>Harley-Davidson Motor Co., </em>supra, 957 (applying Rhode Island law); <em>Neves </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>supra, 1053; <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>532 So. 2d 714, 715 (Fla. App. 1988) (citing <em>Hurt </em>v. <em>Leatherby Ins. Co., </em>380 So. 2d 432, 434 [Fla. 1980]); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Physicians &amp; Surgeons Community Hospital, Inc., </em>249 Ga. 588, 590, 292 S.E.2d 705 (1982). These jurisdictions note that the \u201cintent\u201d rule provides a middle road.between the more extreme \u201cflat bar\u201d and \u201cspecific designation\u201d rules, both of which employ legal fictions regarding the parties\u2019 intent. See, e.g., <em>McInnis </em>v. <em>Harley-Davidson Motor Co., </em>supra, 949. \u201cLogically, it is the intentions of the actors, rather than the presence or absence of buzzwords, which should govern.\u201d Id., 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u201cIntent\u201d rule jurisdictions justify consideration of extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent on various grounds. For example, the Florida Supreme Court held that a general release was ambiguous because of the presence of written and printed language in a single form, thereby warranting admission of extrinsic evidence to interpret that ambiguity. <em>Hurt </em>v. <em>Leatherby Ins. Co., </em>supra, 434. Other courts, however, have held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>even without a prior determination that the release is ambiguous, that extrinsic evidence is admissible to aid the court in ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent because a stranger to a contract (the nonsettling joint tortfeasor) cannot prevent the introduction of extrinsic evidence for that purpose. <em>McInnis </em>v. <em>Harley-Davidson Motor Co., </em>supra, 952; <em>Neves </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>supra, 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We are persuaded that the \u201cintent\u201d rule best implements the goals of \u00a7 52-572e. By abrogating the common law rule that a release of one tortfeasor discharges, by operation of law, all joint tortfeasors, \u00a7 52-572e preserves the right of the injured party to choose to release one or all joint tortfeasors in accordance with the intent of the negotiations between the injured party and the settling tortfeasor. Under \u00a7 52-572e, therefore, the contracting parties\u2019 intent, not the operation of a legal rule, determines the scope of a release. See <em>McInnis </em>v. <em>Harley-Davidson Motor Co., </em>supra, 949 (\u201cintent\u201d rule court noting importance of ascertaining parties\u2019 intent); <em>Hasselrode </em>v. <em>Gnagey, </em>supra, 552 (\u201cflat bar\u201d rule court noting that intent of the parties, as expressed within four corners of release, governs scope of release); <em>Bjork </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corporation, </em>supra, 161 (\u201cspecific designation\u201d rule court noting the importance of ascertaining parties\u2019 intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The \u201cintent\u201d rule best furthers the purpose of \u00a7 52-572e because it enables courts to ascertain the parties\u2019 <em>actual </em>intent. Free of irrebuttable presumptions regarding the intended scope of often boilerplate releases, this approach provides for consideration of extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 actual intent and does not confine interpretation of the release to its four corners.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The consideration of extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent regarding the scope of the release, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ambiguous or not, is appropriate because such consideration will best further the purpose of \u00a7 52-572e, which in our view is to permit the release of one joint tortfeasor to effect the release of other joint tortfeasors only if the settling parties so intended. In light of this statutory purpose, the \u201cboilerplate\u201d nature of the general release language in the agreement executed by Sims raises the specter of an adhesion contract; cf. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>206 Conn. 409, 416-18, 538 A.2d 219 (1988) (notice provisions of adhesion contract not literally enforced); or at least cautions against presuming that the language of the release reflects the parties\u2019 intent regarding its scope. See also <em>Hurt </em>v. <em>Leatherby Ins. Co., </em>supra, 433-34. We are, therefore, disinclined to allow the mere presence of words of general release to frustrate the purpose of \u00a7 52-572e.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Analogous cases from other jurisdictions support our conclusion that extrinsic evidence of intent is appropriately considered in determining the scope of a general release. For example, in interpreting two \u201cdragnet clauses\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that purported to secure payment of \u201c \u2018any and all other indebtedness of Borrower to [the bank giving the loan],\u2019 \u201d the Mississippi Supreme Court held that the language, \u201c \u2018any and all other indebtedness,\u2019 \u201d did not encompass all debts owed by the borrower to the bank. <em>Merchants National Bank </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>608 So. 2d 1120, 1125 n.4 (Miss. 1992). The court reached this conclusion after ascertaining the parties\u2019 probable intent by determining each party\u2019s awareness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>various debts and after noting that the clauses were \u201c \u2018boilerplate\u2019 in nature.\u201d Id., 1126. The court ended its discussion of the dragnet clauses by stating, \u201cthe fact that these notes were otherwise fully secured, further indicates that they were not <em>intended </em>to be included under the . . . agreements.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 1127; see also <em>Wong </em>v. <em>Beneficial Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>56 Cal. App. 3d 286, 293, 128 Cal. Rptr. 338 (1976) (\u201cCalifornia courts have rather consistently tended to prefer a construction that is more faithful to the parties\u2019 actual expectations than to the literal wording of the clause.\u201d [Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>First Security Bank of Utah </em>v. <em>Shiew, </em>609 P.2d 952, 957 (Utah 1980) (refusing to enforce the literal terms of dragnet clause because \u201c[t]here is not a scintilla of evidence to support the inference the parties intended the second loan to be under the security of the first loan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We recognize that our conclusion is a departure from the general rule of contract construction that unambiguous contract provisions are to be given their plain meaning without reference to evidence outside the four corners of the agreement. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 779, 786, 606 A.2d 990 (1992); <em>F &amp;W Welding Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>ADL Contracting Corporation, </em>217 Conn. 507, 517, 587 A.2d 92 (1991). Rigid application of that general rule would, however, frustrate the purposes of \u00a7 52-572e, which counsels against uncritical enforcement of boilerplate general release language and, therefore, justifies treating such language differently from how we treat other contractual provisions. Accordingly, we hold that, in light of the purposes of \u00a7 52-572e, general releases like that executed by Sims are not subject to that traditional rule of contract construction. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 738-39, 613 A.2d 804 (1992) (\u201c[w]e conclude . . . that despite the fact that the language of Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tice Book ^749 [2], read literally, would cover the tape recording of a 911 telephone call, it is not within the intent of that language to cover such a tape recording and that, therefore, a tape recording of a 911 telephone call is not a \u2018statement\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 749 [2]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Finally, the parol evidence rule does not prevent consideration of extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent in the interpretation of the scope of general releases. The parol evidence rule is a substantive rule of contract law that \u201cprohibits the use of extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict the terms of an integrated written contract.\u201d <em>TIE Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kopp, </em>218 Conn. 281, 287-88, 589 A.2d 329 (1991); see also General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-202 <em>(Uniform </em>Commercial Code). The parol evidence rule, however, is not absolute, but admits of various exceptions, some of which are based on equitable considerations. For instance, Connecticut allows extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent to show that a written contract is founded in mistake or fraud. See, e.g., <em>TIE Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kopp, </em>supra, 289; <em>Associated Catalog Merchandisers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chagnon, </em>210 Conn. 734, 742, 557 A.2d 525 (1989). In addition, other jurisdictions have held that the parol evidence rule does not bar extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent if it is a stranger to the contract who seeks to prevent the introduction of extrinsic evidence. See, e.g., <em>McInnis </em>v. <em>Harley-Davidson Motor Co., </em>supra, 952; <em>Neves </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>supra, 1054. These courts take an \u201cunsympathetic position toward parties who seek to take gratuitous advantage of an agreement when they are not parties to the agreement.\u201d <em>Neves </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">General releases like that executed by Sims present a compelling case for creating a limited exception to the parol evidence rule because at least one of the purposes underlying that rule does not apply in the context of such releases. For example, one purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>parol evidence rule is \u201cto secure business stability.\u201d J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts (3d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 3-2 (b), p. 137. Because the negotiation of a release in settlement of personal injury claims, however, is more akin to a consumer transaction than a commercial transaction, this purpose is not dispositive in this case. Cf. <em>Harlach </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 185, 190, 602 A.2d 1007 (1992) (\u201cThe contractual nature of insurance and the commercial relationship between insurer and insured are not altered by any peculiarities of uninsured motorist coverage. The relationship between the insured and the insurer clearly is <em>contractual </em>in nature, and we find nothing in [the uninsured motorist statute] that alters the traditionally commercial setting in which insurance policies are purchased.\u201d [Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.]). We conclude, therefore, that it is appropriate, in the circumstances of this case, to create a limited exception to the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In adopting the \u201cintent\u201d approach to interpreting general releases in Connecticut, we are not unaware of the criticism that the application of this rule may deprive the settling tortfeasor of some important protection that, for the settling tortfeasor\u2019s own sake, may have been part of the bargain memorialized by the release. This criticism arises out of the possibility that a settling tortfeasor may be impleaded by a nonsettling joint tortfeasor in a subsequent suit against that joint tortfeasor by the injured party or may be subject to contribution to a joint tortfeasor who makes some payment to the injured party. We are not persuaded by this criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The possibility that a settling tortfeasor may incur further liability to another tortfeasor is not fanciful. Although the common law of this state entirely prohibited contribution among joint tortfeasors; see <em>Therrien </em>v. <em>Safeguard Mfg. Co., </em>180 Conn. 91, 95, 429 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>808 (1980); <em>Gomeau </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>176 Conn. 523, 524, 409 A.2d 1006 (1979); the legislature has enacted statutes allowing a tortfeasor to implead, in certain circumstances, potentially liable joint tortfeasors. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-572o (e) and 52-102a (a); see also <em>Malerba v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>210 Conn. 189, 195-96, 554 A.2d 287 (1989). A settling tortfeasor therefore runs the potential risk of being held liable to a joint tortfeasor if the injured party subsequently elects to pursue a claim against such a joint tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The possibility that a settling tortfeasor may have a personal interest in the execution of a general release is not, however, a persuasive argument against the \u201cintent\u201d rule. In searching for the intent of the parties at the time of the execution of the release, the trier of fact must inquire into the intent of all the participants. The trial will, therefore, afford a full opportunity for evidence to be heard that a general release was precisely what the settling tortfeasor intended. Indeed, in order to meet the burden of proof regarding the scope of the release, the injured party may have to persuade the finder of fact that the settling tortfeasor intended that the release would not discharge any other tortfeasor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Finally, we note that the potential vulnerability of the settling tortfeasor to a joint tortfeasor in the future is not addressed by either the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule or the \u201cflat bar\u201d rule. Neither of these approaches is premised, in any way, on the settling tortfeasor\u2019s motivation to include general release language in order to avoid liability for contribution to another potentially liable joint tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Accordingly, because it \u201ccomports with equity and, therefore, is in harmony with the beneficent purposes of \u00a7 52-572e\u201d; <em>Fulmore </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 353, 355-56, 574 A.2d 1337 (1990); we adopt the \u201cintent\u201d rule as a guide to interpreting general releases like that executed by Sims. The trial court may consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent regarding the scope of the release regardless of whether the court determines that the language of the release is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The certified questions asked: \u201c1.

See, e.g., <em>Bjork </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corporation, </em>702 P.2d 140, 162 (Wyo. 1985); see generally <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 626, 594 A.2d 464 (1991); but see generally <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>217 Conn. 361, 364, 585 A.2d 1210 (1991) (statute in derogation of common law is to be liberally construed if its purpose is remedial). If this rule of construction were applicable in this case at all, however, it would seem to support adoption of the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule. The rule of statutory construction that encourages narrow construction of statutes in derogation of the common law generally promotes narrow construction of the statute\u2019s change in the common law. \u201c[N]o statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Leslie-Elliott Constructors, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 129, 137, 479 A.2d 231 (1984). In this case, therefore, that rule of construction would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>seem to advise against the \u201cspecific designation\u201d rule, which moves further from the common law rule than General Statutes \u00a7 52-572e necessarily suggests, and in favor of the \u201cflat bar\u201d rule, which allows the common law rule to continue to the extent possible under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> A \u201cdragnet clause\u201d is \u201ca mortgage provision which purports to make the real estate security for other, usually unspecified debts [and which frequently . . . is included in the printed language of mortgages drafted by the mortgagee.\u201d <em>First Security Bank of Utah </em>v. <em>Shiew, </em>609 P.2d 952, 954 (Utah 1980).

Moreover, our adoption of the \u201cintent\u201d approach to interpreting general releases serves to benefit an injured party who may not have intended to release all the world, notwithstanding the agreement\u2019s unambiguous boilerplate language stating that \u201cany and all persons, firms and corporations\u201d are discharged. This approach thus allows the injured party to introduce extrinsic evidence that varies the release\u2019s language. Given this unusual opportunity to introduce extrinsic evidence, it would be anomalous to assign the burden of proof regarding the parties\u2019 intent to the joint tortfeasor, who would in any case prefer to prohibit the introduction of extrinsic evidence and to rely instead on the unambiguous language of the release.
