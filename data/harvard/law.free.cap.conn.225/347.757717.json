We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On November 7,1989, shortly after 10 p.m., the defendant and three other men, two of whom were armed with guns, removed the victim from his car at gunpoint. The defendant and two of the men walked the victim down the street while the fourth man followed in the victim\u2019s car. The victim was forced at gunpoint into the rear seat of his car and was driven away. Some of the men followed in another car.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Approximately thirty minutes later, a local resident heard loud \u201crapping noises\u201d outside his window. Fifteen minutes later, the resident went outside to investigate and found the victim\u2019s body lying along the side of his driveway, and the victim\u2019s car parked at the bottom of his driveway. The victim had died from ten gunshot wounds from at least two guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The police found the defendant\u2019s fingerprint on the right rear interior door handle of the victim\u2019s car. The victim\u2019s car had been rented by a friend of the victim who did not know the defendant. The jury could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>inferred, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s fingerprint had been left in the car during the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The defendant first claims that the evidence before the trial court was insufficient to support his conviction of felony murder. The defendant contends that, because all the elements necessary to establish the crime of kidnapping had occurred prior to the murder, the murder could not have occurred \u201cin the course of\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of\u201d the kidnapping as required by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In reviewing an insufficiency of the evidence claim, \u201c \u2018[w]e first review the evidence presented at trial, construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly found by the trial court or impliedly found by the jury. We then decide whether, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the trial court or the jury could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 606, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 770-71, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) defines kidnapping as the abduction<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of another and the restraint<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of that person with the intent to inflict physical injury upon or terrorize that person. The legislature has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201cimposed any time requirement for the restraint, nor [imposed] any distance requirement for the asportation to constitute the crime of kidnapping.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 170, 377 A.2d 263 (1977). The defendant has confused the point in time at which there is sufficient evidence to convict a person of kidnapping with the point at which the kidnapping has ended. The defendant correctly states that \u201c[f]rom the moment [the victim] was removed from the car and walked down the street, and certainly once he was driven away, he had already been kidnapped. His kidnappers could at that point be convicted of the kidnapping . . . .\u201dWe disagree, however, with the defendant\u2019s contention that, at this point, the kidnapping was a completed crime. Kidnapping is a continuing crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>198 Conn. 147, 155, 502 A.2d 874 (1985); <em>People </em>v. <em>La Marca, </em>3 N.Y.2d 452, 460, 144 N.E.2d 420, 165 N.Y.S.2d 753 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Because kidnapping involves interfering with the victim\u2019s liberty, it continues until that liberty is restored. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Jefferies, </em>304 S.C. 141, 145, 403 S.E.2d 169 (S.C. App. 1991) (\u201ckidnapping commences when one is wrongfully deprived of his freedom and continues until freedom is restored\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dove, </em>52 Wash. App. 81, 88, 757 P.2d 990 (1988) (\u201ckidnapping ... is continuously committed as long as the unlawful detention of the kidnapped person lasts\u201d). Because the victim in this case was never released, the kidnapping ended only with his death. Accordingly, the state provided sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant committed felony murder. Felony murder occurs when, in the course of and in furtherance of another crime, one of the participants in that crime causes the death of a person who is not a participant in the crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. The two phrases, \u201cin the course of\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>limit the applicability of the statute with respect to time and causation. <em>Stater. Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 643-44, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d focuses on the temporal relationship between the murder and the underlying felony. We have previously addressed the meaning of the phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d as an element of robbery, under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133. \u201c[I]f the use of force occurs during the continuous sequence of events surrounding the taking or attempted taking, even though some time immediately before or after, it is considered to be \u2018in the course of the robbery or the attempted robbery within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>201 Conn. 289, 297, 513 A.2d 1226 (1986); <em>State v. </em>Crosswell, 223 Conn. 243, 250-51, 612 A.2d 1174 (1992). Because we have defined the phrase \u201cin the course of\u201d to include the period immediately before or after the actual commission of the crime, the murder in this case, which took place during the period of the crime itself, occurred \u201cin the course of\u201d the kidnapping within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-54c.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018in furtherance of was intended to impose the requirement of a relationship between the underlying felony and the homicide beyond that of mere causation in fact, similar to the concept of proximate cause in the law of torts. Primarily its purpose was to limit the liability of a person whose accomplice in one of the specified felonies has performed the homicidal act to those circumstances which were within the contemplation of the confederates to the undertaking . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 642. When, as here, the participants have kidnapped the victim at gunpoint, a jury may find that it is within the contemplation of those participants that the victim might be shot and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The victim was killed approximately thirty minutes after he was abducted at gunpoint. He died from gun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>shot wounds that came from two guns. Two of the kidnappers were armed with guns. The kidnapping was ongoing because the victim\u2019s liberty had not been restored. The jury could reasonably have inferred that the victim was killed in the course of and in furtherance of that kidnapping. The trial court, therefore, properly rendered a judgment sentencing the defendant for having committed the crime of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Although the defendant neither submitted an instruction on reasonable doubt to the trial court nor took an exception to the instruction given by the trial court, he now contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the instruction on reasonable doubt that the trial court gave<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> violated his due process right to a fair trial. He seeks review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 828 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The challenged instructions are similar to jury instructions that have previously been approved by this court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>217 Conn. 498, 504-505 n.3, 586 A.2d 610 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 177-80, 571 A.2d 79 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>214 Conn. 118, 119-20, 570 A.2d 1123 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 147-50, 554 A.2d 713 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Conn. 657, 664-65, 539 A.2d 133 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 538-39, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>198 Conn. 328, 346, 502 A.2d 921, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S. Ct. 2279, 90 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170-71, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In the above cases, we concluded that the same or similar instructions did not decrease the state\u2019s burden of proof when viewed in the context of the entire charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>supra, 664 (test is whether the jury charge as a whole presents the case adequately to the jury so that no injustice is done). In this case as well, the jury charge as a whole clearly defined the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard. The defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial has not been violated in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Because we find neither a clear violation of a fundamental constitutional right nor a deprivation of a fair trial, the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim does not satisfy the second and third conditions set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. Therefore, the defendant cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\"> The defendant appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3), which provides that \u201can appeal in any criminal action involving a conviction for a capital felony, class A felony or other felony . . . for which the maximum sentence which may be imposed exceeds twenty years,\u201d shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of felony murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit . . . kidnapping . . . and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and ... he restrains the person abducted with the intent to (A) inflict physical injury upon him . . . or (C) terrorize him or a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-8 provides: \u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b371-13\"> It is unclear which men left the scene of the kidnapping in which car.
