When it is competent for a party to bind himself individually, parol evidence cannot be introduced to show, that what he has in fact done in his own name, was intended to be don\u00e9 as an agent for others.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> If one of several partners promise individually to jiay a debt, he will not be permitted to show that it was due jointly from himself and his partners.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> And, generally, all parol evidence to contradict, or vary, a written instrument, is inadmissible.<footnotemark>c</footnotemark> The object of the testimony in the present case, is, not to show that the drawer is liable to a greater or a less extent than that expressed on the face of the check, but to make a corporation, whose servant he was, liable for a debt which, according to the face of the instrument, is a private debt. For if the check, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>face of it, was an official one, the evidence was unnecessary; and introducing, it is an admission that the instrument itself was not sufficient to bind the corporation. 2. The evidence of the debt being a written instrument, the construction of it is matter of law for the decision of the Court, and the Court ought to have instructed the jury, that the check was, on the face of it, a private, and not an official check, and could not bind the Mechanics\u2019 Bank. <em>3. </em>But at all events, the check was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of its being the private check of the drawer, and the possession of it by the plaintiffs in error, was also <em>prima facie </em>evidence of their having paid a valuable consideration for it. 4. Again; this action cannot be maintained, because the contract upon which it is brought was not made in conformity wilh the charter of the Mechanics\u2019 Bank, which provides, (s. 17.) \u201c that all bills, bonds, notes, <em>and every other contract or engagement </em>on behalf of the corporation, shall be signed by the president, and countersigned by the cashier ; and the corporation shall, <em>in no case, be liable f or any contract or </em>engagement, unless the same shall be signed and countersigned as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A4Q\">Mr. <em>Jones </em>and Mr. <em>Key, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfM\">insisted, 1. That the check, upon the face of it, did not purport to be the private check of . Pat\u00f3n, but the check of the bank, drawn by him as its Cashier, and that the presumption was, that it was an official act. 2. But supposing it to be equivocal on. the face of the instrument, whether he acted in his official or private capacity, extrinsic parol evidence, to show in what capacity he acted, was admissible. This would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>be evidence to contradict the written instrument, but only to explain it.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> Suppose the Bank of Columbia had sued Pat\u00f3n, the date and entire face of the check would have been sufficient to defeat their action. There was enough to raise a presumption that he acted officially, beqause the act was within the scope of his authority. No rule of law obliged him to add to his name any designation of his official character; and even supposing him to be liable in his individual capacity, it does not follow that his principals are not liable for what he has done, the presumption being strongly in favour of the official character of the ac\u00edt. And if it be doubtful whether he is personally liable to the Bank of Columbia, he is certainly liable to the Mechanics\u2019 Bank, whose servant he was; who had the best means of knowing and correcting the fraud or mistake ; and who-, upon the principle of the rule <em>de damno </em>evitando, ought to bear the loss. 3. As to the law incorporating the Mechanics\u2019 Bank, it has no application to this case, unless it be contended that it W'ould extend to the case of a deposit, and'every other case where the law implies a contract. The action is not brought upon any such express undertaking as the act contemplates must be signed by the President, &amp;c.; but upon an undertaking which the law implies, and which it may as we\u00edl iniply in the case of a corporation as of an individual.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b344-5\"><em>March </em>13th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"><em> </em>Frontin v.

The merits of this case lie within a very limited compass. The question is, whether a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>act, done by the Cashier of a Bank, was done in his official or individual capacity ? Had the draft, signed by Pat\u00f3n, borne no marks of an official character on the face of it, the case would have presented more difficulty. But if marks of an official character not only exist on the face, but predominate, the case is really a very familiar one. Evidence to fix its true character becomes indispensable.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AZX\">The 17th sec.. of charter incorporating the Mechan&gt;c\u00bb\u2019Bank, not applicable to .this case-</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">It has been contended,, but the argument was not pressed with much confidence, that this defendant * ..... . <em>. </em>could not be bound otherwise than m conformity <em>J </em>with the 17th. section of the charter; by which it is enacted, \u201c that all bills, bonds, notes, and every other contract or engagement, on behalf of the corporation, shall by signed by the President, and countersigned by the Cashier; and the funds of the corporation shall in no case be liable for any contract \u00f3r engagement, unless the same shall be signed and countersigned as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">It is to be hoped this argument was not intended to reach the case of a deposit of tnoney ; and yet if it proves any thing, it proves that no contract in law could be. imputed to this bank. The truth is, that a check is properly neither a bond, bill, or note, with regard to the bank drawn upon, but an acquittance. And the contract arising out of a payment upon it, .is a. contract for money advanced, and must be so declared upon. It is true that checks are generally-made payable to bearer, and this was made payable to order; but it is in evidence that it was drawn as a check, and paid as a check, and the declaration contains only the common money counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Of the six exceptions in the transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>record, the 1st, 2d, 4th, and 5th, are taken on behalf \u00b0f the Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Alexandria. Uponcomparing these exceptions with the evidence, it does not appear that they affirm any other proposition grow-ing out of that evidence, but that the check, on the face \u00b0f it) purported to be the private check of Pat\u00f3n, and no extrinsic evidence could be received to prove J, tfl&lt;? COOtl'ciry*</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AvSp\">was^ffida\u00ed,^ 0mdonyaradmR-\u2019 \u00abibis to explain the ainbiguity.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"APa\">. . The only ground on which it can be contended that this check was a private check, is, that it had not below the name the letters <em>Cas. </em>or <em>Ca. </em>But the fallacy, of the proposition will at once appear, from the consideration, that the consequence would be, that all Paton\u2019s checks must have been adjudged private. For no definite meaning could be attached to the addition of those letters without the aid of parol testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"A8B\">But the fact that this appeared on its face to be a private check, is by no means to be conceded. On the contrary, the appearance of the .corporate, name of the institution on the face of the paper, at once leads to the belief that it is a corporate, and not an individual transaction : to which must be added the circumstances, that the cashier is the drawer, and the.teller the payee; and the form of ordinary checks deviated from by the substitution of <em>to </em>order, for <em>to bearer. </em>The evidence, therefore, on the face of the bill, predominates in favour of its being a bank transaction. Applying, then, the plaintiff\u2019s own principle to the case, and the restriction as to the production of parol. <em>or </em>extrinsic evidence could have been only applicable to himself. But, it is enough for the purposes of the defendant to establish, that there exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>cd, oil the face of the paper, circumstances from which it might reasonably be inferred, that it was either one or the other, in that case, it became in- ' \u2022dispensable to resort to extrinsic evidence, to remove the doubt. The evidence resorted to for this purpose was the most obvious and reasonable possible, viz. that this was the appropriate form of an official check ; that it was, in fact, cut out of the official check-book of the bank, and noted on the margin ; that the money was drawn in behalf of, and applied to the use of the Mechanics\u2019 Bank ; and by ail the banks, and all the officers of the banks through which it passed, recognized as an official transaction. It is true, it was in evidence that this check was credited to Paton\u2019s own account, on the books of his bank. But it was done by his own order, and with the evidence before their eyes, that it was officially drawn. This would never have been sanctioned by the .directors, unless for reasons which they best understood, and on account of debits which they only could explain.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Atc\">SLct%ecm$l stiun\"nte!w far explainable by parol evi* The act3 <em>of </em>agents, as con-</headnotes>\n<p id=\"A40\">It is by no means true, as was contended in argument, that the aicts of agents derive their validity from professing, on the face of them, to have been -, . * . <em>t* i ' </em>* t , done in the exercise ot their agency, in the more solemn exercise of derivative powers, as applied to the execution of instruments known to the common law, rules of form have been prescribed. But in the diversified exercise of the duties of a general agent, the liability of the principal depends upon the facts, 1. That the act was done in the exercise, arid, -?\u25a0 Within the limits of the powers delegated. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>facts are necessarily inquirable into by a Court and juryand this inquiry is not confined to written instruments, (to which alone the principle contended for could apply,) but to any act with, or without writing, within the scope of the pou'er or confidence rbposed in the agent; as, for instance, in the case of money credited in the books of a teller, or proved to have been deposited with him, though he omits to credit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
