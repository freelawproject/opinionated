But ther\u00e9 is no defect in the definition of . piracy by the authorities to which we are referred by this act. The definition given by them is certain, consistent, and unanimous; and pirates being <em>hostes humani </em>generis, are punishable in the tribunals of all nations. All nations are engaged in a league against them, for the mutual defence and safety of all. This renders it the more fit and proper'that there should be a uniform rule as to the definition of the crime, which can only be drawn from the law of nations, as the only code universally known and recognized by the people of all countries.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A3Ae\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\n<em>Feb. 21st.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Mr. <em>Webster, </em>contra, argued,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8o\">that the special verdict did not contain sufficient facts to enable the Court to pronounce the prisoner guilty of the offence charged. The facts found, do not necessarily infer his guilt, but, on the contrary, are consistent with his innocence; inasmuch as it appears that he was one of the crew of a vessel belonging to Buenos Ayres, although not acting at the time when the supposed offence was committed under the commission of that colony, but acting as a non-commissioned captor, and as such, seizing the property of Spanish subjects on the high seas. But even, supposing the offence to be well-found by the special verdict, it cannot be punished under this act, because the law is not a constitutional exercise of the power of Congress to define the crime of piracy. Congress is. bound to define it; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>in terms, and is not at liberty to leave it to be ascertained by judicial interpretation. To refer to the law of nations for a definition of the crime, is not a definition ; for the very thing to be ascertained by the definition, is the law of nations on the subject. The constitution evidently presupposes that this crime, and other offences committed on the high seas, were not defined with sufficient precision by the law of nations, or any other law, to form a rule of conduct; or it would merely have given Congress the power of punishing these offences, without also imposing upon it the duty of defining them. The writers on public law do not.define the crime of piracy with precision and certainty. It was this very defect which rendered it necessary that Congress should define, in terms, before it proceeded to exercise the power of punishing the offence. Congress must define it as the constitution has defined treason, not by referring to the law of nations in one case, or to the common law in the other, but by giving a distinct, intelligible explanation of the nature of the offence in the act itself.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ANW\">\n<em>Feb. 25th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><em> </em>Which provides, (s. 5.) \u201c That if any person or persons whatsoever, shall, on the high seas, commit the crime of piracy, <em>as defined by the law of nations, </em>and such offender or offenders shall afterwards be brought into, or found in, the United States, every such offender or offenders shall, upon conviction thereof, before the'Circuit Court of the-United States for the District into which he or they may be brought, or in which, he or they shall be found, be punished with death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"><em> Grotius de J.

The act of Congress upon which this indictment is founded provides, \u201c that if any person or persons whatsoever, shall, upon the high seas, commit the crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, and such offender or offenders shall be brought into,, or found in the United States, every such offender or offenders shall, upon conviction thereof, &amp;c. be punished with death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>THe first point made at the bar is, whether this enactment be a constitutional exercise of the authority delegated to Congress, upon the subject of piracies. The constitution.declares, that Congress shall, have power \u201c to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and of-fences against the. law of nations.\u201d The argument which has been urged in behalf of the prisoner is, that Congress is bound to define, in terms, the offence of piracy, and is not at liberty to leave it to be. ascertained by judicial interpretation. If the argument be well founded, it seems admitted by the counsel that it equally applies to the 8th section of the act of Congress of 1790, ch; 9. which declares, that robbery and murder committed on the high seas shall be deemed piracy; and yet, notwithstanding a series of contested adjudications on this section, no doubt has hitherto been breathed of its conformity to the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">In our judgment, the construction contended for proceeds upon too narrow a view of the language of the constitution.. The power given to Congress is not merely \u201c to define and punish piraciesif it were, the words \u201c to define,\u201d would seem almost superfluous, since the power to punish piracies-would be held to include the power of ascertaining and fixing the definition of the crime. And it has been very justly observed, in a celebrated commentary, that the definition of piracies might have been left without inconvenience to the law of nations, though a legislative definition of them is to. be found in most muni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>eipal codes.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> But the power is also given . \u201c to define and punish felonies on the high seas, and of-fences against the law of nations.\u201d The term \u00a3\u00a3 felonies,\u201d has been supposed in the same work, not to have a very exact and determinate meaning in relation to offences at the common law committed within the body of a. county. However, this may be, in relation to offences oh the high seas, it is necessarily somewhat indeterminate, since the term is not used in the criminal jurisprudence of the admiralty in the technical sense of the common law.<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> Offences, too, against the law of nations, cannot, with any accuracy, be said to be completely ascertained and defined in any public code recognised by the common consent of nations. In respect, therefore, as well to felonies on the high seas as to offences against the law of nations, there is a peculiar fitness in giving the power to define as well as to punish; and there is not the slightest reason to doubt that this consideration had very great weight in producing the phraseology in question.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AaYF\">The crime of piracy is constitutionally defined by Congress, in an act referring to tiie law of nations for a definition of that crime.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">But supposing Congress were bound in all the\" eases included in the clause under consideration to define the offence, still there is nothing which restricts it tp a mere logical enumeration in detail of all the facts constituting the offence. - Congress may as well define lay using a term of a known and determinate meaning, as by an express enumeration of all the particulars included in that term. That is cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>tain which is by necessary reference made certain. When the act of 1790 declares, that any person who shall commit the crime of robbery, or murder, on the high seas, shall be deemed a pirate, the crime is not less clearly ascertained than it would be by using the definitions of these terms as they are found in our treatises of the common law. In fact, by such a reference, the definitions are necessarily included, as much as if they stood in the text of the act. In respect to murder, where \u201c malice aforethought\u201d is of the essence of the offence, even if the common law definition were quoted in express terms, we should Still be driven to deny that the definition was perfect, since the meaning of <em>u </em>malice aforethought\u201d would remain to be gathered from the common law. There would then be no end to our difficulties, or our definitions, for each would involve some terms which might still require some new explanation. Such a construction of the constitution is, therefore, wholly inadmissible. To define piracies, in the sense of the constitution, is merely to enumerate the crimes which shall constitute piracy; and this may be done either by a reference to crimes having a technical name, and determinate extent, or by enumerating the acts in detail, upon which the punishment is inflicted.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AKi\">Definition of piracy by the taw of nations, and the act of Congress.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">It is next to be considered, whether the crime of piracy is defined by the law of nations with reasonable certainty. What the law of nations on this subject is, may be ascertained by consulting the works of jurists, writing professedly on public law; or by the general usage and practice of nations; or by ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>dicial decisions recognising and enforcing that law. There is scarcely a writer on the law of nations, who does not allude' to piracy as a crime of a settled and determinate nature;'and whatever may be the diversity of definitions, in other respects, all writers concur, in holding, that robbery, or forcible depredations upon the sea, <em>animo furandi, </em>is piracy. The same doctrine is held by all the great writers on maritime law, in terms that admit of no reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> The common law, too, recognises and punishes piracy as an offence, not against its own municipal code, but as an offence against the law of nations, (which is part of the common law,) as an offence against the universal law of society, a pirate being deemed an enemy of the human race. Indeed, until the statute. of 28th of Henry VIII. ch: 15. piracy was punishable in England only in the admiralty as a civil law offence; and that statute, in changing the jurisdiction, has been universally admitted not to have changed the nature of the offence<footnotemark>b</footnotemark> Sir Charles Hedges, in his charge at the Admiralty sessions, in the case of Rex v. Dawson, (5 <em>State </em>Trials,) declared in emphatic terms, that \u201c piracy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>only a sea term for robbery, piracy being a robbery committed within the jurisdiction of the admiralty.\u201d Sir Le\u00f3line Jenkins, too, on a like occasion, declared that \u201c a robbery, when committed upon the sea, is what we call piracy;\u201d and he cited the civil law writers, in proof. And it is manifest from the language of Sir William Blackstone,<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> in his comments on piracy, that he considered the common law definition as distinguishable in no essential respect from that of the law of nations. So that,. whether we advert to writers on the common law, or the maritime law, or the law of nations, we shall find that they universally treat of piracy as an offence against the law of nations, and that its true definition by that law is robbery upon the sea. And the general practice of all nations in punishing all persons, whether natives or foreigners, who have committed this of-fence against any persons whatsoever, with whom they are in amity, is a conclusive proof that the offence is supposed to depend, not upon the particular provisions of any municipal code, but upon the law of nations, both for its definition and punishment. We have, therefore, no hesitation in declaring, that piracy, by the law of nations, is robbery upon the sea, and that it is sufficiently and constitutionally defined by the fifth section of the act of 1819.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"A1Y\">The special ease contains sufficient facts upon which to pronounce the prisoner guilty of piracy.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"AQd\">Another point has been made in this case, which is, that the special verdict does not contain sufficient . . facts upon which the Court can pronounce that the * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>prisoner is guilty of piracy. We are of a different opinion. The special verdict finds that the prisoner is guilty of the plunder and robbery charged in the indictment; and finds certain additional facts from which it is most manifest that he and his associates were, at the time of committing the offence, freebooters upon the sea, not under the acknowledged authority, or deriving protection from the flag or commission of any government. If, under such circumstances, the offence be not piracy, it is difficult to conceive any which would more completely fit the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">It is to be certified to the Circuit Court, that upon the facts stated, the case is piracy, as defined by the law of nations, so as to be punishable under the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1819.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\"><em> The </em>Federalist, <em>No. </em>42. p. 276.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"b\">\n<p id=\"ArW\"><em> </em>See 3 <em>Inst. 112 Hawk.

For this reason pirates have always been compared to robbers. The only difference between them is, that the sea is the theatre of action for the-one, and the land for the other.\u201d (s. 11.) \u201cThus, as pirates are the enemies of the human race, piracy is justly regarded as a crime against the universal laws of society, and is every where punished with death. As they form no national body, as they have no right to arm, nor make war, and on account of their indiscriminate plunder of all vessels are considered only as public robbers, every natiop has a right to pursue, and exterminate them, without any declaration of war. <em>For </em>these reasons it is lawful to arrest them, in order that themay undergo the punishment merited by their crimes.\u201d (s. 12.) <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>Pirates having no right to make conquests, cannot, therefore, acquire any lawful property in what they take ; for the law of nations does not authorize them to deprive the true owner of his property, who always retains the right of reclaiming it wherever it may be found. Thus, by the principles of common law, as well as the law of nature, at whatever period, or in whatever manner, things taken by a pirate may be recovered, they return again to their former owners, who lose none of their rights by such unjust usurpation.\u201d (See <em>Azuni, part. </em>2. <em>c. 5. art. </em>3. <em>p. </em>351. 361. <em>Mr. Johnson\u2019s </em>translation.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Lord Bacon, in his dialogue <em>De Bello Sacro </em>says, \u201c Indubitatum semper fuit, helium contra <em>pira tas </em>juste geri posse per nationem quamcumque, licet ab iis minim\u00e9 infestatam et lassam, &amp;c. &amp;c.

To make a war a public one, both the contending parties must be public persons ; that is, it must be a war of one nation against another, &amp;c. Where a nation makes war upon <em>pirates </em>or <em>other robbers, </em>though these are external enemies, the war will be a mixed one ; it is public on one side, because a., nation or public person is one of the parties ; but it is private on the other side, because the parties on this side are private persons, who act together occasionally, and are not united into a civil society. A <em>band of robbers </em>or a <em>company of pirates </em>may in fact be united to one another by compact, &amp;c. But they are still, by the law of nature, only a number of unconnected individuals ; and consequently, in the view of the law of nations they are not considered as a collective body or public person. For the compact by which they unite themselves is void, because the matter of it is unlawful, &amp;c. &amp;c.

He then adds: \u201c But according to the judgments ofour domestic tribunals, a bare assault without taking or pillaging something away does not constitute the crime, though Molloy pretends, that by the law of nations it is otherwise. Yet it does not seem necessary that any person should be on board the pillaged vessel.\u201d \u201c If these violations of property be perpetrated by any national authority, they are the commencement of a public war ; if without that sanction, they are <em>acts of piracy.\" </em>He then proceeds to state several cases which had arisen in the Admiralty of England, and sums up his remarks as follow: \u201c The foregoing particulars are the more deserving of consideration, because it seems agreed that when a piratical taking is ascertained, it becomes a clear and indisputable consequence that there is no transmutation of property. No right to the spoil vests in the piratical captor ; no right is derivable from them to any recaptors in prejudice of the original owners. These <em>piratical seizures </em>being wholly unauthorized, and highly criminal by <em>the law of nations, </em>there is no pretence for devesting the dominion of the former proprietor. This principle, therefore, * a piratis etlatronibus capta dominium non mutant,\u2019 is the re-ceived opinion of ancient civilians and more modern writers, on general jurisprudence. The same doctrine was maintained in our Courts of Common Law long antecedent to the great cultivation and improvements made in the science of the law' of na <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tions. And he remarks in a note, (p. 427. note \u00bb.) \u201c I have looked into the indictment against Luke Ryan, tried at the Admiralty Sessions, March, 1782, for piracy, and who is alleged to have had a Dutch commission. He was indicted not <em>for piracy generally by the law of nations, </em>but for that, being a natural born subject, he piratically, &amp;c. against the form of the statute.\u201d From the whole scope of Mr. Woodeson\u2019s observations on the subject of piracy, it is very clear that he considered piracy, as punishable by the law of the admiralty, to be no other than piracy by the law of nations. The definition of piracy, and Mr. Woodeson\u2019s comments are cited with approbation by Mr. Gwillim in his late edition of Bacon\u2019s Abridgment. (5 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 310. <em>edit. </em>1807.

They are outlawed as I may say, by the laws of all nations; that is, out of the protection of all princes, and of all laws whatsoever. Every body is commissioned, and is to be armed against them as rebels and traitors to subdue and root them out. That which is called <em>robbing upon the highway, the same being done upon the water, is called piracy. </em>Now, robbery f-3 it is distinguished from thieving or larceny, implies not only the actual taking away of my goods, while I am, as we say, in peace, but; also, the putting me in fear by taking' them by force and arms, out of my hands, or in my sight and presence. When this is donef upon the sea, without a lawful commission of war or reprisals, it is downright piracy.\u201d <em>Vol. </em>1. <em>p. </em>86.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Again; in another charge, he says, <em>(vol. </em>1. <em>p. </em>94.) \u201c The next sort of offences pointed at in the statute [28 Hen. VIII. ch. 16.] are robberies ; and a robbery, when it is committed upon the sea, is what we call piracy. A robbery, when it is committed upon the land, does imply three things, 1. That there be a violent assault; 2. That a man\u2019s goods be actually taken from his person or possession ; 3. That he who is despoiled be put in-fear thereby. When this is done upon the sea, when one or more persons enter on board a ship with force and arms, and those in the ship have their ship carried away by violence, or their goods taken away out of their possession, and are put in fright by the assault, this is piracy ; and he that does so is a pirate or a robber withrn the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The statute of Henry VIII. here referred to, does not contain any description of piracy. Before that statute, piracy was only cognizable by the civil law in the Admiralty Court. But the' statute gave the High Commission Court (created by that statute) jurisdiction of \u201c all treasons; felonies, <em>robberies, </em>murders, and confederacies committed in, or on the sea,\u201d &amp;c. The term <em>piracy </em>is not found in the statute, and it is only as a <em>robbery </em>upon the-sea that the High Commission Court has jurisdiction of piracy. Sir Leoline Jenkins, therefore, refers to the civil law definition of the offence of <em>piracy; </em>for it is agreed on all sides, that the statute of Henry VIII. has not altered the nature of the offence.

But that was certainly not the meaning of the writer. For it is perfectly well settled, that piracy is no felony at common law, being <em>out of its jurisdiction; </em>and before the statute of 28 Henry VIII. c. 15. it was only punishable by the <em>civil law. </em>That statute, however, does not (as has been already stated) alter the nature' of the offence in this respect; and, therefore, a pardon of all felonies generally, does not extend to it. (2 <em>East's P. C. </em>796. 1 <em>Hawk. c. </em>37. s. 6. 8. 10. 1 Hale, 354. 2 <em>Hale, </em>18. 3 <em>Inst. </em>112.) And it was-also determined in Rex v. Morphes, <em>(Salk. </em>85.) that <em>\u201c </em>no attainder for piracy wrought corruption of blood, <em>for it was no offence at common law. </em>(2 <em>East's P. C. </em>796. <em>Co. Litt. </em>391. <em>a.) </em>The intention' of Hawkins must have been to use the phrase \u201c at the common law\u201d in its most comprehensive sense ; in which sense the <em>law of nations </em>itself is a part of the common law ; since all offences against the law of nations are punishable by the criminal jurisprudence of England,</p>\n<p id=\"A3N\">i Blackstone, in the Commentaries, (4 <em>Comm. </em>71. 73.) evidently proceeds upon this notion. He says, \u2018\u2018 The crime of piracy, or <em>robbery and depredation </em>upon the high seas, is an offence against the <em>universal law of society, </em>a pirate being, according to Sir Edward Coke, <em>hostis hitmani generis.'' </em>He goes on to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>mark, that every community hath a right to punish it, for it is a war against all mankind. He then gives the definition of piracy by Hawkins, as the definition of the common law ; and then states the several statutes made in England'on the subject of piracy, concluding thus: \u201c These are the principal cases in which the <em>statute </em>law of England interposes <em>to aid and enforce the law of nations as a part of the common law, </em>by inflicting an adequate punishment for offences against that universal -law committed by private persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The state trials for piracy in the reign of William III.-are entitled to great consideration, both from the eminent talents of the Judges who constituted the tribunal, and the universal approbation of the legal principles asserted by them. It is, also, worthy of remark, that in none of these indictments was there any averment that the prisoners were British' subjects ; and most of them wer,e for piracies committed on foreign subjects and vessels. They' were all framed as indictments at common law, or for general piracy, without reference, to any British statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In Rex v. Dawson and others, (8 <em>William </em>III. 1696. <em>&amp; State Trials, </em>1 <em>edit. </em>1742.) the Court was composed of Sir .Charles Hedges, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, (as President,) Lord Chief Justice Holt,'Lord Chief Justice Treby, Lord Chief Baron Ward, Mr. Justice Rookby, Mr. Justice Turton, Mr. Justice Eyre, Mr. Baron Powis, and''Doctors Lane, King, and Cook, (Civilians.) Sir Charles Hedges delivered the charge to the grand jury, and among other things, directed them as follows : \u201c Now piracy is only a <em>sea term </em>for robbery, <em>piracy being a robbery committed within the jurisdiction of the. Admiralty. . </em>If any man be assaulted, within- that jurisdiction, and his ship or goods violently taken away without legal authority, this is <em>robbery and piracy. </em>If the mariners of a ship shall- violently dispossess the master, and afterwards carry away the ship itself, or any of the goods, or tackle; apparel or furniture, With a fe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Ionious intention, in any place where the Lord Admiral hath, or pretends to have, jurisdiction, this is. also robbery and piracy. The intention will, in these cases, appear, by considering the end for which the fact is .committed, and the end will be known, if the evidence show you what hath been done. The King of England hath not only an empire or sovereignty over the British seas for the punishment of piracy, <em>but in concurrence with other Princes and States, an undoubted jurisdiction and power in the most remote parts of the world. If any person, therefore, native or foreigner, </em>Christian or Infidel, Turk or Pagan, <em>with whose country we are in amity, trade or correspondence, shall be robbed or spoiled, </em>in the narrow or <em>other seas, whether the Mediterranean, Atlantic, or Southern, or any branches thereof , either on this or the other side of the, line, </em>it is a piracy, <em>within the limits of your inquiry, and cognizable by this Court.\" </em>It seems impossible to doubt, that Sir Charles Hedges here understood piracy to be punishable <em>by all nations, </em>as a crime <em>against the law of nations, </em>and that its true definition is the same in the civil and common law, as in the law of nations, viz. robbery upon the seas ; and that, as such, it was punishable by the British Courts in virtue of their general concurrent/jurisdiction on the seas.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In Rex v. Dawson and others, there were several indictments. 1. The first was for piracy in robbing and plundering the ship Gunsway, <em>belonging to the Great Mogul and his subjects,. </em>in the Indian seas. 2. The second for piracy, in forcibly seizing and feloniously taking, stealing, and carrying away a merchant ship called the Charles 2d. <em>belonging to certain of his majesty\u2019s subjects unknown, </em>on the high seas, about three leagues from the Groyne in Spain. 3. The third was for piracy <em>on two Danish ships. 4. </em>The fourth for piracy <em>on a Moorish ship. </em>Dawson pleaded guilty ; and the other prisoner's not guilty, and were upon trial convicted, and all sentenced to death accordingly. It appeared in evidence that the prisoners were part of the crew of the Charles the 2d,- and rose upon her near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the Groyne, and afterwards ran away with her, and committed the piracies. The Solicitor General, in stating the case to the jury, said, \u201cThey (the prisoners) are arraigned for a very high crime, a robbery upon the seas.\u201d \u201c These are crimes <em>against the law of nations, </em>and worse than robbery on land.\u201d Lord Chief Justice Holt, in delivering the charge to the jury, said, \u201c that there was a piracy committed on the ship Charles is most apparent by the evidence that hath been given ; that is, a force was put upon the master, and some of the seamen on board her, who because they would not agree to go on a piratical expedition, had liberty to depart and be set ashore, &amp;c. &amp;c. So that I must tell you beyond all contradiction, the <em>force put upon the </em>\u2018captain,. and taking away this ship, called the Charles 2d, is piracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">On the trial of Kidd and others for piracy, &amp;c. in 13th of William III. 1713, (5 <em>State Trials, edit. </em>1742.) there were several indictments. 1. The first was against William Kidd for the murder of one W. Moore, on the high seas, near the coast of Malabar, in a vessel called the Adventure Galley, of which Kidd was commander. 2. The second was against all the prisoners for piracy in seizing and tunning away with a certain merchant ship called the Q,uedash Merchant, then being <em>a ship of certain persons to the jurors unknown, </em>(not staled to. be British subjects,) upon the high seas about ten leagues from Cutsheen in the East Indies. In fact, the vessel and cargo appeared by the evidence to belong to Armenian - merchants, and then on a voyage from Bengal to Surat. Lord Chief Baron W ard, in charging the jury on this indictment, said-, \u201c the crime charged upon them (the prisoners) is <em>piracy, </em>that is, <em>seizing and taking this ship and the goods in it piratic ally and feloniously. This ship belonged to people in amity with the king of </em>England.\u201d \u201c Jf this was a capture on the high seas, \u2022 and these were- the goods of persons in' amity with the king, and had no-FRENcn pass, then it is a plain piracy ; and if you believe the witnesses, here is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the taking of the gopds and ship of persons in amity, and converting them to their own use. Such a taking as this would be <em>felony; </em>and <em>being at sea, </em>it <em>will be piracy.\u201d </em>The prisoners were convicted and sentenced to death. There were four other indictments, three for piracy on Moorish ships, and one for piracy on a Portuguese ship ; and all the prisoners were convicted'and sentenced. Mr. Justice Turton, in charging the jury on one of these indictments, said, \u201c pirates are called hostes liumani generis, the enemies to all mankind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The case of Rex v. Green (4 <em>Anne, </em>1704. 5 <em>State Trials, </em>573. <em>edit. </em>1742.) was a libel or indictment in the Court of Admiralty in Scotland for piracy, manifestly treated both in the libel and the arguments as a crime against the law of nations, and as such, also against the law of Scotland.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">In Erskine\u2019s Institutes of the law of Scotland, in treating of the crime of piracy, the author says, \u201c piracy is that particular kind of robbery which is committed on the seas.\u201d <em>(Ersk. Inst. b. 4. tit. </em>4. <em>s. </em>65.) He had in the preceding section, (64.) declared'that, \u201crobbery is truly a species of theft ; for both are committed on the property of another, and with the same view of getting gain ; but robbery is aggravated by the <em>violence </em>with which it is attended.\u201d The definition of both these crimes seems not at all different from that of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">The foregoing collection of doctrines, extracted from writers on the civil law!, the law of nations, the maritime law, and the. common law, in the most ample manner confirms the opinion o.f the Court in the case in the text; and it is with great diffidence submitted to the learned reader to aid his future researches in . a path, which, fortunately for us, it has not been hithqrto necessary to explore with minute accuracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b174-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Mr. Justice Livingston</author>\n<p id=\"AEz\">dissented.

The special power here given to define piracy, can he at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tributed to no other cause, than to the uncertainty which it was known existed on this subject in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>law of nations, and which it must have been the intention of the framers of the constitution to remove, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>by conferring on the national legislature the power which has been mentioned. It was well known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the members of the Federal Convention, that in treatises on the law of nations, or in some of them at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>least, definitions of piracy might be found; but it roust have been as well known, to them that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>was not such a coincidence on this- subject, as to ren* der a reference to that code a desirable or safe mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>of proceeding in a criminal, and especially in a capital case. If it had been intended to adopt the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>nition or definitions of this crime, so far as they were to be collected from the different commentators on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>this code, with all the uncertainty and difficulty attending a research for that purpose, it might as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>at once have been adopted as a standard by the constitution itself. The object, therefore, of referring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>its definition to Congress was, and could have been no other than, to enable that body, to select from sources it might think proper, and then to declare, and with reasonable precision to define, what act or acts should constitute this crime; and having done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>so, to annex to it such punishment as might be thought proper. Such a mode of proceeding would be consonant with the universal practice in this country, and with those feelings of humanity which \u00e1re ever opposed to the putting in jeopardy the life of a fellow-being, unless for the contravention of a rule which has been previously prescribed, and in language so plain and explicit as not to be misunderstood by any one. Can this be the case, or can a crime be said to be defined, even to a common intent, when those who are desirous of information on the subject are referred to a code, without knowing with any certainty, where it is to be found, and from which even those to whom it may be accessible, can with difficulty decide, in many cases, whether a particular act be piracy or not ? Although it cannot be denied that some writers on the law of nations do declare what acts are deemed piratical, yet it is certain, that they do not all agree; and if they did, it would seem unreasonable to impose upon that class of men, who. are the most liable to commit offences of this description, the task of looking beyond the written law of their own country for a definition of them. If in criminal cases every thing is sufficiently certain, which by reference may be rendered so., which was an argument used at bar, it is not perceived why a reference to the laws of China, or to any other foreign code, would not have answered the purpose quite as well as the one which has been resorted to. It is not certain, that on examination, the crime would not be found to be more accurately defined in the code thus referred to, than in any writer on the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of nations; but the objection to the reference in both cases is the same; that it is the duty of Congress to incorporate into their own statutes a definition in <em>terms, </em>and not to refer the citizens of the United States for rules of conduct to the statutes or laws of any foreign country, with which it is not'to be presumed that they are acquainted. Nor does it make any difference in this case, that the law of nations forms part of the law of every civilized country. This may be the case to a certain extent; but as to criminal cases, and as to the offence of piracy in particular, the law of nations could not be supposed of itself to form a rule of action; and, therefore, a reference to it in this instance, must be regarded in the same light, as a reference to any other foreign code. But,'it is said, that murder and robbery have been declared to be punishable by the laws of the United States, without any definition of what act or acts shall constitute either of these offences. This may be; but both murder and robbery, with arson, burglary, and some other crimes, are defined by writers on the common law, which is part of the law of every State in the Union, of which, for the most obvious reasons, no one is allowed to allege his ignorance in excuse for any crime he'may commit. Nor is there any hardship in this, for the great body of the community have it in their power to become acquainted with the criminal code under which they live; not so when acts which constitute a crime are to be collected from a variety of writers, either in different languages, or under the disadvantage of translations,. and from a code with whose provisions even profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>sional men are not always acquainted. By the same clause of the constitution, Congress have power to punish offences against the law of nations, and yet it would hardly he deemed a fair and legitimate exer cution of this authority, to declare, that all offences against the law of nations, without defining any one of them, should be punished with death. Such mode of legislation is but badly calculated to furnish that precise and accurate information in criminal cases., which it is the duty, and ought to be the object, of every legislature to impart.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\">Upon the whole, my opinion is, that there is not to be found in the act that definition of piracy which the constitution requires, and that, therefore, judgment on the special verdict ought to be rendered for the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Certificate. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Virginia, and on the question on which the Judges of that Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that the offence charged in the indictment in this case, and found by the jury to have been committed by the prisoner, amounts to the crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, so as to be punishable under the act of Congress, entitled, \u201c an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy.\u201d All which is ordered to be certified to the Circuit Court for the district of Virginia.<footnotemark>a</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em> Vide </em>Appendix, Note IV. for the new act of Congress on the subject of piracy, passed May 15, 1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
