The defendant had been appointed to the office by the State of Virginia, and continued to exercise its duties until the year 1818, during all which time his official acts were recog nised by the United States. In that year he was removed by the Governor and Council of Virginia, and the plaintiff appointed in his place. The writ was brought, by consent of parties, to try the title to the office, waiving all questions of form, and of . jurisdiction. Judgment was given in the Court below for the defendant, and the cause was brought by writ of error to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-12\">The cause was argued by Mr. Hardin, for the plaintiff, and by the <em>Attorney-General </em>and Mr. <em>Scott, </em>for the defendant.

This cause came on to be heard. .on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court for the district of Ohio, and was argued by counsel, On consideration whereof, this .Court is of opinion, that no writ of <em>quo warranto </em>can be maintained, but at the instance of the Government; and as this is a writ issued by an individual without the authority of Government, it is the opinion of this Court, that the same cannot be sustained, whatever may be the right of that individual, or of the person who claims to exercise the office, to try the title to which, the writ is brought. It is, therefore, the opinion of this Court, that the judgment of the Circuit Court ought-to be reversed, and. th\u00e9 cause remanded , to that Court, with directions to dismiss the information because it is not filed at the instance of the United States;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
