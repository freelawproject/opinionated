Title 12, Chapter 7, Section 1 (1956, 1969 Reenactment), which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-23\"><em>\u201cTemporary detention of </em>suspects.\u2014 A peace officer may detain any person abroad whom he has reason to suspect is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime, and may demand of him his name, address, business abroad and whither he is going; and any such person who fails to identify himself and explain his actions to the satisfaction of such peace officer may be further detained and further questioned and investigated by any peace officer; provided, in no case shall the total period of such detention exceed two (2) hours, and such detention shall not be recorded as an arrest in any official record. At the end of any such detention period the person so detained shall be released unless arrested and charged with a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-24\">This action seeks a declaration that this statute is unconstitutional, an injunction against the enforcement of such statute against the plaintiffs, and compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs further request an order of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>Court directing the defendants to destroy all photographs taken of plaintiffs and records made concerning their observations of and conversations with plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">Jurisdiction is premised on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. Because the questioned statute is of state wide application, this three judge federal court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">At noon on May 11, 1972, the plaintiffs, Lillian Lim, Ann DiDomenico and April Robbins together with other persons assembled in front of the United States District Court House in Providence to peacefully express their opposition to the bombing raids in North Vietnam. The demonstration lasted for approximately forty-five minutes. During that time certain members of the group walked about the sidewalk carrying signs and talked to passing pedestrians. For a short period the plaintiff Robbins and several others lay on the court house steps to \u201cdramatize the effects that weapons of war have on people.\u201d There is no evidence before the court that these demonstrators were in any way disruptive of the court house business or of the pedestrian or vehicular traffic. In short the demonstration was peaceful and orderly as must have been observed by the several policemen who were posted in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">After leaving the area the three plaintiffs went to a nearby restaurant. While there they were accosted by two of the defendants and transported by car to the detective bureau. at the Providence police station. They were held approximately forty minutes while questioned about the demonstration and their future plans. The apprehension and questioning was under the direction and control of the defendant, Major Stanley P. Andrukiewicz, who told the 'plaintiff Robbins that he would be seeing her in the future. The plaintiffs were not at any time given \u201cMiranda warnings.\u201d Although plaintiff Robbins requested permission to make a telephone call, she was not allowed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">Two inconsistent arguments have been raised in defense of this statute. First, it is urged that this Court should abstain because a savings construction might be given to this statute by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. In support of abstention defendants cite City of Meridian v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 358 U.S. 639, 79 S.Ct. 455, 3 L.Ed.2d 562 (1959). Secondly, it is argued that decisional law subsequent to the enactment of the statute has authoritatively interpreted the statute so as to limit its operation to circumstances constitutionally permitting arrest. The interpretive Rhode Island opinions referred to by defendants are Kavanagh v. Stenhouse, 93 R.I. 252, 174 A.2d 560 (1961), app. dismissed 368 U.S. 516, 82 S.Ct. 529, 7 L.Ed.2d 521.; Ahern v. Lynch, 99 R.I. 316, 207 A.2d 296 (1965); Barth v. Flad, 99 R.I. 446, 208 A.2d 533 (1965); Berberian v. Smith, 99 R.I. 198, 206 A.2d 531 (1965); and State v. Giragosian, 107 R.I. 657, 270 A.2d 921 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">Plaintiffs merely refer to <em>Kavcmagh, </em>supra, which upheld the constitutionality of the challenged statute, and assert that it is settled that the statute permits detention on less than probable cause. This, plaintiffs emphatically argue, cannot be \u201clogically or constitutionally squared with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">The magnitude and complexity of the constitutional question cannot be treated so blithely. The concept of arrest with all its legal and sociological implications has persistently plagued the courts. Although Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) has eliminated, as determinative, the labels of \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cdetention\u201d in favor of the Fourth Amendment standard of the reasonableness of searches and seizures, there is a treacherous span of uncharted waters before resolution of the issue of the legality of custodial interrogation on a standard falling short of probable cause. See Morales v. New York, 396 U.S. 102, 90 S.Ct. 291, 24 L.Ed.2d 299 (1969). See also W. LaFave, \u201cStreet Encounters\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>Constitution; Terry, Sibron, Peters and Beyond, 67 Mich.L.Rev. 40 (1968); J. Cook, Varieties of Detention and the Fourth Amendment, 10 Ala.L.Rev. 287 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">One mode of analysis of the challenged statute is to view it as composed of two parts. The first part authorizes the police, on reasonable suspicion of a crime, to stop a person and ask certain limited questions. This could be thought of as authorizing \u201cfield detention and interrogation.\u201d The second part of the statute allows a policeman who is not satisfied with the answers given to further detain and question the person for a two hour period without arresting that person. This \u201ccustodial detention and interrogation\u201d usually takes place at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Plaintiffs have attacked the entire statute on its face, claiming that it authorizes detention of both types on less than probable cause. Therefore, an assessment of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge necessarily involves consideration of what standard authorizes field detention, what standard authorizes custodial detention, the relationship of the two parts of the statute, and the severability of the two portions. This inquiry, in turn, must focus on the opinions of the Rhode Island Supreme Court construing and interpreting R.I.G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">\n<em>The Rhode Island Supreme Court Decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-12\">The facts of Kavanagh v. Stenhouse, 93 R.I. 252, 174 A.2d 560 (1961), which sustained the constitutionality of R.I. G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1, may be found in the margin below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff in <em>Kavanagh </em>had both been questioned at the scene of an accident and brought to the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>station for further questioning. In considering the plaintiff\u2019s argument that detention and arrest are synonymous in law and that he was falsely arrested, the Court made no distinction between field detention and interrogation and custodial detention and interrogation. Rather, the Court addressed itself to the question of whether the legislature could constitutionally distinguish between detention and arrest. It is highly unclear from <em>Kavanagh </em>whether the distinction made was one without a constitutional difference, that is, whether detention was authorized only on the same probable cause standard used for arrest or whether detention was permissible on a standard less than probable cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">In a subsequent case, Ahern v. Lynch, 99 R.I. 316, 207 A.2d 296 (1965), the Court interpreted its holding in <em>Kavanagh </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-6\">\u201cIn Kavanagh v. Stenhouse, 93 R.I. 252 [174 A.2d 560], we held that the state could in a proper exercise of its police power distinguish between arrest and a mere detention for investigation when the detaining officer had \u2018reason to suspect\u2019 some criminal act involving the detainee. <em>We further held in that case that \u2018reason to suspect\u2019 constitutes a reasonable standard for so detaining a person abroad as is consistent with the constitutional right to be free from arrest without warrant except on the basis of probable cause.\u201d </em>99 R.I. at 319, 207 A.2d at 297 (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-16\">If <em>Ahem </em>were the terminal word in the decisional interpretive evolution of the statute at issue, we would think that the \u201creason to suspect\u201d standard of the first sentence of the statute embodied a probable cause standard' as a prerequisite to stopping abroad and making inquiries of a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-17\"><em>Ahern, </em>however, is not the latest word. In State v. Ramsdell, 285 A.2d 399 (R.I.1971), the Court took a different view of <em>Kavanagh:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-18\">\u201cThe defendant fails to distinguish a detention from an arrest. We have made such a distinction in Kavanagh v. Stenhouse, 93 R.I. 252, 174 A.2d 560 (1961), when we referred to the fact that \u00a7 12-7-1 expressly authoriz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>es a peace officer to detain any person found abroad whom the officer reasonably suspects has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime and to ask the suspect for his name, address, the reason for his presence abroad and his destination. While this court believes it highly desirable that a citizen\u2019s travel upon the streets of our municipalities be unimpeded, <em>we wish to make it clear that there is nothing ipso facto unconstitutional in the police briefly stopping a citizen under circumstances not justifying an arrest for the purpose of a limited inquiry during a routine police investigation. </em>United States v. Oswald, 441 F.2d 44 (9th Cir. 1971). Although the Fourth Amendment prohibits the \u2018unreasonable seizures\u2019 of persons, not every detention of an individual constitutes an unreasonable seizure. People v. Morales, 22 N.Y.2d 55, 290 N.Y. S.2d 898, 238 N.E.2d 307 (1968). <em>There are circumstances short of establishing the probable cause necessary to make an arrest that can warrant an officer\u2019s stopping a pedestrian or motorist on the streets for questioning. </em>Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); People v. Mickelson, 59 Cal.2d 448, 30 Cal.Rptr. 18, 380 P.2d 658 (1963); Stone v. People, Colo., 485 P.2d 495 (1971); People v. Peters, 18 N.Y.2d 238, 273 N.Y.S.2d 217, 219 N.E.2d 595 (1966).\u201d 285 A.2d at 402 (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">Because defendant in <em>Ramsdell </em>was taken into custody for punching a police officer in the mouth after he had been stopped on the street and questioned and not pursuant to the second part of R.I.G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1, this language in <em>Ramsdell </em>must refer only to the first part of the statute, authorizing field detention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">The interpretation given to R.I.G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1 in both <em>Ahem </em>and <em>Ramsdell </em>was dicta; the holding in <em>Kavanagh </em>was unclear. We are left with the following ambiguities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">Under Terry v. Ohio, supra, it may be constitutionally permissible to stop and question in a limited manner a suspect on the street on less than probable cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under <em>Ramsdell, </em>R.I.G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1 is read to authorize the stopping and questioning of a person suspected of a crime for less than probable cause. But <em>Ahern </em>and certain language in <em>Kavanagh </em>are inconsistent with this reading of the statute. We are not confident of whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court has mandated a standard of questioning of a suspect on the street that is more or less stringent than the <em>Terry </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\"><em>Terry, </em>supra, explicitly stated that it was not deciding the constitutional propriety upon less than probable cause of detention and interrogation beyond that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>involved in the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d situation there. 392 U.S. at 19, n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868. In our opinion, this question reserved by <em>Terry, </em>may well be presented by the second portion of the Rhode Island statute. Surely, custodial detention and interrogation for a two hour period in a station house involves a greater intrusion on personal liberties than being stopped and asked a few questions on the street. See <em>Terry, </em>supra, 398 U.S. at 17-18, n. 15, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Further, we note that special constitutional requirements have been thought to apply with respect to other issues involving custodial interrogation. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">The second part of the statute allows a person to be taken into custody for two hours and questioned when the policeman is not satisfied with that person\u2019s answers. This second part of the statute has not been interpreted by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. At best we could only attempt to predict what the meaning of this standard of \u201csatisfaction\u201d is. Several possible interpretations come to mind. Read by itself, this standard of \u201cto the satisfaction of [the] peace officer\u201d is rather vague, and perhaps subject to attack for unconstitutional vagueness and impermissible discretion in the officer. See Alegata v. Commonwealth, 353 Mass. 287, 231 N.E. 2d 201 (1967). If this standard is read together with the first section of the statute, it is open to the following possible interpretations: that a person may be detained for two hours on the same \u201creason to suspect\u201d standard, or detained on less than a \u201creason to suspect\u201d standard, or detained only on greater than a \u201creason to suspect\u201d standard. Further, it is unclear whether, should one portion of this statute be infirm, the first and second parts of the statute are severable as a matter of Rhode Island law. See Chartier Real Estate Company, Inc. v. Chafee, 101 R.I. 544, 225 A.2d 766, 773 (1967); The Narragansett Indians, 20 R.I. 715, 765, 40 A. 347 (1898). An interpretation of R.I. G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1 by the Rhode Island courts that resolved these ambiguities would better put the constitutional challenge to the statute into proper focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">\n<em>Abstention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">In light of the ambiguities about the meaning of R.I.G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1 set out supra, it is appropriate that we determine whether this Court should abstain and allow the Rhode Island courts to resolve the uncertainties about the proper construction of this statute. In Lake Carriers\u2019 Assn. v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 510, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 1757, 32 L.Ed.2d 257 (1972), the United States Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-9\">\u201cThe paradigm case for abstention arises when the challenged state statute is susceptible of \u2018a construction by the state courts that would avoid or modify the [federal] constitutional question. Harrison v. N.A.A.C.P., 360 U.S. 167 [79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152].\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">As the Court noted in Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, 86, 90 S.Ct. 788, 790, 25 L.Ed.2d 68 (1970)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-11\">\u201cAbstention certainly involves duplication of effort and expense and an attendant delay. See England v. Louisiana State Board, 375 U.S. 411 [84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440]. That is why we have said that this judicially created rule which stems from Railroad Comm\u2019n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 [61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971], should be applied only where \u2018the issue of state law is uncertain\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-12\">Despite the delay abstention causes in resolution of the controversy, the doctrine is supported by important policy considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-13\">\u201cWhere resolution of the federal constitutional question is dependent upon or may be materially altered by, the determination of an uncertain issue of state law, abstention may be proper in order to avoid unnecessary friction in federal-state relations, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>terference with important state functions, tentative decisions on questions of state law, and premature constitutional adjudication.\u201d Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528, 534, 85 S.Ct. 1177, 1182, 14 L.Ed.2d 50 (1965)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">See also Gay v. Bd. of Registration Commrs., 466 F.2d 879, 883 (6th Cir. 1972). Were there no ambiguity in the state law, it would be error to abstain. Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 439, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971). Here, however, there are uncertainties about proper construction of this statute, and there is some likelihood that an interpretation of this statute \u201cwould present the federal constitutional issue in significantly altered light.\u201d Wulp v. Corcoran, 454 F.2d 826, 833 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">The recognition of the above policy considerations is but the first step in our assessment of whether this is a proper case for abstention. The interests of the plaintiff in gaining access to a federal forum must be weighed against these constitutional interests for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-6\">\u201cWherever the Federal courts sit, human rights under the Federal Constitution are always a proper subject for adjudication and ... we have not the right to decline the exercise of that jurisdiction simply because the rights asserted may be adjudicated in some other forum.\u201d Stapleton v. Mitchell, 60 F.Supp. 51, 55 (D.C.) cited by Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 248, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed. 2d 444 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">We note especially the caution that must be exercised in abstaining from an action where First Amendment rights are allegedly involved, see Zwickler v. Koota, supra; Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed. 2d 22 (1965) ; Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 378-379, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964), for the \u201cdelay of state court proceedings might itself effect the impermissible chilling of the very constitutional right [the plaintiff] seeks to protect.\u201d Zwickler v. Koota, supra, 389 U.S. 252, 88 S.Ct. 397.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-11\">However, the statute before us does not regulate First Amendment freedoms, nor does it have a direct impact on such freedoms. Rather this law is an exercise of the police power of the state in the balancing of the maintenance of law and order against the privacy and rights of its citizens. Admittedly, First Amendment overtones are raised in the factual situation presented to us. Plaintiffs have neither alleged nor proved a pattern of use of this statute to chill First Amendment rights or to abridge other constitutional rights. There has been no proof of a pattern of bad faith enforcement or harassment under this statute. Compare Dombrowski v. Pfister, <em>supra, </em>380 U.S. 490, 85 S.Ct. 1116. The demonstration took place over a year ago. No further incidents between the plaintiffs and the police were put into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-12\">Given both the peripheral effect of this statute on First Amendment rights and the fact that the plaintiffs do not appear to be in danger of suffering any harm from the delay created by resort to the state court, we find that this is a proper case for abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-13\">In so abstaining, we also retain jurisdiction and stay all proceedings until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>the courts of Rhode Island have had an. opportunity to determine the proper interpretation of R.I.G.L. \u00a7 12-7-1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lake Carriers\u2019 Assn. v.

The facts in <em>Kavanagh </em>were as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-7\">\u201cThe record establishes that on January 20, 1960 plaintiff and Donald Wheeler, a fellow worker, were involved in a highway accident in the town of Westerly. When James A. Keane of the Westerly police department arrived at the scene, plaintiff was standing outside Wheeler\u2019s car at the door on the operator\u2019s side and Wheeler was seated behind the wheel. The defendant, a lieutenant in the Westerly police department and apparently the superior officer in charge, arrived shortly thereafter and was advised by Officer Keane that he had Wheeler and plaintiff in custody. It is uncontradicted that Officer Keane advised defendant that both men had been drinking and that, although each had identified Wheeler as the operator, he, Officer Keane, was not sure which of the men was operating the car when it struck and knocked down two telephone poles. Asked why he was not sure, Keane replied, \u2018We\u2019ve had trouble in the past on cases like this.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-8\">It further appears that when the investigation had been completed defendant directed Officer Keane to take both men to a doctor for examination preparatory to a possible charge of operating under the influence of liquor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-9\">The substance of defendant\u2019s testimony, more or less corroborated by Keane and a fellow officer, is that the detention of plaintiff was part and parcel of the investigation of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-14\">It is undisputed that pursuant to defendant\u2019s orders Officer Keane drove plaintiff and Wheeler to the police station, where the latter was subsequently charged as the operator and plaintiff was exonerated. Officer Keane testified that he returned to the scene of the accident to continue the investigation but was unable to find any eyewitnesses, which left him with Wheeler\u2019s admission that he had been the operator of the car. The defendant corroborated Officer Keane in this regard and added that Keane and Nicholas T. Terranova were in charge of the investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-15\">The latter testified that he was on duty at the station when an unidentified person telephoned to report the accident, and he dispatched Officer Keane to the scene. He further testified that when plaintiff was brought to the station he appeared to have been drinking, was uncooperative, and refused to produce identification until asked to do so a third time. The record also discloses that both plaintiff and Wheeler were locked up in separate cells and that plaintiff remonstrated against his detention. The testimony is in conflict as to the nature and extent of his remonstrance, but it is uncontradicted that within two hours plaintiff was charged with reveling. See State v. Kavanagh [93] R.I.

We point out that in Wilson v. State, in referring to the arrest of the defendant, we said, \u2018Nor can it be doubted that the arrest was legal, that is, upon reasonable suspicion of felony.\u2019 [10 Terry 37, 109 A. 2d 381, 390.] In this context, the words \u2018suspect\u2019 and \u2018believe\u2019 are equivalents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-20\">93 R.I. at 257, 174 A.2d at 563 and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-21\">\u201cThese words [reason to suspect] are connotative with grounds for belief as distinguished from mere suspicion.\u201d 93 R.I. at 259, 174 A.2d at 565</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEi\">However, there is other language that suggests that a standard less than probable cause supports detention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-22\">\u201cIn the enactment of U.L.1956, \u00a7 12-7-1, however, the general assembly did relax to a degree the limitations to which the police had been subject . . . . * * * Further, we are of the opinion that the words \u2018reason to suspect\u2019 establish a just standard for detention as distinguished from arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-24\">93 R.I. at 256, 174 A.2d at 563 and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-25\">\u201cIf the period of detention is reasonably limited, is unaccompanied by unreasonable or unnecessary restraint, and is based upon circumstances reasonably suggestive of criminal involvement, the legislature may lawfully make a distinction between such mere detention and an arrest.\u201d 93 R.I. at 255, 174 A.2d at 562</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">. Tlie facts of Ramsdell are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-5\">\u201cAt approximately one-half hour after midnight on July 29, 1966, in the city of Providence, Officer Leonard F. De-Magistris and Officer Reginald L. Iarocci were on patrol in an unmarked police car. Both officers were in uniform. They had been ordered to maintain a close watch on a construction site located near the intersection of Pine and Claverick Streets because this location had been the scene of recent thefts and acts of vandalism. As they approached the site, they observed four individuals, one or more of whom were throwing rocks at a shed used to house various tools and building equipment. As the police approached, the four \u2018separated.\u2019 Officer DeMagistris \u2018went\u2019 to defendant and asked bis name. Ramsdell replied by asking the officer Ms name. The officer then asked Ramsdell where he lived. The defendant responded by asking, \u2018Who wants to know?\u2019 and embellished this remark by punching the officer in the mouth causing a laceration of the lip. The defendant was subdued and brought to police headquarters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIb\">285 A.2d at 401-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-13\"><em>Ramsdell </em>involved an appeal from defendant\u2019s conviction for striking a uniformed police officer while the officer was engaged in the performance of his duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">.

Indeed, we are aware that some courts believe that abstention may no longer be a viable doctrine with respect to Civil Rights Act eases, e. g. Church v. Board of Education of Saline Area School District, 339 F.Supp. 538 (E.D.Mich. 1972). We cannot agree in the light of the recent Supreme Court cases of Askew v. Hargrave, 401 U.S. 476, 91 S.Ct. 856, 28 L.Ed.2d 196 (1971) and Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, 90 S.Ct. 788, 25 L.Ed.2d 68 (1970), which held that abstention is the proper course where federal constitutional questions might be obviated or modified by the application and/or construction of state constitutional provisions. For other courts which also espouse this viewpoint, see Reid v. Bd. of Education of City of New York, 453 F.2d 238 (2d Cir. 1972) ; Koehler v. Ogilvie, 53 F.R.D. 98 (N.D.Ill.1971) aff\u2019d 405 U.S. 906, 92 S.Ct. 938, 30 L.Ed.2d 777 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1165-23\">. Under the holding in England v. Louisiana State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1964), plaintiffs would not be foreclosed from returning to this court following termination of the state proceedings if they had made a proper reservation of rights in the state court. We note that our reservation of jurisdiction may later act to somewhat alleviate the tension which has been recognized as existing between the abstention doctrine and challenges to a statute on grounds of unconstitutional vagueness.
