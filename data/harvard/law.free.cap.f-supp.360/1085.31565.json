(14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4451 et seq.) and Rule 4A of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, insofar as they permit the prejudgment attachment of real estate without prior notice and hearing, violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs have brought the actions under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 1983, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction is properly invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), and the relevant facts have been stipulated. In both cases, the same three-judge district court has been convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284 to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the constitutional validity of the Maine statute and rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-22\">The provisions of Maine law here attacked permit the attachment of real property of a defendant in a civil action to satisfy any judgment that may be recovered by the plaintiff. 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 4451.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the Maine practice, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney obtains from the clerk of courts a blank writ of attachment bearing the signature or facsimile signature of the clerk; the attorney then fills out the writ and delivers it to the officer making the attachment.

R.S.A. \u00a7 4454. No provision is made for notice to the defendant or for opportunity for the defendant to be heard <em>before </em>the attachment is made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An amendment to Rule 4A, effective January 1, 1973, now permits a defendant, \u201c[o]n 2 days\u2019 notice to the plaintiff or on such shorter notice as the court may prescribe,\u201d to move for the dissolution or modification of the attachment, in which event the court is directed to hear and determine the motion \u201cas expeditiously as the ends of justice require.\u201d Me.R. Civ.P. 4A(g).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Plaintiff in No. 13-117, June B. Gunter, is the owner of approximately 50 acres of real property in the town of Standish, Cumberland County, Maine. On March 31, 1972, Merchants Warren National Bank of Salem effected an attachment of all Mrs. Gunter\u2019s real estate located in Cumberland County to the value of $4,840. The attachment was incident to a civil action commenced by the Bank against Mrs. Gunter in a Maine District Court to recover a $4,820 balance alleged to be due on a promissory note. Mrs. Gunter received no prior notice of the attachment and had no prior opportunity to challenge it. As permitted by Maine law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> copies of the writ of attachment and of the summons and complaint were not served on her until four days after the attachment, and the complaint was not filed with the Court until 15 days thereafter. She instituted her present action on August 4, 1972. Named as defendants are the Bank, the sheriff who made the attachment, and the Clerk of the Maine District Court from which the writ issued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-14\">Plaintiff Lake Arrowhead Estates, Inc. in No. 14-20 is the owner of a 2250-acre recreational real estate development in the towns of Limerick and North Waterboro, York County, Maine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On February 26, 1973, six purchasers of individual lots from plaintiff\u2019s development effected an attachment of its real property in York County to the value of $330,000. The attachment was incident to a civil action filed in the York County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Superior Court seeking $330,000 damages for alleged fraudulent misrepresentations in connection with the purchase of their lots. Plaintiff was provided no prior notice of the attachment or opportunity for hearing before the attachment was made. Service was not completed on plaintiff until nine days after the attachment, and the complaint was not filed with the court until the following day. The present action was filed in this Court on March 14, 1973, naming as defendants the plaintiffs in the state court action, the sheriff who made the attachment, the Clerk of the Superior Court which issued the writ, and the Register of Deeds in whose office the attachment was recorded.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">The constitutional issue presented is a narrow one. It is whether the failure of Maine law to afford a defendant an opportunity to be heard, <em>before </em>attachment of his real property, deprives the defendant of due process of law. We have concluded that fundamental principles of procedural due process, which have long been recognized by the Supreme Court and have most recently been reaffirmed by that Court in Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969) and Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972) make clear that, by denying the defendant any prior opportunity to be heard and to present any defense he may have to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, Maine\u2019s prejudgment attachment procedure cannot pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">For over 100 years the controlling principles have been well established: \u201cThe fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.\u201d Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394, 34 S.Ct. 779, 783, 58 L.Ed. 1363 (1914); Baldwin v. Hale, 1 Wall. (68 U.S.) 223, 233, 17 L.Ed. 531 (1864); Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965). Such hearing must be \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d Armstrong v. Manzo, <em>supra. </em>\u201c[Opportunity for that hearing must be provided <em>before </em>the deprivation at issue takes effect.\u201d <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 82, 92 S.Ct. at 1995 (emphasis supplied). In a variety of contexts, the Supreme Court has been insistent that due process so requires. <em>E. g., </em>Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 542, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed. 2d 287 (1970); Armstrong v. Manzo, <em>supra, </em>380 U.S. at 551, 85 S.Ct. 1187; Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank and Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). As the Court observed in <em>Fuentes, </em>\u201cthis is no new principle of constitutional law.\u201d <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 82, 92 S.Ct. at 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">Judged by this standard, the procedure provided by Maine law fails to meet even the minimum demands of due process. The effect of the Maine law is to permit, at the option of the plaintiff, the immediate attachment, without opportunity to be heard, of the real property of the defendant, simply upon the plaintiff\u2019s unsubstantiated assertion that he has a meritorious claim for damages. <em>Cf. Fuentes, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 83, 92 S. Ct. 1983. It may be that Rule 4A, as recently amended, permits the defendant, <em>after </em>he receives notice of the attachment, to obtain an expeditious dissolution or modification of the attachment. But Maine law still allows the defendant\u2019s property to be attached for a substantial period of time without his prior knowledge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> More fundamentally, op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>portunity for hearing after the event is no substitute for the right to a prior hearing \u201cthat is the only truly effective safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of property.\u201d <em>Idem. </em>In both <em>Sniadach </em>and <em>Fuentes, </em>the challenged statutes included provisions permitting the defendants to quickly recover the property taken from them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Yet in both eases the Court held that the takings of property had to be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing. Thus, it is of no consequence that the deprivation of an interest within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment is temporary and not final. <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 84-86, 92 S.Ct. 1983; <em>Sniadach, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 343, 89 S.Ct. 1820 (Harlan, J., concurring); Bell v. Burson, <em>supra, </em>402 U.S. at 536, 91 S.Ct. 1586.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">These firmly settled principles underlie the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Sniadach </em>and <em>Fuentes. </em>In <em>Sniadach, </em>the Court invalidated a state pretrial wage garnishment statute because it afforded a defendant neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard prior to the garnishment of his wages. In <em>Fuentes, </em>the Court invalidated for the same reasons two state statutes which provided for the replevin of personal property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defendants argue, however, that the holdings of <em>Sniadach </em>and <em>Fuentes </em>should not be extended to apply to real estate attaehments. They say, first, that an attachment of real estate, which effects only a temporary restriction on the owner\u2019s power of alienation, is not a \u201ctaking of property\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, they urge that even if there has been such a taking, the resulting deprivation is nevertheless so insignificant that in view of the state\u2019s interest in protecting creditors\u2019 rights, due process does not require prior notice and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-11\">It is clear, however, that both contentions were met and rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Fuentes. </em>As to defendants\u2019 first point, the <em>Fuentes </em>court first laid to rest the notion that the requirements of due process are limited to the protection of only a few types of property interests. 407 U.S. at 88-90, 92 S.Ct. 1983. Rejecting a narrow reading of <em>Sniadach </em>and Goldberg v. Kelly, <em>supra, </em>which some lower courts had interpreted as requiring a prior hearing only with respect to the deprivation of such \u201cabsolute necessities\u201d of life as wages and welfare benefits,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1169-12\">[I]f the root principle of procedural due process is to be applied with objectivity, it cannot rest on such distinctions. The Fourteenth Amendment speaks of \u201cproperty\u201d generally. And, under our free-enterprise sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>tem, an individual\u2019s choices in the marketplace are respected, however unwise they may seem to someone else. It is not the business of a court adjudicating due process rights to make its own critical evaluation of those choices and protect only the ones that, by its own lights, are \u201cnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>407 U.S. at 90, 92 S.Ct. at 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">The Court noted that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cproperty\u201d \u201chas been read broadly to extend protection to \u2018any significant property interest\u2019, Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. at 379, 91 S.Ct., at 786, 28 L.Ed.2d 113\u201d 407 U.S. at 86, 92 S.Ct. at 1997, and made clear that <em>any </em>significant deprivation of property is within the protection of the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 92 S.Ct. 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">A restriction on the power of a real estate owner to alienate his property is such a deprivation. A real estate attachment under Maine law, while not disturbing possession, creates a lien on the property, Bachelder v. Perley, 53 Me. 414 (1866); Fletcher v. Tuttle, 97 Me. 491, 54 A. 1110 (1903), and effectively deprives the owner of his ability to convey a clear title while the attachment remains outstanding. 4 American Law of Property \u00a7 18.84 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952); 57 A.L.R. 1406-1408 (1928). As the record in the present cases discloses,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> substantial hardship to the defendant may result. It is thus beyond question that an attachment denies the defendant the unrestricted use of his property in a manner which \u201ccannot be characterized as <em>de minimis.\u201d Sniadach, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 342, 89 S.Ct. at 1823 (Harlan, J., concurring). In light of the principles of due process enunciated in <em>Fuentes, </em>it cannot be said that the right of an owner of real estate to alienate his property is not a \u201csignificant property interest,\u201d the deprivation of which is within the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">As to defendant\u2019s second point, the Supreme Court in <em>Fuentes </em>recognized that there are \u201cextraordinary situations\u201d that may justify postponement of notice and a hearing. 407 U.S. at 90, 92 S.Ct. 1983. But it cautioned that such situations \u201cmust be truly unusual.\u201d <em>Idem. See also Sniadach, supra, </em>395 U. S. at 339, 89 S.Ct. 1820. As within the class of \u201cextraordinary situations\u201d justifying outright seizure, the Court noted that an attachment of property without a prior hearing has been allowed when necessary to protect the public against a bank failure (Coffin Bros. v. Bennett, 277 U.S. 29, 48 S.Ct. 422, 72 L.Ed. 768 (1928)), when necessary to secure quasi in rem jurisdiction (Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U.S. 94, 41 S.Ct. 433, 65 L.Ed. 837 (1921)), and when required to protect the public from misbranded drugs. (Ewing v. Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, Inc., 339 U.S. 594, 70 S.Ct. 870, 94 L.Ed. 1088 (1950)) or from contaminated food (North American Storage Co. v. Chicago, 211 U.S. 306, 29 S.Ct. 101, 53 L.Ed. 195 (1908)). 407 U.S. at 91-92, 92 S. Ct. 1983. The Court pointed out, however, that in each such instance an \u201cimportant governmental or general public interest\u201d has been involved; there has been a \u201cspecial need for very prompt action\u201d ; and the seizure has been under the \u201cstrict control\u201d of a government official responsible for administering a \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d statute. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 92 S.Ct. at 2000. None of these conditions are met here. The asserted public interest \u2014 the protection of creditors\u2019 rights \u2014is no different in this case than it was in <em>Sniadach </em>and <em>Fuentes. </em>There will normally be no need for prompt action since the property in question is real estate, which cannot be removed or destroyed, and the Maine statutes are not narrowly drawn to meet any special situation in which the plaintiff could make a showing of immediate danger that a defendant will alienate or otherwise encumber his property. <em>Id. </em>407 U.S. at 91, 92 S.Ct. 1983; <em>Sniadach, supra, </em>395 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>at 339, 89 S.Ct. 1820. Nor does any government official exercise effective state control over the process, which is entirely within the power of the plaintiff and his attorney. <em>See Fuentes, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 91, 92 S.Ct. 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Finally, defendants contend that the present case is controlled by McKay v. McInnes, 279 U.S. 820, 49 S.Ct. 344, 73 L.Ed. 975 (1929), in which the Supreme Court affirmed <em>per curiam </em>and without opinion, on the authority of Ownbey v. Morgan, <em>supra, </em>and Coffin Bros. v. Bennett, <em>supra, </em>a decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, McInnes v. McKay, 127 Me. 110, 141 A. 699 (1928), upholding against due process attack a prejudgment attachment of real estate under. Maine law. The Supreme Court observed in <em>Fuentes, </em>however, that it is not clear what interests were involved in <em>McKay </em>and \u201c[a]s far as essential procedural due process doctrine goes, <em>McKay </em>cannot stand for any more than was established in the <em>Coffin Bros, </em>and <em>Own-bey </em>cases upon which it relied completely.\u201d <em>Fuentes, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 91, n. 23, 92 S.Ct. at 1999. <em>See also, Sniadach, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 343-344, 89 S.Ct. 1820 (Harlan, J., concurring).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Whatever vitality <em>McKay </em>may have today, it certainly does not negate the basic principle declared in <em>Fuentes </em>that any significant deprivation of property within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment must be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that those provisions of Chapter 507 of Title 14, M.R.S.A., and Rule 4A of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure which permit the prejudgment attachment of real estate without prior notice and hearing violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and are hence void and unenforceable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since a retrospective judgment would cast doubt on the validity of all real estate attachments in actions now pending in the Maine courts and would create a cloud on the title to any property hitherto sold pursuant to a real estate attachment, our decree will be prospective only and will have no effect on any attachments, other than the two attachments presently before us, which have been made prior to the date of this opinion. <em>Cf. </em>Schneider v. Margossian, <em>supra, </em>349 F.Supp. at 745.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>The issue of damages will be remanded to Judge Gignoux for hearing and determination.

Schneider v. Margossian, 349 F.Supp. 741 (D.Mass. 1972) ; Trapper Brown Construction Co., Inc. v. Electromech, Inc., 358 F.Supp. 105 (D. N.H.1973). And another three-judge court in this Circuit, in a case involving the attachment of automobiles, has declared unconstitutional a Rhode Island statute permitting such attachments without prior notice and hearing. McClellan v. Commercial Credit Corp., 350 F.Supp. 1013 (D. R.I.1972), aff\u2019d without opinion sub nom. Georges v. McClellan, 409 U.S. 1120, 93 S.Ct. 935, 35 L.Ed.2d 253 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1169-14\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Black Watch Farms, Inc. v. Dick, 323 F.Supp. 100 (D. Conn.1971) (holding that <em>Sniadach </em>was limited to the garnishment of wages and its rationale was not intended to cover real estate attachment procedures).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">. <em>Bee </em>notes 7 and 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">. The Maine court\u2019s opinion in <em>McKay </em>is equally opaque as to the nature of the attachment involved. But it may reasonably be inferred that the attachment in issue was necessary to secure jurisdiction in the state court, since the court notes that \u201c[t]he defendant appeared specially to object to the jurisdiction of the court and filed a plea and motion that the writ and summons be declared null and void.\u201d McInnes v. McKay, <em>supra, </em>127 Me. at 112, 141 A. 699.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">. We note that the only other post-<em>Fuentes </em>court which has specifically considered the constitutional validity of similar provisions for the prejudgment attachment of real estate has arrived at the same conclusion. Idaho First National Bank v. Estate of Al Rogers, 41 U.S.L.W. 2492 (Idaho Dist.Ct. February 21, 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">. Our attention lias been called to a recent, as yet unpublished, opinion of another three-judge court in this Circuit, filed since the argument in these cases, in which the court declined to apply <em>Fuentes </em>retroactively to attachments, including the one before it, made before June 12, 1972, the date <em>Fuentes </em>was decided. Higley Hill, Inc. v. Knight, 360 F.Supp. 203 (D.Mass.1973). The attachment in No. 14-20 was made on February 26, 1973, and would therefore not be affected by such a ruling. Although the attachment in No. 13-117, which was made on March 31, 1972, antedated <em>Fuentes, </em>for reasons stated in the body of this opinion, we do not regard <em>Fuentes </em>as departing from established principles of procedural due process and are not prepared to give that case solely prospective effect. <em>See Fuentes, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 88, 92 S.Ct. 1983; Randone v. Appellate Dept., 5 Cal. 3d 536, 96 Cal.Rptr. 709, 488 P.2d 13, 22 (Cal.1971). Furthermore, to rule that <em>Fuentes </em>is purely prospective is to hold that if a Supreme Court ruling is so characterized, not only may litigants not benefit from its specific application, but courts may not rely on it as precedent for analogous situations where the event in suit antedated the ruling. This we feel would hamper the traditional process of common law adjudication without ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>vancing the pragmatic purposes of retro-activity doctrine. <em>Compare </em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) <em>with </em>Morissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
