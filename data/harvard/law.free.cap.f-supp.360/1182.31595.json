She has resided there since August 1972, prior to which she resided in the State of New York. She was married to respondent, Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>Sosna, on September 5, 1964 in the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">In September 1972, plaintiff instituted marriage dissolution proceedings against respondent, a non-resident, in the District Court of Iowa, Jackson County, pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 598. Iowa Code \u00a7 598.6 (1971),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires a one year Iowa residency by a petitioner when the respondent is a non-resident. By order dated December 27, 1972, the Honorable A. L. Keck, a co-defendant herein, in ruling on a special appearance of respondent, dismissed the petition pursuant to Iowa Code \u00a7 598.9 (1971)<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">Plaintiff now brings this class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, and seeks to have \u00a7\u00a7 598.6 and 598.9 (1971) declared unconstitutional as violative of her right to petition for redress of grievances under the First Amendment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in violation of her right to travel freely from one state to another insofar as it imposes a one year durational residency requirement. She also prays for an injunction against its further applications. A three-judge district court was convened to consider the merits of this cause. <em>See, </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">\u201c[Djurational residence laws must be measured by a strict equal protection test: they are unconstitutional unless the State can demonstrate that such laws are <em>\u2018necessary </em>to promote a <em>compelling </em>governmental interest.\u2019 \u201d Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 342, 92 S.Ct. 995, 1003, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 634, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1331, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-14\">We are not dealing here with the right to vote nor the privilege to receive welfare as involved in <em>Dunn, supra </em>and <em>Shapiro, supra. </em>In <em>Dunn, </em>the Court held that a durational residency requirement imposed under Tennessee law which precluded newcomers from voting was not necessary to further a compelling state interest. With emphasis placed upon the difference between <em>bona fide </em>residence requirements and <em>durational </em>residence requirements, the Court noted that new residents as a group may be less informed relative to state and local issues than older residents, and that durational residency requirements will exclude some uninformed new residents. It concluded, however, that \u201c. . .as devices to limit the franchise to knowledgeable residents, the conclusive presumptions of durational residence requirements are much too crude. . They represent a requirement of knowledge unfairly imposed on only some citizens.\u201d The basic constitutional right to vote, therefore, could not be an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>nulled where the \u201crelationship between the state interest in an informed electorate\u201d and the one year residency requirement demonstrated \u201csimply too attenuated a relationship.\u201d Dunn v. Blumstein, <em>supra, </em>405 U.S. 330, 359-360, 92 S.Ct. 995, 1012 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">In <em>Shapiro, </em>the Court noted that the record reflected \u201cweighty evidence\u201d that the main thrust of the durational residency requirement in issue was to exclude from that jurisdiction the poor who needed or would probably need relief. Shapiro v. Thompson, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. 618, 628, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1328, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969). In declaring the welfare residency requirement unconstitutional, the Court reasoned that implicit in any attempt to restrain potential welfare recipients from entering a state, when the motivating factor of the indigents is to seek higher benefits, is the notion that this class of indigents is \u201cless deserving than indigents who do not take this consideration into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>394 U.S. 618, 631-632, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1330. The net effect of the requirement was the creation of two classes of indigents \u2014 the sole distinction being a residency requirement which denied the newcomers the very means to obtain their subsistence. <em>Id., </em>394 U.S. 618, 627, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">Furthermore, the Court expressly stated in <em>Shapiro </em>that it did not purport to outlaw summarily all duration residency requirements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-6\">\u201cWe imply no view of the validity of waiting-period <em>or </em>residence requirements determining eligibility to vote, eligibility for tuition-free education, to obtain a license to practice a profession, to hunt or fish, and so forth. Such requirements may promote compelling state interests on the one hand, or, on the other, may not be penalties upon the exercise of the constitutional right of interstate travel.\u201d 394 U.S. 618, 638 n. 21, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1333 n. 21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">Unlike voting or welfare, the concept of divorce is not a constitutional right, nor is it a basic necessity to survival. <em>See, </em>Whitehead v. Whitehead, 492 P.2d 939, 945 (Hawaii 1972); <em>accord, </em>Coleman v. Coleman, 32 Ohio St.2d 155, 291 N.E.2d 530, 533 (1972). Divorce is wholly a creature of statute, with the absolute power to prescribe the conditions relative thereto being vested in the state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, </em>Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 734-735, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1877).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">It is significant to note in this connection that the Iowa Dissolution of Marriage Act is based upon a \u201cno-fault\u201d concept of divorce. <em>See, </em>20 Drake L. Rev. 211 (1971). While this innovative reform promotes a more harmonious dissolution of a marital breakdown, <em>cf., </em>In re Marriage of Williams, 199 N.W.2d 339, 342 (Iowa 1972), it was not the intent of the legislature to create in Iowa a virtual sanctuary for transient divorces based upon sham domiciles. To the contrary, Iowa law favors the preservation of marriage whenever possible, as evidenced by the ninety-day conciliation period of the new Iowa act. The period is mandatory unless waived by the court upon a showing of good cause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the deferral period may well foster a re-examination of marriage so that a couple might determine whether the move itself has helped restore tranquility to their estranged relationship. Place v. Place, 129 Vt. 326, 278 A.2d 710, 711-712 (1971); <em>accord, </em>Coleman v. Coleman, <em>supra, </em>32 Ohio St.2d 155, 291 N.E.2d 530, 535 (1972). It also serves to discourage Iowa from unnecessarily interfering with a marital relationship between non-residents in which it has no interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">Based upon the foregoing, with particular consideration being given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>the power of a state to regulate its own laws governing marriage and its dissolution, Pennoyer v. Neff, <em>supra, </em>95 U.S. 714, 734-735, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1877); <em>accord, </em>Boddie v. Connecticut, <em>supra, </em>401 U.S. 371, 376, 91 S.Ct. 780, 785, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), we are convinced that Iowa\u2019s interest in establishing a one-year deferral period<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is sufficiently compelling to render \u00a7\u00a7 598.6 and 598.9 of the 1971 Iowa Code constitutionally permissible.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">.

In my view the majority\u2019s analysis of the constitutional issues involved is deficient. They incorrectly restrict the right to travel rationale, improperly apply the strict equal protection test and ignore the due process/access to the courts argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">Citing Dunn v. Blumstein and Shapiro v. Thompson, <em>supra, </em>the majority concedes that durational residence requirements must be \u201cmeasured by a strict equal protection test.\u201d From that point, however, the thrust of the opinion seems to be an attempt to distinguish the residence laws at issue in <em>Dunn </em>and <em>Shapiro </em>from that at issue here. Great emphasis is placed upon the fact that <em>Dunn </em>involved the right to vote and <em>Shapiro </em>the right to welfare benefits, while this case involves only divorce, \u201cnot a constitutional right, nor ... a basic necessity to survival.\u201d The purpose of this distinction is unclear, but it appears to be a justification for utilizing some unidentified test, less stringent than strict equal protection. Although the majority does offer several purportedly \u201ccompelling\u201d justifications for the discriminatory classifications inherent in section 598.6 of the Iowa Code, the record is devoid of evidence to support these justifications, since the state produced absolutely no evidence. See <em>Dunn, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 346, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274. Also the majority never expressly recognizes the necessity for considering less onerous alternatives when applying the \u201cstrict equal protection test.\u201d Accordingly, I deem it necessary to set forth what I consider to be the appropriate constitutional analysis mandated by the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">It can no longer be disputed that the right to unhindered interstate travel and settlement, in and of itself, is a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution of the United States. Dunn v. Blumstein, <em>supra, </em>at 338, 92 S.Ct. 995 (1972); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 237, 91 S.Ct. 260, 27 L.Ed.2d 272 (separate opinion of Brennan, White and Marshall, JJ.), 285-286 (Stewart, J., concurring and dissenting, with whom Burger, C. J., and Blackmun, J., joined) (1970). Shapiro v. Thompson, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 629-631, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969); United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 758, 86 S.Ct. 1170, 16 L.Ed.2d 239 (1966). It is also clear that section 598.6 of the Iowa Code is a durational residence requirement which penalizes only petitioners who have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>cently exercised the right to interstate migration. The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Dunn </em>and <em>Shapiro </em>seems unfounded in view of the explicit language in <em>Dunn </em>wherein the court stated that \u201cwhether we look to the benefit withheld by the classification (the opportunity to vote) or the basis for the classification (recent interstate travel) we conclude that the State must show a substantial and compelling reason for imposing durational residence requirements.\u201d <em>Id, </em>405 U.S. at 335, 92 S.Ct. at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">The standard, therefore, that must be applied in determining the constitutionality of sections 598.6 and 598.9 of the Iowa Code (1971) is the strict equal protection test. Under this test the burden is on the state to demonstrate that (1) the classification serves a compelling state interest, and (2) that no less restrictive alternatives are available to the state. As the court stated in <em>Dunn, </em>\u201cIt is not sufficient for the State to show that durational residence requirements further a very substantial state interest. In pursuing that important interest, the State cannot choose means that unnecessarily burden or restrict constitutionally protected activity.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 343, 92 S.Ct. at 1003; see Oregon v. Mitchell, <em>supra, </em>400 U.S. at 237, 239, 91 S.Ct. 260; Shapiro v. Thompson, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 634-638, 89 S.Ct. 1322; N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1962); Wymelenberg v. Syman, 328 F.Supp. 1353 (E.D.Wisc.1971). <em>See also </em>Whitehead v. Whitehead, 492 P.2d 939, 948 (Hawaii 1972) (Levinson, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">As the first \u201ccompelling\u201d justification for section 598.6, the majority has found that it serves to prevent Iowa from becoming \u201ca virtual sanctuary for transient divorces based upon sham domiciles.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This finding completely avoids the basic issue. Admittedly, Iowa has a legitimate interest in not becoming a \u201cdivorce mill.\u201d The critical question, however, is whether this interest is served by denying bona fide resients of the state the right to seek a dissolution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In creating an irrebuttable presumption against recently arrived residents, the Iowa law sweeps too broadly since there are less restrictive alternatives available to the state. In my opinion, the Iowa judiciary is perfectly competent to determine whether the residence of a petitioner has been maintained in good faith and not for the purpose of obtaining a dissolution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>Neither the specter of perjury nor the argument for administrative convenience is supportive of the majority\u2019s position or sufficient to justify the durational residence requirement in question. See Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (June 1973); Dunn, <em>supra, </em>405 U.S. at 345-354, 92 S.Ct. 995; Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 381-382, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971); Shapiro, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 633, 89 S.Ct. 1322; Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L.Ed.2d 675 (1965). As stated in Dunn, <em>supra, </em>405 U.S. at 351-352, 92 S.Ct. at 1007-1008,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-5\">\u201cThe State\u2019s legitimate purpose is to determine whether certain persons in the community are bona fide residents. A durational residence requirement creates a classification that may, in a crude way, exclude nonresidents from that group. But it also excludes many residents. Given the State\u2019s legitimate purpose and the individual interests that are affected, the classification is all too imprecise. In general, it is not very difficult for Tennessee to determine on an individualized basis whether one recently arrived in the community is in fact a resident, although of course there will always be difficult cases. But since Tennessee s presumption from failure to meet the durational residence requirements is conclusive, a showing of actual bona fide residence is irrelevant, even though such a showing would fully serve the State\u2019s purposes embodied in the presumption and would achieve those purposes with far less drastic impact on constitutionally protected interests.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">With regard to the other reasons advanced by the majority in support of \u00a7 598.6, I am convinced that they do not serve any compelling state interest. Initially, the majority states that the one-year \u201cdeferral period may well foster a re-examination of marriage so that a couple might determine whether the move itself has helped restore tranquility to their estranged relationship.\u201d This reasoning, however, completely ignores the fact that \u00a7 598.6 requires a one-year residency of a petitioner only in the limited situation where the respondent does not reside in Iowa.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is difficult to conceive how \u201ca couple might determine whether the move itself has helped restore tranquility to their estranged relationship\u201d when in fact they are living in different states. The majority\u2019s argument would be more plausible had the state seen fit to impose a one-year deferral period where both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>the petitioner and the respondent are residents of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">The final state interest advanced by the majority is that the one-year deferral period \u201cserves to discourage Iowa from unnecessarily interfering with a marital relationship between non-residents in which it has no interest.\u201d This argument, however, ignores the fact that in the case of a bona fide resident, the state does have an interest in the marriage relationship regardless of whether the petitioner has been in Iowa for one year. Additionally, the argument ignores the fact that Iowa imposes no one-year deferral period in the situation where the respondent has recently moved to Iowa and the petitioner still lives in another state. The unnecessary interference in that situation, if any, would appear to be no different than in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Finally, the majority has ignored the due process/access to the courts concept enunciated in Boddie v. Connecticut, supra. Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention that \u201cdivorce is wholly a creature of statute, with the absolute power to prescribe the conditions relative thereto being vested in the state\u201d, and recognizing that marriage is a fundamental human relationship involving interests of basic importance in our society, the court in <em>Boddie </em>held that a state may not, consistent with the obligations imposed by the Due Process Clause, deny one class of citizens access to the procedures for adjusting that relationship, absent a showing by the State of a sufficient countervailing justification for that denial. Boddie, <em>supra, </em>401 U.S. at 380, 91 S.Ct. 780; Wymelenberg v. Syman, <em>supra; </em>Whitehead v. Whitehead, <em>supra. </em>As with the filing fee requirement in <em>Boddie, </em>the durational residence requirement of \u00a7 598.6 denies one class of citizens access to the only procedure available for obtaining a dissolution. As a result, the state must show a sufficient countervailing justification for its restriction on plaintiff\u2019s right to access to the courts to dissolve her marriage, which it totally failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">For the above reasons I am of the view that the state has shown no sufficient countervailing justification to support its one-year residence requirement in light of the alternatives available.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">. The limited classification which \u00a7 598.6 creates also appears violative of the Equal Protection Clause due to its arbitrary imposition of a one-year residency requirement where the petitioner is a resident and the respondent is not, without imposing the same requirement in similar situations such as where the respondent resides in Iowa and the petitioner does not. <em>See </em>United States Dep\u2019t. of Agriculture v. Moreno, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2821, 37 L.Ed.2d 782 (1973). The arbitrariness of the scheme is illustrated by the ease with which divorces can be obtained under the present statute through the use of sham residences. For example, \u201cif both parties desire the divorce and are willing to co-operate, it is possible to avoid the establishment of \u2018residence\u2019 in Iowa. . . . All that the parties need do is falsify their petition for divorce to the effect that the defendant is a resident of the state \u2014 a statement which the Iowa courts apparently are unwilling to scrutinize.\u201d Note, Some Problems Under Iowa\u2019s Judicial Jurisdiction Statutes, 48 Iowa L.Rev. 968, 982 (1963). Additionally, without needing to falsify the petition, the respondent could actually move into Iowa and the petitioner could immediately file for divorce even though not a resident. Thus, in addition to being violative of the Equal Protection Clause due to its arbitrariness, \u00a7 598.6 also appears to make Iowa subject to becoming a \u201cdivorce mill\u201d even with its one-year residency requirement in the limited situation before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1266-12\">. It is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff is a bona fide resident of the state and not here merely for the purpose of obtaining a marriage dissolution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">. Adequate protection would be afforded by limiting access to dissolution to those who are permanent or bona fide residents or domiciliaries of the state, meaning those physically present in the state with intent to make it their home. The burden to establish such would be on the petitioner. <em>See Dunn, supra, </em>at 343-354, 92 S.Ct. 995. \u201cESjuch objective indicia of bona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>fide residence as a dwelling, car registration, or driver\u2019s license,\u201d among other things, provide an adequate basis for a judicial determination of bona fide residence. <em>Dunn, supra, </em>at 352, 92 S.Ct. at 1008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">. Although it has not been urged by the plaintiff, it appears that the \u201cirrebuttable presumption\u201d created by section 598.6 is also subject to attack on due process grounds in view of Vlandis v. Kline, <em>supra. See also </em>Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) ; Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971) ; Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U.S. 312, 52 S.Ct. 358, 76 L.Ed. 772 (1932). Speaking for the majority, Justice Stewart found that a \u201cpermanent irrebutable presumption of nonresidence ... is violative of the Due Process Clause, because it provides no opportunity for students ... to demonstrate that they have become bona fide . . . residents. The State can establish such reasonable criteria for instate status as to make virtually certain that students who are not, in fact, bona fide residents of the State, but who have come there solely for educational purposes, cannot take advantage of the in-state rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">Although the \u201cirrebuttable presumption\u201d in this case is not permanent but only for one year, the state\u2019s denial of any opportunity to demonstrate bona fide residence appears violative of the due process clause in view of the other alternatives available to the state. <em>See Dunn, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 352, 92 S.Ct. 995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1267-15\">. \u00a7 598.6 requires a one-year residency of a petitioner \u201c[e]xeept where respondent is a resident of this state and is served by personal service, ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
