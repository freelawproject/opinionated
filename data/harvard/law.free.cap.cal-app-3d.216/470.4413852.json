J.</author>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">After a contested hearing on a supplemental petition, the juvenile court found that the minor Edwardo L. (1) committed an assault with a deadly weapon during which he intentionally inflicted great bodily injury (count 1, Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a), 12022.7); (2) committed misdemeanor vandalism (count 2, Pen. Code, \u00a7 594, subd. (b)(3)); and (3) violated a previous probationary order by these two new offenses (count 3). The court committed Edwardo to the California Youth Authority (YA) for a maximum term of seven years and eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The primary issue on appeal is whether the court\u2019s failure to find at the jurisdictional hearing that the prior disposition has been ineffective in rehabilitating the minor (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 777)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prevents the court from computing the maximum period of confinement on the basis of aggregated terms for prior sustained section 602 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">We conclude a rehabilitative ineffectiveness finding is not necessary where the court does not expressly modify a former commitment but instead \u201cimposes a different and more onerous disposition,\u201d specifically an aggregated term, based on a new criminal offense alleged in a supplemental section 602 petition. However, the petition and jurisdictional hearing must comport with the due process mandates of <em>In re Michael B. </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 548 [169 Cal.Rptr. 723, 620 P.2d 173],</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we conclude the case must be remanded because the court failed to make the necessary express finding as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to whether count 1 was a felony or a misdemeanor and incorrectly calculated the maximum period of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">A detailed recitation of the facts is unnecessary in light of the issues posed, and the following summary will suffice. On October 15, 1987, about 9 p.m., several Mexican males carrying baseball bats, pipes or similar weapons broke into a Tulare County home. The three youths broke windows, and one, later identified as Edwardo, hit a four-month-old baby on the head causing serious injury. Edwardo had been involved in an altercation with the baby\u2019s father a few days earlier and had threatened, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d Edwardo denied involvement in the house break-in and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">I. <em>The court may aggregate the period of physical confinement on previously sustained section 602 petitions without finding that previous dispositions were rehabilitatively ineffective.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Edwardo\u2019s petition, entitled \u201cSupplemental Petition,\u201d alleged that Edwardo came within the provisions of sections 602/777, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the juvenile court law of California. The petition prefaced the specific allegations with the assertion, \u201cThe previous orders of this court have not been effective in the rehabilitation of the above named person in that: . . The petition then alleged the assault, vandalism and violation of probation counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">At the conclusion of the jurisdictional hearing, the court found Edwardo had committed the two new offenses and thereby violated the terms of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>probation. The court did not find at either the jurisdictional or dispositional hearing that its previous order had been ineffective in rehabilitating the minor. At the dispositional hearing, the court committed Edwardo to YA for seven years and two months for the two most recent offenses, plus six months for previously sustained petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Section 726 permits aggregation of the maximum period of confinement on the current offense by use of \u201cpreviously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within Section 602.\u201d (\u00a7 726, subd. (c).) The section does not specify, however, what procedures the court must follow in order to aggregate the terms.  The question presented by this appeal is: when the court proceeds against a minor on new offenses under section 602, must it make a finding of rehabilitative ineffectiveness pursuant to section 777 before it can use the prior offenses to aggregate the term of commitment?</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>In re Ronald W. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 199, 204, 205 [220 Cal.Rptr. 557], we held that where a prior dispositional order imposing a maximum time of confinement is used to aggregate the maximum time of confinement on the current offense, compliance with both section 602 and section 777, subdivision (a), was required, including an express finding by the court that the prior order was ineffective in rehabilitating the minor. <em>In re Martin L. </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 534 [232 Cal.Rptr. 43] questioned this conclusion: \u201cWe question whether such a finding is necessary under <em>[In re]Michael B. [supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 548] where the court does not expressly <em>modify </em>a former commitment as opposed to [imposing] \u2018 \u201ca different and more onerous disposition [ ]based on a new criminal offense.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Martin L., supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 543.) Accordingly, we take another look <em>at Michael B. </em>and conclude that when the court seeks to aggregate terms in a section 602 proceeding, the crucial requirements are notice to the minor of the possibility of aggregation based on his prior offenses, adequate time to prepare his defense, and a meaningful opportunity to be heard to rebut any derogatory material relating to his prior record rather than compliance with section 777 supplemental petition procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Hearing was granted in <em>Michael B. </em>to resolve a conflict between Court of Appeal opinions. <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 551.) <em>In re Richard W. </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 960 [155 Cal.Rptr. 11] held if a supplemental petition is not filed under section 777, a minor\u2019s record of sustained petitions could be considered in making an appropriate disposition for the current offense, but not in aggregating the period of confinement. Thus, when the People proceed under a section 602 petition, the court is limited to fixing a maximum period of confinement based on the new offense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 978.) <em>In re Ruben M. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 690 [158 Cal.Rptr. 197] parted company with <em>Richard W. </em>and held that when a new petition is filed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>section 602 an additional petition under section 777 is not required in order to include prior cases in the aggregate maximum term of commitment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The petition filed in <em>Michael B. </em>alleged that Michael came within the provisions of section 602 because he had committed a forgery. Michael admitted the allegation and was committed to YA for three years for the forgery, plus an additional two years and four months for previously sustained offenses. <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 551.) Michael appealed claiming that the failure to file a supplemental petition under section 777 prevented the court from using aggregated terms for prior offenses in computing his maximum period of confinement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The Supreme Court noted that section <em>111 </em>requires the filing of a supplemental petition to change or modify a prior disposition by removing the minor from the physical custody of his parents or by placing him in more restrictive custody. The court concluded, \u201cBefore the previous dispositional order may be modified, the court must make an express finding the previous order in fact has been rehabilitatively ineffective.\u201d (28 Cal.3d at pp. 552-553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The court continued, \u201cAfter a new petition is sustained under section 602, on the other hand, the court may consider the juvenile\u2019s entire record before exercising its discretion at the dispositional hearing and may rely on prior sustained section 602 petitions in determining the proper disposition and maximum period of confinement. [Citations.] Section 726, which permits aggregation of terms in computing that period, expressly authorizes aggregation on the basis of prior sustained section 602 petitions but does not sanction consideration of prior section <em>111 </em>petitions for this purpose. A practice has developed, therefore, of filing new section 602 petitions, rather than section <em>111 </em>supplemental petitions, to charge new offenses even when the minor is already a section 602 ward. [Citation.] This practice is not contrary to law. <em>Although section 777recites that a \u2018supplementalpetition\u2019 is required in order to change or modify a previous order by removing the minor from his parents\u2019 custody or by directing his commitment to the Youth Authority, a section 777 petition is not the exclusive method of initiating proceedings calling for such a change or modification. </em>As stated in a recent case it is \u2018clear that the proposers of section <em>111 </em>did not contemplate that that section must, necessarily, be utilized in cases . . . where a different and more onerous disposition is to be based on a new criminal offense.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, <em>section 726 authorizes the court in a section 602 proceeding to \u2018aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple counts, or multiple petitions, including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within Section 602 . . . .\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cWe have decided, however, that where the prior offenses are to be considered to aggregate the maximum term to extend it beyond that which could be imposed for the new offense, due process requires notice of the juvenile court\u2019s intention in order to provide the minor with a meaningful opportunity to rebut any derogatory material within its prior record. [Citations.] Further, in compliance with the <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>protections afforded a minor [citation], the legislative intent embodied within the Juvenile Court Law and the pertinent California Rules of Court mandate the advising of a minor of the possible consequences of the pending petition, including generally the possibility of aggregation and specifically \u2018the maximum period of physical confinement, at the detention or jurisdictional hearing, or at some point before an admission is accepted or a contested jurisdictional hearing commences.\u2019 [Citations.] Thus, <em>we conclude that a petition under section 602 must contain notice of the intent to rely upon previous sustained petitions under section 602, in order to aggregate the maximum period of confinement on the basis of those petitions. </em>(See <em>In re Richard W., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d at p. 978.)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] To the extent contrary to this conclusion, <em>In re Ruben M\u201e supra, 96 </em>Cal.App.3d at pages 697-698, is hereby disapproved.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Absent the filing of a petition containing such notice, the court is limited to the maximum period of confinement of the new offense(s) set forth in the section 602 petition.\u201d <em>(In re Michael B\u201e supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 553-554, brackets omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Applying these rules to Michael\u2019s case, the court held he was denied due process. He was not given adequate notice that his maximum term of confinement could be aggregated on the basis of his prior offenses. Nor was he told of the effect of his plea on his previously sustained section 602 petitions. Thus, he was deprived of notice of the possibility of aggregation based on his prior offenses, adequate time to prepare his defense, and a meaningful opportunity to be heard to rebut any derogatory material relating to his prior record. The court concluded, \u201cDue process mandates the remanding of this matter to the juvenile court \u2018for redetermination of the maximum permissible term of physical confinement by means of procedures which give fair notice to the minor and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>We note that the order did not specify that \u201cfair notice\u201d of the intent to aggregate required compliance with section 777. The court chose a constitutional rather than a statutory route to the notice requirement. (See <em>In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 559 (dis. opn. of Bird, C.J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The portion of <em>Michael B. </em>set out above can only mean that in a section 602 proceeding, section 726 permits the court to aggregate the period of physical confinement on previously sustained section 602 petitions. A section 777 petition need not be filed if, pursuant to the section 602 petition, the court intends to impose a different and more onerous disposition based on the new criminal offense rather than to modify an earlier disposition because it has been ineffective. However, the court cannot impose a more onerous disposition in the form of a term aggregated by previously sustained petitions unless the new section 602 petition notifies the minor of the court\u2019s intent to do so and the minor is afforded an opportunity to rebut derogatory material in the record which the court may consider in imposing an aggregated term.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Had the court\u2019s discussion ended with the above quoted material, the law would be clear. However, the court added: \u201cIt has been suggested that this procedure would require the filing of both a section 777 supplemental petition and a section 602 petition when a new offense has been committed and thereby necessitate \u2018two hearings,\u2019 resulting in a \u2018duplication of effort,\u2019 as well as \u2018confusion or even inconsistent results.\u2019 [Citation.] Yet no compelling reason appears why separate petitions or duplicative hearings should be required under the rule we announce. So long as the minor is given the requisite <em>notice </em>of the intent to rely upon the minor\u2019s prior offense or offenses or upon the ineffectiveness of prior dispositions in order to enhance the maximum period of YA commitment for the current offense, the issues may be presented in a single unitary petition which contains the requisite allegations, and may be disposed of in the course of a single proceeding otherwise conforming to law. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 554, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cunitary petition\u201d is confusing. The term might mean a joint section 602/777 petition with the necessary allegations of each. However, the term might also mean a petition under section 602 which includes the requisite section 602 allegations as well as the notice of intent to aggregate allegations. The second interpretation is persuasive in light of the court\u2019s use of the disjunctive: \u201cSo long as the minor is given the requisite notice of the intent to rely upon the minor\u2019s prior offense or offenses <em>or </em>upon the ineffectiveness of prior dispositions in order to enhance the maximum period of YA commitment for the current offense, the issues may be presented in a single unitary petition which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>contains the requisite allegations, . . .\u201d <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 554, italics in original omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><em>Michael B. </em>\u2019s footnote 2 also creates confusion. The Supreme Court summarized the law surrounding section <em>111 </em>and ended the discussion with: \u201cBefore the previous dispositional order may be modified, the court must make an express finding the previous order in fact has been rehabilitatively ineffective. [Citations.]\u201d (28 Cal.3d at pp. 552-553.) The sentence was footnoted: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s failure to do so here further mandates a limited reversal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553, fn. 2.) The court proceeded against Michael by a section 602 petition. A section <em>111 </em>petition was not filed in connection with his case. Thus, footnote 2 can be interpreted to mean that even under a section 602 proceeding, the court must make a finding of rehabilitative ineffectiveness before it aggregates time remaining on previously sustained section 602 petitions with confinement time imposed for the new offense. We conclude, however, that footnote 2 must be disregarded in light of the court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As set out above, <em>Michael B. </em>expressly held that a section <em>777 </em>petition is not the exclusive method of initiating proceedings for a change or modification of commitment. (28 Cal.3d at p. 553.) The juvenile court may proceed under a supplemental section 602 petition and consider prior offenses to aggregate the maximum term under section 726 if it provides adequate notice of its intention to do so and gives the minor a meaningful opportunity to rebut any derogatory material within his or her prior record. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\"><em>Michael B. </em>contrasts section 602 proceedings with section <em>111 </em>proceedings. The discussion of aggregation of terms in section 602 proceedings does not include a rehabilitative ineffectiveness pleading or finding requirement. Rather the court concludes \u201ca petition under section 602 must contain notice of the intent to rely upon previous sustained petitions under section 602, in order to aggregate the maximum period of confinement on the basis of those petitions. [Citation.] . . . Absent the filing of a petition containing such notice, the court is limited to the maximum period of confinement of the new offense(s) set forth in the section 602 petition.\u201d (28 Cal.3d at p. 554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Thus, the body of the <em>Michael B. </em>opinion authorizes the juvenile court, upon proper notice, to aggregate the term of confinement on previously sustained section 602 petitions after a new petition is sustained under section 602. Unlike section <em>111, </em>section 726 does not require an allegation or finding of rehabilitative ineffectiveness in order to aggregate terms. Moreover, given the court\u2019s holding that the crucial element is notice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>minor of <em>either </em>the court\u2019s intent to rely on the minor\u2019s prior offenses <em>or </em>on the rehabilitative ineffectiveness of prior dispositions (28 Cal.3d at p. 554), footnote 2 makes no sense unless it means failure to make an express finding of rehabilitative ineffectiveness is reversible error only if the court proceeds under section 777 rather than section 602. (See, e.g., <em>In re Reynaldo R. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 250, 255 [150 Cal.Rptr. 71].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Accordingly, when a minor who is already a ward of the court under section 602 commits a new criminal offense, the People can proceed against the minor by way of a section 602 proceeding. If prior sustained petitions are to be used to compute the maximum confinement time to which the minor may be subject, the People must give the minor notice in the petition of the intent to aggregate terms based on previously sustained petitions. <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 553-554.) The court also must provide the minor with an opportunity to rebut any derogatory material in his prior record. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In this case, the petition alleged Edwardo came within both section 602 and section <em>111, </em>but the court proceeded as if only a section 602 petition had been filed. Since, under <em>Michael B\u201e </em>the court could proceed pursuant to section 602 and aggregate the maximum term of confinement with prior sustained petitions provided it gave the necessary notice to the minor, the court\u2019s failure to acknowledge the section <em>111 </em>allegations and to make a rehabilitative ineffectiveness finding in this case was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The petition notified Edwardo that \u201cany previously sustained petition can be used by the Court in aggregating the total amount of time the minor can be removed from the custody of his parents.\u201d The petition then listed the three previous offenses and the maximum confinement time available on each.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petition satisfied the due process notice requirements of <em>Michael B. </em>Consequently, pursuant to the section 602 proceeding, the court properly imposed a more onerous disposition and an aggregated period of confinement without making an express finding that the prior disposition had been ineffective in rehabilitating the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The judgment insofar as it finds true the allegations of count 2 is reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss count 2 and to vacate the two-month confinement time imposed on that count. The court is also directed to make the necessary section 702 misdemeanor or felony finding. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Best, J., and Baxter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 5, 1990, and appellant\u2019s petition for a review by the Supreme Court was denied February 21, 1990.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-14\">All statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">Section 602 provides: \u201cAny person who is under the age of 18 years when he violates any law of this state or of the United States or any ordinance of any city or county of this state defining crime other than an ordinance establishing a curfew based solely on age, is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge such person to be a ward of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">Section 777 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn order changing or modifying a previous order by removing a minor from the physical custody of a parent, guardian, relative, or friend and directing placement in a foster home, or commitment to a private institution or commitment to a county institution, or an order changing or modifying a previous order by directing commitment to the Youth Authority shall be made only after noticed hearing upon a supplemental petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">\u201c(a) The supplemental petition shall be filed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-16\">\u0485\u0485\u201c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-17\">\u201c(2) ...
