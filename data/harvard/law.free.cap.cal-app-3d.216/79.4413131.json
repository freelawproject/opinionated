Proc., \u00a7 581, subd. (f)(1)). The judgment followed the trial court\u2019s order sustaining a demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint without leave to amend. Plaintiffs had alleged causes of action for employment discrimination, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and .loss of consortium. The court found workers\u2019 compensation was the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive remedy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">The following is a summary of the allegations contained in the second amended complaint:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">First Cause of Action\u2014Employment Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">Plaintiff Mary Meninga was employed at two Raley\u2019s stores, owned by defendant Raley\u2019s, Inc., in Modesto between February 1976 and November 1985. During this period she experienced harassment at the hands of Raley\u2019s employees and managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">In 1976, an assistant manager instructed an employee to announce over the store\u2019s loud speaker \u201c \u2018All right you stupid bitches, get your asses up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>front cause [sic] we[\u2019re] closing this place up.\u2019\u201d The announcement was directed at plaintiff and another female employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In 1977 a Raley\u2019s store manager and the employer\u2019s personnel department denied her pregnancy leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">From late spring 1984 until the time she became disabled, defendant Ralph Boisa, a manager in one of the two stores in question, continually harassed and intimidated plaintiff by referring to her as a \u201c \u2018bitch.\u2019 \u201d He also told her: \u201c \u2018[W]omen should not work in the grocery business and if they do, they should only be allowed to work part time.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Defendant Raley\u2019s, Inc., chose to do nothing when plaintiff reported these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Defendant Boisa and another store manager, defendant Wayne Clemens, also condoned and encouraged other employees\u2019 mistreatment of plaintiff. In March 1985, a head clerk in one of the stores said in front of plaintiff, \u201c \u2018Why is it this office only smells like fish when Mary is here.\u2019 \u201d The clerk uttered the comment in a sexually degrading and offensive manner to refer to feminine body odor. The following May, an assistant store manager repeatedly asked plaintiff to go to a party with him. When she refused, he became very abrasive toward her. He also sprayed \u201c \u2018static cling\u2019 \u201d on plaintiff\u2019s buttocks in a degrading and offensive manner and threatened to assault her.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Plaintiff was repeatedly told defendant Boisa did not like working with women and she \u201chad better\u201d do everything he said. Defendant Boisa had directed others to pass these comments on to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Last, during November 1985, defendant Clemens told plaintiff he would not hire women with children in the future because he had to make special arrangements for them. He also stated he did not hire plaintiff, referring to the fact plaintiff was female and had small children.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">As a result of such conduct, plaintiff experienced severe emotional problems. She felt forced to leave her employment in November 1985, at which time she was hospitalized, according to the record. Since then she has been unable to perform her duties at the stores. Plaintiff filed a claim with the Fair Employment and Housing Commission and ultimately received a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Second Cause of Action\u2014Defamation</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In early 1986, after plaintiff Mary Meninga left Raley\u2019s workplace, defendants Clemens and Boisa told store employees \u201c \u2018Mary Meninga has completely lost her mind, she has gone crazy, but then she always was crazy.\u2019 \u201d A bookkeeper for the chain also repeated remarks made by defendant Clemens to the effect \u201cplaintiff was totally insane and [would] be institutionalized for life.\u201d These remarks were unsolicited and made to employees who did not have a need to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The remarks injured plaintiff\u2019s professional reputation by suggesting she was unable to practice her trade in a proficient manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Third Cause of Action\u2014Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">This cause of action is based on the alleged remarks referred to in the second cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Fourth Cause of Action\u2014Loss of Consortium</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Plaintiff William Meninga suffered the loss of plaintiff Mary Meninga\u2019s society as a result of the slanderous remarks made by defendants Clemens and Boisa in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Is the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act the Exclusive Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">for the Employment Discrimination, Defamation and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Causes of</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">Action?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">I. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">We answer the stated question in the negative as to each cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">In <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 160 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743], the state Supreme Court held an employee may not pursue a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against his or her employer and fellow employees when: (a) the alleged misconduct is a normal part of the employment relationship; and (b) the essence of the wrong is a personal physical injury or death thus permit-ting a remedy under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Such an action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>regardless of its name or technical form, is barred by the exclusive remedy provision under workers\u2019 compensation (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3601, subd. (a)) if the usual conditions of workers\u2019 compensation coverage are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Defendants ask this court to conclude <em>Cole </em>is dispositive in the present case. Because plaintiff alleged she was unable to return to work due to the emotional distress she experienced while in defendant Raley\u2019s employ, defendants argue, plaintiff suffers from a work-related disability. Thus, by defendants\u2019 reading of <em>Cole, </em>plaintiff\u2019s causes of action are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As explained below, <em>Cole, </em>by its own terms, does not necessarily bar employment discrimination actions filed outside the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Consequently, we hold, under the alleged facts of this case, defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiff\u2019s causes of action are barred by the exclusive remedy provision in Labor Code section 3601, subdivision (a) is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">II. <em>Employment Discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The <em>Cole </em>court did not address statutory causes of action, but rather only common law causes of action. \u201cWe do not decide whether the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code bar causes of action created by statute.\u201d <em>(Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 157, fn. 9.) As the appellate court in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Community College Dist. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 794, 807 [244 Cal.Rptr. 37], ruled, <em>Cole </em>by its own limitation is not dispositive of claims based on statutory causes of actions, such as the employment discrimination cause of action created by the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA or the Act) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notably, defendants overlook the holding of <em>Jones, </em>to the effect workers\u2019 compensation did not bar a FEHA cause of action for employment discrimination based, in that case, on race. However, the <em>Jones </em>court did not go so far as to hold that the principles and distinctions set out in <em>Cole </em>could never apply to alleged employment discrimination causes of action. Likewise, we do not conclude that acts alleged to constitute employment discrimination are thereby inherently insulated from consideration in connection with the exclusive remedies provided under workers\u2019 compensation. The Supreme Court in <em>Cole </em>stated: \u201cWe have concluded that, when the misconduct attributed to the employer is actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as demotions, promotions, criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances, an employee suffering emotional distress causing disability may not avoid the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code by characterizing the employer\u2019s decisions as manifestly unfair, outrageous, harassment, or intended to cause emotional disturbance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>resulting in disability. The basis of compensation and the exclusive remedy provisions is an injury sustained and arising out of the course of employment (former Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3600, 3601), and then the essence of the wrong is personal physical injury or death, the action is barred by the exclusiveness clause no matter what its name or technical form if the usual conditions of coverage are satisfied. (See Larson, <em>Nonphysical Torts and Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>(1975) 12 Cal. Western L.Rev. 1, 11-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u201cIf characterization of conduct normally occurring in the workplace as unfair or outrageous were sufficient to avoid the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code, the exception would permit the employee to allege a cause of action in every case where he suffered mental disability merely by alleging an ulterior purpose of causing injury. Such an exception would be contrary to the compensation bargain and unfair to the employer.\u201d <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We conclude some deference must be given to the Supreme Court\u2019s concerns expressed in <em>Cole </em>even though it did footnote it was not deciding \u201cwhether the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code bar causes of action created by statute.\u201d Some of our concern arises out of the differing fact situations found in <em>Jones </em>and the instant case. The court in <em>Jones </em>stated: \u201cIn the context of the facts of this case, where plaintiff claims that he was forced to suffer racial insults of a coworker and in retaliation for complaining of such treatment was monitored in his work and given more onerous tasks while the White coworker simply stayed away from work, and where he ultimately suffered a knee injury which apparently caused him to become disabled, the application of the exclusivity provision of the Labor Code would in effect result in no recognition of or compensation for the humiliation and other injuries which Jones suffered before his knee injury. A failure to recognize a cause of action under such circumstances also furthers a policy in <em>favor </em>of discrimination in the workplace. Because two separate wrongs are involved, there are no election of remedies or double recovery problems. Moreover, any possible double recovery in the instant case can easily be avoided.\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Community College Dist., supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 809.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The plaintiff in <em>Jones </em>first filed two claims with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board alleging injury to his \u201cemotions (psyche)\u201d due to \u201crepetitive occupational stresses.\u201d Each claim covered a different period of time. Slightly over one year later he filed a third claim with the board wherein he claimed injury to his left knee. In the meantime, Jones filed a charge of discrimination with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in which he claimed racial harassment and other unfair treatment. The DFEH later notified Jones his case was being closed \u201con the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>basis of insufficient evidence to prove violation of the statute.\u201d Some months later, he filed his complaint in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County alleging race discrimination in employment. Under these facts, the court stated: \u201cWe do not read the complaint as alleging plaintiff\u2019s emotional injuries will render him disabled, but only that his <em>physical </em>injuries will result in disability. Thus, even were we to find <em>Cole </em>applicable to the instant case, as urged by respondents, we would conclude that they did not meet their burden of proof on summary judgment to establish that the conditions of compensation rendering them subject to the protections of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes existed. <em>(Doney </em>v. <em>Tambouratgis </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 91, 97-98 [151 Cal.Rptr. 347, 587 P.2d 1160].) As expounded in <em>Cole, </em>one of those conditions is that plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress caused him disability. The record is bereft of any evidence as to whether plaintiff\u2019s disability was caused by his knee injury or by his emotional injuries. Nor is there any evidence establishing whether the workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to plaintiff were on account of his knee injury or for his emotional injuries. In this regard, we find no evidentiary support for the conclusions reached by the trial court, . . .\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Community College Dist., supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 806, fn. omitted, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In this case there is no claim for a physical injury like the knee in the <em>Jones </em>case. We, therefore, cannot say the record is bereft of any evidence as to whether plaintiff\u2019s disability was caused by emotional injuries or purely physical injury. Plaintiff has unquestionably received workers\u2019 compensation benefits due solely to emotional injury resulting from the discriminatory treatment she alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We, therefore, recognize that trial courts, in cases such as this, are called upon to make determinations as to whether an employee\u2019s claims are based upon true discrimination or are merely employer misconduct in \u201cactions which are a normal part of the employment relationship,. . .\u201d <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 160.) Likewise, we recognize other concerns, such as possible double recovery, are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In FEHA, the Legislature has declared, as a matter of public policy, the need to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination. (\u00a7 12920.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Section 12920 further provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIt is recognized that the practice of denying employment opportunity and discriminating in the terms of employment for such reasons foments domestic strife and unrest, deprives the state of the fullest utilization of its capacities for development and advance, and substantially and adversely affects the interest of employees, employers, and the public in general.\u201d The Legislature has gone so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>as to identify the opportunity to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination, as a civil right. (\u00a7 12921.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">FEHA establishes a comprehensive scheme for combating and eliminating employment discrimination. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 485 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272]; \u00a7 12920.) Employment discrimination is broadly defined in section 12940.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Particularly relevant to the present case is the section\u2019s prohibition of an employer\u2019s discrimination against any person in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The state Supreme Court in <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 213-214 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912], described the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u201c[It] creates a Department of Fair Employment and Housing (Department) (\u00a7 12901), whose function is to investigate, conciliate, and seek redress of claimed discrimination (\u00a7 12930). Aggrieved persons may file complaints with the Department (\u00a7 12960), which must promptly investigate (\u00a7 12963). If it deems a claim valid it seeks to resolve the matter\u2014in confidence\u2014by conference, conciliation, and persuasion. (\u00a7 12963.7.) If that fails or seems inappropriate the Department may issue an accusation to be heard by the Fair Employment and Housing Commission (Commission). (\u00a7\u00a7 12965, subd. (a), 12929; see too \u00a7 12903.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">\u201cThe Commission determines whether an accused employer, union, or employment agency has violated the act. If it finds a violation it must \u2018issue ... an order requiring such [violator] to cease and desist from such unlawful practice and to take such action, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, as, in the judgment of the commission, will effectuate the purpose of this part . . . .\u2019 (\u00a7 12970, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">\u201cIf no accusation is issued within 150 days after the filing of the complaint and the matter is not otherwise resolved, the Department must give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>complainant a right-to-sue letter. Only then may that person sue in the superior court \u2018under this part\u2019 (\u00a7 12965, subd. (b)).\u201d In a civil action under the FEHA, all relief generally available in noncontractual actions, including punitive damages, may be obtained. <em>(Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 221.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">While FEHA seeks the elimination of discriminatory employment practices, our state\u2019s system of workers\u2019 compensation, as embodied in the state Constitution (\u00a7 4 of art. XIV) and in Labor Code section 3200 et seq., has a much different goal. Workers\u2019 compensation law enforces an employer\u2019s liability to compensate workers for injury or disability sustained in the course of their employment, irrespective of the fault of any party. (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4.) It is not designed to combat employment discrimination, except in the case of employers who discriminate against industrially injured employees who exercise workers\u2019 compensation remedies. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 132a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Nevertheless, defendants contend workers\u2019 compensation is the exclusive remedy for plaintiff\u2019s claim of employment discrimination. They rely on the language of Labor Code sections 3600, subdivision (a), 3601, subdivision (a), and 3602, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Their argument may best be summarized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the following manner: where the conditions of compensation, as defined in Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a) are present, workers\u2019 compensation provides the exclusive remedy. In this regard, they emphasize, through judicially noticed documents below, plaintiff applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to cumulative stress sustained between November 30, 1984, and November 30, 1985, while she was employed by defendant Raley\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In addition, they correctly observe none of the exceptions to the exclusive remedy rule, outlined in Labor Code sections 3601, subdivision (b), and 3602, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> apply here. Indeed, according to the defendants, the Legislature has failed to except FEHA claims from the exclusive remedy rule of workers\u2019 compensation. They note in this regard the 1982 amendments to the Labor Code, inferring the exclusive remedy rule, as it presently exists, is a more recent and, therefore, controlling statement of legislative intent. As defendants see it, the workers\u2019 compensation system is plainly unlimited by any other statutory scheme. Thus, the exclusive remedy rule must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">At first glance, defendants\u2019 argument has some appeal given the exclusive remedy language of Labor Code sections 3601, subdivision (a), and 3602, subdivision (b). However, according to defendants\u2019 view of the law, there could never be a civil action for employment discrimination if such discrimination led to disabling emotional distress. This approach would not only render the FEHA cause of action for employment discrimination a non sequitur where disability resulted; it would also make a hollow promise out of the public policy, stated in FEHA, of eliminating employment discrimination. It would then be in an employer\u2019s best interest, if he or she practiced employment discrimination, to make conditions so intolerable for an employee and to cause such a level of emotional distress in the employee that the employee could not work as a result. Thus, the employer could avoid civil liability for his or her discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Nevertheless, the competing arguments and conclusions point up the necessity of recognizing we are dealing with two important legal matrices both designed to protect employees who, in the context of this case, would not have suffered injury but for being employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">It is a well-established rule of statutory construction that the Legislature does not intend to legislate in contravention of existing public policy. <em>(Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 142, 152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>[23 Cal.Rptr. 592, 373 P.2d 640].) Without the most cogent and convincing evidence, a court will never attribute to the Legislature the intent to disregard or overturn a sound rule of policy. <em>(Ibid.) </em> To adopt the defendants\u2019 interpretation would fly in the face of this legislative presumption as far as FEHA is concerned. Moreover, there is no evidence, much less the convincing level of evidence required under <em>Interinsurance Exchange, </em>to read into the exclusive remedy rule an intent to disregard a FEHA cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s application for and receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits does not necessarily lend support to defendants\u2019 position. Nor should it necessarily foreclose plaintiff\u2019s ability to maintain an action under FEHA, since the workers\u2019 compensation claim cannot address her employer\u2019s liability for employment discrimination.  In this regard, another applicable rule of statutory interpretation is that apparent inconsistencies in laws relating to the same general subject should be reconciled if possible. <em>(Tripp </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 671, 679 [131 Cal.Rptr. 789, 552 P.2d 749], overruled on other grounds in <em>Frink </em>v. <em>Prod </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 166, 180 [181 Cal.Rptr. 893, 643 P.2d 476].) Where two codes are to be construed, they must be regarded as blending into each other and forming a single statute. <em>(Tripp, supra, </em>at p. 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In <em>Hart </em>v. <em>National Mortgage &amp; Land Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1420 [235 Cal.Rptr. 68], the court quoted from <em>Cole, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 148, as follows: \u201c <em>\u2018The cases that have permitted recovery in tort for intentional misconduct causing disability have involved conduct of an employer having a \u201cquestionable </em>\u201d <em>relationship to the employment, an injury which did not occur while the employee was performing service incidental to the employment and which would not be viewed as a risk of the employment, or conduct where the employer. . . stepped out of [his] proper [role]. </em>[Citations.]. . <em>Is (Id., </em>atpp. 160-161, italics added.)\u201d <em>(Hart, supra, </em>at p. 1430.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Footnote 8 of the quoted passage provides: \u201cIn <em>Young </em>v. <em>Libbey-Owens Ford Co., supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 1037, the court refused to apply the exclusivity doctrine to the employee\u2019s cause of action for emotional distress (with attendant physical and emotional damages) arising from his employer\u2019s ratification of a coworker\u2019s assault on him even though he had already collected compensation. The court held, \u2018[i]ssues such as causation, which must be litigated in a civil suit, are not addressed in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding . . . .\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1043.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The court in <em>Jones </em>analyzed the matter and concluded because two separate wrongs are involved, there are no election of remedies or double recovery problems. We do not disagree with that conclusion. However, this is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to say difficult questions will not be encountered regarding what may be an employee\u2019s sole remedy under certain facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">This appeal comes to us for determination at the pleading stage. Clearly, the allegations of plaintiff state a cause of action under FEHA for employment discrimination because of sex. Workers\u2019 compensation is not her exclusive remedy under the facts alleged, and the trial court erred in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer to that cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">III., IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The judgment is reversed.
