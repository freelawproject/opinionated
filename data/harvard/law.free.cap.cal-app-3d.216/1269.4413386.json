We affirm the judgment granting the petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">For the 13-year period prior to her resignation in August 1979, Dixon was a permanent, certificated teacher for District. At the time of her resignation, Dixon\u2019s salary classification was column V, step 12, District\u2019s highest salary classification for certificated personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">On July 1, 1980, Dixon was reemployed by District as a permanent, certificated teacher. However, due to a provision contained in the collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>bargaining agreement then in effect, Dixon was classified at column V, step 6, rather than at her previous classification of step 12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Pursuant to the procedure set forth in the 1979-1982 collective bargaining agreement, Dixon filed a grievance with Board. On July 15, 1981, Board rejected Dixon\u2019s demand that she be placed at her former salary classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">On June 7, 1982, Dixon filed a petition in the trial court for a peremptory writ of mandate commanding Board to place Dixon at her previous salary classification. On July 22, 1982, following a hearing, the trial court (Hon. John Cole presiding) denied Dixon\u2019s petition without prejudice on the basis that Dixon failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">On February 11, 1983, pursuant to the nonbinding arbitration provisions of the 1979-1982 collective bargaining agreement, a hearing was conducted before an arbitrator. In a decision issued on March 22, 1983, the arbitrator determined that District violated salary regulation A when, upon reemployment of Dixon, District gave her credit for only six of her thirteen years of teaching experience; salary regulation B did not provide a defense to District since Dixon\u2019s previous teaching experience was performed within District; and Education Code sections 44931<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 45028<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1979-1982 collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator recommended that District place Dixon at column V, step 12 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>the salary schedule and provide her with backpay. The arbitrator\u2019s nonbinding decision was rejected by Board on April 5, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">On June 28, 1983, Dixon filed a petition for writ of mandate alleging that appellants violated salary regulation A as well as sections 45028 and 44931.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">On September 22, 1983, the trial court (Hon. Bruce Geernaert presiding) held that although section 44931 compelled District to place Dixon at column V, step 12 upon reemployment, Dixon had contracted away her rights under section 44931 when she agreed to work for District at a lower rate of pay. The trial court further determined that petitioners\u2019 allegation of breach of applicable collective bargaining agreements constituted an arguably unfair practice, an allegation falling within the exclusive initial jurisdiction of the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 3541.5.) Accordingly, in an order filed on October 17, 1983, the trial court denied the petition insofar as it alleged a violation of section 44931 and abated the proceedings as to the allegation of breach of the collective bargaining agreements so that petitioners could exhaust their administrative remedies before PERB. (See <em>Fresno Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>National Education Assn. </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 259, 274 [177 Cal.Rptr. 888].)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">On March 23, 1984, petitioners filed an unfair labor practice charge with PERB. On November 29, 1984, PERB dismissed petitioners\u2019 charge as untimely since more than six months had elapsed between the alleged violation of the collective bargaining agreements and the filing of the charge. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 3541.5, subd. (a).) Notice of PERB\u2019s decision was filed by petitioners with the trial court on September 24, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">On February 23, 1988, petitioners filed a motion in the trial court to resume the previously abated proceedings on their petition for writ of mandate. Additional declarations and other evidence were attached to the motion to bring the petition current and to apprise the trial court of the proceedings which occurred since the matter was abated.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">Hearings on the petition were conducted on March 10 and 14, 1988. The trial court (Hon. Miriam Vogel presiding)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> held that Judge Geemaert\u2019s October 17, 1983, order finding that Dixon contracted away her rights under section 44931 was merely interlocutory and therefore subject to redetermination; Judge Geernaert\u2019s order was incorrect since section 44924 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>prohibits a contract waiving the benefits conferred under section 44931;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and section 44931 compelled District to classify Dixon at column V, step 12. On April 20, 1988, a judgment granting the petition for writ of mandate was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Appellants contend that section 44931 does not apply to the salaries of reemployed certificated employees, an issue of first impression. However, appellants urge this court not to reach the merits of this issue since they contend reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment is mandated because the trial court improperly determined an issue already determined by a previous judge; petitioners have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; and the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to dismiss the petition for lack of prosecution. We deal with the procedural issues first.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">1. Redetermination of Judge Geernaert\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Appellants contend that it was erroneous for Judge Vogel to determine an issue already decided by another judge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\"> Not being appealable, the order partially denying the petition and abating the proceedings pending petitioners\u2019 exhaustion of administrative remedies was merely interlocutory <em>(Blue Mountain Development Co. </em>v. <em>Carville </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1013 [183 Cal.Rptr. 594])<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and subject, upon consideration of all the evidence, to redetermination by a different judge deciding the remainder of the matter. (See <em>Tilem </em>v. <em>City, of Los Angeles </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 694, 706 [191 Cal.Rptr. 229]; <em>Lacey </em>v. <em>Bertone </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 107, 110-111 [240 P.2d 395]; 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Judgment, \u00a7 8, p. 458.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>Moreover, even if we agreed with appellants\u2019 argument that Judge Vogel should have blindly accepted Judge Geernaert\u2019s earlier ruling on this issue, we would remand the matter for entry of a judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate which would be followed by a new appeal wherein petitioners would assert that Judge Geernaert\u2019s ruling was erroneous. Inasmuch as \u201cany contract or agreement, express or implied, made by any employee to waive the benefits of [the chapter containing section 44931] is null and void\u201d (\u00a7 44924), Judge Vogel properly determined that Judge Geernaert\u2019s interim ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">2. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Appellants contend that the trial court was without jurisdiction to grant the petition for writ of mandate since petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">As discussed above, Judge Geernaert abated the proceedings on the petition for writ of mandate so that petitioners could exhaust their administrative remedies before PERB. PERB dismissed petitioners\u2019 unfair practice charge as untimely since more than six months had elapsed between the alleged violation of the collective bargaining agreements and the filing of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">PERB \u201cprovides an administrative remedy for unfair practices and violation of Government Code sections 3540-3549.3. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3541.3, subd. (i).) Where unfair practices are alleged . . . , \u2018[t]he initial determination as to whether the charges of unfair practices are justified, and, if so, what remedy is necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter, shall be a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3541.5; [citations].)\u201d <em>(Wygant </em>v. <em>Victor Valley Joint Union High School Dist. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 319, 322 [214 Cal.Rptr. 205].) However, PERB does not have exclusive jurisdiction where a pure Education Code violation (as opposed to an arguably unfair practice) is alleged. <em>(United Teachers of Ukiah </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 632, 640 [251 Cal.Rptr. 499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">In <em>Wygant, </em>a certificated teacher petitioned for a writ of mandate contending that a school district\u2019s salary policy violated section 45028. Noting that the teacher\u2019s \u201csole allegation [was] that the district\u2019s professional growth policy violate[d] the uniformity mandated by Education Code section 45028\u201d (168 Cal.App.3d at p. 323), the <em>Wygant </em>court held that, under those circumstances, \u201cthe normal jurisdiction of a trial court over civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>disputes is not superseded by the area of exclusive jurisdiction of PERB provided by Government Code section 3541.5, at least to the extent the violation of section 45028 is not pursuant to mutual agreement as authorized by Government Code section 3543.2, subdivision (d).[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">In <em>McCammon </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 661 [241 Cal.Rptr. 1], a teacher sought a writ of mandate, contending that the school district\u2019s salary schedule, which was a part of the collective bargaining agreement between the school district and the teachers\u2019 collective bargaining representative, violated section 45028. The <em>McCammon </em>court held, without analysis, \u201cthat incorrect placement on the salary table constitutes an unfair practice\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 664), thereby vesting PERB with initial jurisdiction. The <em>McCammon </em>court distinguished <em>Wygant </em>on the basis that the case before it involved the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement which \u201clogically render[ed] the violation nonunilateral, and appropriately before the PERB.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 665.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\"><em>McCammon </em>was severely criticized in <em>United Teachers of Ukiah </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.3d 632, wherein three teachers and their collective bargaining representative complained that a school district violated section 45028 by giving certain newly-hired teachers more than five years of credit for prior teaching experience, an act prohibited by the collective bargaining agreement. In rejecting the school district\u2019s argument that PERB had initial jurisdiction, the <em>United Teachers </em>court indicated that <em>\u201cMcCammon </em>is fatally flawed because it is premised on the erroneous notion that <em>any </em>agreement, whether negotiated before or after the [July 28, 1983] effective date of Government Code section 3543.2, subdivision (d), \u2018renders the violation nonunilateral, and appropriately before the PERB.\u2019 [Citation.] As the trial court correctly noted, prior to the effective date of Government Code section 3543.2, subdivision (d), provisions which contravened the Education Code were completely invalid, regardless of whether they resulted from fair negotiations with the teachers\u2019 representatives. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 44924.) Consequently, we cannot say that the violation here was \u2018nonunilateral\u2019 and thus subject to the PERB\u2019s jurisdiction, [\u00b6] . . . [The <em>McCammon </em>decision was \u2018questionable in at least two respects\u2019 since it (1) failed to identify the unfair practice involved in misplacing a teacher on a salary schedule; and (2) failed to recognize that rights mandated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>Education Code are nonnegotiable. [Citation.]\u201d (201 Cal.App.3d at pp. 639-640, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Regarding McCammon's holding that a dispute concerning salary constitutes an unfair practice, <em>California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Azusa Unified School Dist. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 580 [199 Cal.Rptr. 635], a case predating <em>McCammon, </em>is also instructive. In that case, the collective bargaining representative for certain classified school employees argued that a school district\u2019s refusal to pay particular employees wages for periods those employees were prevented from working due to the absence of students violated section 45203.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">In rejecting the school district\u2019s argument that the failure to pay wages which are due an employee constituted an unfair practice thereby vesting initial jurisdiction in PERB, the court stated: \u201cWages are mandatory subjects of bargaining between the representatives of employers and employees. [Citations.] However, the fact that wages are the subject of the dispute at bar does not resolve the question whether refusal to pay wages claimed under section 45203 constitutes an unfair practice. Section 3543.5 of the Government Code lists five unlawful practices of employers and Government Code section 3543.6 is the comparable listing of employee organization activities which are prohibited. [\u00b6] A review of judicial decisions discussing \u2018unfair practices\u2019 discloses that the activities of representatives of employers or employees in those cases \u2018arguably\u2019 fell within the activities proscribed by Government Code sections 3543.5 or 3543.6. [Citations.]\u201d (152 Cal.App.3d at pp. 591-592, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">With this background, we now focus on the merits of appellants\u2019 contention which is primarily based on the authority of <em>McCammon </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist., supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d 661. Initially, we conclude that, contrary to McCammon's ipse dixit holding, a school district\u2019s improper placement of a teacher on the salary schedule does not constitute an unfair practice as such an act is not of the same character as the unfair practices prohibited by Government Code section 3543.5.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (See <em>California </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number><em>School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Azusa Unified School Disk, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at p. 592.)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Moreover, to the extent the alleged section 45028 violation in the case at bench was based on collective bargaining agreements negotiated prior to July 28, 1983 (the effective date of Gov. Code, \u00a7 3543.2, subd. (d)), such a provision, even if mutually negotiated, would be rendered null and void by section 44924<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and therefore outside of PERB\u2019s initial jurisdiction. <em>(United Teachers of Ukiah </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.3d at p. 639.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Finally, to the extent the alleged section 45028 violation in the case at bench concerns mutually negotiated provisions of collective bargaining agreements entered after July 28, 1983, <em>McCammon </em>is distinguishable since petitioners do not allege that the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements violate section 45028; rather, petitioners assert that section 45028 and the collective bargaining agreements are harmonious and that both mandate Dixon being placed at a higher level on the salary schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that PERB did not have initial jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 45028 allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Notwithstanding the previous discussion, it is crucial to recognize that, although section 45028 was one of the statutory bases upon which petitioners sought relief, the trial court did not base its ruling on section 45028; rather, the writ of mandate was issued on the basis of appellants\u2019 violation of section 44931. We must therefore determine whether PERB had initial jurisdiction over alleged violations of this section of the Education Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Unlike section 45028, to which the Legislature has created an exception (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3543.2, subd. (d)), no similar exception to section 44931 exists. Therefore, any provisions contained in a collective bargaining agreement which conflict with section 44931 are null and void pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>section 44924.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, as with section 45028, we conclude that a violation of section 44931 is not of the same character as the unfair practices prohibited by Government Code section 3543.5. <em>(California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Azusa Unified School Dist, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at p. 952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Accordingly, we hold that petitioners\u2019 allegation that appellants violated section 44931 constituted a pure Education Code violation and therefore PERB did not have initial jurisdiction over this allegation. <em>(California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Azusa Unified School Dist, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at pp. 592-593; <em>Wygant </em>v. <em>Victor Valley Joint Union High School Dist, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 324-325; <em>United Teachers of Ukiah </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.3d at p. 640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">3. Petitioners\u2019 Alleged Lack of Diligence <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">4. Applicability of Section 44931 to the Salaries of Reemployed Certificated Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Relying on the history of section 44931, particularly the urgency amendment of May 16, 1947, appellants argue that the statute applies solely to retirement benefits of reemployed certificated employees and not to their salary classifications. As we explain below, appellants\u2019 construction of section 44931 is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">On May 23, 1945, chapter 428, an urgency measure adding section 13502 to the Education Code, was enacted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Through various amendments discussed below, section 13502 ultimately became current section 44931.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>On May 16, 1947, another urgency measure was enacted which amended section 13502.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Less than two months later, on July 11, 1947, another urgency measure amending section 13502 was enacted. This measure changed section 13502\u2019s reference to the restoration of \u201crights\u201d to the restoration of \u201crights, benefits and burdens,\u201d increased the length of resignation from 36 to 39 months, and segregated this portion of section 13502 from its remaining provisions, along with additional material, which were placed in newly created sections of the Education Code relating to retirement systems.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Effective October 1, 1949, Statutes 1949, chapter 1198, section 1, page 2117, was enacted, which repealed section 13502 as amended by Statutes 1947, chapter 271, since its provisions were enacted elsewhere in the Education Code. Chapter 1198 also added language to section 13502, not pertinent to this appeal, regarding military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>In 1959, the entire Education Code was repealed and reenacted. Section 13502 was renumbered and appeared as section 13402 in substantially the same form. The language of section 13502 which directed the governing board of a school district to disregard a permanent, certificated employee\u2019s \u201cbreak in service\u201d when restoring all the rights, benefits and burdens of a permanent employee was deleted.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In 1963, the previously deleted language of former section 13502 requiring the governing board of a school district to \u201cdisregard[] the break in service\u201d when restoring all of the rights, benefits and burdens to a permanent, certificated employee who is reemployed within 39 months was reinserted to section 13402.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Finally, Statutes 1976, chapter 1010, repealed the entire Education Code as it then existed and enacted a new Education Code, operative on April 1, 1977. The exact content of section 13402 appeared as section 44931.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">As can be seen from the history of section 44931, the original enactment (\u00a7 13502) has not been substantially changed. Essentially, the original 36-month period was lengthened to 39 months; a reemployed permanent, certificated employee was entitled to be restored to the \u201crights, benefits and burdens\u201d of a permanent employee rather than merely having his \u201crights\u201d restored; and the language affecting the restoration of the employee\u2019s membership in a retirement system was moved to other sections of the Education Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>Directing this court\u2019s attention primarily to the language of Statutes 1947, chapter 271, section 2 (quoted in fn. 20, <em>ante), </em>which described the nature of the urgency of that amendment to section 13502 in terms of retirement benefits, appellants contend that the focus of the legislation has always been on the restoration of retirement benefits and not salary classification. Unlike appellants, we do not attribute the same restrictive intent to this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">In the urgency provision of the original enactment of section 13502, the Legislature stated that the \u201c[r]estoration of classification, retirement and other rights, . . . will assist in securing the return of many competent teachers to teaching service . . . .\u201d The Legislature\u2019s specific reference to \u201cretirement\u201d and separate references to \u201cclassification\u201d and \u201cother rights\u201d indicates not only that section 13502 was originally intended to apply to more than just retirement benefits, but also that restoration of classification is a right which is protected by section 13502.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>Thus, the simple answer to appellants\u2019 contention is that the Legislature focused on retirement benefits in the May 16, 1947, amendment because the purpose of that amendment was to add language that if, at the time of resignation, a reemployed permanent, certificated employee was a member of a retirement system, he would be reinstated to that system \u201cwith all rights previously held, including any credit for prior service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Our conclusion regarding the limited nature of the May 16, 1947, amendment is bolstered by the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[i]f possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d [Citation]; \u201ca construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Palos Verdes Faculty Assn. </em>v. <em>Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 650, 659 [147 Cal.Rptr. 359, 580 P.2d 1155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">If this court were to read section 44931 to apply solely to retirement benefits as suggested by appellants, we would render the statute superfluous. As explained above, section 13502 was first amended in 1947 by adding the provisions relating to restoration of retirement benefits. Another amendment in 1947 segregated the portion of section 13502 as originally enacted from the subsequently-amended portion relating to retirement benefits. If the originally enacted portion of section 13502 was meant only to apply to retirement benefits, it would have been unnecessary in light of the newly enacted Education Code sections which specifically discussed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>subject. Yet, instead of repealing the original language of section 13502, the Legislature retained the language when that section was amended in 1947, 1959, 1963, and 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">We therefore conclude that the Legislature intended section 13502, and therefore section 44931, to apply to the full range of rights, benefits and burdens of a permanent, certificated employee (not otherwise prohibited by the Education Code), including classification on the salary schedule.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\"> Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly granted the petition for writ of mandate.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Hanson, Acting P.

However, this footnote does not help appellants because (1) petitioners were granted relief pursuant to the rights conferred by section 44931, not section 45028; and (2) while salary regulation B limits the credit given newly-hired teachers for prior teaching experience performed outside of District, a regulation that is arguably violative of section 45028 since it treats employees differently depending on where they previously taught, salary regulation B has no application to Dixon since her prior teaching experience was performed within District and petitioners have not challenged its validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
