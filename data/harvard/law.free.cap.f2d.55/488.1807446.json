There was a disclaimer as to all except the notation \u201cStyl-Lane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">In conformity with the rules of the Patent Office, the application was passed to publication and published in the Official Gazette of April 23, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">Appellant, Fashion Park Associates, Inc., opposed the registration, alleging ownership and prior use of the trade-mark \u201cFashion Park\u201d upon similar or identical goods, and pleading three registrations thereof, which registrations are made parts of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">The notice of opposition alleged that appellant has built up a large clothing business which has become well known in every state by tbe trade-mark \u201cFashion Park\u201d; that \u201cStyl-Lane,\u201d by reason of tbe meaning of the words composing it (\u201cSlyl\u201d being an obvious slight misspelling of \u201cStyle\u201d), is so similar to \u201cFashion Park\u201d as to create confusion; that appellee\u2019s mark \u201ccould only be used for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of the name and reputation of opponent in the clothing trade and with the buying public,\u201d and that appellant would be damaged by its registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-20\">The answer of appellee insists that both \u201cFashion\u201d and \u201cStyl\u201d are descriptive words and publiei juris; denies generally and specifically the allegations of the notice of opposition as to there being a similarity likely to create confusion to the damage of appellant, and denies also the allegation as to appellee\u2019s purpose to profit from the name and reputation of appellant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-21\">The Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences dismissed the notice of opposition, and adjudged appellee to be entitled to the registration sought. His decision, upon appeal, was affirmed by the Commissioner of Patents, whereupon appeal was taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">It may be here stated that drawings accompanying the last two of appellant\u2019s registrations pleaded and in evidence (the first shows no drawing) disclose the mark underneath a representation of two mounted horsemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-23\">Appellant insists, however, that by usage, as shown by the evidence in the instant case, and by adjudications in certain other cases [Kassman &amp; Kessner, Inc., v. Rosenberg Bros. Co., 56 App. D. C. 109, 10 F.(2d) 904, and Rosenberg Bros. <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Elliott (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 962] \u201cFashion Park\u201d is appellant\u2019s mark, \u201cwith or without the mounted horsemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-24\">Whatever may be the effect in other proceedings of tbe usage and the adjudication referred to, we do not regard them as being of consequence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-25\">The issue before us is solely as to tbe similiarity of the marks, and we are in agreement with the holdings of the tribunals of the Patent Office that they do not conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-26\">This court has had occasion heretofore to determine cases wherein appellant\u2019s mark of \u201cFashion Park\u201d was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-27\">In Rosenberg Bros. <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Robert G. Horowitz, 35 F.(2d) 784, 17 C. C. P. A. 641, the issue was between \u201cFashion Park\u201d and \u201cWashington Park.\u201d We there said: \u201c * * * Appellant has not acquired the exclusive use of the word \u2018park\u2019 in a trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>mark, and therefore the question is: Do the words \u2018Washington Park\u2019 so nearly resemble the words \u2018Fashion Park\u2019 as to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, or to deceive purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We held that sueh resemblance was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Wetherby-Kayser Shoe Co., 37 F.(2d) 437, 438, 17 C. C. P. A. 794, \u201cFashion Park\u201d and \u201cFashion Lame\u201d were held not to conflict. (Italics new here.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">It is true that in that case the \u201cFashion Lane\u201d mark was used on men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and children\u2019s footwear, and we made seme comment upon the dissimilarity, in fact, between these and clothing (though not holding that the respective goods were not goods of the same descriptive properties), and also reference was made to the representation of the horsemen in appellant\u2019s mark, but the concluding sentence of our opinion in the case was: \u201cNor is there, in our opinion, sueh a similarity between the words \u2018Park\u2019 and \u2018Lane\u2019 as justifies, in this case, the sustaining of this opposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Simon Levin <em>&amp; </em>Sons Co., 37 F.(2d) 962, 17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 847, the majority of this court held \u201cCollege Park\u201d and \u201cFashion Park\u201d not to be confusingly similar when applied to goods identical in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In Fashion Park, Inc., v. The Fair, 49 F.(2d) 830, 18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1399, referred to in the oral argument of the case at bar, we held \u201cFashion Park\u201d and \u201cFashion Row\u201d to be confusingly similar when applied to men\u2019s outer clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">But in the instant case both words of the \u25a0conflicting marks differ in practically all respects, except that there is some similarity of meaning between \u201cFashion\u201d and \u201cStyle.\u201d In nil other respects they differ, and each of them is a common word, open to any proper public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The brief of appellant says:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u201cA painstaking search covering the Standard Unabridged Dictionary, the Encyclopedia Britannica and Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus of English words and phrases brings us to the conclusion that \u2018Park\u2019 and \u2018Lane1 have the common synonym \u25a0\u2018place1 and both are rural suggesting trees .and hedges.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">\u201cWe therefore have it on the leading authorities on words that \u2018Park\u2019 means \u2018place*\u2019 and \u2018Lane\u2019 means \u2018place.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">While undoubtedly a park is a \u201cplace\u201d and a lane is a \u201cplace,\u201d we cannot conceive it to be proper to take that broad meaning which is common to innumerable other words for the purpose of trade-mark comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">\u201cPark\u201d has a number of noun meanings, such as those given in Funk &amp; Wagnalls Dictionary :</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">\u201c1. A tract of land, generally large and enclosed, set apart for ornament or recreation. 2. An open, champaign country. 3. A picturesque sparsely wooded valley or plateau in the Rocky Mountains. 4. [Scot.] A cultivated field; paddock. 5. Mil. (1) An enclosure where animals, guns, wagons, etc., are placed for safety. (2) A complete train of cannon, including gunners, equipment, ammunition,\u201d ete.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">The same volume defines \u201clane\u201d as: \u201cA narrow way, path, or street. Syn.: see road ; way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">In common usage we do not think that the same meaning is ever conveyed by, or ascribed to, \u201cPark\u201d and \u201cLane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-18\">We rather agree with the statement in the answer of appellee that-\u201cPark\u201d and \u201cLane\u201d are dissimilar \u201cin spelling, pronunciation, enunciation, meaning and appearance.\u201d We also agree with the tribunals of the Patent Office that they do not, in any sense proper here to be considered, have the same significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-19\">The view of this court that one clear purpose and manifest intent pf the Congress, expressed in the Trade-Mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905 (15 USCA .\u00a7\u00a7 81-109], was to aid in rendering trade-marks valuable and to protect the owners thereof in the enjoyment of their value, by denying registration to sueh as might confuse, has been followed in the many decisions rendered by us since jurisdiction in sueh matters was transferred to us. Following many decisions of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, our predecessor in this field, we have uniformly resolved doubt against a newcomer, and the effect of some of our decisions has undoubtedly been to somewhat modify the practice in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-20\">If there were any real, intelligent ground for doubt in the instant ease, we should here apply the rule against appellee, but, to our minds, there is no sueh ground, and those charged with the administration of the Registration Act are not at liberty to lose sight of, or disregard, the rights of an applicant, as expressed in the language of section 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>(15 USCA \u00a7 85), which declares that, with certain exceptions specifically set forth, \u201cNo mark by which the goods of the owner of the mark may be distinguished from other goods of the same class shall be refused registration. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Appellee seeks to exercise a right assured him by the law; none of the statutory exceptions being deemed applicable hero. B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Kenilworth Mfg. Co., 40 F.(2d) 121, 17 C. C. P. A. 1106, 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">BLAND, Associate Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
