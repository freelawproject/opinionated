A copy of the application, other than the statement required by the rules of the Patent Office, is not found in the record, but it seems to be conceded that it was filed under the provisions of the Trade-mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 81-109).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">In the record we find, in the statement of the Examiner, the following: \u201c * * * The representation of the automobile is disclaimed apart from the mark shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">In the decision of the Commissioner we find the statement that: \u201cThe applicant has disclaimed any exclusive use of the representation of the front end of the automobile vehicle apart from the mark as shown. \u25a0:&lt; if <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">Appellant challenges the accuracy of these statements, and contends that the disclaimer was not of \u201cthe automobile shown,\u201d but of \u201cthe front end of an automotive vehicle apart from the mark shown in the drawing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">The disclaimer is not a part of the record, except that in the reasons of appeal error is alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">\u201c(7) In holding that applicant\u2019s disclaimer : \u2018Without waiver of any of its common law rights, applicant hereby disclaims the exclusive use of the representation of the front end of an automotive vehicle apart from the mark shown in the drawing,\u2019 is a disclaimer of the automotive vehicle shown in the drawings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">The disclaimer, whatever it was, should, of course, have been made a <em>part </em>of the record in order for us to consider this reason of appeal. However, for the purposes of this case, we may assume <em>that </em>appellant\u2019s contention as to the wording of the disclaimer is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-24\">Registration of the mark was refused by the Patent Office tribunals upon the ground that the mark is descriptive of the goods to which it is applied. Accordingly, the application was rejected, and from such rejection this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-25\">Appellant contends: (1) That the representation of the front end of any automobile is a representation of appellant\u2019s \u201cown unique automobile\u201d; (2) that the use of the hexagonal figure inclosing the representation of the front end of the automobile makes the mark a composite one, and, as such, it does not consist \u201cmerely in devices which a,re descriptive of the goods with which they are used. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-26\">In its brief appellant states: \u201cApplicant\u2019s motor ears are identified the world over by the peculiar and unique mounting of the headlights on the front fenders, with the shell of the lamp body flowing back and merging in the crown of the fender with a graceful streamline effect. This constitutes a valuable common law right the ownership of which the Patent Office lias no authority to deprive applicant. For this reason applicant made disclaimer of \u2018an automotive vehicle,\u2019 and not of \u2014 the motor vehicle \u2014 as stated by the First Assistant Commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-27\">Assuming that the foregoing statement as to the characteristics of appellant\u2019s motor ears is correct, although there is no proof in the record to support it, appellant does not advise us of the nature of the common-law right, claimed by him, or how the rejection of his application would deprive him of his common-law rights, if he has any.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>In the case of B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Kenilworth Mfg. Co., 40 F.(2d) 121, 122, 17 C. C. P. A. 1105, we said: \u201cThe duty of the Commissioner and of this court on appeals from' the Commissioner, in all cases, is simply to determine whether an application meets the statutory requirement so as to be entitled to registration. Registration being granted or refused leaves the parties in interest, with their rights and equities, under the common law, legally unaffected, except as they may be enforced under sections 16 and 17, 15 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 96 and 97.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">So far as the issue here is concerned, we can'see no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that there is any distinction between a representation of the automobile made by appellant and a representation of an automobile. In either \u00abase the representation is purely descriptive, and it is immaterial, so far as registration is concerned, that the representation shown in appellant\u2019s mark is descriptive of only the automobile made by it. Standing alone, the representation here involved is of the class which consists \u201cmerely in *' * * devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used,\u201d and registration thereof is barred by section 5 of said TradeMark Registration Act (15 USCA \u00a7 85).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">With regard to appellant\u2019s second contention, that the combination of the hexagonal figure and the pictorial representation makes the mark a composite one which is not \u201cmerely\u201d descriptive, we are clear that it is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In the brief of appellant it is stated that: \u201cApplicant has given a setting to this distinctive feature of its goods by adopting a hexagonal figure as a frame. <em>This was done to create a pictorial field and a hexagonal frame was adopted because it tends to enhance the perspective of the unique front of applicant\u2019s ear. </em>Applicant was fully aw\u00e1re that others had used a hexagon in connection with automobiles and parts thereof. It knew that such use was so common that this well known geometric figure was <em>publici </em>juris, the same as are squares, ovald, ellipses, circles, rhombs, crescents, stars, and the like. But applicant is not seeking to register this common geometrical figure. It is seeking to register a composite mark. * \u2022 * \u201d (First italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The foregoing is a frank statement of the purpose of the use of the hexagonal figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">That a composite mark should be considered'as a whole and not dissected is well established. The Celotex Co. v. Millington, 49 F.(2d) 1053, 18 C. C. P. A. 1484.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">In the ease of In re Plymouth Motor Corporation, 46 F.(2d) 211, 18 C. C. P. A. 838, we had occasion to consider the meaning of the word \u201cmerely\u201d as used in section 5 of the Trade-mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905, and we- there cited the case of Hercules Powder Co. v. Newton (C. C. A.) 266 F. 169, 172, which held that \u201c \u2018merely descriptive\u2019 means only descriptive, or nothing more than descriptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Viewing appellant\u2019s mark as a whole, it is clearly \u201cmerely\u201d descriptive. The observer of the mark would attach no importance to the hexagonal figure, admittedly in common use, and its only purpose is more clearly to call attention to the pictorial representation of the automobile, thus emphasizing the descriptiveness of the mark, or, to use the language of appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cenhance the perspective of the unique front of applicant\u2019s car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">We are clear that appellant\u2019s mark is merely descriptive of the goods to which it is applied, and the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
