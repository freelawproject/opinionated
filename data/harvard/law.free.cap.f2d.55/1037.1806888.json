Low, 57 App. D. C. 167, 18 F.(2d) 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">While, of course, the rules of the court hind the judges of the court as much as its litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-14\">\u201cA rule of the court thus authorized and made has the force of law, and is binding upon the court as well as upon parties to <em>m </em>action, and cannot be dispensed with to suit the circumstances of any particular case.\u201d Rio Grande Irrigation Co. v. Gildersleeve, 174 U. S. 608, 19 S. Ct. 761, 43 L. Ed. 1103; Thompson v. Hatch, 3 Pick.
