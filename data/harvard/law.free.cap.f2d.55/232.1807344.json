From the entry thereof he took no appeal within the time provided by statute. On July 21, 1931, he presented this petition for a writ of certiorari and therein seeks to review the same alleged error that could have been reviewed on a timely appeal. In other words, he seeks, in effect, to use a writ of certiorari as an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">In the ease of Turner v. United States (C. C. A.) 14 F.(2d) 360, 361, the court makes it plain this cannot be done, holding: \u201cBut it may not be used under this provision as a substitute for an appeal or writ of error to correct mere errors committed in the exercise of a lawful jurisdiction. * * * In Greyerbiehl v. Hughes Elec. Co. (C. C. A.) 294 F. 802, we made use of the writ to restrain and correct a plain excess of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">The petition for certiorari is denied and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
