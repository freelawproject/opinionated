Our recent ease of Traub Mfg. Co. v. R. Harris &amp; Co., 53 F.(2d) 416, 19 C. C. P. A. -, is directly in point, and in said case will be found cited numerous others which also relate directly to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-28\">But one of appellant\u2019s citations seem to require comment. It has here cited the ease of Loughran et al. v. Quaker City Chocolate &amp; Confectionery Co., Inc., 286 F. 694, 697, wherein the United States Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in a suit at equity, brought under section 4915, R. S. (35 USCA \u00a7 63), decreed the plaintiffs therein to be entitled to register the notation \u201cQuaker Maid\u201d used in connection with the figure of a girl clad as \u201ca Quaker maiden was supposed to be clothed\u201d against the opposition of the defendant therein, who had the mark \u201c \u2018The Quaker City\u2019 with the figure of a man on a gold seal,\u201d both marks applied to candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-29\">It appears, from an examination of the opinion in that case, that defendant\u2019s mark was registered under the ton-year provision of the Trade-Mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905 (section 5 [15 USCA \u00a7 85]); it apparently being regarded as a geographical designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-30\">In the course of his opinion in that case, District Judge Dickinson, discussing the nature of the word \u201cQuaker,\u201d among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>things, said: \u201cSome words are merely the \u2022names of things. Other words, although used as names, imply the existence of certain qualities or characteristics of excellence or otherwise. The sound or sight of a word often brings with it by suggestion a train of ideas. One of the masters in 'literature has called such words 'polarized/ The word \u2018Quakeri is of this class. Members of the Society of Friends have the reputation of putting conscience and honesty into all that they do or make. Any food product which is really Quaker-made carries with it the assertion that it is wholesome, that its ingredients are genuine, and that it has been prepared by the use of methods of cleanliness. When a manufacturer of candy puts out his product under such a name, he is advertising its excellence. * * * To give any one a monopoly of the use of a word of this bind is to give him the exclusive right to so advertise his product. There is no purpose in the trademark law to confer any such right upon him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Appellanij insists that the decision of the learned District Judge (whose decree subsequently was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit [296 F. 823, 827]) was a judicial construction of the \u201cnature of the trade-mark 'Quaker1 as applied to a food product,\u201d and that, under such construction, the word may not be so appropriated by appellee here as to avoid appellant\u2019s right to register it for use as sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We are unable to accept this contention. We note the Circuit Court of Appeals, in its opinion affirming the decree, said, in part: \u201cIt occurs to us that the only inference to be drawn from the decree of the District Court authorizing registration of the plaintiffs\u2019 trade-mark is that <em>it is not similar </em>to the trade-marks of the opposing defendant. Otherwise there would be neither <em>justification nor validity </em>in the award of registration. At all events, it is our purpose by this decision on appeal to make it clear that the trade-: marks here in opposition are <em>not </em>similar within the meaning of the statute and that, for this reason, the plaintiffs\u2019 right to registration adjudged by the District Court should be sustained, and for the added reason that, in our opinion, the words 'Quaker Maid\u2019 constitute a valid technical trade-mark.\u201d- (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The appellate court had previously declared itself \u201cnot concerned\u201d with the validity of the opposeris mark \u2014 \u201cThe Quaker City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">It seems to us that the marks there, \u201cThe Quaker City\u201d and \u201cQuaker Maid,\u201d certainly presented no such question as to similarity as is here presented, and we are unable to agree that the statements of the District Judge, quoted supra, amounted to an adjudication which should here control.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In the case at bar, the validity of appellee\u2019s mark \u201cQuaker\u201d is not brought into1 question, except as invalidity might be a logical conclusion if appellant\u2019s argument as to the effect of the United States District Judge\u2019s decision in the Loughran Case, supra, were accepted. This, in any event, we need not further consider, because appellants brief says: \u201cAt the outset, Appellant wishes to make clear that it is not attacking the validity of Appellee\u2019s registration. It concedes that the validity of Appellee\u2019s registration is not in issue here. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Some other questions are presented and argued, but, in view of the opinion which we entertain as to the similarity of the marks, we need not go further.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Appellant has merely taken the mark of appellee consisting of the single word \u201cQuaker\u201d and added the single word \u201cMaid\u201d thereto. There is not even proposed a pictorial representation of a girl, as was the situation in the Loughran Case, supra. When pronounced without being seen, the word might imply that' the product was of Quaker production. It certainly cannot be said that this particular word \u201cMaid,\u201d added to the notation \u201cQuaker,\u201d creates a mark so dissimilar as to justify its registration over \u201cQuaker\u201d standing alone, for use upon goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Express holdings in point will be found cited in the Traub Case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
