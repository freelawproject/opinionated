In a plug valve device, in combination, a tapered valve seat, a tapered valve adapted to seat thereon under spring action, each being shouldered whereby a chamber is formed for the reception of a packing member, and a packing member in said chamber adapted to move the valve' off said seat against the tension of the spring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">\u201c26. In a plug valve device, in combination, a easing having a tapered valve seat, a tapered plug valve adapted to engage said seat, the plug valve and seat being shouldered to form a recess for the reception of a packing member and a gland, said shoulders being formed at the smaller end of said plug valve, a spring for sealing said valve, a packing member engaging in said recess upon said shoulders, and a gland engaging said packing for retaining the same and for exerting pressure on said valve to move it off its seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The references relied upon are: Heijlman, 1,370,745, March 8, 1921; Martin, 1,456,326,' May 22, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Appellant\u2019s alleged invention relates to valves, particularly of thh type known as rotating plug valves. As applied to such last-named valves, a spring is provided that normally holds the valve to its seat; the upper ends of the plug and easing, respectively, are shouldered on substantially the same plane. A packing element overlies these shoulders to seal the joint between the plug and the easing. To compress this packing element, a collar is provided above the same, formed with projecting flanges having holes engaged by bolts, which bolts also pass through openings in a flange upon the body of the valve easing. By tightening the nuts upon these bolts, -the packing may be compressed, and, if compressed sufficiently, the vertical thrust of the packing will lift the plug from its seat against the force of the spring in the lower chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">The Martin reference is a patent granted to appellant. With regard to that patent and the Heijlman reference, the Board of Appeals said:</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">\u201cWhile the specification does not so state, the structure of the claims appealed involves an improvement or carrying forward of one of the features of applicant\u2019s prior patent above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">\u201cIn the patent applicant proposed, by exerting pressure on the packing 20 through its gland, to produce sufficient longitudinal movement of the valve to break it loose from its seat and permit its lubrication. The claims at bar are directed to the accomplishment of the same function, the alleged improvement residing in the provision of a shoulder on the plug whereby a more positive thrusting action may be communicated to the plug by longitudinal movement of the packing.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">\u201cThis seems to us to be an obvious remedy for any lack of efficiency that might have been inherent in the patented structure. It is an old expedient to shoulder a valve plug for the reception of packing as shown by Heijlman and while the patent may not teach t\u00fce efficacy of shouldering for applicant\u2019s particular purpose we believe this to he an inherent and obvious advantage of Heijlman\u2019s structure. It would obviously be possible by a proper manipulation of the glands of the Heijlman valve to effect a desired adjustment of the plug in accordance with the teachings of applicant\u2019s patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">In the Examiner\u2019s statement in the record we find the following: \u201c * * * Applicant has merely modified the Martin patent by providing the plug with a shoulder to receive the direct and full thrust of the packing instead of utilizing merely the vertical component of the thrust against a tapered surface, the functions of both structures, however, remaining the .same. Heijlman, however, has shown that this variation is not new in the art since he shows the packing in the lower end of the valve easing seating on shoulders on both the plug and casing to seal the joint between the two and to effect a direct thrust on the plug to move it longitudinally, as brought out in lines 45 to 51, of page 2 of his specification. Consequently, to substitute this Heijlman packing-arrangement for that of Martin does not involve any invention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">We are -in accord with the views of the Patent Office tribunals above quoted. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>are of the opinion that the claims in issue involve nothing more than a substitution of a form of tapered plug and seat having shoulders, as disclosed by Ileijlman, for the tapered plug and sent shown in appellant\u2019s patent, and that this substitution would be obvious to one skilled in the art as soon as any defect was disclosed in the functioning of appellant\u2019s patented packing arrangement. Therefore such substitution would not involve the exercise of the inventive faculty.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
