The total tax thus de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>termined shall be computed, collected and paid in the same manner, at the same time and subject to the same provisions of law, including penalties, as other taxes under this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The taxpayer contends that his gain made taxable by section 202 (a) was \u201ccapital net gain\u201d under section 206 (a) (4) from \u201ccapital gain\u201d under 206 (a) (1) derived from \u201ccapital assets\u201d as intended to be defined by section 206 (a) (6), and therefore he is entitled to the benefits of section 206 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The difficulty in maintaining this position is that the act of 1921, divided as it is into different sections, dealing with different matters and situations, does no more by section 202 (a) (2) than say that he shall pay a tax on the difference between what his donor paid for the stoek and the sale price thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The percentage of tax thereon is prescribed by the later sections 210 and 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">But section 206 comes between, and offers an alternative method of computing the tax to any individual taxpayer who for any taxable year derives a capital net gain (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">And it does more. It contains its own definition of \u201ccapital net gain\u201d as being the excess of the total amount of \u201ccapital gain\u201d over the sum of the capital deductions and capital losses. Section 206 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">And it also contains its own definition of \u201ccapital gain\u201d as being taxable gain from the sale or exchange of \u201ccapital assets.\u201d Section 206 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">While its sixth and final definition is that of \u201ccapital assets\u201d as property acquired and held by the taxpayer for profit or investment for more than two years. Section 206 (a) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">By that definition, Congress indicated a purpose to benefit by 206 (b) only taxpayers (other than corporations) who, having acquired property, held it for profit or investment for more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">And a purpose was also indicated thereby to exclude from such benefits corporations and holders of property for a shorter period than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">The taxpayer having held his stoek less than a day does not come within the provisions of section 206 (b) unless, as he claims, he is entitled to rely on the time his donor held it before him, and stand in his donor\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">This he claims the right to do on the theory that the price paid for the stoek by his donor having been made the basis for1 determining the taxable gain by section 202 (a) (2), the time held by donor having contributed to its increase in value, and the tax having devolved on him instead of his donor, Congress intended that he should have the benefits of section 206 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">He suggests that his donor could have availed himself of that section had he sold the stock at the time of the gift and given him the proceeds instead of the stoek.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">It is true the donor might have done this, and might have benefited thereby, because he would have been in the class intended to be benefited, and in the situation provided for by the statute, but not so the purchaser of the stock, and it is in the shoes of the purchaser rather than of the donor that the taxpayer stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">This statute was intended to benefit taxpaying vendors, not their vendees or donees, except, possibly, by indirection, in procuring a lower price.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">Two things were necessary for its availability to a taxpayer: First, a holding for more than two years; and, second, a sale resulting in a taxable gain to which the statute could apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-19\">This donor by his donation became neither a vendor malting a taxable gain, nor such a taxpayer as the statute contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">He was not entitled to the benefits of section 206 (b), and there was nothing in existence to which that section could apply, or on which it could operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-21\">Since the donor had no rights under that section for himself, he had none to transmit to his donee, and, since the statute does not otherwise provide a right for the appellant, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
