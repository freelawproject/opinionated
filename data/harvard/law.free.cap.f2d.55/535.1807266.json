Tolman v. Tolman, 1 App. D. C. 299; Shaw v. Shaw, 2 App. D. C. 204; Lesh v. Lesh, 21 App. D. C. 475; Reed v. Reed, 52 App. D. C. 36, 280 F. 1009; Wygodsky v. Wygodsky, 134 Md. 344, 106 A. 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-27\">But in this ease there is no showing of any abuse of discretion, and no answer to the bill into which we might look for such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-28\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
