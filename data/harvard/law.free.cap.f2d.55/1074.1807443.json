Upon a plea of guilty as charged in the fourth count, a nolle prosequi was entered as to the other three counts which set out in haee verba the reverse side of a Federal Reserve note of the same denomination as that referred to in the fourth count. The various offenses are alleged to have occurred on the same date. This appeal was taken from an order of the District Court. discharging the writ of habeas corpus which had been issued upon appellant\u2019s petition, and remanding him to custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-20\">It may be assumed that the fourth count, which it is apparent was based on 18 USCA \u00a7 264, was subject to demurrer on the ground that it did not with sufficient definiteness and certainty describe the Federal Reserve note; but we are of opinion that it was not void, or so defective as that appellant could not plead it in bar of a subsequent prosecution. A bill of particulars, if in view of the other substantive counts one was needed, would have enabled appellant to prepare his defense. So we think that any defect in the indictment was cured after verdict. 28 USCA \u00a7 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
