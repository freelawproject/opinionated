On the same day the appellant filed another application for trademark registration, serial No. 259,034, comprising the single word \u201cTiffinware,\u201d the first part of the mark being printed in black block type, and the second part in smaller script type, to be also nsed upon glass tableware.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">The appellee filed notices of opposition against the registration of these marks, and thereafter the Examiner of Interferences, the cases having been consolidated in the Patent Office, dismissed the notices of opposition and permitted registration. On appeal to the Commissioner of Patents, this decision was reversed, and registration was denied in both eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-20\">There is no proof of actual confusion in the record, and the decision of the matter depends upon an examination of the marks themselves. The opposer discloses, by the record, that it is the owner of three marks, namely, \u201cTiffany\u201d and \u201cTiffany &amp; Co.,\u201d both of which were registered in the United States Patent Office on August 31,1920, and a trademark consisting of a monogram having a large letter \u201cT,\u201d upon the <em>stem of </em>which is superimposed the character surrounded by an \u201c0,\u201d which, in turn, is surrounded by a \u201cC,\u201d registered on November 6,1928. All of these marks are shown to be used upon table glassware. The opposer shows by the stipulation on file that it has succeeded to a business which has been carried on since 1837; that it was incorporated in 1868, and since its organization has been selling jewelry, glassware, and like goods; that the words \u201cTiffany &amp; Co.\u201d and \u201cTiffany\u201d have been nsed as a trade-mark on said goods since 1853; and that the mark \u201cT &amp; Co.\u201d has been used as a mark since 1878, these various marks being affixed, in practice, to the ware being sold by being printed on or burned into the merchandise, or attached thereto- by stickers, tags, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-21\">It appears that the applicant, from 1914 to 1927, was in the habit of using stickers to designate its wares, one form of whieh consisted of a shield hearing thereon a monogram comprising the letters \u201cUSGCo,\u201d and, in another form, a small oblong mark, with cut comers, bearing thereon the words \u201cTiffin Quality Handmade,\u201d and with a dollar sign as a part of said design.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-22\">In 1927 the appellant adopted its present marks, and has since used them. In the Patent Office the syllable \u201cware\u201d in the word \u201cTiffinware\u201d was disclaimed apart from the mark sought to be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-23\">Both parties hereto manufacture a high-grade quality of glassware, and have extensive sales. The appellant has one of its fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tories in the city of Tiffin, Ohio, and contends that this was the reason, originally, that the word \u201cTiffin\u201d was used in connection with its marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"> There is only one question primarily involved in this matter; namely, that of likelihood of confusion. The methods of using these marks are substantially' the same in practice, and it becomes material to inquire whether one who was about to purchase high-grade glassware, such as is made by these parties, would be apt to be confused as to origin by the use of the marks which the appellant seeks to register. We are of opinion the Commissioner arrived at the right conclusion in this respect. \u201cTiffinware\u201d is much like \u201cTiffany\u201d in sound, and in appearance . especially when placed on a small label as these marks are ordinarily used.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The monogram mark which is sought to be registered has, as its predominant feature, a large letter \u201cT,\u201d which is also the predominant mark of the opposer in its monogram mark. These letters are of the same character and have-the same peculiarities. The use of the word \u201cTiffin\u201d with this monogram does not help the matter any, for it also bears a confusing similarity to \u201cTiffany.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Whatever may have been the motive of the appellant for - so doing, in 1927, it abandoned the use of the initials \u201cUSGCo\u201d upon its labels. These initials were, to a degree, identifying, and might well serve to make some distinction between the marks of the opposer and the appellant. The present marks, however, which are sought to be registered, are, in our judgment, apt to be confusing, and hence should not be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In addition, if the word \u201cTiffin\u201d in the mark \u201cTiffinware\u201d is intended to designate the city in which one of the factories of appellant is located, it is clearly geographical If it is not, as appellant argues, but rather has the meaning of the name of a meal, such as a luncheon, then it is descriptive, for there is no real difference in principle between saying \u201cTiffinware\u201d in such a ease and \u201ctableware\u201d or \u201cluneheonware.\u201d As so used, the words describe simply a kind of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Even if it were conceded that there is any doubt about the registrability of these marks, that doubt should be resolved against the newcomer in the field. B. E. Goodrich Co. v. Hoekmeyer, 17 C. C. P. A. 1068, 40 F.(2d) 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The decision of'the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
