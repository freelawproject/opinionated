The plaintiff, in his complaint, claimed judgment for $787, and interest from August 7, 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">The defendants Gilbert Lefevre and Henry S. Yan Etten served an offer of judgment, under section 385 of the Code, for $500, the penalty of the bond, and interest from August 7, 1861, and the costs of the action. The plaintiff did not accept the offer, but went to trial on his complaint, and failed to recover more than the amount of the offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-6\">The defendant Hardee made no offer for judgment, but answered in the case, but failed to appear at the trial.

The said defendants Lefevre and Yan Etten now appeal to the general term from the order of Justice Peckham.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-10\">M.

The judgment which the plaintiff in fact obtained was a judgment against all the defendants, for $500 and interest, besides costs. The judgment which the defendant offered to the plaintiff was a judgment for the same amount against only two of the four defendants. The former judgment entitled the plaintiff to collect the amount of it from the joint property of all the defendants, and from the individual property of any one of them. The latter judgment entitled the plaintiff to collect the same only from the interest of Van Btten and Lefevre in the joint property of the defendants, and from the individual property of Van Btten or Lefevre.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">I do not think the latter judgment can be said to be as favorable to the plaintiff as the one he actually recovered, and therefore he was not, at the peril of being subjected to costs, bound to accept it. The Code did not, I think, by authorizing this offer, intend to deprive the plaintiff of any substantial benefit which he could secure by continuing the litigation, but only to protect the defendant from needless expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In construing the defendant\u2019s offer, I have assumed that it was designed to be limited to a judgment against Van Btten and Lefevre. The offer is in terms made by them alone, and is signed by attorneys professing to act for them alone. It is true the language is, \u201c offer to let judgment be taken,\u201d without saying \u201c against them;\u201d but I think it must be construed the same as if the words \u201c against them\u201d had been added : 1, because section 385 ' of the-Code provides that the defendant may serve an offer \u201c to allow judgment to be taken against him;\u201d 2, because, even if two out of four joint defendants have the power to authorize a joint judgment to be taken against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>all. (which I do not decide,) I think the offer should be clear and unequivocal on that point, and not subject to misconstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">If I am right in the position already taken, the decision of the judge at special term was correct. But I will discuss an additional point in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I am inclined to think the offer should be a practical one\u2014one of which the plaintiff may avail himself, at once and absolutely, without asking the aid or permission of the court, and without endangering his proceedings against the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The section of the Code in question, (\u00a7 385,) provides that the plaintiff may, within ten days, by notice in writing to that effect, accept the offer, and in such case may file the summons, complaint, offer, and affidavit of notice of acceptance, and the clerk must thereupon enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Now, in the first place, it is not clear that the plaintiff may, on his own motion, sever the action by entering judgment against two of the joint defendants, and preserve the action in full vigor against the other two ; for section 214 of the Code provides that \u201cin an action against several defendants, the court may, in its discretion, render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed against the others, whenever a several judgment may be proper.\u201d It would appear, therefore, to be in the discretion of the court, and not at the election of the plaintiff, whether the action shall be severed. If the plaintiff, therefore, availed himself of the defendant\u2019s offer, and entered judgment, it may be questionable whether he would not thereby discontinue the action against the defendants who had not united in the offer. I think it was not intended that he should subject himself to \"such a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Nor do I think he should be compelled to go to the court and seek permission to sever the action, before he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>could safely accept the offer. He might or. might not have time to do so within the ten days; he might or might not succeed if he made the attempt. And I do not think the lawmakers meant to expose him to so many embarrassments and contingencies, at the risk of paying costs to his adversary if he did not. My impression is, the offer must be one which the plaintiff may immediately and absolutely accept, and enter judgment thereon without question as to his power to do so, and without impairing or imperiling his remedy against other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Entertaining an opinion adverse to the defendant on the questions thus far discussed, I do not deem it necessary to consider the further question, whether an offer of compromise under this section, in order to be available, must be made in behalf of all the defendants, or of all the defendants who have appeared and defended, or of all the defendants except those as to whom the cause is in a situation to perfect judgment. There are many considerations in favor of such a construction, which did not strike me so forcibly when the question was first presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">I think the decision of the motion at special term was right, and that the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
