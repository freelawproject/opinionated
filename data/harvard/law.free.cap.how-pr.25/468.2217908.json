It admitted that, prior to June 12, 1858, the defendant Ward had been the owner of one-fourth of the schooner, but alleged that on that day he had been deprived of possession of her by an attachment issued against him at the instance of defendant Ruckman, the owner of the remaining three-fourths, since which period he had never had any custody, control or participation in the vessel or her employment, but, on the contrary, he had brought his action against Ruckman, for a conversion of his interest, which suit is still pending; and that the alleged charter party had been made without authority from him and without his knowledge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-6\">Jer.

It bound him to carry such lumber as his vessel could not carry, and such as he, necessarily, refused to carry.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">As to the liability of the defendants : The master, in the home port, could not bind the owners personally, by a charter party, without authority for that purpose, to be proved by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The proof certainly does not show any such authority from Ward, of whose part of the vessel Ruckman had, by legal proceedings, divested Ward of the possession; and by suing for the conversion, Ward had abandoned all claim to regain possession or control. He had elected his remedy, and thereby became no longer an owner entitled to recover or have possession of the specific property, but at most was able to get only its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The authority from Ruckman, as proved in the agreement for running the vessel, hardly amounts to an authority to bind by a charter party.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Judgment for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
