That the court had no jurisdiction of the motion; the moving papers not showing that a transcript of the judgment had been filed with the county clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">As to this, it appeared that he had issued an execution on the judgment to the sheriff, and as an execution out of a district court can only issue to a constable, <em>(see district court act, Laws of </em>1857, <em>ch. </em>344, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 52,) it must be presumed that a transcript had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">II. That it did not appear that the undertaking given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>was in the form prescribed for staying proceedings on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The affidavit clearly indicated\u2014indeed, the only inference that can be drawn from it is\u2014that the undertaking was one in the usual form for staying proceedings. But as no objection to its form or sufficiency was made, below, it cannot now be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">III. That if the execution was irregularly issued, the notice of motion was defective in not specifying the irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">There was no question of irregularity involved in the motion. The plaintiff, in violation of law, had issued an execution, under which he was about seizing the defendant\u2019s property. No mere question of practice was involved in such an act, but a substantial grievance, which the defendant was entitled to have remedied without regard to forms or technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
