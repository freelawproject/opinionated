The action was brought to trial at the November circuit, 1860, before Sutherland, J., and a jury. The package, containing $68,163, was composed of divers smaller packages received by the Park Bank from different banks and individuals, and by that bank put up together in one package without counting it, and sealed up in a bag and forwarded by Kingsley\u2019s express -to the defendant\u2019s bank at Boston. The package was delivered and receipted for as the sum of $68,163. The defendant, after counting the various packages, insisted that the package from the office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>plaintiffs, receipted for as containing the sum of $6,900, was $300 short; in other words, that there was in fact but $6,600 in said package, and that the receipt given by them was given upon the mistaken supposition that it contained $6,900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">The plaintiffs on the trial proved the counting of the said package by three or four different persons, and that in fact it contained $6,900. They further proved that the bills had then been done up in a package, and that it was not thereafter opened or disturbed until it was delivered at the counter of the defendant\u2019s bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">Upon the cross-examination of one of the plaintiffs, (De Mott,) he testified that his firm were depositors at the Park Bank; that they had a right to draw against the $6,900 ; that his firm allowed the Park Bank a certain rate of discount, and that they paid such discount at the time the deposit was made ; that the deposit was passed to the credit of the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs had a right to draw against it the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">On his further re-direct examination he said that the arrangement under which the money was deposited was entered into by his partner Bostwick, and not by himself. The plaintiff Bostwick testified that he made the arrangement with the Park Bank, under which the bills in question were sent; that said contract was, that the bank would receive said bills and send them through to the Bank of Mutual Redemption as agents for said firm, and that the Park Bank was not to count the money, but simply to receive the packages and send them through to the Bank of Mutual Redemption, and in no event to be responsible for any loss, miscount, or counterfeit bills; that subsequent to sending the bills in question, and before the commencement of this suit, his firm had settled all accounts with the Park Bank, and that said Park Bank had accounted for the money as $6,600, leaving the said plaintiffs to pursue their remedy against the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>for the remaining $300. In this statement he was fully corroborated by the teller of the Park Bank, who also testified that the Park Bank had no claim against any one for the money in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-5\">When the plaintiffs rested, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was not brought in the name of the real party in interest; that it should' have been brought in the name of the Park Bank. The court decided that the objection was well taken, and dismissed the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel applied to the court to settle the exception on the spot, and sign the same as required by the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-7\">The court at length settled the exception as follows : \u201c The complaint dismissed on the ground that the plaintiffs have shown no right to bring the action.\u201d Prom this the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-8\">Upon the argument at the general term the court inquired of the defendant\u2019s counsel whether the court at circuit dismissed the complaint on the ground that the action was not brought in the name of the real party in interest, and that it should have been brought in the name of the Park Bank; and whether that was the meaning of the exception as settled by the judge who tried the cause. To which the defendant\u2019s counsel replied that it was.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-9\">I. T. Williams, <em>for plaintiffs.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-10\">C. E. Soule, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b320-11\">By the court, Ingeaham, P. Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A04\">The evidence in this case, we think, showed facts sufficient as to the plaintiffs\u2019 title, to let the case go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">It was proven that the Park Bank agreed with the plaintiffs to take their packages without being responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>for the count, and pass them unopened to the defendant, and that this package was sent under that arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">It was proved, also, on cross-examination of another witness, that the Park Bank charged a rate of discount on hills deposited as these were, and that plaintiffs were allowed to draw on the amount deposited for transmission, and the deposit passed to the plaintiffs\u2019 credit by the Park Bank, and if the package was short the plaintiffs were to make it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">It was also proven that before the commencement of this action, the Park Bank returned to the plaintiffs the package as received by them, and that the plaintiffs paid the bank the deficiency. These facts were sufficient to submit to the jury the question whether the Park Bank had not, by returning the package as soon as the mistake was discovered, refused to accept the same under the contract, and if so, whether the title was not still in the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">It could hardly be said to be erroneous if the jury had been so instructed as matter of law. The nonsuit was improperly granted, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
