The records show that the cause of- action upon which the plaintiff recovered judgment was somewhat novel. It was technically called \u201c malicious trespass.\u201d The defendant sought to collect a milk bill. The plaintiff tendered him all, and even more than he believed to be due; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>he demanded a still greater sum, and would not receive what was offered. On several occasions, but particularly on New Year\u2019s day, the defendant spent about three hours in front of the plaintiff\u2019s door, with his wagon, occasionally ascending the steps, and speaking of the plaintiff (who is a young lady) to her callers as they came and went, in most offensive language. Although somewhat mortified, the plaintiff was resolute, and sought redress in court for the defendant\u2019s trespasses. Judge Robertson granted the original order of arrest, holding the defendant to bail in $1,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\">The sheriff\u2019s jury rendered a verdict for $500 and costs. Execution was issued against defendant\u2019s property and subsequently against his person, upon which he gave bail for the limits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">' Defendant now petitions for his discharge under article 6-of the Revised Statutes.

The defence was, a voluntary return of the prisoner to the jail liberties before suit brought. To which it was replied, that the voluntary return of the prisoner within the limits did not purge the escape; that to entitle the defendant to a verdict, he should have proved that the prisoner returned within the walls of the prison. In delivering the opinion of the court, Spencer, J., said: <em>ee </em>It has been frequently decided in this court, since the statute allowing gaol liberties, that the sheriff may let a prisoner in execution go within the liberties without taking a bond, which is for his indemnity; and this opinion is supported by the case of <em>Bonafous </em>agt. Walker, (2 <em>Term R., </em>26.) Ashurst, J., says, in that case, that the statute, 8 and 9 <em>Wm.} </em>establishing the rules, makes them <em>e </em>to all intents and purposes the same as the walls of the prison.9 <em>If so, then the prisoners in execution are within the prison, whilst on the </em>limits.\u201d\u2014Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-11\">Robertson, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ABK\">There are two questions in this case : First, whether the court has jurisdiction to grant a discharge where the debtor is at large upon the limits; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>and, secondly, whether the court has lost jurisdiction by the omission to adjourn the proceedings from the time noticed for the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In regard to the first question, the term used in the statute is \u201c imprisoned,\u201d and the discharge is from \u201c imprisonment.\u201d (2 <em>R. S., </em>31, \u00a7 1.) The sixth section provides that the court where the application is made shall \u201c order the applicant 'to be brought before it\u201d on a day to be assigned, and on such other days as it may appoint during the same term. <em>(Id., </em>32, \u00a7 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The sheriff is required to discharge the debtor, on the order of the court. <em>(Id., </em>33, \u00a7 11.) The assignees are required, out of the property assigned, to pay \u201c the jail fees on the imprisonment and discharge.\u201d In the same statute, if a person \u201c charged in execution\u201d has not applied for three months to be discharged, the creditors may apply to compel an assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">These various provisions seem to point out a party in close custody, particularly that which relates to the direction to bring the party before the court, and do not seem to be intended to relieve a party having the privilege of going at large over the whole island of New York. For such cases the previous article to relieve insolvent debtors from imprisonment furnishes sufficient relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The other question of a loss of jurisdiction I think is still more clear. Proceedings upon the return of an execution unsatisfied are analogous in regard to jurisdiction, and the failure to adjourn the same regularly in that case has been held to amount to a discontinuance. <em>(Squire </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>1 <em>Bosw., </em>690.) In cases like the present, the court is required to assign the days during the same term in which the application is made when it will hear the applicant. It is also authorized to adjourn the proceedings to the next term, on the application of a creditor, and then all objections to form must be waived, (\u00a7 8,) but not beyond that time. (2 <em>R. S., </em>32, \u00a7 7.) These specific di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>rections are evidently intended to deprive the court of all discretion as to the time of adjournment. It must fix the time of hearing while it has jurisdiction, at least until the court have ordered an assignment. I think the failure to have a day assigned at the adjourned day discontinued the proceedings, and I have no jurisdiction to make any order. The excuse assigned also for not attending at the adjourned day to adjourn the case further, does not seem to me sufficient. The applicant had a counsel who could as easily have reached the court-house as any other party. A distance of four miles even, which is more than the actual distance of the residence of the party from the court, is hardly sufficient to prevent any one who desired it from getting there, even without the usual conveyances. If I had the power, I do not think I ought to interfere. There is no great hardship or delay in requiring the party to renew his application, as the notice required is but for fourteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The motion must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
