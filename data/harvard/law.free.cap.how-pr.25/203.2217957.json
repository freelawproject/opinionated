If such a verdict would be set aside, then there was no error in dismissing the complaint, and the exceptions must be held to be untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The complaint in substance is, \u201c that on or about the 23d day of December, 1853, the plaintiffs bargained and sold the said defendant at his Request, at said city, for cash, a quantity of Canada wheat in store, to wit, about six thousand three hundred bushels, at the price of one dollar and sixty-five cents per bushel, the number of bushels to be ascertained by weight; that on or about the 27th day of December, the plaintiffs bargained and sold to the defendant, at his request, at said city, for cash, a quantity of 1 Canada wheat, in store, to wit, about ten thousand four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>hundred and eleven bushels, at and for the price of one dollar and seventy-five cents per bushel, the number of bushels to be ascertained by weight; that said wheat was weighed and the number of bushels thereby ascertained, and the weigher\u2019s certificate thereof thereupon delivered to said defendant, &amp;c.; that certain payments on account of said two purchases were made on the 7th, 11th and 12th days of January, 1854 ; that there is still due and owing to said plaintiffs from said defendant the balance of $273.13, with interest from the 12th day of January, 1854,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The answer denies the quantity of wheat delivered as alleged in the complaint; avers the payments as specified therein, and that the \u201c sum paid on the 12th of January, 1854, was in full payment of all the wheat ever before that' time purchased of the plaintiffs by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u25a0The defendant further alleges \u201c that the amount of said payment was computed and adjusted between the defendant and plaintiffs upon weighers\u2019 certificates of the weight and quantity of said wheat, furnished by the plaintiffs to the defendant shortly, before such payments were made, and the defendant paid to said plaintiffs the full amount which appeared to be due from him to them by said certificates,\u201d &amp;c. And further, \u201c that all said wheat was shipped by defendant to France, and invoiced by him and sold by him in France at the amount as to quantity stated in said certificates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The action appears to have been commenced in September, 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The weighers testified that they weighed the wheat in question and sent returns thereof to the plaintiffs, who never claimed to them that there was error. It was admitted \u201c that the plaintiffs had the wheat weighed on its delivery to defendant, and before the 12th day of January, 1854, sent to defendant a bill, with the weighers\u2019 certificates annexed, by both of which certificate's and bill it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>appeared that the quantity delivered to the defendant was as follows: Under sale of December 23____6,225 bushels ; \u201c \u201c ,27____10,278 \u201c and the whole amount of the bill, at the price of $1.65 a bushel for the first mentioned parcel, and $1.75 for the second mentioned parcel, was (including therein one-half of the expenses of weighing the same) $28,302.62. Thereupon the defendant paid the plaintiffs on account of and in settlement of the bill -the following amounts at the following dates :</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">January, 7, 1854, . . . $12,000 00</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u201c 11, \u201c . . . . 9,000 00</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u201c 11, \u201c ... 5,000 00</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">\u201c 12, \u201c . . . . 2,302 62</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">and on the occasion of the last payment the plaintiffs delivered to the defendant a receipt, of which the following is a copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">\u201c \u2018 New York, <em>12th </em>January, 1854.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-14\">\u201c 1 Received from A. Carpentier two thousand three hundred and two dollars and sixty-two cents, balance in full purchase of wheat as per account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-15\">\u201c 1 Gillespie, Dean <em>&amp; </em>Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-16\">\u201c \u2018 <em>Per G. M. Clebburn.\u2019 </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-17\">\u201c The defendant was a commission merchant, and had bought the wheat on an order from <em>France; </em>as soon as the defendant bought, he shipped it to France, drew bills against the shipment and settled with his correspondent in France, and according to the measurements in the weighers\u2019 certificates and plaintiffs\u2019 bill delivered to defendant by plaintiffs, receiving payment only for the amount therein stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">It was not until after all this had happened that plaintiffs claimed that there was an error or that defendant had heard of the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-19\">The question of law arises upon this state of facts, whether the plaintiffs are estopped from claiming that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>point of fact the second lot of wheat weighed \u201c ten thousand three hundred and ninety-two and 62-100 bushels,\u201d as alleged in the complaint, instead of \u201c ten thousand two hundred and seventy-eight bushels,\u201d as stated in the weigher\u2019s certificate as returned to the defendant by the plaintiffs as per their account rendered as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Admissions, whether of law or of fact, which have been acted upon by others, are conclusive against the party making them, in all cases between him and the person whose conduct he has thus influenced. (1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>\u00a7 207.) It makes no difference in the operation of this rule whether the thing admitted be true or false; it being the fact that it has been acted upon that renders it conclusive. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Judge Bronson, approving of the decision in 8 <em>Wend. R., </em>483, <em>(Welland Canal Co. </em>agt. Hathaway,) in his dissenting opinion in 3 <em>Hill\u2019s R., </em>220, <em>(Dezelt </em>agt. <em>Odell,) </em>in discussing the question of estoppel, says : \u201c Before the party is concluded it must appear, 1st. That he has made an admission which is clearly inconsistent with the evidence he proposes to give, or the title or claim which he proposes to set up ; 2d. That the other party has acted upon the admission ; and 3d. That he will be injured by allowing the truth of the admission to be disproved.\u201d The authorities upon this point are numerous, and all speak the same language. <em>(Frost </em>agt. <em>The Saratoga Mutual Ins. Co., </em>5 <em>Denio R., </em>154, <em>and cases cited at p. </em>158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u2022 The number of bushels of wheat was, by the agreement of the parties to this action, \u201cto be ascertained by weight.\u201d The plaintiffs allege as a material averment in their complaint, that the whole was weighed and the number of bushels thereby ascertained, and \u201c the weigher\u2019s certificate thereupon delivered to said defendant.\u201d These returns of weight were so delivered by the plaintiffs, <em>(fols. </em>61, 65.) It is clearly inconsistent now to set up that the weight was in excess of what those certificates exhibited. The defendant acted upon the proposed correctness of the certificates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>in making his payments on account of his purchases; in making the payment of the 12th of January, 1854, which the plaintiff received \u201c as balance in full purchase of wheat,\u201d as per account, which they thus again repeated was without error; in the shipment of the wheat to France, drawing bills against the shipments, and settling with his correspondent in France, relying upon the measurements in the weighers\u2019 certificates and the bill of the <em>plaintiffs; </em>and in receiving payment only for the quantity stated in those returns. The defendant, assuming it to be true that a greater number of bushels of wheat was actually delivered to him than the certificates and the plaintiffs\u2019 account specified, must necessarily suffer by permitting the plaintiffs now to assert the claim, <em>(Cheever </em>agt. Smith, 15 <em>J. R., </em>276 ;) he is thereby deprived of the opportunity of establishing the true measurement, and of corroborating the truth of their assertion in January, 1854; he is left for two years with its silent indorsement of the certificates being correct; he has drawn upon his principal upon that basis, and a settlement has been made. It seems quite clear that good conscience requires that the plaintiffs should not, under such circumstances, be permitted to speak in derogation of their claim as made in 1854, and acquiesced in for two years subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The complaint was therefore properly dismissed, and judgment must be entered upon the verdict for the defendant, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
