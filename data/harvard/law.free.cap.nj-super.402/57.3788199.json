Ordinarily, such actions are statutory proceedings designed to accord landlords an expeditious and inexpensive means of regaining possession of leased premises as authorized by statute. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Hodges v. Sasil Corp., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>210, 220, 915 A.2d 1 (2007). A tenant may raise lack of habitability claims in such proceedings, however, and obtain a <em>Marini </em>hearing, provided the tenant deposits the rent with the Clerk of the Court. <em>Marini v. Ireland, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); <em>Demirci v. Burns, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 276, 306 A.2d 468 (App.Div.1973) (finding <em>Marini </em>equally applicable in commercial tenancies and applying the holding of <em>Marini </em>to a commercial tenancy dispute); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-55. In this case, defendant requested such a hearing but did not deposit the rent as required. Accordingly, the trial court entered a judgment for possession. Thereafter, defendant vacated the commercial premises, which has since been re-rented. Consequently the appeal is moot and we are constrained to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Nonetheless, we elect to comment on the nature of the proceedings conducted in the trial court because we have noted certain irregularities. When defendant initially appeared before the trial court on May 8, 2007, the court recognized that defendant required an interpreter and stated that a court-approved interpreter would be needed for trial. The trial court, however, permitted defendant\u2019s brother to serve as an interpreter for the May 8 appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Defendant\u2019s brother\u2019s name was not placed on the record and he was not put under oath as an interpreter or a witness. Rather than interpret, it appears from the record that the brother served as an advocate for defendant. We do not know if he had the ability to interpret for defendant, as he seemed somewhat limited in his own ability to speak English. Further, defendant\u2019s brother did not appear to understand the role of an interpreter in the process. He seemed to think a trial was taking place at which defendant was not being given the opportunity to present his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The brother raised the defense that defendant had to remedy a leaking roof on the store, as well as other habitability defects, indicating defendant had deducted the cost of these repairs from the rent. The brother advocated that the rent paid was appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ate in light of the poor condition of the rented store which defendant repaired. The trial court ordered a <em>Marini </em>hearing, directing defendant to deposit $4,088, the total back rent owed, with the court that day. When defendant\u2019s brother continued to argue, the trial court threatened to incarcerate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Defendant next appeared in court on May 25, 2007. This time, a court-approved interpreter was utilized. Apparently, defendant had not understood that he was to have immediately deposited the rent with the court in order to preserve his right to a hearing. He claimed to have spent $40,000 to repair and improve the rented store. When defendant offered to pay the entire back rent immediately in order to obtain a hearing, the trial court denied the request, indicating it had been \u201cclear\u201d at the May 8 hearing that the money had to be deposited that day. He then entered judgment for possession in favor of the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that defendant was deprived of a full and fair opportunity to be heard as a result of not having had a court-approved interpreter from the outset. The Standards for Delivering Interpreting Services in the New Jersey Judiciary provide that \u201c[a]ll people, including persons with limited proficiency in English, should have equal access to court proceedings, programs and services.\u201d Administrative Office of the Courts, Directive #3-04 (AOC Directive # 3-04) (March 22, 2004), <em>available at </em>http://www.judieiary.state.nj.us/directive/ personneVdir_03_04.pdf. <em>See also, State v. Ehrenberg, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 316 fn. 4, 664 A.2d 1301 (Law Div.1994), <em>citing State v. Kounelis, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super </em>420, 609 A.2d 1310 (App.Div. 1992) (noting that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:8-1 requires that interpreting services be provided for eases in the Law Division and Family Part \u201cin the manner established by the Chief Justice\u201d); <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super </em>129, 682 A.2d 764 (Law Div.1996) (finding appellant\u2019s constitutional rights to counsel and to confront witnesses violated where a Spanish-speaking court-approved interpreter was not present for all of appellant\u2019s hearings in municipal court on a drunk driving charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The following Standards are applicable here. In any proceeding where a transcript may be made, an interpreter must be utilized to assist any person with limited proficiency in English who is a named party. <em>Id. </em>at Standard 1.2. Additionally, \u201c[ijnterpreters should be provided whenever a failure of communication may have significant negative repercussions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Standard 1.2. The judiciary should only use interpreters registered with the New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts and the use of family members and friends as interpreters should be avoided. <em>Id. </em>at Standard 1.3. The interpreter should be provided free of charge, absent an abusive request for such service. <em>Id. </em>at Standard 1.4. All interpreters must take an oath and state his or her name and status as an official interpreter on the record before beginning to interpret. <em>Id. </em>at Standard 3.2. Moreover, if a court-approved interpreter is not reasonably available and there is an emergent matter, a telephone interpreter should be used. Administrative Office of the Courts, Directive # 14-01, Standard 1 (April 24, 2001), <em>available at </em>http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/directive/vicops/ dirl4_01.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In this case defendant was not afforded the services of a court-approved interpreter and it is not clear that he understood what was required in order to receive a hearing on his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Because the court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to determining the issue of the landlord\u2019s right to possession of the premises, and, as previously noted, the tenant vacated the premises and the premises have been re-rented, the issue can no longer be determined. Nonetheless, we are constrained to add that if defendant feels aggrieved by the disposition, he may still pursue a remedy in the Law Division. <em>See Academy Spires, Inc. v. Jones, </em>108 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 400, 261 A.2d 413 (Law Div.1970) (stating a landlord who unjustifiably seeks and obtains possession may later be held to respond in damages and citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-59, <em>Construction and Renting Corp. v. Stein, </em>6 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 70 A.2d 877 (App.Div.1950), and <em>Lyster v. Berberich, </em>3 <em>N.J.Super. </em>78, 65 A.2d 632 (App.Div.1949)). We do not suggest that such an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>should be pursued or would have a favorable outcome; we simply point out that there are means of relief for an aggrieved tenant other than retention of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The appeal of the judgment for possession is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
