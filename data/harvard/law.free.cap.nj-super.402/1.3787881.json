He contends that the trial judge applied the wrong standard of damages and wrongly entered judgment against only one of the defendants. We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">In his complaint, plaintiff sought $5,000 in damages against named entities and corporate defendants for \u201cunsolicited faxes\u201d or facsimile communications. At the hearing he also sought treble damages. The $500 judgment was entered only against Construction Services and Supply, Inc., whereas plaintiff sought damages of $500 (trebled to $1,500) \u201cfor each and every violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act,\u201d and \u201cpunitive damages ... of at least $15,000\u201d against defendants Howard S. Bixenholtz and Stucco Services, Inc., for sending plaintiff unauthorized faxes after he requested that they not be sent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Plaintiff alleges that \u201c[flaxes were sent from six different companies, all having the same phone number, address and website listed with the exception of one of the faxes.\u201d He also asserts that because, with one exception, the offending entities were not in existence, Bixenholtz \u201ccannot hide behind the corporate veil.\u201d Plaintiff insists that \u201cthe unsolicited faxes transmitted to plaintiff failed to identify in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page or on the first page of the transmission the telephone number of the sender or of such business, other entity, or individual in violation of a section of the TCPA, 47 <em>U.S.C.A </em>227(d)(1)(B),\u201d and the implementing regulations! In sum, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>seeks an award of $500 for \u201ceach and every violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and treble damages of $1,500\u201d \u201cfor each and every violation.\u201d He also seeks entry of a judgment with \u201cpunitive damages\u201d for \u201cat least $15,000,\u201d holding Bixenholtz \u201cjointly and severally liable along with Stucco Services, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Plaintiff testified he \u201ctelephoned Mr. Bixenholtz and asked him ... please do not fax my machine.\u201d Plaintiff asserted defendant continued to send \u201ccommercial solicitation for stucco, siding, soffit facie [and] gutters\u201d in the name of \u201capproximately five different defendants, fictitious entities.\u201d According to plaintiff, Bixenholtz continued to send the faxes, even after he was served with the complaint, which evidenced \u201cknowing and willful[ ]\u201d conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Defendant Bixenholtz, a stucco contractor, acknowledged \u201cus[ing] the fax machine to solicit business\u201d from general contractors. He stated he \u201c[took] off the list\u201d people who do not want to receive faxes, and \u201cdidn\u2019t know that this was illegal in any way.\u201d He operated under different names and entities including Stucco Services, Inc., \u201ca current operating company.\u201d The faxes in the names of the various entities were dispatched from the same number with the same \u201cheader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">After reviewing the statute, the judge acknowledged plaintiff could bring \u201ca private cause of action\u201d in state court. He concluded that because plaintiff could not prove \u201cactual monetary loss,\u201d $500 would be the total award for the violation. When plaintiff stated he was entitled to \u201c$500 per fax, it\u2019s a separate violation each one, which means it would be a separate suit for each and every fax ... \u201d, the judge ultimately stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">All right. The federal statute, which I\u2019m reading for the first time, and I\u2019m very uncomfortable making this decision because I would prefer to read the cases that have been decided under the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">But I\u2019m not\u2014but because I don\u2019t want to prolong this, and because, in the future, I hope that you\u2019re never gonna send anymore faxes to this individual, because if you do, that then becomes an intentional violation. I hope you understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">MR. BIXENHOLTZ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>THE COURT: All right. As far as I am concerned, this private right of action allows the plaintiff to bring an action based on a violation of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">An <em>action to recover </em>for the actual <em>monetary </em>loss, if that could be <em>proven, </em>but obviously, that\u2019s not proven, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or if the Court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this section or the regulations, the Court may, it its discretion, increase the amount to treble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">Well, I\u2014I make a finding that the defendant did not willfully or knowingly violate this subsection. My guess is the defendant probably had no idea that this law even existed. And so, I am not gonna treble the damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">With regard to the violation, again, I\u2019m not finding each fax as a separate violation. I\u2019m finding the sending of the faxes, generally, as a violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">And I\u2019m going to find that Construction Services, Inc. is the proper defendant, not Howard Bixenholtz, and the individual corporate officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">And I\u2019m finding that there be a violation of this section. There will be damages of $500 against Construction Services, Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">In his testimony defendant stated Construction Service and Supply is \u201cno[ ] longer in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">Plaintiff relies on the provisions of the TCPA embodied in 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C) and 227(b)(3), and 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(d)(1)(B) and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Act \u201cprohibits unsolicited fax advertisements,\u201d \u201cprovides for damages in the amount of actual monetary loss or $500 per violation whichever is greater\u201d and \u201calso permits up to treble damages for knowing and willful violations.\u201d <em>Universal Underwriters v. Lou Fusz Automotive, </em>401 F.3d 876, 878 (8th Cir.2005). 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C) contains a restriction on the use of automated facsimile equipment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-13\">(b) Restrictions on use of automated telephone equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-14\">(1) Prohibitions. It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States, or any person outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-15\">(C) to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement, unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-16\">(i) the unsolicited advertisement is from a sender with an established business relationship with the recipient;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-17\">(ii) the sender obtained the number of the telephone facsimile machine through\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae28\">(I) the voluntary communication of such number, within the context of such established business relationship, from the recipient of the unsolicited advertisement, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>(II) a directory, advertisement, or site on the Internet to which the recipient voluntarily agreed to make available its facsimile number for public distribution, except that this clause shall not apply in the case of an unsolicited advertisement that is sent based on an established business relationship with the recipient that was in existence before the date of enactment of the Junk Pax Prevention Act of 2005 [enacted July 9, 2005] if the sender possessed the facsimile machine number of the recipient before such date of enactment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Section 227(b)(3) expressly states that a plaintiff may bring suit against a violator of the TCPA in state courts if permitted by the laws of the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">(3) Private right of action. A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">(A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">(C) both such actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">L47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(3) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">The third cited provision, section 227(d)(1)(B), prohibits the sending of anonymous facsimile messages through the imposition of a \u201cheading requirement\u201d on all facsimile messages. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">(d) Technical and procedural standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-13\">(i) Prohibition. It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-14\">(B) to use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via a telephone facsimile machine unless such person clearly marks, in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page of the message or on the first page of the transmission, the date and time it is sent and an identification of the business, other entity, or individual sending the message and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-15\">[ 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(d)(1)(B).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-16\">As noted, section 227(b) deals with \u201crestrictions on use of automated telephone equipment,\u201d and section 227(d) deals with \u201ctechnical and procedural standards.\u201d Section 227(b)(3) (\u201cprivate right of action\u201d) does not apply to section 227(d). Section 227(c)(5) provides a \u201cprivate right of action\u201d for violation of section 227(c) (\u201cprotection of subscriber privacy rights\u201d) which expressly in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>eludes a subsection regarding \u201cregulations,\u201d <em>see </em>47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(c)(2), which is separate from section 227(b)(2) relating to \u201cregulations\u201d under section 227(b). Significantly, however, the \u201cprivate right of action\u201d language of \u00a7 227(b)(3) has the same critical language as section 227(c)(5), although the latter has some additional language.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In <em>Zelma v. Market U.S.A., </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 366-67, <em>778 </em>A.2d 591 (App.Div.2001), we held, in the context of section 227(c)(5), \u201cthat the Congressional grant of exclusive jurisdiction in state courts to enforce the private right of action created by the TCPA does not require an affirmative act by the Legislature or the adoption of rule by the Supreme Court in order for the Superior Court to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the TCPA claims filed by plaintiff.\u201d Prior to <em>Zelma, </em>the Law Division in <em>Szefczek v. Hillsborough Beacon, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 668 A.2d 1099 (Law Div.1995), which assumed the existence of state court jurisdiction, rejected a constitutional attack on the TCPA and found that defendant violated two FCC regulations promulgated under the Act, <em>id. </em>at 267-69, 668 A.2d 1099, by \u201cnot putting plaintiffs name on the do-not-call list immediately, and by failing to honor her request even after it had done so\u201d and by not \u201cproperly training] its employees in the use of the do-not-call list.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 668 A.2d 1099. With respect to damages, the court \u201caward[ed] damages to plaintiff in the amount of $2,000, $500 for each violation occurring after August 5, 1993,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 269, 668 A.2d 1099, the date defendant asserted that plaintiff made \u201cher first do-not-call request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 668 A.2d 1099. Section 227(c)(5)(B) clearly permitted \u201can action to recover for actual monetary loss from such violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater.\u201d However, the court rejected a claim for treble damages because it could not find \u201cdefendant\u2019s actions were \u2018knowing\u2019 in the sense of [section (c)(5)\u2019s requirement] which contemplates that defendant affirmatively knew at the time each telemarket call to plaintiff was made, that such call was a knowing violation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 668 A.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(3) has language identical to that embodied in section (c)(5) discussed in <em>Szefczek, </em>and other courts have now held that section (c)(5) provides for damages based on a \u201cper call\u201d (not for each of multiple regulatory violations per call) basis. <em>See also Charvat v. GVN Michigan, Inc., </em>531 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>922, 927-28 (S.D.Ohio 2008); <em>Worsham v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>Md.App. </em>487, 500-01, 772 A.2d 868, 876-77 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Accordingly, we agree with plaintiff that his state court private cause of action may go forward, and vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial at which the judge shall determine the number of unsolicited faxes, if any, were sent in violation of the TCPA and the amount of damages to be assessed against Stucco Services, Inc., including whether treble damages are warranted. The court shall also assess any personal liability of defendant Bixenholtz personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-10\"> The record reflects that plaintiffs motion to add Bixenholtz individually as a defendant was granted. However, plaintiff's statement of facts contains no citations to the record, and we refer to the facts only as developed at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
