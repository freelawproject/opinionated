In both cases, we remand to the IAIU for modification of its reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\n<em>S.P.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In Docket No. A-2522-06T2, S.P. appeals from a report dated November 29, 2006 in which the IAIU determined that the allegations of physical abuse injurious to the health and welfare of E.V. were unfounded under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. Nevertheless, the report indicated that S.P.\u2019s \u201caction was inappropriate and placed the child at some risk of harm.\u201d The IAIU made no recommendations for disciplinary or corrective action. The investigation of S.P. was initiated on October 3, 2006, when the Department of Children and Families (DCF) received a referral from its North Passaic local office that six-year-old E.V. \u201calleged that his classroom teacher ... [had] kicked him repeatedly on his ribs while he was on the floor,\u201d on September 27, 2006. The local DCF case worker was conducting a monthly visit with E.V. on October 3, 2006, when E.V.\u2019s foster parent reported the alleged abuse. According to the foster parent, E.V. told his bus driver about the incident, and the bus driver reported the matter to the babysitter, who later informed the foster parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">When the DCF case worker spoke with E.V., he stated that he was \u201cbeing bad [at school] and he was on the floor, and his teacher started to kick him.\u201d The teacher was later identified as S.P., an Instructional Assistant employed by the Paterson Public Schools (District). The case worker did not observe any visible marks or bruises on E.V., and he did not complain of pain or discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">DCF referred the case to the local IAIU, which assigned an investigator to the matter. Between October and November 2006, the IAIU investigator interviewed the individuals involved in the incident. Although E.V. was five-years-old when he was interviewed, he had communication disabilities and functioned at the level of a child who was twenty-four to thirty months of age. When the interviewer asked specifically about the incident, E.V. said that he was \u201cthrowing tables\u201d and the teacher \u201ctook paper and wiped [his] eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">When he was asked what he told the bus driver, E.V. responded: \u201cI cried because the kids called me \u2018baby\u2019 and I was crying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>saying, \u2018Don\u2019t call me baby.\u2019 \u201d He also indicated that he felt safe at school and he wanted to go back to school. E.V. never stated to the IAIU investigator that S.P. kicked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">E.V.\u2019s school bus driver informed the IAIU investigator that E.V. was crying one day because his teacher screamed at him. The bus driver told the investigator that E.V. did not say anything about the teacher kicking him. Both E.V.\u2019s babysitter and his foster mother, however, told the investigator that E.V. said his teacher had kicked or hit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The IAIU investigator interviewed the child\u2019s special education teacher, Ms. Carswell, on October 5, 2006. She recalled that the incident occurred when E.V. started a tantrum because he wanted a pair of scissors. Carswell continued teaching while S.P. tended to E.V. She informed the investigator that she did not see S.P. kick E.V.; she only heard a \u201cbang\u201d and S.P. say \u201c \u2018Stop,\u2019 \u201d after which she then heard S.P. take the chair away from E.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Two children, N.G. and D.S., both seven years old, reported having witnessed E.V. kick S.P. and S.P. respond by kicking him. N.G. told the investigator she was sitting at her desk when S.P. kicked E.V. while he was on the floor. She explained that E.V. was \u201claying on the floor kicking the closet\u201d and S.P. kicked him hard on one leg. D.S. also reported that E.V. \u201ckicked the door and the teacher [S.P.] kicked him back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">S.P. informed the IAIU investigator that E.V. is \u201c[b]asically ... a good kid\u201d unless he doesn\u2019t get his way. She noted that he cries everyday and sometimes the principal or vice principal will take him for a walk. S.P. denied kicking E.V. and reported that on the day of the alleged abuse</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">E.V. was on the floor crying and kicking. While he was doing that, he was flipping the chair. It was in the corner. I came in the door. E.V. was crying kicking and throwing a chair____I said to him \u201cYou can not throw the chair around, someone may get hurt.\u201d So I said, \u201cPlease give me the chair.\u201d [A]nd he gave it to me and I sat the chair next to the desk. He kept kicking and I told him to get up. I went on back to my desk to do my folders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">S.P. reported that Ms. Carswell was occupied with the other children at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>On October 10, 2006, the IAIU investigator informed the school principal that S.P.\u2019s \u201cactions did not rise to the level of abuse as defined by statute.\u201d She did say, however, that it appeared there was \u201csome physical contact\u201d between S.P. and E.V. while he was laying on the floor, but it did not appear that S.P. kicked E.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">After completion of the interviews, the IAIU issued its report on November 29, 2006 in a letter to the District\u2019s Superintendent. Under the heading of \u201cInvestigative Finding,\u201d the IAIU found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">Physical Abuse/Substantial Risk of Physical Injury/Environmenl Injurious to Health and Welfare was unfounded in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. However, some information obtained during the investigation raised an issue relative to an action of Instructional Assistant [S.P.]. No adjudicative findings have been made. The [IAIU\u2019sl review herein is solely investigative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The letter also set forth the IAIU\u2019s \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">The results of the investigation indicate that Student [E.V.] age six, was not injured by the actions of Instructional Assistant [S.P.j. However, the information gathered indicates that at one point on September 27, 2006, [E.V.] became disruptive and aggressive in class and [S.P.] responded by kicking the child. The information gathered indicates that [E.V.] tossed a chair and told [S.P.] to shut up and at the point he was kicked, was in the midst of a tantrum and was lying on the floor, kicking a closet. Although [SJP.\u2019s] kick was of limited force and [E.V.] was not harmed, [S.P.\u2019s] action was inappropriate and placed the child at some risk of harm. However, [S.P.\u2019s] action did not meet the statutory requirement to find abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The remedial actions taken by the District at the time of the investigation were also enumerated in the letter, but the IAIU made no recommendations for corrective or disciplinary action. The letter was copied to the Passaic County Superintendent and the Manager of the Northern Passaic County IAIU, but was not sent to S.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">S.P. received a separate letter from the IAIU also dated November 29, 2006. The findings were nearly identical to the letter sent to the District, but the \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d differed significantly. In S.P.\u2019s letter, the IAIU stated that her \u201caction placed [E.V.] at some risk of harm; however, [her] action did not meet the statutory requirement to find abuse.\u201d There was no description of the incident and no mention of S.P. kicking the child. In December 2006, the District terminated S.P.\u2019s employment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>she filed a grievance challenging the termination, which is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">On January 11, 2007, S.P. filed her Notice of Appeal of that portion of the November 2006 letter sent to the District, which found E.V. was kicked by S.P. and S.P.\u2019s \u201caction was inappropriate and placed the child at some risk of harm.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> S.P. argues that these findings resulted in her termination from employment; are beyond the statutory authority of the IAIU; and are not based on substantial evidence. S.P. also appeals the IAIU\u2019s failure to notify S.P. of these findings and recommendations in its November 29, 2006 letter to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On September 20, 2007, the IAIU sent another letter to the District amending its findings \u201c[i]n light of a recent court decision.\u201d Under the heading of \u201cInvestigative Finding,\u201d the IAIU again stated that abuse was unfounded as related to S.P.\u2019s actions. The finding that \u201csome information obtained during the investigation raised concerns regarding the actions of Instructional Assistant [S.P.]\u201d was, however, moved from the \u201cInvestigative Finding\u201d section and into the \u201cEvaluation of Facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In the \u201cEvaluation of Facts,\u201d the IAIU stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">Physical abuse was unfounded; however, some information obtained during the investigation raised concerns regarding the actions of Instructional Assistant [S.P.]. Statements by witnesses taken during the investigation indicate that [E.V.] became disruptive and aggressive in class and [S.P.] responded by kicking [E.V.]. [E.V.] tossed a chair, told [S.P.] to shut up and kicked a closet while lying on the floor during a tantrum. Although [S.P.\u2019s] kick was of limited force and [E.V.] was not harmed, [S.P.\u2019s] action was inappropriate and placed [E.V.] at some risk of harm. However, [S.P.\u2019s] action did not meet the statutory requirement to find abuse. As previously noted, the [IAIU\u2019s] findings have not been adjudicated. The findings are not binding upon the school or conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Under the heading of \u201cRecommendations for Corrective/Disciplinary Action,\u201d the IAIU stated the following: \u201c[i]t was determined that the aforementioned incident suggests a need for some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>form of corrective action, however, the need or form of the specific action taken is left to the discretion of the school district and is not mandated or monitored by the [IAIU].\u201d A copy of this letter was sent to S.P. and the Passaic County Schools Superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In S.P.\u2019s appeal, she argues that (1) the practices and procedures used by the IAIU violate due process and fundamental fairness; and (2) the conclusion reached by the IAIU must be stricken as <em>ultra vires </em>because they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\n<em>G.W.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">With respect to Docket No. A-4807-06T2, G.W. appeals from a report dated April 2, 2007 in which the IAIU indicated that the allegations against G.W. were unfounded under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 but that G.W.\u2019s \u201cactions placed [s]tudent F.R. at some risk of harm; however, [G.W.\u2019s] actions were not to the degree required by statute to find abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">On February 6, 2007, the DCF received a referral from the principal of a public school in Paterson indicating that an eighth grade student, F.R., had accused his teacher, G.W., of slapping him once on his cheek that morning. The principal also stated that another student in the classroom confirmed that G.W. had slapped F.R. The principal stated that F.R. did not show signs of a visible injury and did not complain of any pain. The principal also reported that a prior allegation of abuse had been made in 2002 against G.W. at another school during a summer program.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">DCF referred the matter to the local IAIU for a 24-hour response. The DCF database indicated that the prior allegation of abuse against G.W. in 2002 was not substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">During February and March 2007, an IAIU senior investigator conducted interviews relevant to the alleged incident. F.R. informed the investigator that he left his regular classroom several times a week for a 45-minute bilingual class with G.W. F.R. told the investigator that, on the morning of February 6, he arrived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>late for his class with G.W. and was not prepared. He asked G.W. for a notepad and a pencil and proceeded to copy the lesson on the blackboard. Because F.R. was late for class, he was unable to copy all of the material on the board. When G.W. dismissed the class, F.R. told him to wait until he finished copying everything. F.R. reported that G.W.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">got mad and pulled the notebook, ripped the paper and told me, \u201cGo get out of my class!\u201d [G.W.] grabbed my paper so I was talking under my breath. He thought that I had cursed him off. Then he said, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d That is when he smacked me on my left side of my face. Then my glasses fell off my face. Sometimes, [G.W.] pretends like he smacks our faces. However, this time he was mad and he did it with force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">F.R. also told the investigator that he went to talk to the principal about the incident but the principal was not available. When he returned to his regular classroom, F.R. claimed that another student said that G.W.\u2019s handprints were on his face. F. R. also claimed that G.W. is \u201cvery aggressive\u201d and \u201cyells a lot.\u201d He added that \u201c[s]ometimes, playfully, [G.W.] smacks the back of kids\u2019 heads with his hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The IAIU investigator interviewed seven other students who were present when the incident occurred. Three of those students said they did not witness the interaction between G.W. and F.R. One student spoke only French and, when asked questions, replied that he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Student witness, A.L., informed the investigator that \u201c[G.W.] does not hit us. He just plays with our head. He taps the side of our head.\u201d When questioned about F.R.\u2019s glasses, A.L. explained that they came off of F.R.\u2019s face when he \u201cmoved his head as [G.W.] touched the side of his face.\u201d J.L.D., another student, witnessed the incident and reported that F.R. cursed at G.W. and it appeared that he was going to hit G.W. He said that G.W. \u201cdid not hit [F.R.] he only touched the side of his head and [F.R.\u2019s] glasses flew off.\u201d J.L.D. added that G.W. \u201chardly used any force\u201d and he \u201chardly saw [any marks] on [F.R.\u2019s] face.\u201d A.J., another of G. W.\u2019s students, told the investigator that she \u201cdid not see much.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The only thing she actually observed was F.R.\u2019s glasses falling off his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">After the student interviews, the IAIU investigator interviewed Frank Puglise, the school principal. The investigator advised Puglise that it \u201cappear[ed] that something occurred in [G.W.\u2019s] class and there is some information to indicate a possible issue regarding some physical contact.\u201d She requested the school district take remedial action, such as moving G.W. out of the school building temporarily pending the investigation. The IAIU investigator requested that the principal submit a written statement that G.W. would receive administrative counseling regarding the requirement to maintain appropriate interaction with students at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">On March 16, 2007, the IAIU met with G.W. and his attorney at the IAIU office. G.W. informed the investigator that on February 6, 2007 he was teaching a small group of bilingual students including F.R. At dismissal time, F.R. refused to return a pad of graph paper G.W. had given him to use during the class. When G.W. attempted to take the pad, F.R. cursed at him and lunged toward the teacher. G.W. reacted by \u201cliftfing] his ... hand\u201d at F.R. and F.R. \u201cturned his head and his glasses fell down.\u201d The student grabbed his glasses and ran out of the room. G.W. explained that he raised his hand because he thought F.R. \u201cwas coming at [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On March 21, 2007, the IAIU conducted a follow-up phone call with the principal to inquire about his plans for G.W. The principal indicated that he would like to bring G.W. back if the IAIU tells him that \u201ceverything is okay.\u201d He also informed the investigator that G.W. would be required to take classroom and anger management training and to review the ethics code, and would not be permitted to pull students out of class without another teacher present. The IAIU recommended that G.W. receive counseling for the school\u2019s policy against corporal punishment in addition to the classroom management training. The principal agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the recommendations and indicated he would ensure they were implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On April 2, 2007, the IAIU issued its findings report in a letter to the District Superintendent stating the abuse allegations were \u201cunfounded,\u201d but that some information obtained during the investigation \u201craised an issue relative to the actions of [G.W.].\u201d The report noted that \u201c[n]o adjudicative findings have been made\u201d and the IAIU\u2019s review was \u201csolely investigative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Under the \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d section of the report, the IAIU stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">The results of the investigation indicate that Student [F.R.] was not injured by [G.W.\u2019s] actions. However, the information gathered indicates that at the conclusion of [G.W.\u2019s] class on the morning of February 6, 2007, [F.R.] refused to release a paper pad to [G.W.] and became verbally vulgar/abusive towards this teacher, who then responded by striking [F.R.] on the face with an open hand and minimal force. Although [F.R.] was not harmed, [G.W.\u2019s] actions were inappropriate. [G.W.\u2019s] actions placed [F.R.] at some risk of harm; however, [G.W.\u2019s] actions were not to the degree required by statute to find abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The IAIU also cited the remedial action that the school had taken at the time of the investigation but made no additional recommendations in its report. A copy of this letter was sent to both the Passaic County Interim Superintendent and the Office of the Child Advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Another letter issued on April 2, 2007 was sent to G.W. and contained wording nearly identical to the \u201cInvestigative Finding\u201d in the letter to the District which stated that physical abuse was unfounded but there were some concerns. The letter addressed to G.W. did not contain a detailed description in the \u201cEvaluation of Facts.\u201d Rather, it simply stated \u201c[y]our actions placed Student [F.R.] at some risk of harm; however, your actions were not to the degree required by statute to find abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">On May 16, 2007, G.W. filed his Notice of Appeal of that portion of the April 2, 2007 letter sent to the District that found G.W.\u2019s action placed F.R. at some risk of harm. G.W. argued that these findings: (1) resulted in the freezing of his salary in 2007; (2) are beyond the statutory authority of the IAIU; and, (3) are not based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>on substantial evidence. Additionally, G.W. appealed the IAIU\u2019s failure to provide him with a copy of the findings letter sent to the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On September 20, 2007, the IAIU sent a letter amending the April 2, 2007 letter and revising its findings \u201c[i]n light of a recent court decision.\u201d A copy of this letter was sent to G.W. Although the child abuse allegations remained unfounded in the revised letter, the IAIU amended its \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqn\">Physical abuse was unfounded; however, some information obtained during the investigation raised concerns regarding the actions of Teacher [G.W.l. Statements by witnesses taken during the investigation indicate that [F.R.] refused to release a paper pad to [G.W.] and [F.R.I became verbally vulgar/abusive towards [G.W.]. [G.W.] used corporal punishment by striking IF.R.J on the face one time, with an open hand, using minimal force. Although [F.R.] was not harmed, [G.W.\u2019s] actions were not warranted. [G.W.\u2019sJ actions placed [F.R.] at some risk of harm. However, [G.W.\u2019sJ actions did not meet the statutory requirement to find abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">As previously noted, the [IAIU\u2019s] findings have not been adjudicated. The findings are not binding upon the school or conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Under the heading of \u201cRecommendations for Corrective/Disciplinary Action,\u201d the IAIU stated the following: \u201c[i]t was determined that the aforementioned incident suggests a need for some form of corrective action, however, the need or form of the specific action taken is left to the discretion of the school district and is not mandated or monitored by the [IAIU].\u201d A copy of this letter was sent to G.W. and to the Passaic County Superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In his appeal, G.W. argues that (1) the practices and procedures used by the IAIU violate due process and fundamental fairness; (2) the conclusions reached by the IAIU must be stricken as <em>ultra vires </em>because they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record; and (3) the IAIU continues to demand confirmation on remedial actions taken by employers in violation of our directive in <em>In re an Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning R.P., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 754 A.2d 615 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Our review of an administrative decision is narrowly circumscribed. <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 656, 731 A.2d 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(1999). Great deference is given to administrative decisions, <em>State v.

We stated that \u201cwhile ... the finding of abuse was \u2018unfounded\u2019 and, therefore, not substantiated, the final letter to the [school district] referred to \u2018concerns\u2019 about appellant\u2019s conduct and stated that her actions were \u2018unjustified and inappropriate\u2019 and \u2018placed the child at some risk of harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 922 A.2d 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In response to the appellant\u2019s argument that the IAIU\u2019s \u201cconcerns\u201d were actually conclusions, we noted that the \u201cIAIU is not limited to reporting on abuse in its findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 922 A.2d 817 (citing <em>L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.

The IAIU \u201cis authorized to make recommendations to a district for action when it uncovers behavior that falls short of child abuse but is nonetheless undesirable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We further explained that \u201c[w]hile the content of findings is not limited, [the] IAIU must now classify allegations as either \u2018unfounded\u2019 or \u2018substantiated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Although we found that the IAIU acted within its authority in issuing findings that the teacher\u2019s conduct was \u201cunjustified and inappropriate\u201d despite finding that the child abuse allegation was \u201cunfounded,\u201d we ordered the IAIU to amend its letter to include language emphasizing that the IAIU had neither adjudicated the findings nor could it make binding recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">In this ease, we <em>order the September 7, </em>2005 letter to the District to be amended to include such language because it also needs to be amended to avoid an improper impression conveyed despite the ultimate finding that the charges of abuse were \u201cunfounded.\u201d <em>Although interviews with students and teachers presented conflicting accounts and no adjudication took place, IAIU\u2019s Utter to the District stated, as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>if cone lusively found, that appellant \u201cgrabbed [the student\u2019s] ponytail quickly at the same time [the student] was trying to move away and as a result, the student fell to the floor.\" </em>Accordingly, even though the section on \u201cInvestigative Findings\u201d states that \u201c[n]o adjudicative findings have been made [and] IAIU\u2019s review herein is solely investigative,\u201d <em>the factual recitation in the \u201cEvaluation of Facts\" should be reworded to reflect this distinction. </em>The letter should also note that IAIU\u2019s findings are not binding or conclusive. However, the overall conclusion that appellant\u2019s actions were \u201cunjustified and inappropriate\u201d is supported by the witness accounts, all of which suggest some physical confrontation between [the student] and [the teacher], and need not be deleted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">[ 393 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 181, 922 A.2d 817. (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We remanded the matter and directed the IAIU to amend the report. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In the two cases now before us, rather than amend the investigatory reports as directed in <em>A.I., </em>the IAIU simply added language stating that its \u201cfindings have not been adjudicated. The findings are not binding upon the school or conclusive.\u201d Moreover, there was no statement in the amended reports indicating that the IAIU had not made any determination of the accuracy of the student\u2019s allegations as required by <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 117, 754 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Accordingly, we remand both matters to IAIU to rewrite the reports to reflect our holdings in <em>A.I. </em>and <em>R.P. </em>In other words, while the reports may recite conflicting statements of witnesses, immediately thereafter, the reports must clearly articulate that there has been no determination as to the accuracy of the statements. If the IAIU concludes that allegations of abuse were unfounded but that the employee\u2019s actions were \u201cunjustified\u201d or \u201cinappropriate,\u201d the IAIU must state in its report the <em>facts </em>upon which the conclusion is based. We note that an untenured teacher\u2014who may be completely innocent\u2014could have an otherwise promising career terminated by an \u201cunfounded\u201d report that nevertheless expresses concern about \u201cinappropriate\u201d or \u201cunjustified\u201d conduct based upon vague, conflicting or inaccurate reports. Since the teacher who is the subject of an \u201cunfounded\u201d report has no means by which to challenge the report or test the accuracy of statements contained therein, any statement about \u201cinappropriate\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>or \u201cunjustified\u201d conduct on the part of the teacher must be supported by facts that have been tested for accuracy or clearly corroborated by eyewitnesses to the purported incident. For example, if a teacher admitted touching a child, that <em>fact </em>may be the basis for a statement that the teacher\u2019s action was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">S.P. and G.W. further argue that the IAIU\u2019s conclusions should be deleted from the final letters to the District as <em>ultra, vires </em>because they are not supported by substantial evidence. The IAIU responds that it had credible evidence from students who stated they witnessed S.P. and G.W. striking the students. We note, however, that since there had been no determination of the accuracy of witnesses\u2019 statements, the IAIU cannot claim that the evidence is \u201ccredible\u201d without such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The \u201cIAIU is not limited to reporting on abuse in its findings.\u201d <em>A.I., supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 128, 922 A.2d 817 (citing <em>L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452, 729 A.2d 463). The IAIU \u201cis authorized to make recommendations to a district for action when it uncovers behavior that falls short of child abuse but is nonetheless undesirable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because it is encouraged to report concerns even when actual child abuse has not been substantiated, the IAIU may raise concerns about inappropriate behavior, when such behavior is supported by facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">While we do not find the IAIU\u2019s conclusions <em>ultra </em>vires,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because they do not exceed the agency\u2019s power or authority, our concern lies on the drawing of conclusions from conflicting statements by witnesses or from statements not tested for accuracy. As we have stated previously, IAIU reports must clearly indicate that the accuracy of the witnesses\u2019 statements has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>determined. Nevertheless, the IAIU may express concerns to a district respecting policies that may affect the safety of students and teachers. We do not approve of IAIU conclusions that a teacher\u2019s actions were \u201cinappropriate,\u201d however, without a factual basis or a means by which the accuracy of witnesses\u2019 statements leading to such conclusions may be corroborated. <em>See R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 117, 754 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">G.W. argues that the IAIU continues to demand from employers confirmation of remedial actions, contrary to law. The IAIU acknowledges that it may not compel remedial action when abuse or neglect is unfounded. It maintains, however, that its amended reports are in compliance because no recommendations were made and the need for or form of any corrective action was left to the District\u2019s discretion. G.W.\u2019s argument merits consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In <em>L.R., </em>we concluded that DYFS does not have the statutory authority to require a school district to take specific \u201ccorrective action or submit a plan for remedial action in response to DYFS\u2019 investigatory findings\u201d that child abuse is not substantiated. 321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 453, 729 A.2d 463 (App.Div.1999); <em>accord, R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 118, 754 A.2d 615; <em>A.I., supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 130, 922 A.2d 817. \u201cDYFS\u2019 authority is limited to the investigation of any allegation of child abuse or neglect against a school employee and notification to \u2018the school district and the employee of its findings.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a). Moreover, if the district decides to take action against the teacher, \u201cit must accord all the due process and contract rights that must be honored before formal action may be taken, and the IAIU\u2019s findings may not by themselves provide a basis for the action.\u201d AI., <em>supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 114, 922 A.2d 817 (citing <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 118, 754 A.2d 615).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In <em>L.R., </em>although DYFS did not substantiate allegations of abuse in its report, DYFS directed the school district to \u201cconfirm\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>its corrective action \u201cin writing.\u201d 321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 454, 729 A.2d 463. We found that by seeking a specific response from the school district, DYFS \u201cimplied that the district was required to act in accordance with [its] recommendations, rather than to exercise its own independent judgment in deciding what action, if any, to take.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded \u201cthat DYFS should be required to notify the ... school district that DYFS\u2019 reports concerning the child abuse allegations against appellants did not require the district to take any disciplinary or other personnel actions but were investigatory findings and recommendations only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 729 A.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Here, in its September 2007 letter to the District regarding G.W., under the \u201cRecommendations for Corrective/Disciplinary Action\u201d heading the IAIU stated: \u201c[i]t was determined that the aforementioned incident suggests a need for some form of corrective action, however, the need or form of the specific action taken is left to the discretion of the school district and is not mandated or monitored by the [IAIU].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">G.W. argues that \u201c[d]espite [the] admonition that there be no demand from IAIU for confirmation of an employer\u2019s remedial action in a case that is not \u2018substantiated,\u2019 the [a]gency ... clearly continues that practice.\u201d G.W. cites the notes from the investigator\u2019s \u201cSubsequent Supervisory Conference,\u201d the \u201cIAIU Investigation Checklist\u201d and correspondence between the IAIU and the school principal as evidence that the investigator sought to obtain documentation from the school concerning its remedial action plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">IAIU twice sought written confirmation from the District that it took specific action concerning G.W.: First, that G.W. has been reassigned to a position without student contact; and second, that it \u201cneed[ed] school to document remedial [action].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Despite its statement to the contrary in its September 2007 letter, the IAIU\u2019s actions prior to the letter suggested that the school district was required to confirm that it had or would take corrective or remedial action. By doing so, the IAIU exceeded its authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Accordingly, we direct the IAIU to amend the September 20, 2007 report by including language stating that since the allegations of abuse were not substantiated, the district was not required to take any disciplinary or other personnel actions against G.W. <em>L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.
