He began dating defendant in October 1994. At the time they met, defendant was employed as a model and manager for a cosmetics company, earning about $70,000 per year. In 1995, the parties moved in together and defendant quit her job, purportedly at plaintiffs request. When plaintiff extended a marriage proposal, defendant agreed to sign a pre-nuptial agreement (agreement) before they married on July 18, 1999. Twin girls were born of the marriage on October 28, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The complaint for divorce was filed on March 14, 2005. The parties were able to agree on joint legal custody of the children with defendant having primary residential custody. The matter was tried over eleven days in June and July 2006. A dual judgment of divorce was entered on July 20, 2006 dissolving the marriage. An amended judgment was entered on January 12, 2007 addressing the validity of the agreement, equitable distribution, child support, disability insurance for plaintiff and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In this appeal, plaintiff argues that (1) he performed his obligations under the agreement and the equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 joint assets exceeded the amount to which defendant was entitled under the agreement; (2) the trial court erred in its calculation of child support and failed to make the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>findings of fact and conclusions of law in awarding child support; (3) the trial court erred in requiring plaintiff to pay ninety-one percent of the total child support; (4) the trial court erred in ordering plaintiff to obtain a $7.5 million disability insurance policy; and (5) the trial court erred in awarding $13,777.50 in counsel and accountant fees to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">During the pendency of this appeal, the parties reached an agreement and entered a partial stipulation dismissing the equitable distribution issues, leaving only child support, the disability insurance and counsel fees to be addressed by this court. On July 11, 2008 an order was entered memorializing the stipulation and allowing the parties to distribute the monies held in the court\u2019s trust fund escrow account. Accordingly, we will address only the remaining issues of (a) child support; (b) the disability insurance policy; and (c) counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">A. <em>Child Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in setting the amount of supplemental child support and in ordering him to pay 91% of the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Both parents have a shared obligation to support their children. <em>Koelble v. Koelble, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 194, 618 A.2d 377 (App.Div.1992). \u201c[W]here the parties have the financial wherewithal to provide for their children, the children are entitled to the benefit of financial advantages available to them.\u201d <em>Isaacson v. Isaacson, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 579, 792 A.2d 525 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>364, 807 A.2d 195 (2002). \u201cChildren are entitled to not only bare necessities, but a supporting parent has the obligation to share with his children the benefit of his financial achievement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 792 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">In setting child support, the court shall consider the factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">(1) Needs of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">(2) Standard of living and economic circumstances of each parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">(3) All sources of income and assets of each parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>(4) Earning ability of each parent, including educational background, training, employment skills, work experience, custodial responsibility for children including the cost of providing child care and the length of time and cost of each parent <em>to </em>obtain training or experience for appropriate employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">(5) Need and capacity of the child for education, including higher education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">(6) Age and health of the child and each parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">(7) Income, assets and earning ability of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">(8) Responsibility of the parents for the court-ordered support of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">(9) Reasonable debts and liabilities of each child and parent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">(10) Any other factors the court may deem relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">\u201cIf the combined net income of the parents is more than $187,200 per year, the court shall apply the guidelines up to $187,200 and supplement the guidelines-based award with a discretionary amount based on the remaining family income (i.e., income in excess of $187,200) and the factors specified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Appendix IX-A to <em>R. </em>5:6A at 2302 (2007). \u201cThe key to both the [guidelines and the statutory factors is flexibility and the best interest of children.\u201d Pas<em>cale v. Pascale, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>583, 594, 660 A.2d 485 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">In the context of high-income parents whose ability to pay is not an issue, \u201cthe dominant guideline for consideration is the <em>reasonable needs of the children, </em>which must be addressed in the context of the standard of living of the parties. The needs of the children must be the centerpiece of any relevant analysis.\u201d <em>Isaacson, supra, </em>348 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 581, 792 A.2d 525 (emphasis added). The consideration of needs must include the age and health of the children\u2014with the understanding that infants\u2019 needs are less than those of teenagers\u2014as well as any assets or income of the children. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">Determining a child\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d in high-income earning families presents \u201cunique problems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 792 A.2d 525.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">First, a balance must be struck between reasonable needs, which reflect lifestyle opportunities, while at the same time precluding an inappropriate windfall to the child or even in some cases infringing on the legitimate right of either parent to determine the appropriate lifestyle of a child. This latter consideration involves a careful balancing of interests reflecting that a child\u2019s entitlement to share in a parent\u2019s good fortune does not deprive either parent of the right to participate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the development of an appropriate value system for a child. This is a critical tension that may develop between competing parents. Ultimately, the needs of a child in such circumstances also calls to the fore the best interests of a child. <em>[ Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u201cJudges must be vigilant in providing for \u2018needs\u2019 consistent with lifestyle without overindulgenee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 792 A.2d 525. In <em>Isaacson, </em>we referred to the Kansas \u201cThree Pony Rule,\u201d which states that \u201c \u2018no child, no matter how wealthy the parents, needs to be provided [with] more than three ponies.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>In re Patterson, </em>22 <em>Kan.App.</em>2d 522, 920 P.2d 450, 455 (1996)). Even with high income parents, the court still must \u201cdetermin[e] needs of a child in a sensible manner consistent with the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Isaacson, supra, </em>348 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 584, 792 A.2d 525. \u201c[T]he law is not offended if there is some incidental benefit to the custodial parent from increased child support payments.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While \u201csome incidental benefit\u201d is not offensive, \u201coverreaching in the name of benefiting a child is.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 792 A.2d 525. \u201c[A] custodial parent cannot[,] through the guise of the incidental benefits of child support[,] gain a benefit beyond that which is merely incidental to a benefit being conferred on the child.\u201d <em>Loro v. Del Colliano, </em>354 <em>NJ.Super. </em>212, 225-26, 806 A.2d 799 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>544, 810 A.2d 64 (2002). That is especially true where the custodial parent is not entitled to alimony. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe award of nonessential additions to child support requires a careful weighing and determination as to who is the primary and who is the incidental beneficiary of such support.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Here, the parties\u2019 experts agreed the marital standard of living was approximately $1 million a year. The court found that the \u201creasonable current standard of living\u201d of defendant and the two children was $630,000 a year. The court set forth all of the expenses that went into that figure, but did not distinguish defendant\u2019s expenses from those of the children\u2019s. The court stated that defendant \u201creported spending approximately $8,000 per month over an approximate twelve month period on the children.\u201d The court added: \u201cThe historical expenses attributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to the children, to the extent reasonable and recurring, have been reviewed and weighed to their current needs as determined by the court\u2019s analysis of the factors under N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(b).\u201d The basic child support amount under the guidelines was $35,984 a year. But, the court found that the children had a supplemental need of $200,000 a year, for a total of $235,984 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The court did not impute income to defendant but considered the funds she would have available at the conclusion of the divorce. The court determined defendant would have $10.5 million in liquid assets to invest, which would return about $525,600 annually in gross income or $341,640 net, or $28,470 net income per month. With monthly expenses of $52,500, however, defendant had a shortfall of $24,030 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Plaintiffs post-divorce income for 2006 was about $5.87 million, with \u201c$292,000 net monthly income available for child support.\u201d The parties\u2019 combined net monthly income was $330,470, with plaintiffs income being 91% of the total and defendant\u2019s 9%. Plaintiffs 91% share of the annual child support amounted to $214,745. This did not include the additional expenses for the children that plaintiff volunteered to pay: medical insurance, uncovered medical expenses, and 80% of the agreed-upon extracurricular activities and college expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s decision was defective because it was \u201ccompletely bereft of any correlation between the relevant facts and the law,\u201d and gave no explanation as to how the court arrived at the $200,000 supplemental award. Specifically, plaintiff argues that the court (1) failed to make findings concerning the reasonable needs of the children, (2) failed to explain its balancing of the reasonable needs of the children and plaintiffs right to have a say in how his children are raised, (3) failed to identify non-essential items in defendant\u2019s statement of the children\u2019s needs; and (4) failed to determine who was the primary beneficiary of the award. Plaintiff maintains that the award was a windfall to defendant, and that the judge erred in failing to impute any income to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cMeaningful appellate review is inhibited unless the judge sets forth the reasons for his or her opinion.\u201d <em>Salch v. Salch, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 443, 573 A.2d 520 (App.Div.1990). \u201cThe absence of adequate findings ... necessitates a reversal.\u201d <em>Heinl v. Heinl, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 347, 671 A.2d 147 (App.Div.1996). We ordinarily remand to the trial court to make findings of fact if the trial court failed to do so. <em>Barnett and Herenchak, Inc. v. State Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 473, 648 A.2d 256 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We agree with plaintiff that the court here failed to make the specific findings of fact necessary to sustain its decision regarding the amount of supplemental child support. The court merely repeated defendant\u2019s recitation of the children\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d as they appeared on her case information statement (CIS) without any determination of what was essential or non-essential or any judgment regarding the accuracy or appropriateness of those needs. Expenses such as the mortgage, taxes, utilities, car expenses, and similar items benefited defendant as well as the children, but the court did not discuss what portion of those expenses was for the benefit of the children and what portion was for the benefit of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Defendant broke down some of these expenses on her CIS, attributing between one-half to two-thirds of the expenses to the children. Plaintiff\u2019s accounting expert testified, that in such cases, it is customary to attribute twenty-percent of such joint expenses to the children. While the law is not offended if defendant receives an incidental benefit, the custodial parent cannot be a primary beneficiary. <em>Loro, supra, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 224-25, 806 A.2d 799. This is of special concern when, as here, the custodial parent has no right to alimony. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 806 A.2d 799. The trial court failed to address this very significant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Moreover, the court failed to make any analysis of the reasonableness of the \u201cneeds\u201d claimed by defendant on behalf of the twin toddlers. Although in high income families, children are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>entitled to the benefit of financial advantages available to them, \u201cthe custodial parent bears the burden of establishing the reasonableness of those expenses.\u201d <em>Accardi v. Accardi, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 88, 848 A.2d 44 (App.Div.2004). Some of the expenses claimed by defendant clearly should have been deleted by the court. For example, the \u201cchildren\u201d sent their nanny and her family to Jamaica for a ten-day vacation, and gave their grandmother diamond jewelry. Defendant claimed that the twin toddlers needed nearly $27,000 a year for clothing because she dressed them in a new outfit every time they saw their father, and one of the three-year-old girls did not like to leave the house without a purse. There was no explanation as to why the children needed $30,000 worth of landscaping per year, or what was included in $3,000 for \u201caudio visual\u201d expenses per year. Defendant listed $36,000 a year for the children\u2019s \u201cequipment and furnishings\u201d without explaining what that covered. Other expenses listed in defendant\u2019s CIS should have been questioned by the court, as well, but the court made no distinction between what needs were reasonable, given the young age of the children, and what simply amounted to a \u201cfourth pony.\u201d Nor is it possible to tell from the record whether the court \u201cdouble-counted\u201d certain expenses that appear on defendant\u2019s CIS, such as unreimbursed medical expenses, that plaintiff volunteered to pay separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The court failed to acknowledge that because the twins were only a few months old when the parties\u2019 separated, there was virtually no \u201cmarital standard\u201d to ascertain the way the parties\u2019 treated the children. Defendant admitted that many of the expenses she listed for the children were incurred without plaintiffs knowledge or consent. At trial, plaintiff expressed his desire not \u201cto spoil\u201d the children and to teach them the value of money. Nevertheless, the court failed to address plaintiffs \u201clegitimate right ... to determine the appropriate lifestyle of [his] ehild[ren].\u201d <em>Isaacson, supra, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 582, 792 A.2d 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Plaintiff further argues that the judge erred in failing to impute any income to defendant for child support purposes. He main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tains that defendant has two college degrees, had earned $70,000 per year prior to the marriage, and admitted that she was capable of working but chose not to do so. He contends that her \u201cvoluntary decision to be unemployed is not a legitimate basis for failing to impute any income.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The \u201cfairness of a child support award is dependent on the accurate determination of a parent\u2019s net income. If the court finds that either parent is, without just cause, voluntarily underemployed or unemployed, it shall impute income to that parent[J\u201d Pressler, <em>supra, </em>Appendix IX-A to <em>R. </em>5:6A at 2292.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In <em>Caplan v. Caplan, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>250, 268, 864 A.2d 1108 (2005), the Court concluded \u201cthat the imputation of income to one or both parents who have voluntarily remained underemployed or unemployed, without just cause, will promote a fair and just allocation of the child support responsibility of the parents.\u201d In assessing income, however, the court must first determine whether the parent has \u201cjust cause\u201d to be voluntarily unemployed. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIn making that decision, the court should consider the employment status and earning capacity of that parent had the family remained intact; the reason for and intent behind the voluntary underemployment or unemployment; the extent other assets are available to pay support; and the ages of the children in the parent\u2019s household as well as child-care alternatives.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also </em>Pressler, <em>supra, </em>Appendix IX-A at 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">If the court-finds that there is no \u201cjust cause\u201d for the parent remaining unemployed or underemployed, the guidelines provide that income can be imputed \u201cbased on potential employment and earning capacity using the parent\u2019s work history, occupational qualifications, educational background and ... job opportunities.\u201d Pressler, <em>supra, </em>Appendix IX-A at 2292. The court also may impute income in accordance with the person\u2019s usual or former occupation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Here, the court concluded that defendant was \u201cneither voluntarily unemployed nor underemployed\u201d and declined to impute income to her. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">The defendant was a wife, homemaker, companion, and mother during her relationship with the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not want the defendant to be employed during their cohabitation, both before and after their marriage. The court finds the plaintiff wanted the defendant to be his companion and wife, and ultimately, the full time mother of his children. The parlies\u2019 relationship was a \u201cshared enterprise\u201d resulting in their living together, becoming engaged and married, and wanting to have children. On the parties\u2019 tax returns the plaintiff reported ... [defendant\u2019s occupation] as homemaker____The parties\u2019 parenting agreement recognized the defendant\u2019s parental responsibilities as the primary caretaker of the parties\u2019 children____Under the circumstances of this case, the defendant cannot go back in time and continue her employment or develop her career as if it was 1994, the date of cohabitation, or 1999, the date the parties married, or 2004, the date the parties\u2019 twin[s] were born. The defendant testified that she will not seek employment but will raise the parties\u2019 children as the parties\u2019 intended during her pregnancy and after the birth of the children. Under those circumstances, and based on the assets and income of the parties and quality of life for the children, the court finds it would be unreasonable to impute earned employment income to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">First, we note that the parties separated when the children were a few months old, so there was virtually no history of their conduct vis-\u00e1-vis the children. Second, defendant\u2019s employment opportunities were, in all likelihood, enhanced by her celebrity marriage. There is no question that as a healthy, educated, forty-one-year old, defendant is capable of earning her own income. The court found, however, that defendant was unemployed at plaintiffs request, and had the family stayed together, she would have remained unemployed. There is insufficient evidence to support that conclusion, however. The children were quite young when the parties separated and have had nannies to care for them since they were born.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Although the court did attribute income to defendant from the interest on her investments, it failed to take into consideration the very substantial assets defendant derived from the marriage and divorce, the opportunities for employment available to her as the former wife of a celebrity and the time available to her as a result of the nannies who care for the children. In short, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>remand hearing, the court should consider all possible sources of income for defendant\u2014earned and unearned\u2014as well as her assets in determining her share of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the child support award of $235,984 per year\u201491% of which was charged to plaintiff\u2014and remand for the trial court to reconsider in accordance with this opinion. We further direct the trial court to reconsider the imputation of income to defendant and the percentage of child support plaintiff is obligated to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">B. <em>Disability Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Plaintiff argues that the judge erred in requiring him to maintain a $7.5 million disability policy, and in denying his motion for reconsideration of the issue when he advised the court that it was impossible to obtain such a policy. Defendant maintains that the disability requirement was properly imposed as a security for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">In its decision, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">The plaintiff reported in his certificate of insurance coverage that he maintains no disability coverage for total disability from injury or sickness. However, the plaintiffs contract with the New York Giants required him from 2002 through 2004 to obtain (a) term life insurance policies ... and (b) a permanent and total disability policy or policies covering injury or death. Neither party provided any evidence of disability insurance to offset any loss of earned income that may occur due to injury or sickness. As further security for payment of his child support obligation, the plaintiff shall be required to obtain disability insurance in the face amount of $7,500,000 for \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d to offset any loss of income of [sic] earned income that may occur due to injury or sickness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">In his motion for reconsideration, plaintiff certified that he attempted to obtain a $7.5 million disability policy and was unable to do so based on his age and his prior injuries. He included a letter from an underwriter at HOC Specialty Underwriters, Inc, stating the same. The court denied plaintiff\u2019s reconsideration motion, simply stating that it was permitted to require security to protect child support. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Plaintiff argues that he should not have to maintain the disability insurance because there was no evidence at trial to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>requirement of the insurance or the amount. He further argues that the court failed to make factual findings to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In addition to requiring plaintiff to obtain a $7.5 million disability policy, the court ordered plaintiff to maintain a $4 million life insurance policy \u201cas reasonable and equitable security for [the children\u2019s] support and anticipated costs of higher education if the plaintiff should prematurely expire.\u201d It is illogical to require plaintiff to secure child support with a $4 million policy in the event he dies, but require $7.5 million in disability insurance if he were injured and precluded from playing football. If plaintiff were injured and unable to play football, he would be no different than any other parent who is injured or ill and unable to pursue his or her chosen profession. In such circumstances, the disabled parent would be entitled to seek a modification of child support based upon the reduction in income. <em>Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 146, 416 A.2d 45 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Moreover, plaintiff demonstrated that he cannot obtain disability insurance. The trial court commented that plaintiff should have addressed this issue at trial rather than in his motion for reconsideration. While raising the issue at trial would have allowed the parties to explore the issue to a greater extent, plaintiffs failure to raise it at trial does not preclude him from challenging the reasonableness of the court\u2019s requirement after it was imposed. In our view, there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the requirement of a $7.5 million disability insurance policy and, given the $4 million life insurance requirement, it is not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">We do not operate in a vacuum and we are aware that while this matter was pending, plaintiff announced that he was retiring from professional football. Plaintiffs retirement further illustrates the unreasonable requirement of the disability policy: since there was no provision in the amended judgment for securing child support when plaintiff retired, he will have to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>issue of child support as any other parent whose circumstances have changed. <em>Lepis, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 146, 416 A.2d 45. If a trial court intends to secure child support pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23, it must do so in a reasonable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The disability insurance issue is now moot in this case. Accordingly, we vacate the paragraph on pages four and five of the amended judgment requiring plaintiff to \u201cmaintain disability insurance in the face amount of $7,500,000 for permanent total disability to offset any loss of the plaintiffs professional football earned income that may occur due to injury or sickness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">C. <em>Counsel Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Plaintiff contends that because the parties agreed that each would pay his and her own counsel fees, the court erred by awarding defendant a total of $13,777.50 in counsel and accountant\u2019s fees as a result of the post-judgment motion for reconsideration. Plaintiff further argues that even if fees were permitted under the agreement, the judge erred in ordering plaintiff to pay defendant\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">After the amended judgment was entered, plaintiff moved for reconsideration and a stay of the order requiring him to pay more than $6.5 million to defendant under the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement. Defendant cross-moved for an order adjudicating plaintiff in violation of litigant\u2019s rights for failing to pay $7.7 million due under the final judgment of divorce, and for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>5:3-5(e), a court may, in its discretion, award counsel fees in a matrimonial action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">In determining the amount of the fee award, the court should consider, in addition to the information required to be submitted pursuant to <em>B. </em>4:42-9, the following factors: (1) the financial circumstances of the parties; (2) the ability of the parties to pay their own fees or to contribute to the fees of the other party; (3) the reasonableness and good faith of the positions advanced by the parties; (4) the extent of the fees incurred by both parties; (5) any fees previously awarded; (6) the amount of fees previously paid to counsel by each party; (7) the results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>obtained; (8) the degree to which fees were incurred to enforce existing orders or to compel discovery; and (9) any other factor bearing on the fairness of an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In this case, however, the parties\u2019 agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">In the event of an action for legal separation or dissolution, each party shall pay and be responsible for their own respective attorney\u2019s fees and costs <em>both pending the litigation and upon completion of the actions. </em>If either party is called upon to pay attorneys\u2019 fees or costs of the other party, the amount paid shall be charged against the Separate Property of the party whose lees were paid and will be reimbursed to the paying party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">[Emphasis added.!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In considering defendant\u2019s request for counsel fees, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">[Plaintiff) in effect, by seeking the stay ... would have the defendant use her [principal] reducing her investment income as indicated in her reply cross motion with the information with regard to her investment, and how it would be reduced, to pay her attorney\u2019s fees, such would result again in irreparable financial hardship to this defendant, as indicated under the [c]ourt\u2019s rulings as to her obligation as to her financial circumstances, and her obligation to pay her fair share of maintaining her two children as the parent of primary residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The court then concluded that plaintiff made the reconsideration motion in bad faith, warranting an award of counsel fees to defendant. When reminded by plaintiffs counsel of the parties\u2019 pre-nuptial agreement regarding counsel fees, the court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that it applies to a post-award matter.\u201d In a supplemental order dated March 22, 2007, the court ordered plaintiff to pay defendant accounting fees and counsel fees totaling $13,777.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">We will disturb a trial court\u2019s determination on counsel fees only on the \u201crarest occasion,\u201d and then only because of clear abuse of discretion. <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 317, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995). We find that the court did, indeed, abuse its discretion. In our view, the language in the pre-nuptial agreement\u2014\u201cboth pending and upon completion of the actions\u201d\u2014includes motions for reconsideration. The amended final judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d in the sense that it cannot be enforced while the matter is still under reconsideration or stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Plaintiff farther argues that even if the agreement did not preclude the award of fees, the court improperly assessed fees against him. He maintains that his motion was not in bad faith as evidenced by our grant of a stay pending appeal. We agree. Our decision here further supports plaintiffs argument that his motion for reconsideration was made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Accordingly, we reverse and vacate paragraphs eleven and twelve of the order entered on March 22, 2007 directing plaintiff to pay defendant\u2019s accountant and counsel fees totaling $13,777.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">D. <em>Remand to a Different Judge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In his final argument, plaintiff requests a remand to a different judge based upon the trial judge\u2019s bias. We have carefully considered the extensive record in this matter and find no evidence of bias. Bias cannot be inferred from adverse rulings against a party. <em>Matthews v. Deane, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 444-47, 483 A.2d 232 (Ch.Div.1984). We find no reason to remand the matter to a different judge. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">To summarize our decision: (1) the paragraph in the amended judgment directing plaintiff to pay \u201cchild support in the sum of $214,745 annually, payable $8,948 on the first and $8,948 on the fifteenth of each month\u201d is reversed and remanded for reconsideration in accordance with this opinion; (2) the paragraph requiring plaintiff to maintain a $7.5 million disability insurance policy is vacated; and (3) paragraphs eleven and twelve of the March 22, 2007 order relating to accountant and counsel fees are vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Reversed in part; remanded in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
