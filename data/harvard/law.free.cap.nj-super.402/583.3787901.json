(Daibes) for reconsideration of an April 12, 2007 judgment on an order to show cause, entered pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:67\u2014 5; vacating that order and judgment; holding that plaintiff \u201cis not a valid and rightful lien claimant\u201d under the terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44A-2, a provision of the Construction Lien Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:44A-1 to -38; and ruling that a March 27, 2007 arbitration decision and award issued pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44A-21 \u201cbe considered a valid interpretation of the lien provisions and thereby reinstated!].]\u201d Judge Donohue appended a \u201crider\u201d to the August 2, 2007 order elucidating the reasons for the result reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>According to plaintiffs own depiction of the facts, it supplied certain construction materials valued at $701,864.72 in connection with \u201cthe improvement of a ... high-rise condominium building[.]\u201d The bill for those materials, addressed to \u201cNigo Construction\u201d (Nigo) of Newburgh, New York, was not paid and plaintiff filed a lien against the property, citing the authority of the Construction Lien Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Further according to plaintiff,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">[t]hose construction materials were used and incorporated by Nigo Construction Corp. in the performance of the cast-in-place foundation and slabs labor work for the construction of the ... building under a June 3, 2005 Purchase Order from R &amp; L Construction Corporation for such direct foundation and slabs construction work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">The owner and developer of the ... project is Tarragon Edgewater Associates, LLC, that, in turn, had contracted on April 4, 2005 with the defendant, Daibes Brothers, Inc____to be the General Contractor for the overall labor services and materials provision for the ... project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Plaintiff, itself, summarizes the relationships by describing Tarragon Edgewater Associates as the owner and developer; Daibes as the \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d; R <em>&amp; </em>L Construction Corporation (R &amp; L) as the \u201csubcontractor\u201d; Nigo as having done work that was \u201cthe subject of [a] June 3, [2]005 Purchase Order from R &amp; L[;]\u201d and plaintiff as having supplied materials to Nigo.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">In his cogent written opinion, Judge Donohue focused on \u201cthe three-tier rule established by [the statute.]\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:44r-2 limits the definition of a \u201csupplier\u201d to a \u201csupplier of material ... having a direct privity of contract with an owner, contractor or subcontractor, in direct privity of contract with a contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-14\">The supplier must have a contractual relationship with either an owner, general contractor or subcontractor. Plaintiffs purchase order identifies its contractual relationship was with a sub-subcontractor, Nigo Construction Corp. As the court has before it all documents, the findings are that the Construction Lien Act applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-15\">Plaintiffs argument that R &amp; Xj Construction was the alter ego of Daibes is rejected. Assuming that the contract was limited to Casb-In-Place Concrete work does not negate Daibes\u2019ts] status. The obligation to the owner, Tarragon, was Daibes\u2019[s] obligation, and not Lthat of] R &amp; L Construction. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:44A-2 does not elevate plaintiffs position as a supplier with privity of contract with the owner, contractor or subcontractor (R &amp; L).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">An arbitrator had reached the same conclusion after construing and applying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44\u00c1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>As the trial court held, the plain meaning of the statute controls. In addition to the definition of \u201csupplier\u201d as recited in Judge Donohue\u2019s opinion, the three-tier orientation of the statutory scheme is fortified by the definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d as \u201cany person providing work or services in connection with the improvement of real property pursuant to a contract with a contractor or pursuant to a contract with a subcontractor in direct privity of contract with a contractor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44A-2. Here, the arbitrator expressly concluded that plaintiff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">did not have a contract with the contractor on this job. [Plaintiff] supplied concrete to Nigo____ Nigo was not in direct privity of contract with the contractor. Therefore, [plaintiff] is not a supplier pursuant to the [statute] and does not have a right to file a lien claim on real property pursuant to the provision of the [statute],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We decline plaintiff\u2019s invitation to reach a result, ostensibly on public policy grounds, that is at variance with the plain meaning of the statute. Courts are obliged to interpret a statute in a way that gives full meaning to all of its terms. <em>See Board of Educ. v. Hackensack, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 569, 165 A.2d 33 (App. Div.1960). The argument propounded by plaintiff in this appeal, <em>i.e., </em>for affixing a meaning to the statute at variance with the clear purport of its terms, is one that should be addressed to the Legislature. We have no warrant to reach a result that is manifestly precluded by the terms of the governing statute. Despite plaintiff\u2019s suggestion, <em>Craft v. Stevenson Lumber Yard, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>56, 67-68, 843 A.2d 1076 (2004), requires no such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
