Applying the limit fixed by that order, the trial judge subsequently entered judgment on January 22, 2007, in favor of plaintiff against defendant in the amount of $98,705. Harvey argues that the judge misapplied <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.50 to limit his damages on a per vehicle basis, and that as a result, he was denied the opportunity to prove his actual damages, an amount he claims was significantly higher. We have considered the arguments raised in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Plaintiff towed and stored vehicles at the request of Deptford and its police department from 1995 to 2003. He filed a complaint in January 2004 in which he alleged that Deptford had failed to comply with its statutory obligations to publicly auction those vehicles. In the complaint, plaintiff sought an order compelling Deptford \u201cto comply with its obligations to auction vehicles and obtain titles so that the vehicles may be removed from plaintiffs premises.\u201d Plaintiff also sought \u201ccompensatory damages, punitive damages, special damages and the imposition of sanctions, together with counsel fees and costs.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Deptford filed its answer and discovery ensued, apparently limited to interrogatories and document requests. On July 14, 2005, plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. In support of the motion, plaintiff supplied his counsel\u2019s certification along with attachments comprised mostly of defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories and documents it supplied. Plaintiff demonstrated that Deptford had held only two vehicle auctions between 1995 and June 2003. Deptford admitted that it failed to hold any auctions pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:10A-1 to -7, despite internal memoranda from the police department outlining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the procedure for holding auctions, and notices from various State agencies indicating the obligation to comply with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Deptford did not oppose the motion, and on August 19, 2005, the motion judge delivered an oral opinion, subsequently memorialized in an order dated the same day, granting plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. The judge ruled that \u201cDeptford ... breached its obligations to plaintiff,\u201d and he \u201cdeclare[d] that [] Deptford [was] liable to [] plaintiff for the tow costs and the storage costs in an amount to be determined at a proof hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">After efforts by the parties to count the number of vehicles that had been towed and stored at Deptford\u2019s request, 221 vehicles were removed from plaintiffs property on April 6, 2006. On July 24, 2006, Deptford moved for an order limiting the amount of monetary damages that plaintiff could recover for storage costs. In particular, Deptford argued that pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.50, plaintiffs recovery was limited to $400 per vehicle stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Plaintiff opposed the motion and certified that based upon his actual towing and storage costs, Deptford owed him $4,479,508.70. Plaintiff also furnished a series of letters between his counsel and counsel for Deptford, evidencing attempts to resolve the matter, and noted that Deptford never claimed its damages were limited by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">At oral argument held on August 18, 2006, Deptford contended that the legislation, enacted in 1987, was intended to limit the amount plaintiff could charge for storage of the vehicles. Citing legislative history, Deptford argued that the Legislature had concluded by enacting the statute that \u201c[i]t was imperative that a reasonable limitation be imposed on the storage fees for the important public purpose of sustaining local [fiscal] soundness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Plaintiff countered that he was entitled to his actual damages \u201cas a result of [Deptford\u2019s] breach of its independent statutory] [duty].\u201d Plaintiff noted the long history of trying to have Dept-ford respond to his entreaties to remove the vehicles through the auction process. Plaintiff further contended that he could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>limit his damages by auctioning the vehicles himself because he lacked any authority to do so since the vehicles were not towed \u201cat the request of or with the authority of the owner[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In a brief explanation of his ruling, the judge concluded that \u201cthe statute would appear to apply to this situation,\u201d and makes \u201cquite clear ... [its purpose was] to limit the liability of municipalities to $400 per vehicle for storage fees.\u201d He entered an order limiting plaintiffs damages for storage fees to that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Although the record is less than clear as to the proceedings thereafter, the parties apparently tried the issue of how many vehicles were towed and stored at Deptford\u2019s request over the years. We have not been supplied with any transcript of those proceedings, however, on January 22, 2007, another judge entered an order, based on \u201cthe testimony of the parties,\u201d and concluded 221 vehicles were at issue, applied the $400 limit per vehicle to storage costs, resulting in a total of $88,400, determined the towing costs to be an additional $10,305, and entered a total judgment of $98,705. This appeal ensued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Plaintiff contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.50 limits the amount that a municipality is obligated to pay a tower for towing and storage costs, but it does not limit his claim for damages based upon Deptford\u2019s \u201cbreach of independent statutory obligations.\u201d Those independent statutory obligations were Deptford\u2019s responsibility to periodically hold auctions for the vehicles it stored on plaintiff\u2019s property. Having already prevailed on summary judgment on that issue, and we note Deptford has not cross-appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that decision, plaintiff claims he is entitled to prove his actual damages as a result of the municipality\u2019s failure to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Deptford counters by arguing, as it did below, that plaintiff\u2019s monetary damage claim is limited by statute to $400 per vehicle. It notes that <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:10A-1 to -7 imposes no sanctions or penalties for its failure to comply, and, more importantly, provides for no \u201ccivil remedy for damages against a municipality.\u201d It further argues that plaintiff should have been aware of the legislative limit he could charge for his services, and therefore is bound by that limit. Lastly, it notes that plaintiff failed, prior to filing his complaint, \u201cto make any application to the Court to compel Deptford to remove the vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\"><em>N.J.SA. </em>40:48-2.49 provides in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">[A] municipality may regulate, by ordinance, the removal of motor vehicles from private or public property by operators engaged in such practice, including, but not limited to, the fees charged for storage following removal in accordance with [N.J.S.A] 40:48-2.50, fees charged for such removal, notice requirements therefor, and the mercantile licensing of such operators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">The regulations shall include, but not be limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az-\">a. A schedule of fees or other charges which an operator may charge vehicle owners for towing services, storage services or both[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">It is undisputed that Deptford enacted such an ordinance, though it was apparently revised through various iterations during the course of plaintiffs storage of the vehicles at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\"><em>N.J.SA </em>40:48-2.50 provides in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">All fees to be paid to an operator by a municipality for the storage of removed motor vehicles shall not exceed the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">(1) A limit of $ 3.00 per day for the first 30 days of storage per vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-13\">(2) A limit of $ 2.00 per day for the 31st day of storage and any day thereafter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">(3) A limit of $ 400.00 per vehicle stored regardless of the duration of the storage, except that a waiver may be granted for good cause upon the request of a municipality by the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">Subsection (3) became the basis for the judge\u2019s order limiting plaintiffs damages to $400 per vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Plaintiffs suggestion that because a municipality may secure a waiver for good cause, the statute\u2019s limits are not maximum amounts \u201cunder all circumstances,\u201d is inconsequential to this case. While the language may allow a municipality to seek such a waiver, none was sought in this caso, and therefore, the language does not support plaintiffs argument by extension, i.e., that the statute does not provide for a limit to the costs a municipality may incur for towing and storing vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We agree with Deptford and the motion judge that the statute is plain on its face, and, although resort to legislative intent is unnecessary for interpretive purposes, we note that an examination of the legislative history fully supports the conclusion that plaintiffs recovery is limited. The \u201cLegislative Findings and Declarations\u201d that accompanied the passage of the statute, <em>L. </em>1987 c. 127 \u00a7 1, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">1. The Legislature finds and declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">a. Certain municipalities are faced with exorbitant storage fees for storage following the removal of abandoned and unclaimed motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">b. <em>Storage fees have been permitted to accumulate far in excess of the value of any of these vehicles.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">c. Certain contracts concerning storage of these abandoned motor vehicles have been entered into by private persons and public agencies which failed to provide for a limitation on the accumulation of these storage fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">d. It is <em>imperative that a reasonable limitation be imposed on these storage fees </em>fin\u25a0 <em>the important public purpose of sustaining local fiscal soundness.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">e. In view of the forgoing, <em>it is reasonable and necessary for the State to set limitation on these contracts for storage fees now that this important public interest has come to light.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">We are hard-pressed to find a clearer enunciation of the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute and we note that the public purpose recognized by the statute is indeed served by limiting plaintiffs recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">The essential argument plaintiff raises, however, is unrelated to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.50. Plaintiff contends that he should be able to pursue a claim for monetary damages because Deptford violated a different statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:10A-1. Therefore, assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>arguendo plaintiff cannot recover any amount greater than $400 per vehicle because of the limits cited above, he contends he has a private cause of action to recover monetary damages as a result of Deptford\u2019s failure to auction the vehicles in a timely fashion. We disagree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We note initially that there are no provisions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>89:10A-1 to -7 for a remedy in damages in the event a public agency fails to comply with its obligation to auction vehicles towed and stored at its request. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:10A-7 provides, \u201cThis act is intended to provide an additional remedy and shall not be construed to supersede procedures provided under any other act.\u201d Plaintiff has not cited any other statutory provisions and we find none that are particularly applicable to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Therefore, failing to find any express cause of action for damages provided by the legislation, we consider whether plaintiff has some implied private right of action under the statute, or, in a more generic sense, as a corollary to the writ of mandamus he sought in the prerogative writs aspect of his suit, i.e., an order compelling Deptford to hold the auction or remove the vehicles from his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We have said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">In determining whether a statute implicitly creates a private cause of action, our Supreme Court has directed that courts should consider: (1) whether plaintiff is a member of the \u201cclass for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether there is any evidence that the Legislature intended to create a private cause of action under the statute\u201d; and (3) whether such an implied private cause of action would be \u201cconsistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\"><em>[Ferraro v. City of Long Branch, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 288, 714 A.2d 945 (App.Div.)(quoting <em>Matter of State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>35, 41, 527 A.2d 851 (1987))(internal quotations omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>541, 724 A.2d 801 (1998).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">First, there is nothing in <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:10A-1 to -7 that indicates towers and storage operators were intended beneficiaries of the statute. Rather, it is clear that the Legislature intended to clarify a municipality\u2019s obligations with respect to the owners and secured parties regarding the vehicles, and to facilitate the vehicle\u2019s \u201csale and disposition by [the] governmental agency.\u201d <em>L.196J/, c. </em>81. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Thus, certainly as to plaintiffs claim against Deptford, he cannot show that he was a member of \u201ca class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Further, we find no legislative intention to accord a private cause of action to plaintiff, and, given our discussion above regarding <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.50, doing so is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s otherwise categorically-stated purpose of limiting municipal exposure and insuring \u201clocal fiscal soundness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We lastly consider whether plaintiffs claim for monetary damages should be permitted as a corollary to his mandamus cause of action. While it has long been recognized that a plaintiff may include in an action in lieu of prerogative writs a claim for ancillary relief, <em>Garrou v. Teaneck Tryon Co., </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>294, 301-05, 94 A.2d 332 (1953), a claim for monetary damages against a municipality for the failure to execute its statutory obligations is not permitted absent a constitutional or statutory basis for the claim. <em>Jenkins v. Kaplan, </em>50 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 281, 141 A.2d 802 (App.Div.1958); <em>Lanni v. Bayonne, </em>7 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 172, 72 A.2d 397 (App.Div.1950). As noted above, the only statute plaintiff has pled or cited does not supply a basis for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Lastly, though Deptford never raised the defense of laches at the time partial summary judgment on the issue of liability was granted to plaintiff, we find further support for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>conclusion that limiting plaintiff\u2019s damage claim is not inequitable precisely because he failed to initiate an action to compel any auction of the vehicles for several years. \u201c[T]he \u2018central issue\u2019 in determining whether the laches doctrine bars a lawsuit \u2018is whether it is inequitable to permit the claim to be enforced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Borough of Princeton v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>135, 158, 777 A.2d 19 (2001)(quoting <em>Lavin v. Bd. of Educ. of Hackensack, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>145, 152-53, 447 A.2d 516 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Although plaintiff contended that he informally complained to various municipal officials about Deptford\u2019s refusal to auction the vehicles, it is undisputed that he did not file his complaint until January 2004, years after the first vehicles were towed and stored at his premises, and years after Deptford failed to hold a timely public auction. While plaintiff may have resisted filing his suit because he wished to maintain his status as one of Deptford\u2019s designated towing operators, we must conclude it would be highly inequitable to the public\u2019s interest in sound fiscal policy to now recognize his claims for substantial monetary damages when they are based, in large part, upon his delay in seeking mandamus at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> Plaintiff's notice of appeal does not include this judgment. However, Dept-ford has not objected to our consideration of the issue presented, first decided interlocutorily, and then applied to the calculations that led to the final judgment. Therefore, we consider the issue with recognition that if plaintiff were to prevail and the interlocutory order reversed, the final judgment would also need to be vacated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">We contrast this with the Legislature's enactment of <em>N.J.SA. </em>39:10A-8 through -20, \u201ca larger statutory scheme [\u00a3,.1983, <em>c. </em>455] that had as its primary purpose <em>the facilitation of a garage keepers disposal of abandoned motor vehicles.\u201d GE Capital Auto Lease </em>v. <em>Violante, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>24, 40, 848 <em>A.2d </em>732 (2004) (emphasis added). Specifically, pursuant to <em>NJ.SA. </em>39:10A-14, \u201cprior to the sale of the motor vehicle ... the owner of the motor vehicle may reclaim possession ... from the motor vehicle repair facility ... upon payment of the reasonable costs of removal and storage of the motor vehicle, the expenses incurred pursuant to the provisions of this act, and the charges for the servicing or repair of the motor vehicle.\" Plaintiff acknowledged at oral argument that he was unable to effectuate a public sale of the vehicles, or otheiwise dispose of them pursuant to <em>NJ.SA. </em>39:10A-8 to -20, because they were not towed and stored at the request of or with the authority of the owners, and that only Deptford was in a position to publicly auction the vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
