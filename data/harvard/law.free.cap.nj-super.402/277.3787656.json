On this appeal, defendant argues that the convictions on counts one, three, five and seven must be reversed because he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the convictions for misconduct and pattern of misconduct must be reversed because: \u201cas a matter of law, his conduct was not related to his office\u201d; \u201che did not derive a \u2018benefit\u2019 from his conduct\u201d; \u201cthe finding of \u2018benefit\u2019 \u201d was against the weight of the evidence; the prosecutor\u2019s use of the term \u201cduty\u201d in the summation with respect to defendant\u2019s conduct and the judge\u2019s failure to give a curative instruction with respect thereto, deprived defendant of a fair trial; and the charge and response to jury questions confused the jury and denied the defendant a fair trial. He further contends his convictions for making false alarms should have merged into the misconduct convictions if those convictions are sustained, and that the pattern of misconduct conviction was only a third degree crime, not a second degree crime, so defendant must be resentenced thereon. He does not challenge the convictions for third degree setting a false alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Defendant contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for not raising a number of things\u2014that calling in the false alarm was not related to his office; that defendant did not receive a \u201cbenefit\u201d therefrom for purposes of the misconduct and pattern of misconduct statutes, that there was insufficient evidence defendant received a \u201cbenefit\u201d; by not objecting to the summation and charge, and by not arguing that a pattern of misconduct was third degree, not second degree, because his misconduct was making the false alarms, a third degree offense. He essentially makes every substantive contention a basis for his ineffectiveness claim. However, many of the contentions addressed to the misconduct statute and conviction present legal issues which can be raised by motion before or after trial, <em>see Rule </em>3:10, and which can be, and are, raised on the direct appeal. Hence, we address these arguments in the context of the claims presented without the need to evaluate if counsel\u2019s conduct was deficient and affected the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>We hold that when a volunteer firefighter calls in a false alarm it is misconduct related to a public office or position, and defendant receives a \u201cbenefit\u201d by the joy or gratification of participating in the response or even by giving the unit work to keep it in existence. We agree with the State that responding to fires and creating such opportunities for enjoyment or self-gratification is a \u201cbenefit\u201d under the statute, and find no insufficiency with the proofs in this case because defendant was identified as the caller, independent of his statement or admission, and the reasonable inferences warrant a finding that he received a \u201cbenefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Defendant was a volunteer firefighter with the Prospect Park Volunteer Fire Department (\u201cthe Department\u201d). He applied to the Department in May 2003, and began four months of training at a firefighter academy in June 2003, graduating in October of that year. Defendant received no compensation for his work because it was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Beginning in September 2003, the Department received, and responded to, an increasing number of \u201cfalse alarms.\u201d At a meeting held during December 2003, Jeffrey Vantermolen, then Chief of the Department, discussed the \u201crash of false alarms\u201d which had been called in. Immediately following a February 21, 2004, false alarm call, Chief Vantermolen contacted the Paterson fire dispatcher, and learned that none of the false alarm calls were being reported \u201cvia 911,\u201d but instead the caller was directly contacting the Paterson Fire Department by calling its \u201ctelephone line,\u201d a number which \u201cwould bypass police\u201d and was known only to \u201csomeone who\u2019s familiar with that line even existing.\u201d Thus, the police department was never notified of the calls and had no record of the reports. The calls were \u201cvoice recorded, but there\u2019s no record of the number\u201d calling in.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The Paterson Fire Department had recorded the calls. However, Paterson officials could not locate some of the recordings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Chief Vantermolen listened to the recordings of the December 29, 2003, and January 14 and February 21, 2004, calls, and recognized the defendant\u2019s voice as the caller on each of those recordings. Assistant Chief Douglas Struyk subsequently verified the voice identification. Defendant had responded to all of these calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On February 23, 2004, the Passaic County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Bureau undertook an investigation of the false alarm calls. Detectives Richard Diaz and Don Dolan thereafter met defendant who agreed to accompany the detectives to headquarters. There, the detectives played the tapes of the false alarm calls in the presence of the defendant, who admitted that his voice was on the tape. Detective Diaz advised defendant of his constitutional rights, which were written on a form pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Defendant executed the <em>Miranda </em>form and waived his rights. Defendant admitted making the calls which were on the tapes and several others, and stated he would call \u201c411\u201d and ask to be connected with \u201cPaterson dispatch directly\u201d \u201c[b]ecause every time [he] called 911 they asked too many questions\u201d and \u201cit was faster calling Paterson dispatch directly.\u201d He reported the odor of smoke and then \u201cresponded] to the calls on the fire truck.\u201d On a few occasions defendant identified himself as a firefighter but did not discuss the calls with fellow firefighters or superiors \u201c[b]e-cause there were times when we responded to alarms and ... the odors of something burning was no longer there at our time of arrival [and he] therefore did not want to get in trouble for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">There is no contention that the statement was involuntary or that there was not a knowing, voluntary waiver of defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Defendant produced a number of witnesses, including family members, who testified to frequently smelling smoke and odors in Prospect Park. They also testified to defendant\u2019s desire to serve, and enjoyment in being, a firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2G:30-2(a) under which defendant was indicted for official misconduct provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">A public servant is guilty of official misconduct when, with purpose to obtain a benefit for himself or another or to injure or to deprive another of a benefit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApT\">a. He commits an act relating to his office but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions, knowing that such act is unauthorized or he is committing such act in an unauthorized manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In order to be convicted under this subsection of the statute, (1) the defendant had to be a \u201cpublic servant\u201d at all relevant times, (2) who committed \u201can act relating to his office\u201d which constituted \u201can unauthorized exercise of his official functions,\u201d knowing that it was unauthorized or committed in an unauthorized manner, and (3) his purpose must have been \u201cto obtain a benefit for himself or another\u201d or \u201cto injure or deprive another of a benefit.\u201d <em>See State v. Mason, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 301, 810 A.2d 88 (App.Div.2002); Model Jury Charge (Criminal), \u00a7 2C:30-2 \u201cOfficial Misconduct\u201d (2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Hence, two of the elements require that the defendant be a \u201cpublic servant\u201d and that the act constitute misconduct relating to his office. <em>See State v. Bullock, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>149, 156-57, 642 A.2d 397 (1994); <em>Mason, supra, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 301, 810 A.2d 88. The issue as to whether or not an unpaid volunteer firefighter can be a \u201cpublic servant\u201d is a question of law, see <em>State v. Grimes, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 79, 561 A.2d 647 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>222, 570 A.2d 976 (1989),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we have previously held that the actor need not be a government employee so long as he performs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>a governmental regulatory or enforcement function, <em>Mason, supra, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 303-04, 810 A.2d 88. Private misconduct by a public official is punishable as misconduct by a non-public official would be, <em>State v. Hinds, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>540, 549, 674 A.2d 161 (1996), but a private citizen performing \u201ca governmental function\u201d can commit official misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The definition of \u201cpublic servant,\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-l(g), which applies to all \u201coffenses involving public administration\u201d embodied in chapters 27 through 30, includes \u201cany person participating as juror, advisor, consultant or otherwise, in performing a governmental function____\u201d \u201cFirefighting\u201d is clearly a \u201cgovernmental function,\u201d as part of government\u2019s primary role is to protect the health, welfare and safety of the public, even if performed or assisted by volunteers of the community\u2014at least in some organized or officially recognized form. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-13 (tort immunity for volunteer firefighters); <em>Schwartz v. Stockton, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>141, 150, 160 A.2d 1 (1960) (volunteer fire companies perform \u201cgovernmental function as far as tort liability is concerned\u201d); <em>Capano v. Bound Brook Relief Fire Co. </em># <em>4 </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>87, 91, 811 A.2d 510 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>550, 816 A.2d 1051 (2003) (firefighter injured \u201cdoing public fire duty\u201d entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>see also Eggert v. Tuckerton Vol. Fire Co. No. 1, </em>938 <em>F.Supp. </em>1230, 1240 (D.N.J.1996) (volunteer fire company was \u201c \u2018state actor\u2019 for purposes of plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims\u201d); <em>Sprint Spectrum, L.P. v. Borough of Upper Saddle River Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 598, 801 A.2d 336 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>543, 810 A.2d 63 (2002) (volunteer fire companies may lease their real property, but as the property is private, they are not required to follow public bidding laws). The charged conduct sufficiently related to defendant\u2019s firefighting activities because it called the department into action. See <em>Hinds, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>546-49, 674 A.2d 161; <em>State v. De Cree, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 418, 778 A.2d 1119 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>388, 788 A.2d 772 (2001) (\u201cactions in joining the [insurance fraud] scheme [involving the State Health Benefits Program] had nothing to do with [defendant\u2019s] status as a security guard,\u201d and defendant was not guilty of misconduct merely because of her public employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The issue concerning obtaining a \u201cbenefit\u201d also turns on the definitional section of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-1. The word \u201cbenefit,\u201d unless having a different meaning in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">means gain or advantage, or anything regarded by the beneficiary as gain or advantage, including a pecuniary benefit or a benefit to any other person or entity in whose welfare he is interested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Clearly, the joy of responding to fires as a volunteer firefighter, if not the desire to give the volunteer department enough work to justify its existence or gain public recognition, is a \u201cbenefit\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-la and, therefore, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2a. There was testimony defendant always wanted to be a firefighter and enjoyed his participation on the force.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">We have no hesitation in concluding, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, that there was sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the jury\u2019s conviction based on a finding of a \u201cbenefit.\u201d <em>See State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967). Just as the trial judge must give the State the benefit of all reasonable inferences relating to that issue, we must do the same on the review of defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Moffa, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>258, 263, <em>200 A.2d 108 </em>(1964).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">We find no reversible error flowing from the prosecutor\u2019s summation or the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. <em>See R. </em>2:113(e)(2); <em>State v. Feal, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>293, 944 A.2d 599 (2008). Defendant complains the judge instructed the jury to return a verdict of guilty of official misconduct if he committed either an unautho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>rized act relating to Ms office, or \u201ccommitted the act in an unauthorized manner.\u201d The element requires either one or the other, and not both.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-7 which deals with committing a pattern of official misconduct, and for which defendant was convicted in count seven, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">a. A person commits the crime of pattern of official misconduct if he commits two or more acts that violate the provisions of <em>N.J.S. </em>20:30-2 or section 2 of PL 2003, c. 31, (C. 2C:30-6(c)). It shall not be a defense that the violations were not part of a common plan or scheme, or did not have similar methods of commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Here there is no dispute that if defendant was convicted of two or more violations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2a, he committed a pattern of official misconduct, and the jury was instructed accordingly. Because there was no pecuniary benefit, the misconduct was second degree, <em>see State v. Phelps, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>364, 373-76, 454 A.2d 908 (App.Div.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>500, 476 A.2d 1199 (1984);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>see also State v. Cetnar, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>257, 264, 775 A.2d 198 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>89, 784 A.2d 721 (2001). Accordingly, the pattern violation constituted a second degree crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The convictions for official misconduct and committing a pattern of misconduct do not merge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-7b provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4i\">Pattern of official misconduct is a crime of the second degree if one of the acts committed by the defendant is a first or second degree crime; otherwise, it is a crime of the third degree, provided, however, that the presumption of nonimprisonment set forth in subsection e. of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:44-1 for persons who have not previously been convicted of an offense shall not apply. Notwithstanding the provisions of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:l-8 or any other law, a conviction of pattern of official misconduct shall not merge with a conviction of official misconduct, official deprivation of civil rights, or any other criminal offense, nor shall such other conviction merge with a conviction under this section, and the court shall impose separate sentences upon each violation of <em>N.J.S. </em>20:30-2 and sections 2 and 3 of P.L. 2003, c. 31 (C. 2C:30-6 and C. 20:30-7).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>462, 588 A.2d 816 (1991), and <em>State v. Dillihay, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>42, 601 A.2d 1149 (1992), the Supreme Court held that, notwithstanding the anti-merger provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7, violations of that section merged into convictions for distribution and possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance (CDS) in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5, so long as the mandatory minimum required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 was imposed. In the words of <em>Dillihay, </em>\u201cin such cases a mandatory minimum sentence no less severe than that required by the school-zone statute should nevertheless be imposed on defendants convicted of a Section 5 offense.\u201d <em>Dillihay, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 44, 601 A.2d 1149. For purposes of considering the issue before us, we quote at length from <em>Dillihay </em>with respect to the basis for merger and the constitutional principles involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">We have consistenUy interpreted New Jersey\u2019s constitutional double-jeopardy protection, <em>N.J. Constitution, </em>article I, paragraph 11, as co-extensive with the guarantee of the federal constitution. U.S. <em>Const, </em>amend. V; <em>State v. Churchdale Leasing, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 107-08, 557 A.2d 277 (1989); <em>State v. DeLuca, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>98, 102, 527 A.2d 1355 (1987); <em>State v. Soto, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 479, 575 A.2d 501 (App.Div.1990). We have not determined, nor need we do so here, whether or to what extent New Jersey\u2019s constitutional guarantee affords greater protection than does the federal constitution. <em>Churchdale Leasing, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 557 A.2d 277. To evaluate whether to convict a defendant for violating both Section 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>and the school zone statute by the same conduct is permissible, we first examine the federal law of double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Federal double-jeopardy principles require a two-step analysis to determine whether multiple punishment violates double jeopardy. <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>359, 368-69, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 679 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>535, 543-44 (1983); <em>Albernaz v.

The first step requires the court to consider whether the legislature intended to impose multiple punishments. <em>Albernaz, supra, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>at 344, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1145, 67 L.Ed.2d at 285. The federal double-jeopardy guarantee \u201cserves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors.\u201d <em>Brown v.

Therefore, \u201c[wjhere ... a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, ... a court\u2019s task of statutory construction is at an end ... and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment.\u201d <em>Missouri v. Hunter, supra, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>at 368-69, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 679, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 544.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">If, however, the legislative intent to allow multiple punishment is not clear, the Court must then apply the test articulated in <em>Blockburger, supra, </em>284 <em>U.S. </em>at 304, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 182, 76 <em>L.Ed, </em>at 309, to determine whether the defendant is unconstitutionally faced with multiple punishment for the \u201csame\u201d offense. In the absence of legislative intent to authorize cumulative punishment, to punish a defendant twice for the same offense is unconstitutional. <em>Missouri v.

To determine whether the non-merger provision of the school-zone statute violates double jeopardy, we first inquire whether the Legislature clearly intended to permit multiple punishment for violations of both Section 5 and the school-zone statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\"><em>[Dillihay, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 47-48, 601 A.2d 1149.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">As already noted, the Supreme Court, finding no need to invalidate the school zone anti-merger provision, interpreted it to be consistent with constitutional principles by holding that the ineligibility term or mandatory minimum \u201cwould survive the merger of a school-zone offense with a Section 5 offense that did not carry a mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 601 A.2d 1149. Stated differently, the Court held \u201cthat the school-zone statute must be construed to allow merger of school-zone offenses into ... Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>5 offenses provided that a defendant convicted of a drag offense in a school zone is sentenced to no less than the mandatory minimum sentence provided in the school-zone statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 601 A.2d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">However, we cannot so hold in this case because there is no mandatory minimum established by the Legislature, and in any event,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the anti-merger legislation embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-7 added language to that embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 after <em>Gonzalez </em>and <em>Dillihay </em>were decided to prevent the very merger that those cases required and which defendant seeks in this case. The Legislature expressly stated that, in addition to the non-merger provision (into or with another conviction), \u201cthe court shall impose separate sentences upon each violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2.\u201d Nothing could be clearer with respect to the legislative intent. The language is expressed because it has been so consistently held that the double-jeopardy provision of the state constitution is coextensive with, or provides no greater protection than, the federal double-jeopardy clause, <em>see, e.g., Dillihay, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 47-48, 601 A.2d 1149, <em>but see Churchdale Leasing Inc., supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 557 A.2d 277 (leaving room for a distinction between \u201cmultiple prosecutions\u201d and the prohibition against multiple punishment), and because the cases under the federal constitution make clear that merger is a matter of legislative intent when defendant is convicted of multiple offenses in the same prosecution, <em>see, e.g., Albemaz, supra, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>333, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275; <em>Hunter, supra, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>359, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). Accordingly, given the additional language in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:30-7 in light of, or because of, <em>Gonzalez </em>and <em>Dillihay, </em>we find no basis for merger of the pattern violation into the misconduct violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The State responds to defendant\u2019s argument that his \u201cconvictions for making false alarms should have been merged with his convictions for official misconduct,\u201d by referring to the anti-merger provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-7b. However, that section relates only to merger of convictions with or into the pattern offense. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:18; <em>Dillihay, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 46, 601 A.2d 1149; <em>State v.

He complains that, in response to jury questions the judge charged the elements of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:30-2b (\u201cknowingly refrains from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office\u201d). However, in addition to the fact there was no relevant objection, the judge repeated the elements of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:30-2a. Defendant also asserts that the prosecutor emphasized he called in an alarm and then violated his \"primary duty\u201d to stay at the scene of the fire. He did make an objection to this after the charge was completed. However, if defendant knew there was no fire, it is inconceivable anyone would believe he had to stay to fight it, even though the defense asserted he smelled smoke or an odor and another firefighter testified that in such instance he would have a duty to remain on the scene.
