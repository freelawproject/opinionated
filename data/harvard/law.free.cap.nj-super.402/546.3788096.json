(FMC), Rocque Dameo and Daniel Dameo seek recovery of losses alleged to result from false and misleading representations by defendants James W. Barrett, Gerard T. Papetti and Papetti\u2019s company, U.S. Financial Services Corporation, (defendants or Barrett and Papetti). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Defendants induced plaintiffs to establish what they represented was a \u201ctax qualified,\u201d \u201c419 annuity\u201d by participating in a program known as the Employers Participating Insurance Cooperative (EPIC). EPIC purported to be a multiple employer welfare benefit plan and trust that provided employers with a tax-deductible vehicle to fund pre-retirement death benefits for owner-employees through the purchase of specific life insurance products, and allowed the individual insured to convert the insurance policy to obtain post-retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Six years after FMC commenced participation in EPIC, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited the company and disallowed claimed deductions for two tax years. As a result of the IRS audit, plaintiffs paid additional taxes and interest deemed due. Thereafter, plaintiffs terminated participation in EPIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint asserts various misrepresentation claims, sounding in negligence and fraud.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">They argue that defendants misrepresented the tax consequences of the benefit plans to induce plaintiffs to purchase life insurance. Plaintiffs allege that while [defendants] earned millions of dollars in commissions from the insurance sales, plaintiffs lost substantial sums of money because the IKS decided that plaintiffs\u2019 contributions were not tax deductible. Plaintiffs claim that defendants knew of the potential adverse tax consequences, and not only failed to tell plaintiffs, but affirmatively represented that the contributions would be tax deductible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\"><em>{Finderne Management Co., Inc. v. Barrett, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 190, 809 A.2d 842 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>219, 827 A.2d 287 (2003) <em>(Findeme I).]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The matter was tried to a jury. The trial judge entered an order of judgment molding the verdict and fixed liability against Barrett and Papetti, each in the amount of $36,734.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Plaintiffs appeal from numerous pre-trial and trial orders, asserting legal errors that warrant a new trial. Two specific arguments challenge the orders that dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 consumer fraud claims and limited the scope of damages. Also, in a permitted supplemental brief filed following entry of a trial court order upon our grant of a limited remand, plaintiffs challenge the denial of their motion to set aside the judgment under <em>Rule </em>4:50-1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Defendants Barrett and Papetti cross-appeal from the denial of their respective summary judgment motions and certain evidentiary trial rulings.

We affirm on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">FMC operates a Bridgewater trucking business and is owned by brothers Rocque Dameo and Daniel Dameo. Since 1977, Barrett, a Senior Account Executive at Cigna Financial Advisors, Inc. (Cigna) provided financial advice and sold life insurance to the D\u00e1meos. In the late 1980s, Barrett suggested the D\u00e1meos develop a business succession plan to consolidate their companies and to minimize estate taxes in the event of the death of either brother. The D\u00e1meos held significant wealth in the value of their business interests, but had \u201ca very serious problem\u201d with asset liquidity to pay anticipated death taxes in the event one brother passed away. Furthermore, the D\u00e1meos had terminated an existing retirement vehicle so they had no program to provide for retirement. The brothers agreed that additional estate planning strategies \u201csuch as retitling assets, new wills, new trusts, and some other financial planning\u201d techniques were necessary to \u201creduce the estate tax[es] down to a meaningful level\u201d and, in planning for their retirement, to provide a \u201cseamless\u201d transfer of the business to family members while affording them, as former owners, a sufficient stream of retirement income.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Barrett introduced the D\u00e1meos to Papetti who was a personal financial planner, licensed insurance agent, and certified public accountant. Together, Barrett and Papetti performed a comprehensive review of the D\u00e1meos\u2019 financial concerns, including available cash flow and the future \u201caccumulation and preservation of ... wealth.\u201d Defendants prepared and presented a comprehensive tax and estate planning analysis that made several planning recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Included among the recommendations was Papetti\u2019s proposal that FMC participate in EPIC. The EPIC plan was designed by-defendant Ronn Redfearn and marketed through defendant TriCore, Inc. (Tri-Core). EPIC was presented as a multi-employer trust, funded by life insurance products purchased by the individual employers from designated insurance companies. Employers joined the trust by executing an adoption agreement. The employer paid annual contributions and deducted the sums as business expenses pursuant to 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 162.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Prior to retirement, a covered employee received death benefits through group term life insurance; following retirement, the employee could convert the term insurance interest to an individual universal life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">EPIC\u2019s insurance benefits were provided through a program called Group Entry Age Reserve (GEAR), developed by Tri-Core, which served as the EPIC Plan Administrator. The key feature of GEAR was the conversion option available to employees who terminated participation in the plan. The employer\u2019s premium costs for the insurance were based on an employee\u2019s age when he or she \u201cbegan [] employment, not [] retirement age.\u201d In this way, the universal life policy costs were lower than costs had the policy issued upon retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The GEAR marketing materials tout the ease with which a participating employer funds the individual universal life insurance policies for its terminating employees, explaining that a portion of an employer\u2019s annual contributions are set aside in a rate stabilization reserve, which is used to pay the conversion costs charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>when an employee retires. The insurance feature called, \u201cContinuous Group\u201d or \u201cC-Group,\u201d is defined in the materials as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEDD\">a plan of group term life insurance with a special conversion option. When combined with the EPIC Plan and Trust, actuarially determined deposits are fully deductible. Upon retirement, the participants may convert to an individual universal life special conversion policy and take tax free annual distributions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Although the premium costs on the C-Group product were significantly greater than premiums for a conventional group term life insurance policy, Barrett and Papetti explained that under EPIC, FMC would reap large tax benefits by deducting the annual contributions. FMC would pay the annual tax deductible contributions. Approximately twenty percent of each annual payment covered the premiums for group life insurance for FMC\u2019s employees. The remaining eighty percent would accumulate in a reserve \u201cfund\u201d to pay the conversion benefits when the principal-employees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> retired. Upon retirement, the employee would use the excess contributions to buy \u201cconversion credits\u201d to obtain the individual\u2019s universal life policy. In the first year after conversion, the D\u00e1meos would pay a post-retirement premium of $5,000 and their converted policy would have a cash value of approximately $255,000; the following year another $5,000 premium would further increase the policy\u2019s cash value. Thereafter, the D\u00e1meos could borrow against the individual policy, withdrawing the cash value without incurring a tax consequence. \u201cIn other words, the benefits would include tax-free deductions to purchase the insurance and a tax-free loan after conversion.\u201d <em>Finderne I, supra, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 809 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Barrett and Papetti gave the D\u00e1meos schedules specifying the annual retirement benefit at age sixty-five. The documents represented that upon conversion at age sixty-five, Rocque and Daniel would receive annual tax free annuity-like payments of $26,532, and $24,541, respectively for twenty-years.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>FMC executed the EPIC adoption agreement on January 1, 1991. FMC also set up a trust to act as a vehicle to deliver the program of benefits promised by EPIC to its covered employees. <em>Finderne I, supra, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 187, 809 A.2d 842. FMC participated in EPIC for six years paying $336,591.86 in contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The EPIC plan was substantively challenged by the IRS. The IRS concluded EPIC was not an employee benefit plan, but a method to defer compensation. Therefore, the employer\u2019s claimed business expenses were disallowed and the employees could be taxed on the benefits received.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">FMC was audited for the tax years 1994 and 1995. The IRS disallowed the deductions for the EPIC contributions that exceeded the actual cost of the employees\u2019 term life insurance benefits. In its settlement with the IRS, FMC remitted approximately $50,000 to pay the taxes deemed due and interest on those payments for the two identified tax years. The IRS agreed to waive applicable penalties and the potential recovery for unpaid taxes in the remaining years of FMC\u2019s EPIC participation. Also, FMC agreed to terminate its EPIC participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">FMC ceased making EPIC contributions in 1996. The last payment covered premiums due up to September 1, 1997. The D\u00e1meos attempted to recover the contributions believed to have accrued in EPIC\u2019s reserve fund. They learned the reserve was not an actual depository of funds, but a book entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">In a February 25, 1998 letter, Barrett urged the D\u00e1meos to exercise the right to convert the insurance and cautioned that the term insurance coverage would lapse without payment of the outstanding sums due. The overdue premium owed was $72,967.86. Eventually, the D\u00e1meos completed the documentation for conversion of the policies. The insurance company denied the requests, stating the policy had lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint asserted a variety of causes of action, including violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.A \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>New Jersey Racketeering Act (NJRICO), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:41-1 to - 41-6.2, as well as claims of fraud, consumer fraud, equitable fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, and aiding arid abetting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Plaintiffs asserted Barrett and Papetti failed to warn the beneficial tax features of EPIC were not sanctioned by the IRS, and failed to disclose they received commissions based on plaintiffs\u2019 EPIC contributions. Additionally, plaintiffs maintained Barrett and Papetti knew EPIC had no reserve fund to pay promised benefits upon the termination of participation because the hefty contributions were used to pay the promoters\u2019 commissions. Finally, plaintiffs contend defendants failed to reveal that Commonwealth Life Insurance Company (Commonwealth), the company providing the convertible term policies through EPIC, was not licensed in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Prior to trial, defendants submitted a $350,000 offer of judgment. Plaintiff did not accept and the offer expired. The jury verdict was returned on August 4, 2005. The trial court molded the verdict, and after the addition of pretrial interest, a judgment was entered against Barrett and Papetti each for $36,734.60. Plaintiffs\u2019 post-verdict motions for a judgment not withstanding the verdict or for a new trial were denied. Also, defendants\u2019 motions for counsel fees because plaintiffs declined to accept the offer of judgment were denied. The appeals and cross-appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Important to the understanding of plaintiffs\u2019 claims is a brief discussion of the federal tax provisions implicated by EPIC. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Act), Pub. L. 98-369 (1984), amended the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to add sections 419 and 419A. The intended effect of these amendments was to squarely limit the deductibility of an employer\u2019s contributions to pre-fund an employee welfare benefit fund. 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 419 and \u00a7 419A. Concerned with the tax shelter potential when employers claimed deductions for expenses that had not yet been incurred, the amended statute espoused the general policy that \u201ccontributions paid or accrued by an employer to a welfare benefit fund ... shall not be deductible\u201d by the employer, except as specifically allowed by the statute. 26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 419(a). If a plan qualified, such that the contributions were deductible, then 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419(a)(2) and (b) limited the amount and nature of the payments. Generally, deductions were limited to the actual cost of the circumscribed benefits and the maximum aggregate total benefit per employee was capped at $50,000. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The related amendments adding 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419A(a), allowed employers to establish \u201cqualified asset accounts\u201d consisting of assets set aside to provide for the payment of employee benefits for (1) disability, (2) medical, (3) supplemental compensation or severance pay, or (4) life insurance. The Code section set forth similar rules that limited funding and the permitted deductions for these benefit plans. One provision sanctioned an employer\u2019s prefunding of limited post-retirement benefits using a trust or \u201creserve\u201d account. 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419A(c)(2). To be deductible, contributions to a reserve account must accumulate solely for the payment of qualified post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits in accordance with a stated formula. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, the fund must be nondiscriminatory, i.e., cover all employees, and the maximum aggregate total benefit per employee must not exceed $50,000. 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419A(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Other Code amendments in the Act imposed an excise tax to discourage abusive use of welfare benefit plans. 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 4976. The excise tax was assessed on the employer and equaled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>100 percent of any \u201cdisqualified benefits\u201d provided by the welfare benefit plan. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">A special kind of multiple employee welfare benefit plan was exempt from the funding restrictions of sections 419 and 419A. A plan that was part of a \u201c10 or more employer plan,\u201d 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419A(f)(6), was permitted to deduct contributions as business expenses so long as no single employer contributed more than ten percent of the total contributions and the allocated plan contributions did not use experience rating arrangements with respect to the individual employers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In a letter dated January 28,1992, Barrett advised the plaintiffs EPIC was designed to \u201ccomply with each provision of [26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>419A(f)(6)]\u201d thus, allowing the employer to deduct unrestricted amounts of contributions often designated for the most highly compensated employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The IRS had not proposed regulations explaining its interpretation of these new Code sections. Journal articles were written by tax specialists offering perspectives on whether the newly promoted plans in fact qualified for the favorable tax treatment allowed by section 419A(f)(6). In June 1992, the IRS issued for use by its employees, a 117-page book entitled, \u201cThe Tax Treatment of Contributions to Funded Welfare Benefit Plans Under IRC Sections 419 and 419A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In 1995, the IRS began to challenge certain welfare benefit plans purportedly designed to qualify for the 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419A(f)(6) exemption and disallowed favorable tax treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>claimed <em>for the </em>employer\u2019s contributions to those plans. On May 18, 1995, the IES issued Notice 95-34. The Notice explained that the IES examined \u201ctrust arrangements that [promoters] claim satisfy the requirements for the 10-or-more-employer plan exemption and that are used to provide benefits),] such as life insurance, disability, and severance pay benefits.\u201d I.E.S. Notice 95-34,1995-1 <em>C.B. </em>309. The IES announced its disagreement that these plans qualified for preferential tax treatment under 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419(f)(6). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Notice stated these \u201ctrusts often maintain separate accounting of the assets attributable to the contributions made by each subscribing employer), and b]enefits are sometimes related to the amounts allocated to the employees of the participant\u2019s employer.\u201d I.E.S. Notice 95-34, 1995-1 <em>C.B. </em>309. The Notice further warned that plans of this type, which charged contributions based on the employer\u2019s experience in a way that \u201cinsulates the employer to a significant extent from the experience of other subscribing employers\u201d will \u201cnot satisfy the requirements of the section 419A(f)(6) exemption and do not provide the tax deductions claimed by the promoters----\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Thereafter, in <em>Booth, supra, </em>108 <em>T.C. </em>at 561, the United States Tax Court, examined a benefit plan similar to EPIC, entitled the \u201cPrime Financial Benefits Trust Multiple Employer Welfare Benefit Plan and Trust\u201d (the Prime Plan). The Prime Plan used life insurance to provide severance benefits to the participating employees. <em>Id. </em>at 556. The court upheld the IES\u2019s tax position, which mirrored the warnings contained in Notice 95-34. <em>Id. </em>at 576-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In <em>Booth, </em>\u201cthe IES did not interpret the statutory language [of section 419A(f)(6)] to include a program, like the EPIC Plan, \u201cwhere multiple employers have contributed funds to an independent party to hold in separate accounts until disbursed primarily for the benefit of the contributing employer\u2019s employees in accordance with unique terms established by that employer.\u2019\u201d <em>Finderne I, supra, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 184, 809 A.2d 842 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Booth, supra, </em>108 <em>T.C. </em>at 571). The Tax Court determined the Prime Plan was \u201can aggregation of separate welfare benefit plans, each of which has an experience-rating arrangement with the contributing employer,\u201d ibid., and one administrator, <em>id. </em>at 571, not a \u201c10 or more employer plan\u201d that lacks \u201cexperience-rating arrangements with respect to individual employers\u201d as required by 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419A(f)(6). <em>Booth, supra, </em>108 <em>T.C. </em>at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Tax Court concluded that for a plan to qualify for exemption under the Code section, \u201cthere must be a single pool of funds for use by the group as a whole____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571. Although several employers participated in the Prime Plan, each employer\u2019s contributions were based on the employer\u2019s determined needs and funds were separated to solely benefit the employer\u2019s employees. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The second significant United States Tax Court decision that reviewed the new section 419A(f)(6) multiple employer welfare benefit plans was <em>Neonatology </em>Assocs., <em>P.A. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>115 <em>T.C. </em>43, 2000 <em>WL </em>1048512 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>299 F.3d 221 (3d Cir.2002). The ease involved the validity and legitimacy of a Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association (VEBA) plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 56. The mechanics of the VEBA were similar to EPIC in that the employer overpaid for C-Group policies (group term policies with conversion credits to purchase an individual whole life policy upon termination or retirement). <em>Id. </em>at 53-54. The Tax Court held that the contributions to a VEBA made by two professional medical corporations were disguised taxable dividends and not deductible expenses by the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 97. The court labeled the plan \u201ca tax avoidance scheme\u201d and its purported tax benefits were disal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>lowed. <em>Id. </em>at 100-01. In affirming the Tax Court, the Third Circuit made clear VEBAs were not the type of multiple employer plans allowed by section 419A(f)(6). <em>Neonatology Assocs., P.A. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>299 A.3d 221, 232 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">At trial, the parties\u2019 experts disagreed when Barrett and Papetti knew or should have known EPIC ran afoul of the IRS requirements to qualify for the asserted preferred tax treatment. Floyd Culhane, Jr., Esq., one of plaintiffs\u2019 experts published an article in January 1992 titled \u201cRisks Involved in the Sale of Life Insurance to Multiple Employer Welfare Benefit Plans.\u201d Culhane acknowledged that when he wrote the article, \u201cthere was no guidance from the IRS on [section] 419A(f)(6) [plans].\u201d His article predicted that the \u201cnew type of multiple employer welfare benefit plan\u201d marketed to closely held businesses, \u201cunder claims that inordinately large current deductions are available for contributions to fund severance pay plans and death benefit plans\u201d did not qualify as exempt section 419A(f)(6) plans. Culhane concluded the mechanisms of these non-qualifying plans \u201cattempt to exploit a loophole in rules regarding income tax deductibility of the contributions\u201d and the plans continued \u201cthe abuse Congress sought to curb\u201d by the amendments of the Act. Culhane testified EPIC was \u201cexactly the plan\u201d his article discussed because its structure did not fit the previously accepted structure of multi-employer welfare benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">After reading Culhane\u2019s article early in 1992, prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 participation in EPIC, Papetti contacted Culhane to \u201cget his thoughts and understand where he was coming from.\u201d Papetti believed the EPIC\u2019s conversion provision would not be considered a disallowed post-retirement benefit to employees and Culhane\u2019s commentary was directed to \u201ca different type of employee benefit plan,\u201d that provided severance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Russell Greenblatt, Esq., defendants\u2019 expert on taxation and employee benefit and welfare plans, specialized in VEBAs. In 1980, he had substantially authored the IRS regulations governing those associations. Greenblatt concurred that in 1991 or 1992 \u201c[t]here was zero guidance\u201d from the IRS on how the new Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>sections would be interpreted or what was permitted under section 419A(f)(6). Greenblatt distinguished EPIC from the plans discussed in <em>Booth </em>and Notice 95-34, and he concluded, Barrett and Papetti had no reason to believe EPIC was abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We now examine plaintiffs\u2019 arguments as related to their claims of fraud and misrepresentation against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">. Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Plaintiffs propose that providers of personal financial planning services are subject to the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -166. Prior to trial, defendants Barrett and Papetti filed motions for summary judgment on the CFA claims, which were denied. On reconsideration, the motion judge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reviewed whether the sale of life insurance through EPIC was the type of transaction intended to be covered by the CFA. <em>See Lemelledo v. Beneficial Mgmt. Corp. of Am., </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>255, 265, 696 A.2d 546 (1997) (CFA\u2019s language was \u201cample enough to encompass the sale of insurance policies as goods and services that are marketed to consumers\u201d). The motion judge reversed the prior determination and concluded the insurance transactions in this case were factually distinguishable from those presented in <em>Lemelledo, </em>such that the EPIC tax avoidance program was not encompassed by the protections of the CFA. The motion judge also examined the services rendered by Barrett and Papetti, concluding they were exempt because they \u201cinvolv[ed] the rendering of services by a learned professional.\u201d <em>Neveroski v. Blair, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 379, 358 A.2d 473 (App.Div.1976). With respect to the other defendants, the judge concluded that as a matter of policy, \u201can aggressive tax strategy ... hardly merits the protective cocoon of the CFA.\u201d Thus, the court granted summary judgment on this claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Plaintiffs focus on the actions of Barrett and Papetti that induced them to participate in EPIC, arguing the motion judge erred as a matter of law. Plaintiffs argue EPIC was \u201ca fancy way to package the sale of the C-Group insurance product\u201d and assert the transaction falls within the scope of the CFA. Defendants center their arguments on the transaction between FMC and EPIC, suggesting the CFA does not apply to participation in such a sophisticated employee benefit plan.

They also withheld revelation of the insurance company\u2019s control over the amount and issuance of conversion credits, and that their remuneration was paid from FMC\u2019s EPIC contributions.

Nevertheless, services provided by professionals acting outside their professional capacity may be covered by the CFA. <em>See Gilmore v.

J.Super. </em>at 175, 732 A.2d 555 (false representations by an architect performing marketing services was covered by CFA).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We agree with plaintiff that despite Barrett\u2019s licensure as an insurance producer and Papetti\u2019s certification as an accountant, the services rendered in this instance, termed \u201cfinancial planning,\u201d extended beyond the finite acts of selling insurance policies or providing accounting services. In fact, at trial, Papetti emphasized he \u201cwas never engaged as a CPA by the D\u00e1meos, [he] was engaged as a [financial planner\u201d and his company was \u201cin the business of providing fee based financial planning.\u201d Barrett, the plaintiffs\u2019 longtime insurance agent, also characterized his services as \u201cfinancial planning services.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendants reviewed and recommended business structure and strategy, advanced the purchase of products to address estate tax minimization, and made investment recommendations for retirement vehicles. Defendants were selling products and services to plaintiffs purportedly to achieve an overall plan for the corporation and the individuals financial well-being. These acts of \u201cfinancial planning\u201d went beyond Papetti\u2019s profession as an accountant or Barrett\u2019s as an insurance agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Plaintiffs persuasively argue the lack of state or federal licensure or regulation of \u201cfinancial planners\u201d subjects Barrett and Papetti to CFA liability. Unlike physicians <em>(Macedo), </em>attorneys (Vort) or real estate brokers (Neveroski), no regulatory body defines uniform education, testing, or standards governing financial planners or the products they promote. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>45:1-1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>to -32 (Professions and Occupations Subject To State Boards Of Registration And Examination). Papetti used the designation of \u201cCFP,\u201d which he explained was \u201ccertified financial planner.\u201d Papetti did not elaborate what entity issued the designation. Matthew Tuttle, offered as defendants\u2019 expert in financial planning, had no organization certification and stated, \u201cThere are hundreds of organizations offering certifications in my field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We are convinced that self-proclaimed \u201cprofessionals\u201d offering financial planning services, like Barrett and Papetti, are not the \u201clearned professionals\u201d identified by the court in <em>Neveroski </em>who are beyond the reach of the CFA. Although competing voluntary associations issue designations to those who seek to be called \u201cfinancial planners,\u201d no governmental board or agency regulates or sets uniform minimum education or training criteria. <em>See Plemmons, supra, </em>387 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 564, 904 A.2d 825 (professional or semi-professional suggests person is subject to testing, licensing and comprehensive regulation by relevant regulatory bodies); <em>see also, Quigley v. Esquire Deposition Serv., </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 507, 948 A.2d 665 (App.Div.2008) (federal depositions shorthand reporting services are not semi-professional because services are not subject to regulation under the state statute and regulations governing shorthand reporting).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">We conclude that the lack of uniform regulation of an occupational group defeats its recognition as \u201clearned professionals,\u201d as contemplated in <em>Neveroski. </em>This result does not demean the abilities, education, or professionalism of any occupation. It contemplates that there must be some standards by which all members in the profession are measured. Only in this way can the group fall outside CFA regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Also, we reject defendants\u2019 suggestion that because a corporation participated in EPIC, the CFA does not apply. \u201cCharacterizing consumers as those who both \u2018use and consume economic goods and services,\u2019 protections under the CFA fare] extended to corporate plaintiffs \u2018in a consumer oriented situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Papergraphics, supra, </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 12, 910 A.2d 625 (quoting <em>BOC </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Group, Inc. v.

It is the character of the transaction, not the identity of the purchaser, which determines whether the CFA is applicable. <em>J &amp; R Ice Cream Corp. v. Cal.

Broward Hosp. Dist. v. MedQuist, Inc., </em>516 F.Supp.2d 370, 399 (D.N.J.2007), <em>aff'd, </em>258 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>466 (3d Cir.2007); <em>Bracco Diagnostics, Inc. v.

The VEBA plans were similar to EPIC in that the employers purchased \u201cC-Group\u201d convertible term life insurance policies for employees at an inflated cost. <em>Id. </em>at 501. The employers\u2019 annual contributions were to be tax-deductible and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the employees could later convert the group life insurance to individual policies, using the premium overpayments as tax conversion credits. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Agreeing with the trial court, the Third Circuit concluded that \u201cthe VEBA plans were complex tax-avoidance schemes designed primarily to allow an investor to make tax-deductible contributions while allowing for a permanent tax deferral upon withdrawal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514. The court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 CFA claims, concluding the \u201crather complex arrangements\u201d required by participation in the VEBA plans did not \u201creflect the kinds of goods or services generally sold to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514 (quotations and citations omitted). Moreover, the court determined the plans were \u201cmarketed to a discrete and specific class of capable investors\u2014not the general public,\u201d and concluded \u201cthe sale of complex employee welfare benefit plans to a very specific class of investor does not point to the remedial purpose or intent of the CFA.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">This reasoning directly applies to the facts at hand. EPIC was not a single transaction, such as obtaining a loan or buying an insurance policy. It was very complex. The sixty-page disclosure document detailed the intricacies of EPIC\u2019s multiemployer trust and the trust\u2019s ownership of the insurance polices purchased; the role of the EPIC plan trustee; the need for the simultaneous establishment by each individual of a trust to receive any insurance proceeds; the purchase of term insurance policies and the workings of the conversion credits to obtain universal whole life insurance; and the existence of stabilization reserve accounts and accumulations of excess contributions for the future conversion purposes of the individual insureds. The layers of the EPIC plan implicated numerous Code sections striving to achieve the \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d tax benefits that foreshadowed an IRS challenge as a tax avoidance design.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Furthermore, we do not view plaintiffs as unsophisticated buyers, victimized after being lured into EPIC through fraudulent, deceptive selling or advertising practices. Plaintiffs sought advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>from both an accountant and an attorney while proceeding with their estate plan, which included executing the EPIC adoption agreement. The EPIC documents were replete with recommendations and disclaimers to seek independent guidance. For example, this disclaimer was included in defendants\u2019 initial planning proposal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">THIS IS A PROPOSAL NOT A CONTRACT. TAX AND LEGAL CONSEQUENCES AND COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EMPLOYER AND ITS ATTORNEYS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">This directive was in the financial illustrations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">ALL QUESTIONS OF TAX AND LEGAL NATURE SHOULD BE REFERRED TO TAX COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">This language was in the EPIC Adoption Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">[Tjri-Core, Inc. and Trustee have recommended that such employers seek independent tax advice regarding the tax consequences of Employer\u2019s participation in the Trust prior to executing this Adoption Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">And, this statement was placed above the signature line of the Adoption Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">The undersigned hereby represents that (1) ... (2) legal and tax counsel have been consulted to the extent the undersigned deems necessary and appropriate; (3) neither the insurer nor its agents can guarantee or promise that any anticipated favorable tax results will in fact be achieved____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">Perhaps these statements alone would be considered \u201cboilerplate\u201d and not be determinative of the complexity or risk of the endeavor; however, when they are set in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 desire to obtain large corporate deductions and substantial tax free income for themselves, it is clear this was a device to shelter income from taxation, which is not a consumer transaction as envisioned by the adopters of the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">The courts have recognized the \u201cneed to place reasonable limits upon the operation of the [CFA] \u2018despite broad statutory language^] so that its enforcement properly reflects legislative intent____\u2019\u201d DiBer<em>nardo v. Mosley, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>371, 375, 502 A.2d 1166 (App.Div.), (quoting <em>Jones v.

Accordingly, we conclude the denial of the broad remedial relief of the CFA to plaintiffs\u2019 participation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the disallowed EPIC tax avoidance program does not thwart the Legislature\u2019s desire to protect consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Next, plaintiffs contend the motion judge erred in excluding their claims for damages based on their expectation under EPIC, i.e., damages equivalent to the retirement benefits promised. Defendants counter any claim for benefit-of-the-bargain damages was speculative and inappropriate because plaintiffs failed to exercise the available conversion option to realize this benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In denying recovery for \u201cbenefit-of-the-bargain\u201d damages, rather than \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d losses incurred as a result of the collapse of the EPIC plan, Judge Derman identified the high stakes tax avoidance plan and the speculative rewards contemplated by a taxpayer joining EPIC. She concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">If this court were to allow [plaintiffs to pursue damages under the benefit of the bargain theory, the court would in essence be allowing [plaintiffs to realize benefits that the federal government has already determined are not allowed under our tax laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">Also, <em>Zeliff v. Sabatino, </em>[15 <em>N.J. 70, </em>104 A.2d 54 (1954)], holds that the formula utilized, benefit of the bargain or out of pocket, must be the one that is \u201cappropriate under the circumstances.\u201d The court finds it unreasonable and incredible that [p]laintiffs thought that, because of the exploitation of a tax loophole, ... they were guaranteed by defendants to receive post-retirement income, tax-free for twenty years____ [Benefit-of-the-bargain damages] would be a windfall, and ... it would be condoning a manipulation of the [Code]. This court will not be a party to device in which essentially, as the Tax Court described in <em>Neonatology, [supra,] </em>115 <em>T.C. </em>[at 89], the plan was a vehicle \u201cdesigned ... to distribute surplus cash surreptitiously (in the form of excess contributions) from the corporations for the employer/owners\u2019 ultimate use and benefit,\u201d tax free.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">Although we do not owe any special deference to a trial court\u2019s legal conclusion, <em>Shaler v.

The typical dispute is between applying an \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d model, versus the \u201cbenefit-of-the-bargain\u201d rule. <em>Ibid. </em>Out-of-pocket damages represent the difference between the price paid and the actual value received. <em>Ibid. </em>On the other hand, benefit-of-the-bargain principles allow \u201crecovery for the difference between the price paid and the value of the property had the representations been true.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[S]o long as the amount of the lost benefit can be established by the proofs with sufficient certainty, a court will award damages equal to that which a plaintiff would have received had the representation been true.\u201d <em>McConkey v.

The projected retirement benefits analysis given to plaintiffs were estimates, contingent on issues including the amount of the conversion credits as allowed by the insurance company, FMC\u2019s experience rating, or possible future changes in the tax laws. Plaintiffs knew their EPIC participation involved taking advantage of the narrow exclusion provided by 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 419A(f)(6). They also knew they were significantly overpaying for group term life insurance and claiming the inflated amount as a business expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Even more critical to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 argument that it should recover benefit-of-the-bargain damages is the fact that this court would be required to enforce the EPIC plan provisions, which were disallowed by the IRS.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>[I]n no way and through no channels, directly or indirectly, will the courts allow an action to be maintained for the recovery of property delivered under an illegal contract where, in order to maintain such recovery, it is necessary to have recourse to that contract.

Plaintiffs advance the following errors in the charge: (1) on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>RICO claims,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> inclusion of the ultimate outcome charge; (2) improperly articulating the fiduciary responsibilities of defendants; (3) failure to charge plaintiffs could not be contributorily negligent; (4) inclusion of a charge that damages could be reduced by any benefits plaintiffs received by EPIC participation; (5) charging mitigation; and (6) inclusion of comparative fault. Prior to consideration of these arguments, we recite the principles that guide our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">\u201cA jury is entitled to an explanation of the applicable legal principles and how they are to be applied in light of the parties\u2019 contentions and the evidence produced in the case.\u201d <em>Viscik v. Fowler Equip. Co., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18, 800 A.2d 826 (2002) (citing <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 431, 648 A.2d 223 (App.Div.1994)); <em>Toto v. Sheriff's Officer Rolando Ensuar, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>134, 144, 952 A.2d 463 (2008). The charge to the jury \u201cmust correctly state the applicable law, outline the jury\u2019s function and be clear in how the jury should apply the legal principles charged to the facts of the ease at hand.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Erroneous jury instructions constitute reversible error only if the jury could have come to a different result had it been correctly instructed. <em>Velazquez ex rel. Velazquez v. Portadin, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>677, 688, 751 A.2d 102 (2000). Erroneous instructions on a material part of the charge are also presumed to be reversible. <em>McClelland v. Tucker, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 417, 642 A.2d 409 (App.Div.1994). One ground for finding an instruction erroneous and likely to mislead the jury is the absence of support for it in the evidence. <em>Dynasty, Inc. v. Princeton Ins. Co., </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>1,13-14, 754 A.2d 1137 (2000); <em>Lesniak v. County of Bergen, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>12, 20, 563 A.2d 795 (1989); <em>Guzzi v. Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>251, 260, 96 A.2d 387 (1953), <em>certif. denied, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>339, 117 A.2d 52 (1955). Thus, we undertake our examination by reviewing the charge as a whole, rather than focusing on individual errors in isolation. <em>Ryder v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>128 F.3d 128, 137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>(3d Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>1116, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>1052, 140 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>115 (1998); <em>Mohr v. B.F. Goodrich Rubber Co., </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>279, 283, 371 A.2d 288 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>281, 377 A.2d 685 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We agree with plaintiffs\u2019 argument that federal law applies with respect to the RICO charge, and informing the jury of the ultimate outcome of a verdict on the RICO count was inappropriate. <em>St. James v. Future Fin., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>310, 348, 776 A.2d 849 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>388, 788 A.2d 773 (2001). The judge advised if defendants were liable under RICO, the damages are trebled and attorney\u2019s fees awarded. 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1964(c). Those federal courts addressing the issue have consistently held that the implementation of treble damages is a function for the court, not the jury. <em>HBE Leasing Corp. v. Frank, 22 </em>F.3d 41, 45 (2d Cir.1994). This avoids presenting the jury with information irrelevant to its deliberations that could tempt jurors to manipulate the outcome and lead to intellectually dishonest results. <em>Ibid. </em>In this matter, we conclude the error is of no moment. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Following the court\u2019s instructions, the jury agreed plaintiffs proved defendants formed an informal association to promote EPIC, but determined Barrett and Papetti had not committed the predicate acts of mail or wire fraud. 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1961. Nothing suggests the jury was misled or sympathetic to defendants. It is \u201cour belief that jurors are persons of good faith, that they strive to fulfill their role without passion or prejudice toward either side, and that they work hard to abide by all instructions to the best of their ability.\u201d <em>Wanetick v. Gateway Mitsubishi, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>484, 494, 750 A.2d 79 (2000). Accordingly, we conclude the verdict was the product of thoughtful deliberations by a diligent jury that viewed the evidence and applied the law as instructed. We are not convinced the use of the inappropriate ultimate outcome charge resulted in manifest injustice or warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>On the next challenge, we find unavailing plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that the charge was flawed because it inadequately described the nature of the fiduciary obligations owed by Barrett and Papetti, and also failed to include a pronouncement that plaintiffs could not have contributed to their harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">As requested, the court charged the jury that \u201cas a matter of law, [Barrett and Papetti] both had fiduciary duties with respect to the plaintiffs in this case.\u201d Then, the court satisfactorily described the scope and nature of the \u201cduty of loyalty to plaintiffs\u201d and \u201cthe duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in giving advice and making recommendations about the [plaintiffs\u2019] participation in the EPIC plan.\u201d The additional language plaintiffs requested sought to heighten the loyalty standard. We do not agree that the language was necessary or proper. Moreover, plaintiffs prevailed on their breach of duty claims, militating against claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Next, plaintiffs target the portion of the jury instruction related to damages, presumably due to dissatisfaction with the amount of the award. Plaintiffs argued for an instruction telling the jury to ignore possible tax savings. Defendants maintained the tax deductions taken by FMC in four of the six years of EPIC participation were a permissible offset against damages. The trial judge determined he could not state as a matter of law that there was or was not a benefit. He included both positions in the charge and left the question of whether there was a realized benefit for the jury. Thus, the jury could consider whether plaintiffs were entitled \u201cto get all [their] money back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>Randall v. Loftsgaarden, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>647, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>3143, 92 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986), suggesting \u201cas a matter of law\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ctax deductions should not be taken into account in determining damages in business transactions.\u201d We disagree that the United States Supreme Court made such a pronouncement. In fact, the Court actually demurred on \u201cwhether evidence concerning tax benefits is ordinarily so speculative as to be beyond the jury\u2019s province.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664-65, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3153-54, 92 L.Ed.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>In <em>Randall, supra, </em>the plaintiff purchased a limited real estate partnership interest in a motel. 478 <em>U.S. </em>at 650, <em>106 S.Ct. </em>at 3146, 92 L.Ed.2d at 533. The plaintiffs rescission action, brought under \u00a7 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Act), [15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 <em>771(2)], </em>sought return of her investment based on fraud in the prospectus.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>At issue was the calculation of rescissory damages as allowed under the Act. <em>Ibid. </em>The statute provides a defrauded investor harmed by a prospectus fraud may sue \u201cto recover the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon....\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 <em>771(2).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Examining this language, the Supreme Court concluded the tax benefits from the investment were not \u201cincome received\u201d and were not to be offset from the recovery. <em>Randall, supra, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>at 656, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3149, 92 L.Ed.2d at 537. The discussion specifically centered on Congress\u2019s intent. The Court concluded by enacting the specific statutory remedy of rescission, Congress intended to provide what may be an enhanced recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 664, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3153, 92 L.Ed.2d at 542. \u201c[Rjescission adds an additional measure of deterrence as compared to a purely compensatory measure of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3151, 92 L.Ed.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">We cannot construe <em>Randall\u2019s </em>holding as dispositive in this matter. The fraud alleged by the plaintiff in <em>Randall </em>was a prospectus misrepresentation directed to the value of the underlying asset, not a misrepresentation as to the level of potential tax benefits from the investment. Had the basis of the plaintiffs suit been a misrepresentation of the level of tax benefits, the Supreme Court stated \u201cwe do not consider whether courts may ever refuse to allow a rescissory recovery under [the statute] where the \u2018premium\u2019 for expected tax benefits represented a large portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the purchase price, in which event the out-of-pocket measure might yield a significantly smaller recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667,106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3155, 92 L.Ed.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The case at bar was not one seeking rescission, but actual damages. Judge Ashrafi adopted the rationale of the Seventh Circuit in <em>Burdett v. Miller, </em>957 F.2d 1375, 1383 (7th Cir.1992). In <em>Burdett, supra, </em>the court noted the plaintiffs investment was intended to generate tax benefits, which included losses incurred by the purchase of the tax shelter, designed to offset other income, thus, reducing the taxpayer\u2019s overall tax obligation. 957 F.2d at 1384. The court concluded the tax benefits must be considered when fixing actual damages as \u201c[t]he essential point is that with regard to benefits of whatever sort that are promised and received, there is no injury, [and] no basis for a claim of damages.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Despite the lack of published authority on this narrow issue, we note New Jersey has a strong public policy against permitting double recoveries. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 (collateral source statute permits the court to deduct any duplicative award from a plaintiffs personal injury recovery); <em>Taylor v. Metzger, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>490, 509, 706 A.2d 685 (1998) (plaintiff cannot obtain double recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of LAD); <em>Millison v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 187, 501 A.2d 505 (1985) (injured employee must reimburse workers\u2019 compensation carrier in the event of recovery in civil action for employers\u2019 intentional actions that caused injury); <em>Rosales v. State Dept. of the Judiciary, </em>373 <em>N. J.Super. </em>29, 31, 860 A.2d 929 (App.Div.2004) (long standing public policy prohibiting dual recoveries for the same disability), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>630, 868 A.2d 1033 (2005); <em>Kislak Co. v. Hirschfeld, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 559, 537 A.2d 748 (App.Div.1988) (real estate agent is entitled to the commission for performance, diminished by any expense to accomplish result, which included commission of selling agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We cannot ignore that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>a harmed plaintiff is permitted to recover for the wrongdoing of a tortfeasor, but that the plaintiffs recovery should be reduced by any benefits received from the wrongdoers\u2019 actions. This is the only reasonable interpretation that furthers the overriding tort damages principle of restoring the plaintiff to the position he or she would have been but for the actions of the tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\"><em>(Ronson v. Talesnick, </em>33 F.Supp.2d 347, 354 (D.N.J.1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Here, the trial judge did not instruct the jury to offset the tax savings realized by FMC. He raised the arguments of the parties and allowed the jury to weigh the evidence and consider whether benefits flowed to plaintiffs that lessened their loss. No legal error is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\"># * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">[At the direction of the court, per <em>Rule </em>l:36-2(a), Part VII-VIII of the opinion is omitted from publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">*!\u2022 \u2022!' v</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">In their respective cross-appeals, defendants seek entitlement to counsel fees under the offer of judgment rule. <em>R. </em>4:58-2(a). In June 2004, seven defendants, including Barrett and Papetti, submitted a joint offer of judgment to plaintiffs for $350,000. When plaintiffs did not accept the offer within ninety days, several defendants submitted individual settlement offers. Defendants made no subsequent offers. Barrett and Papetti suggest their liability, pursuant to the verdict when compared to the joint offer, warrants an award of fees and costs. Reviewing these facts, the trial court concluded the rule was inapplicable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">Under <em>Rule </em>4:58-l(a), a party may offer to satisfy a claim for monetary relief prior to trial. The rule is \u201cdesigned to promote early settlement\u201d and discourage rejection of reasonable settlement offers. <em>Palmer v. Kovacs, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 425, 897 A.2d 429 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>356, 907 A.2d 1015 (2006). If an offer is not accepted under prescribed time limits, it is deemed withdrawn, and \u201cevidence thereof shall not be admissible except in a proceeding after trial to fix costs, interest, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:58\u20141(b). Also, \u201c[t]he making of a further offer shall constitute a withdrawal of all previous offers made by that party.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:58\u20141(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">If the offer is not accepted and the party obtains a \u201cfavorable determination,\u201d the offering party receives costs, reasonable litigation expenses incurred after non-acceptance, prejudgment interest, and reasonable counsel fees occasioned by the non-acceptance. <em>R. </em>4:58-3(a) referencing <em>R. </em>4:58-2. A \u201cfavorable determination\u201d is a \u201cmoney judgment ... excluding allowable prejudgment interest and counsel fees, that is 80% of the offer or less.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>R. </em>4:58\u20143(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">A basic reading of the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>requirements defeats defendants\u2019 argument. Plaintiffs had the right to reject the original combined offer by a group of defendants and accept the separately made subsequent offers by certain defendants. <em>Schettino v. Roizman Dev., Inc., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>476, 483, 730 A.2d 797 (1999). By operation of the <em>Rule, </em>the original joint offer was considered withdrawn. Defendants did not offer a subsequent settlement sum to trigger the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>application.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We recognize this simplistic approach ignores the difficulties presented when attempting to apply the <em>Rule </em>in complex, multidefendant cases. <em>Cripps v. DiGregorio, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 198, 824 A.2d 1104 (App.Div.2003). In <em>Cripps, supra, </em>we noted the <em>Rule </em>does not apply to any offer by fewer than all defendants in a \u201cmulti-defendant, multi-count case[,] including claims of joint and several liability.\u201d 361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 198, 824 A.2d 1104. This case illustrates the complexities. Defendants seek credit for the entire amount of the initial offer, yet there is no mention of the actual amount they were to contribute. Plaintiffs respond that their combined recovery from other defendants exceeded the initial settlement offer. The <em>Rule </em>is simply unworkable in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>$ $ Ht</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">[At the direction of the court, per <em>Rule </em>l:36-2(a), the balance of the opinion is omitted from publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">5|\u00ab Sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\"> 26 <em>U.S.CA. </em>\u00a7 162(a) permits a deduction for all \"ordinary and necessaiy expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\" Any item claimed as deductible must be (1) paid or incurred during the taxable year; (2) for carrying on a trade or business; (3) an expense; (4) a necessary expense; and (5) an ordinary expense. <em>Commissioner v.
