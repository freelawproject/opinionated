We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">This appeal arises out of allegations that defendant sexually assaulted his daughters between 1996 and 2000. In 2000, the children reported to their mother that their father had sexually abused them. The mother then contacted her pastor, Glenford Brown, and reported the children\u2019s allegations. Brown knew defendant from their native Jamaica, although defendant, himself, did not attend Brown\u2019s church in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Believing he had a duty to protect defendant\u2019s wife and children, Brown called defendant at work to tell him he should not go back to his home. Brown arranged to meet defendant outside Brown\u2019s townhouse\u2014because Brown would not allow defendant into his house. They talked in a play area behind Brown\u2019s house where defendant, \u201cwithout directly saying [he] sexually molested them, ... acknowledged what he did\u201d and asked Brown to persuade his wife to let him back in the house. Brown told defendant he would not do that. Defendant asked Brown \u201cto counsel\u201d him but Brown declined because he was too angry with defendant and defendant \u201cneeded real psychological help which [Brown] was not qualified to give.\u201d A few weeks later, defendant went to Brown\u2019s church where he talked with Brown and \u201cacknowledged what he did.\u201d Defendant asked Brown to baptize him, but Brown told defendant he could not baptize him because Brown \u201cthought he wanted cover for his actions.\u201d Brown urged defendant to turn himself in to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">After a hearing, during which Brown gave the testimony related above, the trial court rendered a decision on the record of October 25,2007, granting defendant\u2019s motion to preclude Brown\u2019s testimony under the privilege. Relying on the three-part test articulated in <em>State v. Cary, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 241, 751 A.2d 620 (App.Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>2000), the court found that the statements made to Brown by defendant were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The State, in this interlocutory appeal, argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">THE TRIAL JUDGE IMPROPERLY RULED THAT DEPENDANT\u2019S MEETING AND CONVERSATION WITH GLENFORD BROWN WAS PROTECTED UNDER THE CLERIC-PENITENT PRIVILEGE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The State contends that defendant\u2019s communications to Brown are not protected under the cleric-penitent privilege because the circumstances surrounding the communications did not demonstrate that they were made in confidence to Brown in his role as a spiritual advisor. The State contends that the trial court\u2019s ruling is contrary to both the evidence and the law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Pursuant to both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23 and <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511, under the cleric-penitent privilege</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">[a]ny communication made in confidence to a cleric in the cleric\u2019s professional character, or as a spiritual advisor in the course of the discipline or practice of the religious body to which the cleric belongs or of the religion which the cleric professes, shall be privileged. Privileged communications shall include confessions and other communications made in confidence between and among the cleric and individuals, couples, families or groups in the exercise of the cleric\u2019s professional or spiritual counseling role.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">The privilege belongs to both the cleric and the person making the communication, and either can invoke it. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>511.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">In <em>Cary, </em>we articulated a three-part test for application of the cleric-penitent privilege. To warrant protection, \u201ca person\u2019s communication must be made: (1) in confidence; (2) to a cleric; and (3) to the cleric in his or her professional character or role as a spiritual advisor.\u201d 331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 241, 751 A.2d 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">Generally, \u201cprivileges are to be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>State v. Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 413, 640 A.2d 817 (1994), <em>superseded by N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-23. Because privileges can \u201c \u2018undermine the search for truth in the administration of justice,\u2019 ... they are accepted only to the extent that they outweigh the public interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>in the search for truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413-14, 640 A.2d 817 (quoting <em>State v. Dyal, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>229, 237, 478 A.2d 390 (1984)). Privileges \u201care accepted only because in the particular area concerned, they are regarded as serving a more important public interest than the need for full disclosure.\u201d <em>State v. Briley, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>498, 506, 251 A.2d 442 (1969). Thus, they should \u201cbe construed and applied in a sensible accommodation to the aim of a just result.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Here, the State argues that the trial court failed to construe the privilege narrowly. The State contends that the trial court judge: (1) \u201ccompletely failed to give any regard to the pastor\u2019s explanation of the circumstances that gave rise to the outdoor meeting with defendant\u201d that \u201cit had no religious purpose to it at all;\u201d (2) \u201cfailed to properly analyze the circumstances under which Pastor Brown met with defendant;\u201d and (3) impermissibly relied on the length of defendant\u2019s relationship with the pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In <em>Cary, </em>we considered whether the cleric-penitent privilege applied to a defendant who confessed to a Baptist deacon who was also a New Jersey State Trooper. 331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 238, 751 A.2d 620. The defendant, Cary, was involved in an altercation in which he allegedly fired several gun shots into a store striking two bystanders, killing one and injuring the other. <em>Ibid. </em>A few days after the incident, Cary met privately with his pastor at his church in Belleville, \u201capparently to seek spiritual guidance regarding the altercation and how he should proceed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After the meeting, Cary informed the pastor that he wanted to surrender to the police. <em>Ibid. </em>The pastor summoned a recently ordained deacon, who was also a state trooper, to determine how to handle the matter with Cary. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">When the pastor and the deacon met with Cary, the deacon introduced himself as a deacon in the church and as a state trooper. <em>Ibid. </em>While Cary related certain events to the men, the deacon reminded Cary of his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 751 A.2d 620. Moreover, during the meeting, the deacon had Cary \u201cstand against the wall and spread his arms and legs in a traditional search posture\u201d while the deacon searched him. <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>At some point during the meeting, however, all three men prayed together. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In deciding that Cary\u2019s communications to the deacon were not privileged, we noted the deacon\u2019s dual role in his relationship to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 246-47, 751 A.2d 620. The deacon identified himself as both a deacon and state trooper; reminded Cary of his right to remain silent and, despite praying with him, searched him. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 751 A.2d 620. Given these circumstances, we found it \u201cdifficult to comprehend how Cary could have \u2018reasonably expected\u2019 that his communications with [the deacon] would remain confidential.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. List, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 175, 636 A.2d 1054 (App.Div.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In <em>In re Murtha, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 388, 279 A.2d 889 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>239, 281 A.2d 278 (1971), where the defendant made certain statements to a nun, we found that the privilege did not apply. There, the nun invoked the privilege and refused to testify about the conversation she had with the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 279 A.2d 889. We found that \u201c[h]er posture ... was not that of a person standing in the relation of a priest hearing [the defendant\u2019s] confession or confidential communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 279 A.2d 889. Instead, the \u201c[defendant] had, quite simply, come to [the nun] for support and help in a time of great trouble, ready to go to the police and tell what happened ____ [The nun] accompanied [defendant] ... to the police station. Any claim of confidentiality and privilege evaporates in such a factual setting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 279 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In <em>Corsie v. Campanalonga, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>177, 182-84, 721 A.2d 733 (App.Div.1998), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>473, 734 A.2d 788 (1999), plaintiffs alleged that they were sexually abused by defendant, a former Catholic priest. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 721 A.2d 733. There, we found that correspondence or communications in files maintained by the Vicar for Priests were protected by the privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 721 A.2d 733. The Vicar testified that he was acting in his \u201cprofessional character, or as a spiritual advisor\u201d when a priest confided in him regarding certain alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>sexual assaults. <em>Ibid. </em>Similar to a confessional matter with any other penitent, priests often confide in the Vicar with the expectation of privacy and confidentiality. <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded that \u201cso long as [the priest\u2019s] communications to the Vicar were \u2018confessions\u2019 or otherwise made with the expectation of confidentiality, these communications are protected against disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 721 A.2d 733. We remanded the matter for the trial court to review the Vicar\u2019s files <em>in camera </em>to determine which documents were \u201c\u2018confessions\u2019 or otherwise made with the expectation of confidentiality.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The State also relies on <em>Magar v. State, </em>308 <em>Ark. </em>380, 826 S.W.2d 221, 222-23 (1992), wherein the Arkansas Supreme Court considered whether a conversation Magar had with a minister was made in confidence on the ground that Magar and the minister had previous counseling sessions, which the minister had assured Magar were private. 826 S.W.2d at 222. Essentially, Magar relied upon \u201ca purported established relationship of confidentiality between himself and [the minister] when he discussed the issues later involved at his trial.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The minister testified that members of his church, the parents of two boys, told him that their sons had been sexually molested by Magar. <em>Ibid. </em>When the minister confronted Magar with the allegations, he admitted they were true. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The minister also testified that \u201cconfession [was] not a tenet of his church and keeping evidence of a crime confidential is within the discretion of the pastor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although the minister generally regarded the information gained in a counseling relationship as confidential, this particular conversation with Magar was \u201cdisciplinary in nature.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the minister \u201cdid not tell Magar that the conversation was confidential, nor did Magar ask that it be kept confidential.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In determining that Magar\u2019s communication was not made to the minister \u201cin his professional character as a spiritual advisor,\u201d the court found it significant that the minister sought Magar to confront him with the allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 222. The court was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>influenced by the minister\u2019s testimony that the conversation was disciplinary in nature and not for counseling purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 222-23. The court determined that \u201c[t]he attendant circumstances support the trial court\u2019s decision that this was an accusatory situation initiated by [the minister] that did not encompass spiritual counseling, thereby precluding Magar' from excluding [the minister\u2019s] testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have interpreted similar statutory provisions, declining to apply the privilege when the communications were not related to religious or spiritual concerns. <em>See e.g., Keenan v. Gigante, </em>47 N.Y.2d 160, 417 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>226, 390 <em>N.E.2d </em>1151, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>887, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>181, 62 L.Ed.2d 118 (1979) (finding privilege was inapplicable to defendant\u2019s communications to priest where the communications were made for purpose of securing defendant\u2019s admittance into a work release program); <em>Burger v. State, </em>238 <em>Ga. </em>171, 231 S.E.2d 769 (1977) (holding defendant could not claim privilege concerning conversation with a clergy member who was his friend and frequent companion regarding defendant\u2019s intent to kill his wife and her lover). A \u201ccommon thread in these cases is that the privilege may not be invoked to enshroud conversations with wholly secular purposes solely because one of the parties to the conversation happened to be a religious minister.\u201d <em>People v. Carmona, </em>82 <em>N.Y.2d </em>603, 606 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>879, 627 <em>N.E.2d </em>959, 962 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Although this court is not bound by <em>Magar, </em>we consider it factually similar to the facts here. As in <em>Magar, </em>defendant, who was charged with sexual assault, claimed the conversations he had with Brown were made in confidence. Brown reached out to defendant, as did the minister in <em>Magar, </em>and when confronted with the allegations, defendant admitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Brown testified that the purpose of his conversation with defendant was not for counseling but to protect defendant\u2019s wife and children. During their initial conversation defendant asked for Brown\u2019s counsel and help. Brown refused to counsel defendant, however, and told defendant that he needed psychological help. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The pastor indicated only that he could \u201cprobably try to help find an organization that [could] counsel [defendant],\u201d but Brown stated that he could not help defendant. Although they were the only individuals present during their conversations, Brown never informed defendant that their conversations would be confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Applying the <em>Cary </em>test, we find that although Brown was a cleric and spoke to defendant without anyone else present, (1) defendant did not ask and Brown did not offer to keep the conversation confidential; (2) Brown reached out to defendant\u2014 not as a spiritual advisor\u2014but to protect defendant\u2019s children; and (3) Brown specifically told defendant he could not counsel him or even baptize him because defendant needed professional help. Clearly, the conversations between defendant and Brown are not protected by the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
