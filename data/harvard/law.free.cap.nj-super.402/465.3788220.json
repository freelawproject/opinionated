Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged retaliation by defendants in violation of plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 and unlawful termination based upon age in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12. After a careful review of the contentions raised by plaintiffs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our consideration of the issues advanced on appeal. Plaintiffs were police officers in Clinton. In 2001, the police department conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ed an internal investigation based on complaints of malingering by some officers. The investigation revealed that several officers, including the three plaintiffs, had filed false time reports and had been idle when they claimed to be working. Clinton submitted that information to the county prosecutor, who filed criminal charges. In November 2001, plaintiffs pled guilty to falsifying documents, were admitted into a pre-trial intervention program, resigned their positions as police officers, and stipulated they would not work again in law enforcement in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In January 2000, plaintiffs and other PBA members had filed an unfair practice charge with the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) challenging the new promotional procedure adopted by Clancy in September 1999, which had resulted in some officers being promoted over plaintiffs, despite plaintiffs\u2019 greater seniority. Plaintiffs and three other officers also challenged the new procedure in a February 2000 Law Division complaint. The complaint contained three counts. In count one, the complaint alleged that the new promotional process allowed some less senior officers to be promoted over plaintiffs and contained inadequate standards to guide the selection process. Plaintiffs claimed that they were denied rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and sought relief pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In count two, plaintiffs asserted that the new promotional process \u201cwas totally devoid of appropriate norms and standards,\u201d allowed defendants \u201cunfettered discretion,\u201d and was so vague as to be \u201cunintelligible and unenforceable.\u201d Plaintiffs again claimed violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and sought relief pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In the third count of the complaint, plaintiffs complained that in a personnel order of September 16, 1999, the police department restricted all officers from posting or distributing any \u201cunauthorized or unnecessary\u201d documents on any \u201cPBA maintained bulletin board\u201d or in any mail slot used by the officers or PBA. That order, alleged plaintiffs, denied them their First Amendment freedom of speech, as well as their rights under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00a7 1983 and the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In March 2000, the Law Division action was transferred to New Jersey Federal District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In July 2000, the parties executed an Agreement and Release, by which plaintiffs agreed to dismiss with prejudice the pending PERC and District Court actions, and Clinton agreed to promote four of the complaining officers (including the plaintiffs here, Spinks, Kovacs, and Exley). In addition, the Agreement bound the parties to agree to accept the new collective bargaining agreement, covering 1999-2001, that had been negotiated and was awaiting approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In November 2000, as a result of complaints about the on-the-job conduct of patrol officers, Clancy ordered Sergeant Kuczynski (Kuczynski) of Internal Affairs to conduct a covert investigation. The complaints included \u201cworkplace harassment, stalking of an officer\u2019s wife, sexual liaisons by on-duty police officers, discontinued radio contact with officers, and idling of officers during certain shifts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In preparation for the investigation, Kuczynski and Clancy met with the county prosecutor, Stephen Rubin (Rubin), to ask for permission to secretly install a global positioning device (GPS) in each patrol car. Rubin gave his permission. Kuczynski stated in his deposition that it was \u201c[u]pon [Rubin\u2019s] order [that] the investigation commenced.\u201d Rubin ordered that all officers be monitored, not just the two against whom specific complaints had been made. The GPS unit was put in all cars, in random order, between May and August 2001. According to Kuczynski\u2019s investigation report, the prosecutor \u201cwas informed and assisted with support.\u201d In his deposition, Kuczynski explained that he gave all the data to Rubin, who decided on the criteria to be used to determine if criminal charges should be brought. Kuczynski elaborated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">Immediately upon commencing with this investigation, Prosecutor Rubin, and every time I went to him with a report, indicated to me that the criteria if an officer was on location at any time during the entire eight-hour shift, it would not constitute in his mind falsification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>In other words, he was not going to prosecute an officer for sloppy record keeping, only on falsifications. So based upon that recommendation given to me numerous times, this officer, every officer was held to that standard and checked. And simply if there was any falsification or indication of falsification that was found on any officer, it was presented to Prosecutor Rubin. Prosecutor Rubin decided if he was going to exercise [sicl to prosecute this or refer to administrative issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">He added: \u201cAll the prosecution decisions were made by the prosecutor and prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Kuczynski presented all investigative reports to Rubin; Clancy never saw them. In his deposition, Clancy confirmed that he had no personal role in the investigation aside from his initial meeting with Rubin, and that he never reviewed the results obtained by Kuczynski. Clancy and Kuczynski were the only Township employees aware of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The GPS generated reports of the location of each officer at a given time. The GPS device was placed in each car at least twice. Whenever \u201cserious discrepancies\u201d were found in an officer\u2019s reports and the GPS data, the GPS unit was put in that car again, in order to determine if there were a \u201cpattern of conduct.\u201d The trial judge accepted, for the purposes of the summary judgment motion, that the reports showed \u201cthat all or many officers, not just plaintiffs, were engaged in idling behavior, and failed to report it, and that it had been condoned in the past by the Township.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYD\">In August 2001, Detective Tavener (Tavener) of the prosecutor\u2019s office was assigned to \u201coversee\u201d the investigation, and he met with Kuczynski \u201cmany times\u201d to discuss the case. His task was to review the data and prepare the case for the prosecutor. Tavener felt that the investigation had been done \u201ccorrectly and fairly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-F\">As a result of the investigation, plaintiffs and Officer Brown were charged with falsification of documents in September 2001. In October 2001, Officer Krejdovski (Krejdovski) was arrested and charged. Plaintiffs did not and do not deny the falsification, arguing instead that other officers did the same, but were not similarly charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Some of the officers implicated in the investigation, other than plaintiffs, retired or resigned, and one went to trial and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>convicted by a jury of falsifying documents. Plaintiffs each pled guilty to one count of falsifying documents and, as required by the plea agreement, resigned from the police department, entered the Pretrial Intervention Program, and agreed not to work again in law enforcement in New Jersey. All three had resigned by November 9,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In 2004, plaintiffs filed a Law Division action contending that the 2001 investigation had been commenced in retaliation for plaintiffs\u2019 2000 challenges. In plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint of January 2004, they alleged that they had been forced to resign as police officers in 2001 because of defendants\u2019 1) allegations of misconduct by plaintiffs, which were in retaliation for plaintiffs\u2019 successful 2000 legal' actions; and 2) discrimination against plaintiffs because of their age, in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49. Named as defendants were Clinton, Clancy, who was the police chief, and two lieutenants (Wayne Weiss and Dwight Runyon). Both Weiss and Runyon were dismissed by stipulation before summary judgment was entered and take no part in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Clinton and Clancy filed separate answers, denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses. In February 2006, after the completion of discovery, each defendant moved for summary judgment, and plaintiffs opposed the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The motions were argued before Judge Peter A. Buehsbaum on March 17, 2006. In a written opinion on March 27, 2006, Judge Buehsbaum granted summary judgment to both defendants, ruling that Clancy was protected by virtue of qualified immunity and that Clinton was not liable under either cause of action. The trial judge entered orders on the same date. Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">On appeal, plaintiffs present the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">THE JUDGE EEEED IN FINDING THAT THE PROSECUTOE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">PLAINTIFFS\u2019 42 U.S.C.

PLAINTIFFS\u2019 1983 RETALIATION CLAIM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">THE INTENTIONAL FALSE ARREST, MALICIOUS PROSECUTION AND DEFAMATION COMPONENTS OF PLAINTIFFS\u2019 SECTION 1983 CLAIMS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuB\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">LIABILITY UNDER NJLAD FOR AGE DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION <em>NJ.S.A </em>10:5-12D.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">In reviewing the dismissal of a complaint on summary judgment, we apply the same legal standard as the trial court. <em>Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hillside Bottling Co., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 230, 903 A.2d 513 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>104, 912 A.2d 1264 (2006). A court must determine \u201cwhether the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue[s] in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). If there is a genuine issue as to any material fact, or where credibility issues are presented, then summary judgment should be denied. <em>Ibid.; </em>4:46\u20142(c). However, if the evidence \u201cis \u2018so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law,\u2019 \u201d then summary judgment should be granted. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>242, 252, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 214 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">Plaintiffs dispute Judge Buchsbaum\u2019s ruling that the retaliation count must fail because, even if there were a prohibited retaliation, that retaliation was attributable to the prosecutor, not to defendants. They insist that they at least raised a disputed fact question on this point, and that the trial judge wrongly resolved this question instead of submitting it to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">In support of his ruling, the trial judge reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">[T]he actual termination resulted from plaintiffs\u2019 resignation which was clearly procured by the Prosecutor as a condition of not filing felony charges, plaintiffs\u2019 admission into Pretrial Intervention, and their being allowed to retain pension benefits. As is noted above, plaintiffs have agreed that he determined who and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>what to charge. Such decision was not a Township decision. Accordingly, plaintiffs have failed to show sufficient retaliatory actions. Nor do they make any claim that a mere investigation itself absent their resignation would constitute retaliation under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The trial judge also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the prosecutor was \u201csimply a tool\u201d of Clinton in effecting the retaliation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-P\">[T]heir own concessions that Krejdovski was charged despite the Township\u2019s wishes, that the file on six other officers was turned over to the Prosecutor, and that two others left or resigned belies their assertion factually. Their further concession that the Prosecutor decided who and what to charge is likewise inconsistent with their \u201ctool\u201d theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs insist that \u201c[t]he facts show [tjhey were investigated, charged, arrested, and suspended without pay by the Township and then referred by Clancy to the Prosecutor.\u201d They say that Clancy \u201cselectively reported the investigation results to the Prosecutor,\u201d and that there is \u201cno concrete evidence that anyone from the Prosecutor\u2019s office even looked at the disks which contain the actual trackings of each officer.\u201d Plaintiffs assert that \u201c[t]he evidence shows that the Prosecutor\u2019s office saw only what Clancy and John Kuczynski wanted them to see.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Plaintiffs cite no such \u201cevidence.\u201d Nor do they specify items in the record to support their allegations that Clancy and Kuczynski were selective in their investigative reports to the prosecutor and that their reports were \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, plaintiffs invite us to peruse evidence that they state is contained in sixty-one pages of the appendix and for us to review seven computer disks and one CD recording of the \u201cGPS\u201d trackings. We are assured that when we compare \u201cthe trackings to Kuczynski\u2019s reports to the prosecutor, the misrepresentations become readily and clearly apparent.\u201d Plaintiffs ignore the fact that it is their responsibility to refer us to specific parts of the record to support their argument. They may not discharge that duty by inviting us to search through the record ourselves. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>v. Hild, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>294, 296, 372 A.2d 642 (App.Div.1977). It is improper to request us to scour sixty-one pages of plaintiffs\u2019 appendix, as well as computer disks without informing us of what particular pages supposedly support their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Clinton counters that it was undisputed that the prosecutor made the decision to charge plaintiffs; that plaintiffs resigned as a condition of their plea bargain -with the prosecutor; and that they were not terminated by Clinton. Moreover, it states that the record confirms that the prosecutor was not a mere tool of Clinton in that the prosecutor charged another officer, Krejdovski, \u201cdespite the Township\u2019s wishes\u201d (quoting the trial judge\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Clancy\u2019s response to plaintiffs\u2019 theory is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">[T]he uneontroverted evidence is that, Chief Clancy initially only intended to utilize the GPS in the patrol cars of two officers. It was the Prosecutor who issued an order to Sgt. Kuezynski to expand the scope of the Investigation to include the random placement of the GPS into <em>all </em>Division vehicles in order to investigate <em>all </em>Division officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">He adds: \u201cPlaintiffs fail to appreciate that they were charged by the Prosecutor with criminal violations. Chief Clancy had no choice but to suspend them from the police force. However, the catalyst for the suspension was the Charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The record adequately supports Judge Buchsbaum\u2019s ruling on this point. In contrast to plaintiffs\u2019 unattributed claims in their brief, the record uniformly points to the prosecutor as being the one who directed the details of the investigation and decided to charge plaintiffs. We note that Kuezynski himself, the officer in charge of the investigation for Clinton, stated that it was the prosecutor who ordered the investigation, authorized use of the GPS, and made all decisions whether to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Plaintiffs failed to show any genuine factual dispute on this issue. <em>See R. </em>4:46-5(a). Accordingly, we concur with the trial judge\u2019s ruling that there was no \u201cadverse employment action\u201d by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Plaintiffs also challenge the trial judge\u2019s decision concerning plaintiffs\u2019 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 claim. Judge Buchsbaum, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>Watters v. City of Philadelphia, </em>55 F.3d 886, 892 (3d Cir.1995), applied a three-part test to determine whether plaintiffs stated a 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 claim for retaliation for engaging in a constitutionally protected activity. The <em>Watters </em>test requires a court to analyze whether 1) the employee did engage in protected conduct; 2) that protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged retaliation; and 3) the retaliatory action would not have occurred if the employee had not engaged in the protected activity. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In applying the first factor, Judge Buehsbaum analyzed the three counts of plaintiffs\u2019 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 complaint, which had been filed in 2000, to determine whether the filing of that complaint qualified as \u201cprotected activity.\u201d He construed \u201cprotected activity\u201d to mean the freedom-of-speech guarantee of the First Amendment, and he applied the United States Supreme Court\u2019s guideline that, when a public employee alleges retaliation for exercising freedom-of-speech, he or she must show that the speech in question addressed a \u201cmatter of public concern.\u201d <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 <em>US. </em>138, 146, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1684, 1690, 75 L.Ed.2d 708, 719 (1983). The Court defined such a matter as one that can \u201cbe fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The trial judge then observed that the first count alleged that the Township\u2019s new promotion process allowed officers with less experience than plaintiffs to be promoted before plaintiffs. He found that the second count asserted that the new process gave unfettered discretion to the Township and ignored the officers\u2019 actual performance. Both counts, ruled the trial judge, were not protected activity that could give rise to a 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">[T]he first two counts of the complaint deal entirely with an internal action taken within the workplace. The internal promotion process followed by the Police Department does not relate to a matter of political or social concern to the community at large. Thus, it relates only to matters of personal interest and not to matters of public concern, and a Section 1983 action cannot lie with regard to Clinton\u2019s response to these claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The third count, the trial judge said, protested Clinton\u2019s prohibition on posting or distributing unauthorized documents. That form of expression, the trial judge ruled, involved \u201cmatters of internal personnel policy and personal interest and not matters of public concern.\u201d Thus, that count also failed the first prong of a valid retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Having concluded that the first of the three prongs was not established, the trial judge ruled that he did not have to reach the second and third prongs of the test. He opined, however, that those factors were disputed and thus would not have been amenable to summary judgment. Plaintiffs dispute the trial judge\u2019s conclusion concerning the first prong of the three-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argue that the trial judge was wrong in determining their alleged protected conduct was not a matter of public concern, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">Public interest and community concern over the promotions action were repeatedly expressed in the local papers from the filing of the action to the global settlement and appointment of a committee to set promotion standards. The public concerns involved qualifications of the promoted officers without objective standards and competitive tests, the influence of polities over promotions, and the impact of the action on the PBA/ Township contract negotiations, among other issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The resulting \u201cappointment of inexperienced and unqualified officers,\u201d add plaintiffs, \u201cwas of great concern to both the PBA and the public at large as it affected public security and confidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Clinton counters, in agreement with Judge Buchsbaum\u2019s finding that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 prior complaints focused on pay, promotion, and internal regulations regarding distribution of literature and notices within the police department____ Internal promotions and communication policies are not of general concern to the public at large.\u201d Clinton correctly cites the Supreme Court\u2019s position that public employees\u2019 personnel grievances do not qualify as conduct protected by the First Amendment freedom of speech. <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>410, 420, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>1951, 1959, 164 L.Ed.2d 689, 700 (2006); <em>Connick, supra, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 149, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1691, 75 L.Ed.2d at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>We agree with the trial judge\u2019s analysis. Even granting plaintiffs the benefit of all favorable inferences, their complaints concerned how the administration of the police department and management of its personnel affected plaintiffs and their bargaining unit. While it may be true that some of the controversy was reported in the newspapers, and that the public does have an interest in its police force, those alleged public interests do not change or overshadow the primary thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint\u2014 their personal employment grievances. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court has said, \u201cthe First Amendment does not empower public employees to \u2018constitutionalize the employee grievance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garcetti, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at 420, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1959, 164 L.Ed.2d at 700 (quoting <em>Connick, supra, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>at 154, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1694, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 725).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Plaintiffs propose an additional theory for reversal concerning 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983. They contend that the trial judge read their 2004 complaint too narrowly, arguing it encompassed more than their First Amendment free-speech right to file their 2000 actions, but that it also included \u201ctheir constitutional right to sue under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 for denial of due process and equal protection.\u201d The trial judge was wrong, argue plaintiffs, to use the \u201cpublic interest\u201d test, which applies only when the alleged protected activity was the exercise of the freedom of speech. They assert that their 2004 complaint did not even mention free speech. Rather, they were invoking a different clause of the First Amendment: the \u201cpetition clause,\u201d which forbids any law that abridges the right \u201cto petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Clinton does not respond to plaintiffs\u2019 petition-clause theory, insisting that plaintiffs waived this issue by not raising it below. Plaintiffs reply that they did raise it. First, they point to paragraph fourteen of their complaint, in which they referred to their \u201csuccessful pursuit of their constitutional employment and equal protection rights <em>in prior actions </em>under the <em>U.S. Constitution </em>and 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>Section 1983.\u201d And they look to paragraph sixteen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>which alleges retaliation for their \u201cprior successful assertion of their civil rights,\u201d and that defendants deprived them of their \u201ccivil and constitutional rights, privileges and immunities and equal protection rights secured by the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the <em>U.S. Constitution, </em>and 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>Section 1983.\u201d Plaintiffs insist that these allegations served to raise the petition-clause question, and they also claim that the issue was discussed at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Neither the amended complaint nor the oral argument contained specific references to the petition clause. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s references at oral argument were similarly imprecise: \u201cThere was a 1983-case brought, that the plaintiffs had the right under the constitution to bring that case.\u201d The trial judge did not mention such an argument in his opinion. We agree with Clinton that on this record plaintiffs cannot fairly claim to have raised below the petition-clause argument that they now raise on appeal. As the issue was not timely raised before the trial court, we need not consider it. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Plaintiffs also dispute the trial judge\u2019s alternative reason for granting summary judgment to Clancy, namely, that he was qualifiedly immune from 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 liability. Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense to liability. <em>Schneider v. Simonini, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>336, 354, 749 A.2d 336 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>1146, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1083, 148 L.Ed.2d 959 (2001). <em>As </em>to defendant Clancy only, Judge Buchsbaum ruled that, in addition to Clancy being dismissed as a party by way of summary judgment because plaintiffs had not raised a factual dispute concerning their retaliation cause of action, Clancy had also succeeded in establishing his defense of qualified immunity. The trial judge applied the rule that \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>800, 818, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2727, 2738, 73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>L.Ed.2d 396, 410 (1982). And he acknowledged the Court\u2019s two-part test for qualified immunity: 1) the officer violated a constitutional right of a plaintiff, and 2) that right was \u201cclearly established.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 <em>U.S. </em>194, 201, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>2151, 2156, 150 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>272,281 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The test for the second part\u2014whether the right was known with sufficient clarity\u2014\u201cis whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Saucier, supra, </em>533 <em>U.S. </em>at 202, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d at 282. When, as here, plaintiffs claim that a police officer acted without probable cause, the <em>Saucier </em>test is refined to require that an officer seeking immunity prove that: 1) he did have probable cause, or 2) even if he did not have probable cause, he reasonably believed that he did. <em>Schneider, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 749 A.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In this case, Judge Buchsbaum ruled, \u201cthere was no clear constitutional right barring retaliation via an investigation for litigating \u00a7 1983 claims.\u201d While plaintiffs alleged at oral argument that Clancy had procured a false arrest\u2014thereby implicating their Fourth Amendment rights\u2014they never pleaded false arrest in their complaint, and it was the prosecutor, not Clancy, who prompted the arrest. And, noted the trial judge, even if there were a false arrest,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">a reasonable person in Chief Clancy\u2019s position at the time he initiated the GPS investigation, or turned it over to the Prosecutor, would not have known this____ [T]he charges here were made entirely at the discretion of the Prosecutor\u2019s office. Defendant Clancy cannot be charged with clear foreknowledge of what rights even a biased submission of facts to the Prosecutor would affect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 no-probable-cause theory, the trial judge observed that Clancy was not the one who arrested and charged plaintiffs; that was the prosecutor, who \u201cis not even a party to this case.\u201d And he noted that plaintiffs had pleaded guilty and otherwise admitted the offenses; thus \u201cthey are now in no position to claim an absence of probable cause for their arrest.\u201d Thus, concluded Judge Buchsbaum, Clancy was immune from Section 1983 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>On appeal, plaintiffs argue that, accepting their allegations as true, Clancy had no probable cause to conclude that plaintiffs were guilty of any crime, in that their misreporting of their whereabouts was accepted and condoned by the police department. They insist that Clancy\u2019s act of turning plaintiffs over to the prosecutor was not merely negligence or bad judgment (for which he would be immune) but rather was \u201cintentional bad faith and misconduct.\u201d And they again refer us to the disks and CD, which they say will show that Kuezynski\u2019s reports to the prosecutor were false and misleading. They conclude that, if a jury believed their evidence, it could award damages to plaintiffs on theories of false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Clancy responds that plaintiffs\u2019 premise that there was no probable cause is negated by the fact that they pleaded guilty, and, as plaintiffs concede, if there was probable cause, Clancy was entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. Under the second part of the <em>Saucier </em>test, Clancy reasonably believed that his actions were proper. In fact, argues Clancy, he had no involvement in expanding the investigation to include plaintiffs. While he commenced the investigation, that investigation was of two officers <em>not </em>among these three plaintiffs. It was the prosecutor who expanded it to include plaintiffs. In reply, plaintiffs dispute Clancy\u2019s factual representations, saying that they must be resolved by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">While bad faith is normally a jury question, plaintiffs offer no citations to the record that might support their characterization of Clancy\u2019s conduct, as required by <em>Rule </em>4:46-5(a). Plaintiffs\u2019 general references to the disks and CD is insufficient to show a genuine issue of material fact. Therefore, we agree with the trial judge\u2019s ruling that Clancy enjoyed a qualified immunity from 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Plaintiffs further complain that Judge Buchsbaum erred in dismissing their LAD claims contained in count two of their complaint. They contend that the trial judge treated their cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>of action as a disparate-treatment claim only, ignoring their disparate-impact and retaliation theories. They also object that the trial judge overlooked their allegations that the adverse employment actions included the investigation itself, plaintiffs\u2019 arrest, and plaintiffs\u2019 suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In count two of their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that defendants discriminated against them because of their age (over forty). They listed a variety of acts having a disparate impact, representing disparate treatment, or constituting retaliatory action, including using the GPS investigation to entrap and terminate older employees, and preferring younger employees for promotions, overtime, and good assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In assessing plaintiffs\u2019 claim of age discrimination, Judge Buchsbaum applied the burden-shifting analysis that governs such a claim. A plaintiff first must establish the four elements of a prima facie case of age discrimination: 1) he or she belonged to a protected class by reason of his or her age; 2) he or she was performing the job to the employer\u2019s satisfaction; 3) he or she was subjected to some adverse employment action; and 4) he or she was replaced by someone young enough to warrant an inference of age discrimination. <em>Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>188, 212-13, 723 A.2d 944 (1999); <em>Young v. Hobart West Group, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448, 458, 897 A.2d 1063 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Should a plaintiff succeed in constructing a prima facie case, age discrimination is presumed. The employer then must come forward with evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, and, if it does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the claimed reason was a pretext for age discrimination. <em>Bergen Commercial Bank, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, 723 A.2d 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Judge Buchsbaum noted that defendants had conceded for the purpose of the motion elements one, two, and four of the prima facie case, leaving only the third element in dispute\u2014whether defendants subjected plaintiffs to any sort of adverse employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>action. For the purposes of the summary judgment motion, the trial judge accepted plaintiffs\u2019 claim that defendants used the GPS investigation as a \u201ctool\u201d to single out older employees, like plaintiffs, and to remove them from the police department even though officers of all ages were guilty of the same conduct. But, he ruled, plaintiffs could not show that the resulting adverse actions\u2014their resignations as a condition of their plea agreements\u2014were attributable to defendants; rather, they were the prosecutor\u2019s responsibility. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">However, plaintiffs concede as they must that they were not terminated by the Township. Rather, they resigned as part of the plea agreement reached with the Prosecutor\u2019s office in the face of an indictment for misconduct in office____ Moreover, they concede that a total of thirteen officers were referred to the Prosecutor\u2019s office at some point and that the decision on whom and what to charge was his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">Here, the decision to charge plaintiffs with crimes and to reach plea agreements with them rested solely with the Prosecutor\u2019s office. During the investigation, Prosecutor Rubin and his staff reviewed each of the GPS reports to determine whether a \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d was established against a particular officer, and he had the ultimate discretion to determine whether an officer was charged with a crime and prosecuted____ The Prosecutor procured the plea agreement that included plaintiffs\u2019 resignations. Clinton Township did not fire them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Thus, concluded the trial judge, plaintiffs could not show that Clinton took an adverse action against them. As for defendant Clancy, plaintiffs\u2019 LAD claim also failed, the trial judge ruled, because \u201can individual within a public entity may only be held liable under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12 if he is an \u2018aider or abettor.\u2019 Otherwise, only the entity itself can be held liable.\u201d But, observed the trial judge, Clancy was not merely an aider or abettor; he was Clinton\u2019s main decision-maker with respect to the GPS investigation. Thus, he could not be individually liable, and he, too, was entitled to summary judgment on the LAD count.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue various errors in the trial judge\u2019s opinion. They say that the trial judge considered their plea-bargained resignation to be the only relevant adverse employment action, and that, because that resignation was negotiated by the prosecutor, there was no adverse action by defendants. But, they argue, the trial judge ignored plaintiffs\u2019 claims that an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>action was \u201cthe Township\u2019s immediate suspension of the plaintiffs first with, then without pay from the date of the arrest until the date of the resignation.\u201d And they insist that \u201cthe investigation itself was retaliatory\u201d and, thus, that it too qualified as an adverse action. They elaborate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">The criminal accusations themselves, publicized as they were by the Township, caused great embarrassment and humiliation, the three months suspension partially without pay, the necessity and cost of hiring attorneys and all the adverse publicity sought from the defendants\u2019 media releases, and the continuing coverage in the local press all caused the plaintiffs great damage, whether or not they ultimately resigned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Judge Buchsbaum expressly ruled that the investigation itself was not an adverse action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">Plaintiffs do not claim an NJLAD action would lie if the investigation had terminated without their resignation. Nor could they. An investigation or even an unfavorable personnel report without more does not constitute adverse employment action under the NJLAD. <em>El-Sioufi v. St. Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp., </em>382 <em>NJ.Super. 145, </em>170, 887 A.2d 1170 (App.Div.2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Plaintiffs dispute the trial judge\u2019s premise that they are not claiming that the investigation was an adverse action, and they disagree with the trial judge\u2019s reading of <em>El-Sioufi v. St. Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp., </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 887 A.2d 1170 (App.Div.2005). They concede that <em>El-Sioufi </em>\u201cstands for the proposition that a claim of an unfavorable personnel report or a negative investigation accompanied by no tangible detriment is insufficient to rise to the level of an adverse employment decision.\u201d But that ruling \u201cis in no way analogous to the retaliatory actions claimed by plaintiffs here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We agree with the trial judge. An employer must be free to investigate complaints of employee misconduct without fear of LAD liability. Only when the investigation results in some real detriment, such as a suspension, demotion, or termination, should the aggrieved employee be able to invoke the protection of the LAD. <em>El-Sioufi, supra, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 169-70, 887 A.2d 1170. <em>Cf. Beasley v. Passaic County, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>585, 606, 873 A.2d 673 (App.Div.2005) (in the CEPA context, \u201can investigation of an employee is not normally considered retaliation\u201d). Here plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>do allege real detriments\u2014the suspension and forced resignation. Thus, they could still prevail against defendants if they can establish that either of those two actions qualified as an adverse action for which defendants are responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Those two alleged actions, suspension and forced resignation, concededly do constitute adverse actions, but the trial judge\u2019s key ruling was that those actions were chargeable to the prosecutor, not to defendants. We agree with the trial judge that the record indicates that both the resignations and the suspensions were the result of the fabrication charges brought by the prosecutor and were not brought about by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">With respect to the trial judge\u2019s dismissal of the LAD claim as to Clancy, plaintiffs do not argue against the trial judge\u2019s \u201caiding and abetting\u201d theory in their merits brief, arguing only against the ruling as to Clinton. Clancy argues in favor of the trial judge\u2019s rationale, noting that in <em>Tarr v. Ciasulli, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>70, 83, 853 A.2d 921 (2004), the Court held that, based on its reading of <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-5(a), which defines \u201cemployer\u201d for LAD purposes, \u201can individual supervisor is not defined as an \u2018employer\u2019 under the LAD.\u201d Instead, such a supervisor may be personally liable only as an aider or abettor of the employer\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 853 A.2d 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">In response to Clancy\u2019s argument, plaintiffs addressed the issue for the first time in their reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Accepting the inferences most favorable to plaintiffs, the trial judge observed that Clancy, as police chief, was an employee of Clinton who, on behalf of Clinton, made the relevant investigative decisions before enlisting the prosecutor; Clancy had nothing further to do with the case. The record supports that observation. Plaintiffs counter with unsubstantiated representations, citing no part of the record, except for two pages. They cite page Pa2629 of their appendix for the proposition that it was Clancy who supervised plaintiffs\u2019 arrests and decided whose files to send to the prosecutor\u2019s office. But that page does not refer to Clancy at all. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>It is a memo from Kuezynski sending four unnamed files to someone named Chief Nicholas Susalis.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 other citation is to an investigative report at page Pa2995 of their appendix, which they say shows that Clancy \u201cdirected Kuezynski as to who\u2019s [sic] car to place the GPS unit in, when to do it, and how often.\u201d That is true, but it is incomplete to the extent plaintiffs imply that Clancy made those choices to discriminate against plaintiffs. The same report acknowledges that the GPS units were installed on <em>all </em>patrol cars and in a random order. It reflects that Clancy decided the order of patrol cars to be surveilled, but it does not support an argument that his chosen sequence was discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We are satisfied, therefore, that the trial judge appropriately ruled that plaintiffs had not established a material factual issue as to the \u201cadverse employment action\u201d element of a prima facie case of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, as well as those contained in the thoughtful, detailed, and considered opinion of Judge Buchsbaum, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> To the contraiy, in his deposition, Clancy confirmed that he had no personal role in the investigation aside from his initial meeting with Rubin, and that he never reviewed the results obtained by Kuczynski.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
