The motion on behalf of the plaintiff is founded on the plaintiff\u2019s petition, the pleadings (complaint and answer), the certificate of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to the effect that he examined the case and that the plaintiff has a good cause of action; and it is opposed by the affidavit of William H. Hamilton, one of the defendant\u2019s attorneys herein. The moving papers comply with the requirements of Code, \u00a7\u00a7 458, 459. Code, \u00a7 460, ordains that \u201cthe court may [which means must] make the order if satisfied of the truth of the facts alleged in the petition and that the applicant has a good cause of action.\u201d The truth of the facts set up in the petition is not controverted. The complaint sets up a good cause of action. It alleges facts which, if established at the trial, will entitle the plaintiff to recover. The plaintiff need not go into the merits of the case, nor prove his right to recover. McNamara v. Nolan, 13 Misc. Rep. 76, 34 N. Y. Supp. 178. The truth of the facts alleged in the petition and the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action can be controverted by affidavits only. The answer is not available for that purpose, because that creates the issues merely. Beyer v. Clark, 29 Abb. N. C. 338, 22 N. Y. Supp. 540. The only opposing affidavit on this motion is the one of Hamilton. It does not controvert the truth of the facts contained in the petition, nor the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. It sets up three affirmative defenses, to wit, payment, accord and satisfaction, and a prior adjudication, which the defendant must establish on the trial by competent proof, according to the rules of evidence. Section 458 of the Code en\u00e1cts that \u201ca poor person may apply to the court in which the action is pending, or in which it is intended to be brought,\u201d for leave to prosecute as a poor person. This means before or during the pendency of the action. There is no other limitation prescribed. The motion \"was made soon after the issue was joined. Defendant\u2019s point of laches is of no merit, Shapiro v. Burns, 7 Misc. Rep. 418, 27 N. Y. Supp. 980. The plaintiff, having complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>with the statutory conditions, was entitled to have his motion granted as a matter of right, and therefore the order appealed from is reversed, with the costs of this appeal, and the motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Order appealed from reversed, with costs, and motion for leave to prosecute as a poor person granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
