It cannot be disputed that, if the lessor had collected the. rent, an action in favor of the principal could have been maintained against him to recover it. This being so, and all the parties to the transaction having conceded the right of the plaintiff to the rent, she cannot be deprived of it by \u00e1 stranger to the transaction, under a technical rule of pleading which requires an action to be brought upon a sealed instrument by and against the parties named in it. Judgment for the defendant, with costs.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-3\">Action by Louis S. Sterrit, as receiver in supplementary proceedings of W. H.
