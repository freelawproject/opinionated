In this view of the case the fact that the horse was killed by a train - of the Ontario &amp; Western Railroad Company does not appear to be material, and it was not error by the court to so charge the jury. No other question requires consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
