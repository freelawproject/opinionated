The defendant\u2019s business, as touching the plaintiff\u2019s employment, was that of industrial life insurance, with policies issued on weekly premiums; and it was the defendant\u2019s custom, when the premiums on any policy became four weeks in arrears, to require the soliciting agent to \u201clapse\u201d or cancel it, failing which, the agent or the \u201cassistant superintendent\u201d (the agent\u2019s immediate superior) was charged with the amount of the premium when so in arrears excessive of four weeks. The right to make this charge against the plaintiff was not reserved by the defendant in the written contract of employment, nor, we are to assume, was the custom to make deductions in this regard from the employes salary known to him at the time when he accepted the position of assistant superintendent; and the claim in suit is for the recovery of sums withheld by the defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s weekly salary on account of arrearage of premiums, due under circumstances such as above alluded to, during some 46 weeks, at the rate of about one dollar per week. Whatever the provisions of the contract, and however ignorant the plaintiff might originally have been as to this custom, it appears beyond contradiction from admissions by counsel and from the plaintiff\u2019s own writings that these deductions were made from his salary with his knowledge of the defendant\u2019s reason for so doing, and with his expressed assent. He signed vouchers weekly for his salary as received, upon the face of each of which appeared the amount of deduction, and the name of the sub-agent for whose arrearage it was made. He recognized the custom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>under which these charges were made against him, in letters to his superiors, proposing slight modifications, such as the facts called for; and, that there might be no doubt of his knowledge of the matters in question, his counsel admitted it upon the trial. What, then, is his explanation of this apparent acquiescence in that course of business, and abandonment of a part of his. salary thereunder? It is, according to his evidence, that, from his experience of the defendant\u2019s conduct of its affairs, his discharge would have followed his dissent, and that he was passive, in order that he might keep his position. If so, we may only say that he kept it at an expense of precisely the amount in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">This was no case of a contract performed by one, with a reservation of rights arising through the other party\u2019s breach, such as the respondent\u2019s counsel contends for in support of the judgment. It is of course to be conceded that in a proper case the aggrieved party may continue performance, and recover his damages none the less. Here, however, the plaintiff did not avail himself of his rights arising under the defendant\u2019s breach of contract, which occurred, if at all, during the first month of his employment; and his opportunity for performance during the succeeding 10 or 11 months existed through his waiver of the breach, or an accepted modification of the agreement, under which the defendant retained him. The actual waiver, instead of being explained away by the circumstances, is shown to have existed for an acceptable consideration, in that it was intended to induce the defendant to forego the exercise of its privilege under the contract,\u2014the right of immediate discharge; and hence the plaintiff has proven, not an excuse for his ratification, but an estoppel of its denial. It results that the recovery was manifestly without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
