The insurance by this policy is to cover only while the permanent or other insurance covering the same property, if there be any, is retired or void, on account of the hop drying process or hazard.\u201d The fire occurred a few hours before the month expired. There was existing other insurance \u201con the hop house, except during hop harvesting, $250,\u201d under a policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of the Otsego County Farmers\u2019 Co-operative Fire Insurance Company, for the term of three years. The defenses were: First, that the policy was not in force upon the hop house, because the hop harvesting was over, and therefore the Otsego Company\u2019s policy was in force as to the hop house at the time of the fire; second, an accord and satisfaction of all claims under the defendant\u2019s policy. Further facts are stated in the opinion.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b638-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Appeal from trial term, Otsego county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-12\">Action by John Marsh against the Glens Falls Insurance Company.

The Otsego Company\u2019s policy was by its terms retired \u201cduring hop harvesting.\u201d Two questions of fact arise: (1) Does \u201chop harvesting\u201d cover the \u201chop drying process or hazard\u201d? If yes, did the fire occur during the \u201chop drying process or hazard\u201d? The undisputed evidence was to the effect that Mrs. Withey\u2019s crop of hops had all been gathered, placed in the hop house, dried there, and packed away in the storeroom in the hop house at least 10 days before the fire, and that, when the fire occurred, the process of baling the hops for the' market had begun. The following testimony was given, and was not disputed: \u201c(2) Describe the steps taken in harvesting hops. (Objected to, as immaterial and incompetent; that the contract is clear, and parol evidence is not competent to vary it; that it is a question here about hop drying, and not hop harvesting. Objection overruled, and defendant excepted.) A. In the first place, they have to be picked, and then they are put into the kiln, and dried, and from that they are pressed and baled. When they are baled, they are ready for the market. That is the usual steps taken, I think, by almost everybody.\u201d The learned trial judge instructed the jury that, if they should find that \u201cthe baling and preparing the hops for market was a part of the harvesting of the hops, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover, provided there had been no settlement.\u201d The defendant excepted. This was substituting a condition of liability different from the one expressed in the defendant\u2019s policy. It was immaterial whether the baling the hops was part of the hop harvesting, unless the baling was also part of the hop drying process or hazard, and that did not appear. Apparently, the hop drying process or hazard preceded the bailing by, at least, 10 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event.
