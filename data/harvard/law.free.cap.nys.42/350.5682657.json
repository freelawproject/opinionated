Baker, as receiver of said hotel company, to foreclose a chattel mortgage. Defendant Baker was appointed receiver of the hotel company on petition of a majority of the stockholders for a dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of a receiver to wind up its affairs. Afterwards R. Sturgis was appointed receiver of the hotel company on the application of the mortgagee under a chattel mortgage of the property of the hotel company, and defendant Baker appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AkR\">Modified.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b366-15\">Argued before BARRETT, RUMSEY, WILLIAMS, O\u2019BRIEN, and INGRAHAM, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-16\">Ira Leo Bamberger, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-17\">David McClure, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A3q1\">We think the plaintiff made out a proper case for the appointment of a receiver in this action. But there was no reason why the receiver who had already been appointed in the voluntary dissolution proceedings should not have been appointed receiver in this action. We think it was not necessary for the protection of the plaintiff\u2019s interest that the court should have appointed a new receiver in this action. Everything sought to be obtained by that appointment could have been obtained through the instrumentality of the receiver already appointed, and by proper instructions and directions to that receiver. The effect of this is, practically, to extend Mr. Baker\u2019s receivership in the dissolution proceedings to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We think, therefore, that the order should be modified by striking out the name of Mr. Sturgis, and inserting the name of Mr.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">, Baker, as receiver in this action, and should also be modified by striking out the provision requiring the receiver to give the security mentioned in the order, and that the order, as so modified, should be affirmed, without costs to either party on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
