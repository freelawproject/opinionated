J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">The appellant\u2019s counsel, by his brief and argument, concedes that the evidence was sufficient to justify the submission of the case to the jury, in the absence of a motion by him, at the close of the case, to direct a verdict for defendant. The plaintiff was the widow of a member of defendant\u2019s benevolent association, and sued to recover the $500 to which such widow was entitled upon the death of such married member. The only real dispute made by defendant was that the deceased had been dropped from the roll of membership for nonpayment of dues and death assessments, and, as to this, conceded that they had not given the notice of such action which was required by the constitution and by-laws, but endeavored to supply proof of a waiver by deceased of such required notice, by having its secretary give oral evidence of admissions made by deceased to him; nor did it produce its minute or other books showing entries of their official action at the meeting at which this secretary said the deceased was expelled. Much of this evidence would certainly have been excluded if duly objected to by plaintiff. The jury\u2019s verdict, under the proofs as made by defendant, is not against the weight of evidence, and should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
