This rule seems to be laid down by the court of appeals in the case of Otten v. Railway Co., 150 N. Y. 395, 44 N. E. 1033, in which the court holds that it is by virtue of this exception alone that the appellate division has power to review either the facts or the law in a case where the court or referee has filed a decision concisely stating the grounds upon which the issues have been decided. Under these circumstances we think that the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>lant should be allowed an opportunity to apply to the special term for leave to file such exception nunc pro tunc. The decision of this appeal should be suspended a sufficient length of time to enable the appellant to make such application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
