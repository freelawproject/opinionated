This view of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel proceeds upon the contention that there was no property to be condemned by the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">It is difficult to see how the plaintiff can effectually take that position, since it has conducted to their conclusion proceedings to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>condemn alleged easements of the defendants connected with their premises. The judgment referred to has been affirmed. Garvey v. Railroad Co., 9 App. Div. 254, 41 N. Y. Supp. 397. In view of the import and effect of that judgment, the commissioners do not seem to have proceeded upon an erroneous basis in estimating damages, nor were there any errors in their rulings to the prejudice of the plaintiff; and, in such view, the amount awarded has the support of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
