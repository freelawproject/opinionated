For the purpose of obtaining an order directing a physical and oral examination oi plaintiff before trial, defendant filed his affidavit, alleging, among other things, that: \u201cI am ignorant of the nature and extent of the injuries complained -of by the plaintiff herein,' and, so far as I know, no other person other than the plaintiff has any knowledge of the circumstances, nature, and extent of said injuries. The testimony of the plaintiff is material and necessary to me in the defense of this action. Without such testimony it is impossible for me to be informed of the nature, \u2022extent, character, and circumstances of the alleged injuries.\u201d On the strength .of the affidavit the following order was made and entered:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-14\">\u201cSupreme Court, New York County.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b128-15\">\u201cEmma Bell, Plaintiff, against Jacob Litt, Defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-16\">\u201cOn reading the affidavit of Jacob Litt, verified the 29th day of September, 1896, .and upon all the ,pleadings and proceedings herein, now, on motion of Burr &amp; Delacy, attorneys for the defendant, it is ordered that Emma Bell, the plaintiff herein, attend before Thomas L.

The order appealed from does not bear the construction placed upon It by the appellant. The examination by the physician is not to take place in the presence of the referee, or of the defendant\u2019s attorney, but is to be a private examination; and, subsequent to such private examination, the physician is to appear before the referee and testify as to the condition in which she then found the plaintiff. The other objections to the order are not well taken. The examination was clearly justified by the provisions of the Code, and the facts shown bring the case within those provisions. The time for the examination having passed, a new day will be fixed upon the settlement of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
