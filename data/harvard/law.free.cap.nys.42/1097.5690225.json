The Pennsylvania residence he characterizes as \u201cpermanent\u201d; the New York residence as \u201ctemporary.\u201d The statute (Rev. St. [8th Ed.] p. 1094, \u00a7 5) makes no such distinction. It provides that every person \u201cshall be assessed in the town or ward where he resides when the assessment is made for all personal estate owned by him.\u201d Mr. Crilly tells us that his temporary residence in this city commenced on the 1st day of October, 1894. Apparently it has been continued from that day to this. It certainly continued down to the 27th of August of the present year, when his affidavit in the proceeding was made. He hired a house in this city for a residence about the 1st of October, 1894, and he was engaged in business here from that date down to the 1st of May, 1895. Clearly, he confounds residence with domicile. The fact is that, though his domicile is in Pennsylvania, he has resided here ever since the 1st of October, 1894. What he styles his permanent residence is his domicile. What he characterizes as his temporary residence is simply his residence. He says he has paid taxes in Pennsylvania during the period in question. But he does not say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>that these taxes were upon personalty. They may have heen upon real estate. He also says that he has always voted in Pennsylvania. That may be, but it is not conclusive. He may still be a resident of this city for the purposes of taxation. Besides, the statement is too general. It may well mean that, whenever he voted, it was there. He does not state that he has actually voted in Pennsylvania since the 1st day of October, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">The court properly found, upon the relator\u2019s affidavit, as matter of fact, that he was a resident of the city for the purposes of taxation. The case comes directly within the definition of residence -vtn in Frost v. Brisbin, 19 Wend. 11: \u201cThere must be a settled, fixed abode, and intention to remain permanently, at least for a time, for business or other purposes.\u201d To the same effect are Ex parte Thompson, 1 Wend. 45, Bartlett v. Mayor, etc., 5 Sandf. 44, and Douglas v. Mayor, etc., 2 Duer, 110. The word \u201cpermanently\u201d is used in Frost v. Brisbin as the converse of \u201ctransient.\u201d It expresses the idea of an abode, which may be temporary, but is not transient; that is, an abode where one settles down with some business or other object which requires it, and with the intention of remaining steadily in the place until such object is accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">The order should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
