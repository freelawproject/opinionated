The plaintiff\u2019s proof is so overwhelming that it would have been reversible error for the referee-to have found that the defendants were entitled to the judgment. The appellants contend that the evidence does not show the liability of any of the defendants except McKeever, nor that defendants were the joint owners of the tract of land upon which the work was performed, nor that a partnership or joint enterprise of the defendants existed. However, plaintiff\u2019s witness Appleton testified, at folio 79, that each defendant, in his and each other\u2019s presence, agreed that if defendant McKeever gave his check for $5,000, the cash part- of the purchase price of $30,000, the) would pay their proportionate share, each one-quarter. And plaintiff\u2019s assignor, at folio 103, says that, while he was at work upon the land, the defendants came there, and examined the plans, and made sugges tions; and one of them, in the presence of the others, told him that they were joint owners of the land, each having a fourth interest in it. And the defendant McKeever himself testified, at folio 152, that, in the transfer of this property,\u2014the purchase of this property,\u2014the title was taken in his name, acting for himself and the other three defendants, and each was equally interested to the extent of one-quarter in this property, and that these three defendants delegated to him the agency and authority to represent their interests, as well as his own, in all that was done in connection with this property; that he represented his co-defendants besides himself; and that they contributed to the expenses of running the property, and carrying it on. They contributed each one-quarter share to all expenses. The plaintiff\u2019s proof shows that his services were worth the price sued for, that he performed, at the request of defendants, upon property of which they were the joint owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
