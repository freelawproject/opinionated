In this instance the complaint was not dismissed, nor was judgment rendered against plaintiff. On the contrary, she recovered a verdict. The action having been brought to recover damages for personal injury sustained through defendant\u2019s negligence, the defendant is entitled to costs where the recovery is for less than $50. Rieger v. Watch-Case Co. (City Ct. Brook.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Does the fact that the plaintiff has been permitted to sue in forma pauperis protect her from the imposition of costs in this case? We think not. The justices\u2019 courts have jurisdiction in actions of this character, and, where the damages are less than $50, are the proper tribunals in which to maintain them. Section 461 simply provides for the prosecution of the action without payment of fees to any officer, and, where the complaint is dismissed, or judgment rendered against plaintiff, costs shall not be awarded. The section makes no provision regarding costs where the plaintiff is wholly or partially successful, and we are of opinion that section 3228 applies, and that, where a poor person is wholly or partially successful, costs will follow as in an action by an ordinary litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
