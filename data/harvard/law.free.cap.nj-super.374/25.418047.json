The homicide occurred in 1981. The victim was Townsend\u2019s girlfriend, Norma Williams. In March 2003 Townsend was sentenced to a custodial term of thirty years to life. He now appeals his convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tion and sentence. We reverse the conviction because of error in the admission of expert testimony on Battered Women\u2019s Syndrome (BWS) and in the jury instruction on expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">On January 30, 2002 a Mercer County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging defendant with the knowing or purposeful murder of his girlfriend, Williams, also known as \u201cNicky,\u201d in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3a(2). The alleged murder occurred on December 12,1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The trial judge held extensive pretrial evidentiary hearings over four different days between October 1 and October 8, 2002. The hearings involved the legality of the twenty-year delay between the crime charged and the indictment; the adequacy of the victim\u2019s dying declaration, in which she declared, through her head motions, that a car, not a truck, hit her and that defendant did not beat her; the admissibility of BWS expert testimony used to attack the credibility of the victim\u2019s dying declaration; and the admissibility of statements the defendant and other witnesses made to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The trial was held between October 9 and October 23, 2002. At trial, the State sought to prove that around 6 p.m. on December 11, 1981 defendant drove to 64 Bond Street in Trenton where he and Williams lived together. He came into the house and told Williams\u2019s sons, Jason Williams, age seven, and Brian Williams, age three, to go upstairs. The sons said they only went up the stairs part-way and watched as defendant proceeded to beat Williams, sitting on a couch, with a two-by-four with a nail in it. Defendant beat Williams until she was motionless and groaning. He then picked her up to take her to the hospital; he told the two boys to come with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Defendant took Williams and the two boys to the hospital in his blue truck. Upon leaving, defendant crashed through a gate to the front yard of the house. When they arrived at the hospital, Williams was examined in the emergency room by a Dr. Abud. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The doctor\u2019s notes indicated she was drowsy, with low blood pressure, alcohol on her breath, and no damage to her brain stem. Williams had a cut over her right eye, a compound fracture of her left femur, a fracture of her left tibia, and a fracture of the right femur. Her left upper thigh was grossly swollen and externally rotated. Williams had indications of internal injuries, and fractures of her right humerus and left humerus. The doctor also noted possible fractures of her left wrist and hand. The doctor prescribed 100-per-cent oxygen and intravenous fluids. Around 9:15 p.m., Williams received blood transfusions. At 11:45 p.m., her eyes were rolled back and she was moaning. At 11:50 p.m. she went into respiratory arrest and at 12:10 a.m. Williams was pronounced dead. The Mercer County medical examiner, Dr. Raafat Ahmad, performed an autopsy and identified shock and massive hemorrhage from multiple traumatic injuries as the cause of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The State produced evidence that while Williams was at the hospital, various members of the Trenton police were dispatched to investigate the incident. Patrolman Joseph Salvatore arrived at the hospital and spoke to Williams around 6:45 p.m. She told him she had been struck by a car. Patrolman Salvatore then went to the waiting room to talk to defendant and the two children. Jason told the officer that a red truck hit his mother on Bond Street and then three white men got out and beat her with sticks. Defendant said he got home and saw Williams bleeding against the gate outside 64 Bond Street. He then took her to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Another Trenton police officer, Detective Theodore Pogorzelski, arrived at the hospital around 9:30 p.m. He met with defendant and the two boys. Jason told the detective that a red tow truck ran over his mom but he did not see any white men. At around 11:30 p.m., Dr. Abud permitted Detective Pogorzelski to speak with Williams, although he warned communication would be difficult. The detective told Williams that things did not look good and he needed a statement from her. The detective asked her if defendant beat her, and she shook her head side-to-side indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cno.\u201d Again she shook her head indicating \u201cno\u201d when the detective asked if she was hit by a truck. She nodded a \u201cyes\u201d when the detective asked if she was hit by a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">While Detective Pogorzelski was at the hospital, Detectives Taylor and Paccillo investigated the area of 64 Bond Street for evidence of a hit-and-run accident. They found one of the gates by the driveway smashed; the damaged parts contained specks of blue paint, not red paint. The officers found no automobile debris or blood. Tire tracks went to the back of the house. When these officers looked for witnesses, all refused to speak. Two other officers, Officers Hoffman and Rowland, searched for defendant\u2019s blue pickup truck and found it in the hospital parking lot with damage to the left rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">A few hours after Williams died, defendant and the two children were taken to Trenton police headquarters. At headquarters, defendant was separated from the two boys. Jason, the older boy, told Officer Hoffman and a Sergeant Golden that defendant and Williams got into a fight and defendant beat her with a stick. Detectives Pogorzelski and Taylor then interviewed Jason, and he again said defendant beat his mother with a stick. Jason said he told the story about the white men at the defendant\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Detectives Pogorzelski and Taylor then interviewed defendant. Defendant told them he was at a bar when Jason came to tell him Williams was hit by a truck. Defendant said he found Williams in the driveway moaning that a red car smashed through the gate. At around 11:30 a.m. on December 12 defendant gave a written statement but in this recitation he said Williams was leaning against the house, not the gate. Around 1 p.m., Detective Pogorzelski obtained a formal statement from Jason. Defendant was not formally charged as a result of this investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">After Williams\u2019 death, Jason and Brian lived with Williams\u2019 brother and his wife in Browns Mills. When Brian, the younger boy, turned eighteen, he moved to Trenton and sought to contact defendant, who was also living in Trenton. At one point, Brian visited defendant, and defendant asked what Brian thought hap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>pened to his mother. Brian said that defendant murdered her and defendant became hysterical.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In May 2001, Brian heard about a newspaper article discussing numerous unsolved homicides, including his mother\u2019s. He contacted Jason, who asked the Mercer County Prosecutor\u2019s Office to reopen the investigation, which it did on August 2, 2001. On August 10, 2001 Brian gave a formal statement detailing what he saw on the night his mother died. On the same day defendant was arrested for the murder. After defendant was arrested, he was placed in a cell and later was found naked hanging from the cell door with his pants around his neck. The police revived defendant after this apparent suicide attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In addition to the testimony at trial of Jason, Brian, the several police officers, and the hospital personnel, the State produced the testimony of Freddie Williams, the brother of Jason and Brian, age fifteen at the time of Williams\u2019s death. Freddie had not been living with his mother at the time of her death. He testified to prior acts of violence by defendant against Williams. Annissa Gaines, who lived on Bond Street and was age thirteen when Williams died, testified that on the night of Williams\u2019 death she saw defendant ram through the front gate. Patricia Brevard, Williams\u2019 best Mend, testified that defendant spoke to her after Williams died, and on one occasion said he beat Willilams and ran over her with the truck before he took her to the hospital. Brevard did not tell police because of her fear of the defendant. The State also presented testimony from a Battered Women\u2019s Syndrome (BWS) expert, Dr. Judith Kabus, in an effort to discredit Williams\u2019 putative dying declaration that she was hit by a car. Dr. Kabus could not conclude Williams had BWS.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Defendant\u2019s main trial strategies were to discredit the State\u2019s case by cross-examining its witnesses, to rely upon Williams\u2019 dying declaration, and to counter Dr. Kabus\u2019 BWS testimony. For this latter purpose defendant presented the testimony of Dr. Richard Coughlin, a licensed psychologist, who testified about BWS as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Dr. Coughlin was the only defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The jury found defendant guilty of murder. On March 28, 2003 the trial judge sentenced him to a term of thirty years to life. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Defendant raises these four points on this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO DEFENDANT\u2019S GREAT PREJUDICE BY PERMITTING TESTIMONY CONCERNING BATTERED WOMEN\u2019S SYNDROME WHEN THE STATE\u2019S OWN EXPERT DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE PURPORTED VICTIM AS SUFFERING FROM THE SYNDROME, AS WELL AS BY FAILING TO DELIVER AN APPROPRIATE LIMITING INSTRUCTION (Partially Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">A The Trial Court Erred Grievously by Permitting Testimony Concerning Battered Women\u2019s Syndrome When the State\u2019s Own Expert would Not State that the Purported Victim Suffered From the Syndrome B.

Const. </em>(1947), Art. 1, par. 10 <em>POINT III</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-13\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO DEFENDANT\u2019S GREAT PREJUDICE BY ADMITTING TESTIMONY CONCERNING ALLEGED PRIOR INSTANCES OF VIOLENCE BY THE DEFENDANT <em>POINT IV</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-14\">THE TRIAL COURT IMPOSED AN ILLEGAL SENTENCE, NECESSITATING REDUCTION</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">As noted, we reverse and remand for a new trial on defendant\u2019s first point. We also consider the claims raised in Points II and III because of their implications for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">We first consider whether the defendant\u2019s right to due process was violated because of the lapse of almost twenty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>in prosecuting the case. <em>U.S. Const., </em>amend XIV; <em>N.J. Const </em>art. I, II10. There is no time bar to a murder prosecution. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-6a (\u201c[a] prosecution for any offense set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3 ... may be commenced at any time.\u201d) The 1971 Commission Commentary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:l-6 explains why there is no time bar for murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">The Code provides for limitation for all offenses except for murder (\u00a7 2C:l-6a), the view being that it is desirable to maintain the common police practice never to close the files on an unsolved murder case. Granting the fact that there are other crimes of comparable gravity, we believe that they are less likely to present equal obstacles to prompt discovery of evidence or to have comparably long continued impact on the sense of general security of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\"><em>ISee </em>Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 3 on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:l-6 (quoting 1971 Commission Commentary).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Defendant presents the rare question of whether other principles, namely due process protections, may still bar a murder prosecution where a statutory time-bar does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The indictment charges Townsend with the murder of Williams on December 12, 1981. The date of the indictment was January 30, 2002. The time from the alleged murder to the indictment was just over twenty years. Because of this period, Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment under <em>R. </em>3:25-3 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">If there is an unreasonable delay in presenting the charge to a grand jury or in filing an accusation against a defendant who has been held to answer upon a complaint, the Assignment Judge, or the Assignment Judge\u2019s designee, may dismiss the matter sua sponte or on motion of the defendant. If there is unreasonable delay in the disposition of an indictment or accusation, the judge to whom the case has been assigned may dismiss the matter sua sponte or on motion of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">The Law Division judge heard arguments on defendant\u2019s motion and denied defendant\u2019s request. The judge remarked that the relevant \u201cdelay\u201d was from the date of the incident to the date of indictment, not from the date of indictment to the date of trial. As for the proper test to apply, the judge cited to <em>State v. Cappadona, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 318 A.2d 425 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>574, 325 A.2d 707, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>1034, 95 <em>S.Ct </em>518, 42 L.Ed.2d 310 (1974). The judge acknowledged <em>Cappadona </em>was not directly on point; it dealt with the delay between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>indictment and trial. Still, the judge observed that the four factors <em>Cappadona </em>deemed relevant \u2014 length of delay, reason for delay, defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and the prejudice from the delay \u2014 might be relevant to defendant Townsend\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The judge then discussed <em>State v. Alexander, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>348, 708 A.2d 770 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>408, 719 A.2d 640 (1998). In that case, the defendant faced many charges including attempted murder and armed robbery. This pre-indictment delay was nearly two-and-one-half years. <em>Id. </em>at 350-353, 708 A.2d 770. We there observed that the Sixth Amendment Speedy Trial Clause does not apply to pre-indictment delay because the Sixth Amendment is not triggered until arrest or indictment. <em>Alexander, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 352-53, 708 A.2d 770 (citing <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>783, 788-89, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2044, 2048, 52 L.Ed.2d 752, 758 (1977); <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>307, 313-23, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>455, 463-64, 30 L.Ed.2d 468, 474-80 (1971)). <em>Alexander </em>found the validity of a pre-indictment delay is better measured by the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions. For that analysis, <em>Alexander </em>quoted <em>State v. Aguirre, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128, 132, 670 A.2d 583 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>585, 677 A.2d 758 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">The due process inquiry focuses on whether the delay \u201cviolates those \u2018fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our sense of fair play and decency.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lovasco, [supra,] </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 790, 97 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2049, 52 L.Ed.2d at 759 (citations omitted). Unlike analysis under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Speedy Trial Clause, which involves a four-factor balancing test and under which prejudice to the defense is presumed from an unusually long delay between indictment and trial, [citations omitted], claims under the Due Process Clause arising from undue preindictment or pre-arrest delay are measured by a far more rigorous standard. In order to prevail, a defendant must demonstrate \u201cboth that (1) there was no legitimate reason for the delay and (2) [defendant] was prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 515, 271 A.2d 905 (App.Div.1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\"><em>[Alexander, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 353, 708 A.2d 770 (quoting <em>Aguirre, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 132, 670 A.2d 583).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">As for the first prong, the <em>Alexander </em>court noted a split in the federal circuits as to whether a defendant must show the delay was the \u201cproduct of intentional governmental action to gain some tactical advantage over the accused or for some other impermissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ble, bad faith purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353-355, 708 A.2d 770. Rather than determining whether the defendant Alexander met the first prong, the court assumed that prong was met and rested the decision on Alexander\u2019s failure to meet the second prong on actual prejudice. Judge Skillman there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u201cThe law is well-settled that actual prejudice, not possible or presumed prejudice, is required to support a due process claim.\u201d <em>State v. Aguirre, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 133, 670 A.2d 583. \u201c[T]he defendant must show \u2018the delay caused \u201cactual and substantial prejudice\u2019 \u201d endangering his right to a fair trial and \u2018must present concrete evidence showing material harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 670 A.2d 583 (quoting <em>United States v. Anagnostou, </em>974 F.2d 939, 941-42 (7th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>1050, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>1943, 123 L.Ed.2d 649 (1993)). \u201cVague assertions of lost witnesses, faded memories, or misplaced documents are insufficient to establish a due process violation from pre-indictment delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Beszborn, </em>21 F.3d 62, 67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>934, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>330, 130 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 288 (1994). \u201cA mere loss of potential witnesses is insufficient absent a showing that their testimony \u2018would have actually aided the defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>[United States v. Crouch, </em>84 <em>F.3d </em>1497, 1515 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>1076, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>736, 136 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>676 (1997)] (quoting <em>Beszborn supra, </em>21 F.3d at 66). In fact, one federal circuit court has noted that \u201c[t]he task of establishing the requisite prejudice for a possible due process violation is \u2018so heavy\u2019 that we have found only two cases since 1975 in which any circuit has upheld a due process claim [based on pre-indictment delay].\u201d <em>United States v. Huntley, </em>976 <em>F.2d </em>1287, 1290 (9th Cir.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Barket, </em>530 <em>F.</em>2d 189 (8th Cir.1976) and <em>[Howell v. Barker, </em>904 <em>F.2d </em>889 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>1016, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>590, 112 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>595 (1990)]). Thus, in <em>United States v. McGough, </em>510 F.2d 598, 604-05 (5th Cir.1975), the court held that \u201cthe death of some six potential defense witnesses\u201d failed to \u201cmeet the clear requirement of <em>[United States v. Marion, supra, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>307, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>455, 30 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>468] that actual prejudice be shown\u201d because defendant\u2019s assertions concerning the testimony these witnesses could have given was \u201cspeculative.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Beszborn, supra, </em>21 F.3d at 66, the court concluded that the death of \u201cfive potentially material witnesses\u201d as well as the loss of alleged exculpatory documents was insufficient to establish actual prejudice. <em>See also United States v. Lovasco, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 789-90, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2048, 52 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 759; <em>United States v. West, </em>58 F.3d 133, 136 (5th Cir.1995). <em>[Alexander, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355-56, 708 A.2d 770.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The <em>Alexander </em>court applied this \u201cstringent standard\u201d for actual prejudice to the facts. 310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 356, 708 A.2d 770. Defendant said he was prejudiced because he could not call his brother as a witness. Defendant claimed he was with his brother at the time of the crimes and his brother had died. Defendant also said that on numerous prior occasions he had used the phone on which critical fingerprints were found, but the phone company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>only maintained phone records for up to eighteen months. We said there was no actual prejudice because even if defendant had been indicted promptly, his brother still could not have testified because he died shortly after the offense occurred. We also said defendant\u2019s brother likely would not have remembered defendant\u2019s prior calls from the fingerprinted phone, and there was no \u201cdirect evidence\u201d the phone records would have shown the prior calls. <em>Id. </em>at 356-57, 708 A.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Alexander </em>makes several important points. First, pre-indictment delays are not subject to the Sixth Amendment speedy trial standards, since those are only implicated post-arrest. Second, the relevant test is a two-pronged analysis from <em>Aguirre, </em>which requires a defendant to show (1) there was no legitimate reason for the delay and (2) defendant was prejudiced. Third, assuming defendant had established the first prong, there was no actual prejudice established in a two-year delay. One witness\u2019 death would not have affected an undelayed trial and there was no real proof that the telephone records, if available, would have supported defendant\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In this case now before us, the judge essentially applied <em>Alexander. </em>The judge said he was \u201cnot prepared to make a determination that no prejudice exists.\u201d The judge\u2019s hesitation was rather on the first prong of whether there was a legitimate reason for the delay. As the judge phrased it, his concern was \u201cwhether [the State] was irresponsible or if it contributed to the delay in an unreasonable sense.\u201d On this issue the judge concluded that an indictment could have been returned against Townsend in 1981. Still, \u201cthe evidence at that time was such that the [State] could not reasonably anticipate conviction given the evidence it had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The judge observed that two of the State\u2019s main witnesses, Jason and Brian Williams, were seven and three, respectively, when the crime occurred. In the judge\u2019s view, these witnesses \u201care now in a much better position to verbalize what they did and did not experience.\u201d The judge also said \u201cthe so-called dying declaration was such in 1981 as to permit a reasonably informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>determination to be made by the prosecutor then, that it would be unwise for the prosecutor to move the case with the state of the evidence that then existed ... that declaration converted what would otherwise be a case more ripe for conviction to one less ripe for conviction, although in any circumstance, might have been sufficient to produce an indictment now.\u201d The judge recognized that there was no statute of limitations for murder. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApH\">I am moved by the fact that no indictment was delivered in '81 or '82, and this matter was allowed to languish this far, but the fact of the matter is that discretionary efforts were made by the prosecutor at that time, and this time, are, I think under all of the circumstances laudable. They are not a great example of what, and I should say they are not what we would like to see under due process, but there are times when that can\u2019t be helped. This is one of those times. This is one of the times that for purposes of this decision and assuming that delay, that the reason for the delay is reasonable, and therefore ... the application of the defendant must fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The judge also cited <em>State v. Cichetto, </em>144 <em>N. J.Super. </em>236, 365 A.2d 207 (App.Div.1976). There, the defendant was not indicted until 1974 on charges of bribery, extortion, and other crimes that allegedly occurred in 1969. The trial judge dismissed the indictment based on federal speedy trial standards. We reversed. We held federal speedy trial standards did not apply because the case involved pre-arrest delay. 144 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 237-38, 365 A.2d 207. Rather, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">The paramount issue in this case is whether there was a denial of defendant\u2019s right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment because of an unreasonable delay between the commission of the crimes and presentment of the charges to a grand jury where there had been no prior criminal complaint or arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">At a hearing on a motion to dismiss an indictment on that ground, a defendant has the burden of establishing both that there was no legitimate reason for the delay and that he was prejudiced thereby. <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 271 A.2d 905 (App.Div.1970). While the ultimate burden of persuasion on both issues rests upon defendant, the State is obligated to show that there was a legitimate reason for the delay once the defendant has shown prejudice to his case. <em>State v. Roundtree, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 29, 285 A.2d 564 (App.Div.1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\"><em>[Cichetto, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 238-39, 365 A.2d 207.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">We held defendant did not meet his burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">We must here determine (1) whether the trial judge used the proper test for a claim of undue delay between the criminal event and the leveling of the charges; and (2) whether the facts sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ported denial of the motion. We conclude that the trial judge used the right test and applied it correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On the first issue, case law adequately supports <em>Alexander </em>as the proper test for a delay between the criminal event and arrest. The other two possible tests \u2014 the <em>Cappadona </em>four-part test and <em>R. </em>3:25-3 \u2014 do not fit the mold. As discussed in <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Cichetto, </em>the federal standards that form the basis of <em>Cappadona\u2019s </em>four-part test do not deal with pre-arrest delays. <em>Alexander, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 352-53, 708 A.2d 770 (citing <em>Lovasco, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 788-89, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2048, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 758). <em>R. </em>3:25-3, which requires a judge to ask whether \u201cthere is an unreasonable delay in presenting the charge to a grand jury or in filing an accusation against a defendant who has been held to answer upon a complaint,\u201d does not work either. The language of <em>R. </em>3:25-3 suggests it applies to delays after the defendant is detained. It applies to \u201can unreasonable delay in presenting the charge to a grand jury or in filing an accusation <em>against a defendant who has been held to answer upon a complaint </em>[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The use of \u201cdefendant\u201d implies the person has already been arrested and charged, and the use of \u201chas been held\u201d suggests the delay occurred while the person was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">As noted, the trial judge turned his decision on the first prong. The State contended it had more mature witnesses. The State said it now had the testimony of a woman, then age thirteen in 1981, who would not testify because her mother would forbid her cooperation. The witness stated she saw defendant in his truck and he crashed through a gate, weakening the defense theory that Williams was killed by another vehicle, not a truck, coming through the gate. The State also said it now had the helpful statement of a neighbor whose residence adjoined Williams\u2019 residence. There also were additional statements of relatives detailing prior acts of domestic violence that would show motive under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). The State demonstrated that this additional evidence was not a mere refinement of its available 1981 evidence, but included both additional relevant witnesses and corroborative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>testimony. To the State \u201cthe investigation needed to remain open to develop other witnesses\u201d in part because \u201ceveryone was so petrified of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The State further argues persuasively there was no proven actual prejudice to defendant, but only vague assertions of lost witnesses, faded memories, and misplaced documents. Defendant argues there were lost witnesses, including police officers and a nurse, who might have heard Williams say she was hit by a car. Defendant also claimed other lost witnesses could have testified about the relationship between himself and Williams. Defendant also lamented the lack of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) rebuttal evidence. Still, defendant did not explain persuasively why the State\u2019s conduct lacked legitimate justification, especially when this was a murder case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In his appellate brief, defendant restates his arguments below on actual prejudice. He emphasizes that unlike other pre-arrest delay cases, the extenuating delay here was twenty years. He argues the State had all the evidence it needed in 1981 and the only reason for the delay was the State\u2019s inattention and lethargy. Defendant argues the only reason the State took action in 2001 was because the Williams brothers came forward on their own initiative. Defendant urges the State did not need to wait until 2001 for the case to develop, but could have indicted at some point between 1981 and 2001. Against the State\u2019s argument that witnesses were afraid to testify, defendant submits the State could have avoided that by arresting him and detaining him pending his indictment and trial. Defendant also observes the BWS evidence to combat the dying declaration was available in 1984 after <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 478 A.2d 364 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">We agree with the State assertion that defendant\u2019s claims of actual prejudice with regard to the inability to call helpful witnesses are vague, if not fanciful and very speculative. As for <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>first prong, the State notes that no New Jersey court has explained whether \u201clegitimate reason for delay\u201d requires the defendant show the delay was intentional, a strategic maneuver. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The State argues it could still satisfy the first prong if it were so defined. The State asserts convincingly that although it could have indicted in 1981, it could not reasonably have anticipated a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We agree that there might be extreme eases where due process could bar a long-delayed murder prosecution. For example, if a defendant showed that the State had sufficient evidence to indict for murder, but did not indict until the potential defendant\u2019s main exculpatory witness died, due process might be triggered. In such a situation, the defense could be entirely eviscerated by the passage of time. However, that is not the case here. Although the State probably could have indicted defendant earlier, its delay did not violate the rigorous standards of <em>Alexander.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Defendant asserts the judge erred by admitting testimony concerning the alleged prior instances of violence by defendant directed against the victim. The scope of review of a trial judge\u2019s determination on the admissibility of other \u201cbad conduct\u201d evidence is narrow and deferential, limited to an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>State v. Marrero, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>469, 483, 691 A.2d 293 (1997) (citing, <em>inter alia State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 266, 524 A.2d 188 (1987) (\u201cThe trial court, because of its intimate knowledge of the case, is in the best position to engage in this balancing process. Its decisions are entitled to deference and are to be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>404 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">Character Evidence Not Admissible to Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Other Crimes Evidence * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the disposition of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. Such evidence may be admitted for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident when such matters are relevant to a material issue in dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 338, 605 A.2d 230 (1992), the Supreme Court placed additional constraints on the admission of character evidence against an accused. Such evidence: (1) must be relevant to a material issue which is genuinely disputed; (2) the other conduct must be similar in kind to that which is charged currently and must have occurred reasonably close in time to the events at issue in the criminal trial; (3) evidence of the other conduct must be clear and convincing; and (4) its probative value must not be outweighed by prejudice to the defendant. <em>See </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>Comment 8 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) (Gann 2004) (citing <em>Cofield; State v. Bakka, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>533, 547, 826 A.2d 604 (2003); <em>State v. Darby, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>509, 519, 809 A.2d 138 (2002); <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>106, 119, 784 A.2d 1225 (2001); <em>State v. Covell, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>554, 564, 725 A.2d 675 (1999); <em>Marrero, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 691 A.2d 293).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Jason Williams, Brian Williams, and Freddie Williams all testified for the State. As noted, at the time of Williams\u2019 death, Jason was seven, Brian was three, and Freddie was fifteen. At that time, Brian and Jason lived with Williams and defendant (also nicknamed \u201cPoncho\u201d) at 64 Bond Street in Trenton. Each said they saw defendant beat Williams on various earlier occasions. Jason and Brian testified that they saw the beating incident they said led to Williams\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Defendant argues that \u201cother crimes, wrongs or bad acts\u201d testimony from Jason, Brian, and Freddie violated <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). Jason talked about how defendant \u201cwould always beat on her.\u201d He said that once defendant pushed Williams through a glass window and allowed the broken glass to cut her. He said defendant would beat Williams with anything, including a two-by-four. He testified to another specific act of violence that occurred when defendant and Williams lived at a different location. Brian, four years Jason\u2019s junior, testified to an incident when defendant threw Williams through a Christmas tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Freddie, age fifteen at Williams\u2019 death, gave more extensive bad acts testimony occurring when he lived with Williams in Trenton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>when defendant first dated her. Freddie said defendant hit his mother in the knee with a glass' baby bottle, and another time hit her in the head with a new stereo. After this latter testimony the judge gave a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) limiting instruction. The judge said the jury could only use the evidence \u201cfor a specific purpose, such as motive, or such as lack of mistake, or such as in this case, the allusion to the identity of who did and did not commit the offense.\u201d Freddie continued to testify that defendant would beat Williams \u201conce or twice a week.\u201d He said defendant once tried to throw a TV at Williams and on another occasion tried to throw her out a window. He said on one Christmas defendant threw gifts out a window. Freddie testified about another instance when defendant punched his mother which led to a fight between himself and defendant. The trial judge gave another limiting instruction on Freddie\u2019s bad acts testimony at the end of his direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The scope of the bad acts testimony was decided at a pretrial hearing. After considering the expected testimony of Jason, Brian, and Freddie, and another witness Patricia Brevard, the trial judge said the first three could testify to prior bad acts but that Brevard, who offered to testify to defendant\u2019s slap of Williams while bowling in 1976, could not. The judge fully explained his reasoning in his pretrial ruling on October 3,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">We agree with the judge\u2019s ruling on this point. The bad acts evidence was \u201chighly probative of several issues in dispute\u2014 defendant\u2019s intent or purpose, his state of mind, his motive, the absence of mistake or accident, ...\u201d The State properly relies on <em>State v. Long, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>138, 162, 801 A.2d 221 (2002), for the proposition that evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior assaults on his victim is so highly probative of these issues that it is seldom excluded because of undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Our courts have frequently allowed other crimes evidence as a permissible evidence of motive, intent and state of mind. <em>See e.g., State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 266, 524 A.2d 188 (1987) (evidence of defendant\u2019s prior threats and violence towards victim admissible to show defendant\u2019s state of mind); <em>State v.

M.L., </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 22-25, 600 A.2d 1211 (App.Div. 1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>560, 606 A.2d 371 (1992) (permitting testimony about other instances of abuse not charged in the indictment); <em>State v. Frost, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>601, 619-21, 577 A.2d 1282 (App.Div.1990) (prior assaults on victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In her closing argument the prosecutor did not rely on the evidence of the prior bad acts at all; she certainly did not try to improperly arouse the jurors\u2019 emotions on this score. A limiting instruction, as given here, \u201chelps to insure that the prosecutor does not use the motive evidence improperly during summation.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 801 A.2d 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The heart of the defense was the putative dying declaration that Williams made while in the intensive care unit. In the so-called declaration, Williams allegedly nodded to a detective that defendant did not cause her injuries but rather a car struck her.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Defendant argues that the trial judge should not have allowed the State to introduce BWS testimony to discredit Williams\u2019 dying declaration. Defendant asserts the judge\u2019s articu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>lated basis for admitting the BWS evidence \u2014 to compensate the State because he admitted the dying declaration that, in his opinion, did not have a strong or even adequate foundation \u2014 was erroneous. In a subpoint, not raised below, defendant argues that the judge should have provided a special BWS instruction, especially because the State\u2019s expert, Dr. Kabus, could not conclusively testify Williams had BWS.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(2) authorizes the introduction of a \u201cdying declaration\u201d as admissible hearsay. The rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">Statement under belief of imminent death. In a criminal proceeding, a statement made by a victim unavailable as a witness is admissible, if it was made voluntarily and in good faith and while the declarant believed in the imminence of declarant\u2019s impending death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(a)(4) deems a declarant an \u201cunavailable\u201d witness when the declarant \u201cis absent from the hearing because of death[J\u201d The rationale for admissibility is that a person in such circumstances would have no reason to lie. <em>See </em>Biunno, <em>New Jersey Rules of Evidence, </em>Comment 3 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804 (Gann 2004). As described in 1789 in one of the earliest cases to apply the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">[T]hey are declarations made in extremity, when the party is at the point of death, and when every hope of this world is gone: when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth; a situation so solemn, and so awful, is considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by a positive oath administered in a Court of Justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">[Desmond Manderson, <em>Et Lex Perpetua: Dying Declarations &amp; Mozart\u2019s Requiem, </em>20 <em>Cardozo L.Rev. </em>1621, 1622 (1999) (citing <em>The King v. Woodcock </em>168 <em>Eng. Rep. </em>352, 353 (Cr.Cas.Res.1789) (footnote omitted in article)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">In this case, the testimony on the dying declaration came from Detective Pogorzelski. He started with the Trenton Police Department in April 1968 and retired in June 1994. When he arrived at the hospital, a doctor informed him that \u201cit would be very hard for [Williams] to understand any of [Detective Pogorzelski\u2019s] questions, that because of her being in an intoxicated condition and being under medication.\u201d The detective approached Williams as she lay in the intensive care unit. He \u201ctold her she was in a very bad condition, things did not look good for her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>that she would have to talk to me.\u201d Williams \u201cjust laid there and kind of moaned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Detective Pogorzelski then asked Williams if defendant beat her. She moved her head from side-to-side. The officer interpreted this as a \u201cno.\u201d When he asked her if she was hit by a truck, she made the same motion. When he asked her if she was hit by a car, \u201cshe went up and down with her head, [a] kind of motion telling me yes, that she was hit by a car.\u201d She could not verbalize her answers; she then became unresponsive. Detective Pogorzelski\u2019s testimony was consistent with his testimony at a pretrial evidentiary hearing on the declaration\u2019s admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">During the evidentiary hearings, the parties debated whether Williams\u2019 responses to Detective Pogorzelski satisfied <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b)(2). Defendant argued that Williams was aware of her impending death, and that her responses were voluntary and in good faith. Defendant said that since Williams knew to shake her head \u201cno\u201d to two questions and then nodded a \u201cyes\u201d to another question she understood the questions asked of her. The State argued Williams did not realize she was dying, and that her answers lacked credibility because she feared further abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The judge observed this was an unusual situation because the defense sought to use a dying declaration as exculpatory evidence, not the State using it as incriminating evidence. The judge\u2019s initial impressions were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">This is a very close question because there is on one part-one-half the broader question of judicial fairness seems to require that that dying declaration be permitted, and on the other half, there are some structural weaknesses in the application of the rules which must be met to permit the declaration to be allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">The statements that are made are susceptible of at least three interpretations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">One, they were the truth, and this defendant is, of course, thereby wrongly charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">Two, they were an effort to protect Walter Townsend, notwithstanding the fact that Walter Townsend applied the beating and eventually physical injuries that resulted in the death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">And three, the victim had no notion of what she was saying or doing, and we\u2019re interpreting Pogorzelski\u2019s interpretation of what he saw as what I called verbal acts. Each one of those three is almost susceptible under the circumstances to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>that conclusion, however, as I said, inasmuch as this evidence underpins so many things that happened in this case, the original redirecting of the ship of investigation piloted by the police department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">Two, the reaction to what he considered to be the legal consequence of a dying declaration by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">And three, the ultimate equities involved. [It] is this Court\u2019s opinion that it will side with the ultimate equities involved and permit the evidence of what is called the dying declaration despite the manifest interpretations that can be made ... I will permit the discussion relating to [BWS] as it had been described by the prosecutor in Court and what I understand the [BWS] to be permitted, to prove respecting the acts of a battered woman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">In response to the ruling, defendant\u2019s counsel expressed concern about the admission of the BWS testimony in conjunction with the dying declaration. After an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing on the testimony proposed from Dr. Kabus, the State\u2019s BWS expert, and Dr. Coughlin, the defendant\u2019s BWS expert, the judge ruled that if defendant wanted to introduce the dying declaration, he would allow the State to introduce BWS testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">During trial, but before Dr. Kabus testified, defense counsel requested an offer of proof from the State as to what the expert would say. Even though under the earlier ruling any BWS testimony was admissible, both the judge and the prosecutor began to express reservations about the admissibility of the BWS evidence where Dr. Kabus could not conclude Williams actually had the BWS syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">The State said it would introduce the \u201cgeneralities of [BWS], without having [Dr. Kabus] opine as to Mrs. Williams herself.\u201d Defense counsel objected \u201cbecause [the expert testimony] has to have some relationship to this ease. If she is going to have Dr. Kabus get up there and talk about [BWS] and not in some way relate it to this case, I don\u2019t see the value of that. I see extreme prejudice because in effect what the prosecutor is asking the jury to do is ... to come to that conclusion.\u201d The judge found the prosecutor\u2019s proffer of BWS \u201cgeneralities\u201d a \u201clittle bit troublesome because you\u2019re going to argue to the jury, I would presume, that a connection should be made.\u201d The prosecutor admitted she was \u201cconcerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The judge suggested that the presentation of BWS testimony without an expert conclusion that Williams had BWS was like having one Christmas tree bulb on a Christmas tree. The prosecutor analogized the testimony to the use of a drug expert in a drug-distribution case. Near the end of the colloquy, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">I looked at the cases, and my concern is a general philosophical discussion about the [BWS1 would be more problematic because if you\u2019re just saying you\u2019re going to lay those questions out and say what is a battered woman, what is [BWS] and then just leave it there, that strikes me as being more, shall we say, renewable negatively by an ... Appellate Division court who probably never got deeply ensconced in the issue in the first place, and here we are, deeply ensconced in the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In response to defense counsel\u2019s question, the judge stated the substance of his ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">ME. SOMEES [Defense counsel]: ... Your Honor, that is why I asked for this offer of proof, because ... if the prosecutor is going to talk about the generalities or her expert is going to talk about the generalities of the [BWS] and not make a connection to this ease, then I don\u2019t see ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">THE COURT: You\u2019ve already had the benefit of the fruit of the dying declaration. I mean, that was \u2014 remember, just for purposes of review, of the reviewing court, this could have been shaved either way as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">Here is what ... I believed just so the Appellate Division, should it ever get to them, or the Supreme Court so they have a better understanding of my thinking; the dying declaration was a little bit short of being a dying declaration for a number of reasons, whether you have to infer that Nicky Wiliams was ... of a belef that she was going to die is the foundation upon which dying declarations are ... founded. Is the foundation of that, the permissibilty of hearing a dying declaration because it is the feeing that if someone is going to die, they are not going to die with a le on their lips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">Now, you take that one step further and you get into the sticky area of the [BWS] and you have a battered woman defending her assailant because, one, she is fearful of further assaults, she is depended upon the assaulter, her assailant, and reasons that speak to the ... motives of Nicky Williams to look into the future, under whatever delirium she might have been exposed to at that period in time, if she should happen to end up, and Poncho did do it, and she is going to Ive with Poncho with anticipation of another beating, that is why ... the argument is a circular one with respect to the balance of the two, of the two issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">I could have very easily [have] said there is insufficient proof that Nicky Wiliams believed that she was going to die, and cut out the dying declaration. But, I thought in fairness to Walter Townsend that that declaration was important, not only for the defense, but critical to the defense. That was my reasoning, and I beleved, without being able to assess, as the prosecutor\u2019s often noted, a dead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>victim, we can\u2019t assess what her motives were. We can\u2019t get a full development as to whether she was a battered woman and whether she \u2014 whether the dying declaration was, at all was an appropriate circumstance if she should have survived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">There are a number of reasons that you might be able to argue that the dying declaration would still be permissible because it would still be with the anticipation of dying. You could argue either way on the dying declaration; anticipation of death or anticipation of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">But, as I asked you earlier in the trial, when we weighed this the first time, went through the argument, you indicated, Mr. Somers, you wanted, you wanted it to be offered to the jury, and I think your decision was a correct one. In other words, you could have said you didn\u2019t want it in and it would foreclose other avenues, but it certainly operates in all fairness to Poncho, and that is why I permitted that to be let in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">Now, giving a little on that end, I thought it balances by permitting discussion about the [BWS] because that gives a subsidiaiy explanation to why, why a woman might do that. So, it is trying to give you both fairness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">And what I am encouraged by, shall I say, is that I\u2019m obliged, as are all of the judges, to go to what we call the New Jersey Judicial College, and I\u2019ve received the curriculum after I made this ruling earlier on in this case and now I\u2019m being revisited, but there is a little course that I have indicated a desire to take and that would be trial evidence, artistry and advocacy in the courtroom. And it is given by somebody from Arizona. What they know about New Jersey law, whatever, I\u2019m not sure. But this gentleman figures that there are three Rs for filtering evidence, to quickly scrutinize its admissibility, and he says, he asks three questions, is it relevant, is it reliable, and the last question is what compels me, is it right. Now, we can\u2019t tell whether it is right until ultimately another reviewing court makes the determination. It is like the umpire saying, is it a ball or a strike, and it is nothing until he calls it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">So whether we know that this is right, we won\u2019t know if, in fact, it ever goes to the Appellate Division and is considered, but I think the Appellate Division should understand that the motivation behind this was a balancing of the two equities of complicated evidentiary rulings that have, in my view, no foundation in the books. All the books, all the green books and all the cream books I have in my office I found nothing that really makes it clear that this is admissible or not admissible. Consequently, I have to rely on my experience as a trial lawyer, my experience as a trial judge, and the feeling that I have that it\u2019s right to do this. It is right to give it to the jury. I can\u2019t make that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">The judge added;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">In other words, there is [a] rationale that the jury is entitled to consider in light of her testimony, there is a rationale in the broadest sense for a statement that otherwise defies our credulity. Well, normally we would say, well, damn, the woman is on her death bed and she is exonerating the guy. Poncho didn\u2019t do it. She was hit by a car. She was hit by a truck. Well, this gives you a rational motivation to lie, and which apparently has been approved and accepted by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>number of courts in New Jersey; one that seems to be within legitimate reasons, the bounds of reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">So the jury is not going to make an expert opinion, they going to draw facts from, and draw inferences as circumstantial evidence oft times does, permit them to draw inference as to what facts existed. They can determine that that was a characteristic of a battered woman, whether it was \u2014 whether she was or not declared a battered woman, that is one of the characteristics that are out there, and that is the rationale behind this reasoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The next day, the judge amplified his ruling, citing <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702. He said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">It seems to me that a jury can appropriately benefit by the testimony, it will be helpful to the trier of fact, it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, and therefore, the testimony of a \u2014 of the proposed expert who has been deemed an expert by other courts in this state, seems to be appropriate, that they can take what has been a relatively new field of expertise but that has received a lot of attention because of a variety of reasons that we need not go into, but that battered women and [BWS] arc a more \u2014 a higher focal point in the panorama of specialized circumstances that afflict the variety of victims that we have in this day and age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">Accordingly, it would seem to me that it is appropriate that the jury should be assisted in understanding the concept that has been, I believe, dealt with approbation by our Supreme Court and that provides yet another foundation for the testimony I\u2019ve permitted, and I just wanted to make it a little more, a little more clear, although it was not referred to by anybody in particular in this court, it seems to me to be quite, quite clear that that could be offered and assessed by the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">It is not unlike the analogy that the prosecutor brought in about a broad assessment of drug circumstances that are not necessarily directly applicable to the case wherein such testimony is heard, but nevertheless, it is testimony that is helpful to a jury, and for that reason, I can agree with what the prosecutor has said and the testimony again, will be admitted for the purposes described by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Immediately before Dr. Kabus testified for the State, defense counsel renewed his objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">I object to Dr. Kabus coming in and testifying. I learned from the Prosecutor that Dr. Kabus is going to come in and testify to characteristics of the [BWS] in general, and, your Honor, what I\u2019m saying is that her mere presence talking about [BWS], she in effect, even if she doesn\u2019t talk about this particular case, she is in fact rendering a net opinion, because this jury will wonder why in the world is she here. I mean why she\u2019s giving this opinion about battered women, and by implication, that must apply to Norma Williams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">To this the judge responded, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">[I]t should be made clear that there are a number of competing concerns, and those concerns include the fact that there is testimony which suggests that the victim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the subject of a number of attacks by the defendant, and that is our 404(b) testimony. That testimony is related in my view to an appropriate introduction under 404(b), but also relates to the declaration that Nicky Williams made on a prior dying, half an hour before she died or 20 minutes before she died, which effectually exonerated the defendant, if we can determine as a matter of fact that that testimony does do that. We have relatively abstruse testimony, I would say with respect to Detective Pogorzelski\u2019s final confrontation with the victim. And as I said, in my view, within this Court\u2019s discretion, I could have discounted that as a dying declaration because there was not any evidence necessarily that could be determined to suggest an awareness on the part of Nicky Williams that she was about to die, thereby making the dying declaration, meeting one of the elements of a dying declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">However, and as a matter of fact, if one is going to understand her comments in the context in which they were given, and I say comments as loosely as X possibly can, because they involve a groan, whether it was conscious or unconscious, it involves questions of whether she understood what she was saying, what she was doing, what she was hearing, whether the shakes of the head and the nods of the head were interpreted correctly by the detective are all matters that ultimately have to be resolved by this jury. That was introduced, despite the fact that I felt that it could have easily been declared to fall short of those requirements needed to involve a dying declaration, but I figured further, this Court figured that in the interest of fairness to the defendant, and in interest and response to your request and Mr. Townsend\u2019s request, that they be introduced, and obviously, you have to argue that those are important considerations for the jury to respond to, they are appropriately counter-balanced by the introduction of what, if it is determined to be exculpation in a dying declaration, there \u2014 as equally it can be determined that it is part of what would normally be considered or a characteristic of what may normally be considered a dying \u2014 a[BWS] or battered women\u2019s response to years of battery, and that would be the protection of the person who is her batterer and assailant. And that, once again, is compounded by the fact that it goes to the dying declaration as to whether, if she exonerated the defendant inappropriately, again, the question for the jury, that that goes against the declaration of an \u2014 that the declaration can be considered dying declaration for purposes of the hearsay rules and the testimony disallowing such hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">Consequently, it comes down to a question of what is the most right under all of the considerations, and those considerations this Court has balanced, and any reviewer of these decisions should understand that in the broadest sense it was felt by this Court that it would be \u2014 although without any prior guidance from any courts, it was felt that it was the right thing to do, given the interpretation that could be accorded the dying declaration, taken into account with what could effect that dying declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">Consequently, the Court denies the application to once again disallow it, because it seems to this Court to be most correct under all of the circumstances, of the totality of the circumstances that it be permitted under 702, which permits testimony that is helpful to the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>In sum, the trial judge adopted an equitable balancing justification for admitting the BWS testimony, despite the fact that Dr. Kabus could not say Williams had a BWS diagnosis. The first justification was that he was previously indulgent to the defense when he admitted the dying declaration testimony. A second justification was that it was useful \u201cgeneral information\u201d evidence, and thus helpful to the trier of fact under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702. A third was that this testimony combined with <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) testimony on defendant\u2019s prior acts of abuse to give added context to the dying declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">After this ruling, Dr. Kabus and the defense\u2019s expert, Dr. Coughlin, testified about BWS. Dr. Kabus was qualified as an expert \u201cin battered women and [BWS]\u201d and \u201cto testify with respect to [BWS] as an adjunct to or part of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\u201d Both experts distinguished between a battered woman and a woman with BWS. To have BWS, a woman must exhibit five of eight BWS characteristics. But a woman who does not meet five of the eight BWS characteristics might still be \u201cbattered.\u201d Dr. Kabus agreed that the difference is a matter of degree. Dr. Coughlin did not fully agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Dr. Kabus testified that a common trait of women with BWS\u2014 lying to protect the abuser for fear of future abuse \u2014 can also be present in women who are battered but who do not have BWS. By contrast, Dr. Coughlin said that just because a woman is battered does not mean an expert can predict what her behavior will be. Instead, \u201c \u2018predict behavior\u2019 has more to do with me for what Mnd of treatment I need to provide for the person, what\u2019s likely to happen in our treatment, what supports do I need to provide for the person.\u201d Although Dr. Coughlin agreed there are commonalities in behavior between battered women and women with BWS, he said there was no extant research to support the presence of lying as a protective device in both BWS women and non-BWS battered women. While clinically he had seen both BWS women and non-BWS battered women who lie to protect abusers, no research supported this as a characteristic in both.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>On appeal, defendant contests the use of Dr. Kabus to testify on BWS. Defendant argues that it was erroneous for the judge to adopt the \u201crough justice\u201d solution that allowed the admission of the dying declaration only if the State could present BWS testimony. As defendant states, \u201c[A] perceived weakness in the foundation for an aspect of one party\u2019s case \u2014 and the defendant vehemently maintains that no such weakness exists \u2014 cannot provide the basis for permitting countervailing evidence in the absence of a factual basis or legal authority for it.\u201d Such a perception of weakness in the foundation of the dying declaration \u201cdoes not constitute authorization for the court to disregard the rules of evidence in order to permit the State to neutralize that declaration.\u201d Further, defendant contends \u201cour case law has not authorized expert testimony concerning purportedly typical characteristics and responses of battered woman. Rather, it has authorized such testimony concerning sufferers of the Battered Women\u2019s Syndrome.\u201d Defendant urges that \u201cno inferences may be appropriately drawn on the basis of the Syndrome in the absence of a diagnosis that the woman in question suffers from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In response, the State contends the BWS testimony was appropriately admitted because it was relevant under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702. The State asserts there was no error in admitting the BWS testimony without a conclusion that Williams had BWS, based on cases in this State and from other jurisdictions. The State also claims that even if defendant\u2019s position is meritorious, the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">This court said in <em>State v. Ellis, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 656 A.2d 25 (App.Div.1995), where Dr. Kabus also testified on BWS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">The use of expert testimony to establish Battered Woman\u2019s Syndrome has been permitted in New Jersey for over a decade. <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 209, 478 A.2d 364 (1984). The Court more recently restated the rationale for allowing such testimony as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">[E]xpert scientific evidence concerning \u201cbattered-woman\u2019s syndrome\u201d does not aid a jury in determining whether a defendant had or had not behaved in a given manner on a particular occasion; rather, the evidence enables the jury to overcome common myths or misconceptions that a woman who had been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>victim of battering would have surely left the batterer. Thus, the evidence helps the jury to understand the battered woman\u2019s state of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\"><em>[State v. J.Q., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>554, 574, 617 A.2d 1196 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">Thus, there is no question that expert testimony concerning the Battered Woman\u2019s Syndrome can be introduced in a criminal proceeding. <em>But its application is limited to explaining a victim\u2019s reactions or late reporting of the events and not as evidence that the crime occurred. Ibid. See also State v. Frost, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>601, 613-614, 577 A.2d 1282 (App.Div.) <em>eertif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>321, 604 A.2d 596 (1990) (evidence of Battered Woman\u2019s Syndrome can be used to bolster a victim\u2019s credibility in the State\u2019s ease in chief). This use is similar to proof of a fresh complaint in a sexual assault case. <em>See State v. Hill, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>150, 578 A.2d 370 (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\"><em>[Ellis, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 543-544, 656 A.2d 25 (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">In <em>Kelly, </em>the Supreme Court allowed a woman charged with murder to introduce BWS testimony to support her credibility. In <em>Frost, </em>we extended the permissible uses of such testimony to the State\u2019s use to support a female victim\u2019s credibility. 242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 612-613, 577 <em>A.2d </em>1282. In <em>Frost </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">\"[TJhere is nothing about the testimony itself which makes it inappropriate for admission as part of the State\u2019s ease in chief where the woman eventually asserts herself and reports her abuser to the authorities, before she becomes the defendant on trial for committing murder ... It would seem anomalous to allow a battered woman, where she is a criminal defendant, to offer this type of expert testimony in order to help the jury understand the actions she took, yet deny her that same opportunity when she is the complaining witness and/or victim and her abuser is the criminal defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 612, 577 A.2d 1282.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Aside from the various justifications used before and at trial for admission of the expert testimony, all expert testimony must meet the requirements of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702 and 703. The judge relied on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702 to say that the BWS testimony would be helpful to the trier of fact. That may have been so, but this does not end the inquiry. Expert testimony must satisfy <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts. The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">The judge rationalized the expert BWS testimony as \u201cgeneral information\u201d evidence akin to a detective\u2019s expert testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>drug distribution. But ultimately, Dr. Kabus was asked about her opinions on the characteristics of non-BWS battered women.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Specifically, the State sought to elicit Dr. Kabus\u2019 opinion that non-BWS battered women, like women with BWS, are likely to he to protect their abusers. Of course, the State wanted this testimony to discredit Williams\u2019 dying declaration. Within that opinion are several sub-opinions, including the opinions that non-BWS battered women are a discrete analytical category, that characteristics of non-BWS battered women resemble the characteristics of women with BWS, and that lying to protect abusers is one overlapping characteristic. All of these statements are not just \u201cgeneral information\u201d but discrete expert opinions. As such, they are subject to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703. Under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, they had to be based on sufficient facts or data, either made known to the expert before trial or of the type reasonably relied upon in the field. The State did not make such a demonstration. The following passage demonstrates the lack of an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703 grounding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">MS. LACKEN [Prosecutor]: You described the characteristics of the [BWS], but there are also common behaviors that are exhibited by women that either are either battered and/or suffer from the [BWS], correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">DR. KABUS: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">This was a \u201cnet\u201d opinion. There is no elaboration on the underlying facts or data that support this proposition. Another example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">MS. LACKEN: One of the things that you mentioned was the ability to live with a Jekyll/Hyde personality, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">DR. KABUS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">MS. LACKEN: Now, would that be something that was consistent with individuals that are battered women without being a clinical, clinically diagnosed with the [BWS]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">DR. KABUS: Yes, that would be true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">MS. LACKEN: It seems that a lot of the characteristics that battered women suffer overlap into the [BWS] and vice-versa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\">DR. KABUS: Definitely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">Again, these are \u201cnet\u201d opinions, introduced over defense counsel\u2019s earlier objections to the BWS testimony. Eventually they became an important part of the prosecutor\u2019s summation to discredit the dying declaration when she argued to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>And if you think [Norma Williams] was lucid, ladies and gentlemen, if you think she could hear and could understand, then you\u2019ve got to assess the testimony of Dr. Kabus. Women who are battered lie to protect not only their batterers, but themselves from future beatings, from future abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The State did not use Dr. Kabus\u2019 testimony for general information, but for her specific opinion that non-BWS battered women act like women with BWS, and a common characteristic of both is that they lie to protect abusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">We conclude that the admission of the victim\u2019s dying declaration was not sufficient to justify admission of the BWS expert testimony. Nowhere in the rules of evidence does admissibility hinge on the judge\u2019s prior liberality in admitting evidence favorable to the opposing side. The \u201ckeystone of the Rules of Evidence,\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>402, says \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in these rules or by law, all relevant evidence is admissible.\u201d <em>See </em>Biunno, <em>New Jersey Rules of Evidence, </em>Comment 1 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>402 (citing <em>Reinhart v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>156, 164, 685 A.2d 1301 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Dixon, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>223, 248, 593 A.2d 266 (1991) (dealing with prior <em>Evidence R. </em>7(f)))). That is, for evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant and not excluded by other rules. Prior liberality is not an exception to the rule of admissibility, especially in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In this case, the BWS testimony should have been relevant and should have satisfied <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703 standards. Dr. Kabus\u2019s statements that non-BWS battered women exhibit similar characteristics to women with BWS, such as lying to protect abusers, were net opinions. Their admission was potentially highly prejudicial, tending to discredit the linchpin of the defense case. While Dr. Coughlin did testify that no research has demonstrated commonality between non-BWS battered women and women with BWS, this does not cure or offset the inevitable prejudice occasioned by Dr. Kabus\u2019s testimony. Our rules choose exclusion, not cross-examination, as the safeguard against prejudice. The State had other ways to attack the dying declaration. There was the suggestion that Williams was both intoxicated and highly medicated at the time of the statement. The State could have pursued these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>grounds, as was its right under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>806 (attacking and supporting credibility of hearsay declarant). We reverse because the basis of Dr. Kobus testimony did not satisfy the grounds for admissibility. We cannot permit the jury to draw an expert conclusion from evidence where the State\u2019s expert could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Although not raised at trial, we find defendant\u2019s related argument on the lack of a BWS expert-testimony jury instruction satisfies the plain error standard, <em>R. </em>2:10-2. This provides an additional basis to reverse. The judge gave the standard charge for experts. <em>See </em>Model Criminal Jury Charge: Expert Testimony. There was no mention of the special characteristics of BWS testimony in the jury charge. Because defense counsel did not submit a request to charge, <em>R. </em>1:8-7, or otherwise object to the charge, this alleged error requires reversal only if clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>1:7-2; <em>R. </em>2:10-2. We conclude it had that potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In <em>Ellis, </em>we held that the absence of a special jury instruction on BWS was plain error. We there discussed the limited uses of BWS evidence \u2014 to overcome the myth that a battered woman necessarily would leave her abuser \u2014 and then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">In the case before us, Dr. Kabus testified, based on what she was told by L.N., including all of the acts of abuse defendant allegedly inflicted on L.N. over the years, that the victim\u2019s failure to attempt an escape from defendant during the period of the abduction was consistent with someone who is suffering from Battered Woman\u2019s Syndrome. However, the court did not instruct the jury on the limited use of Dr. Kabus\u2019 testimony. The only instruction the judge gave the jury relating to Dr. Kabus concerned assessing her credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\"><em>[Ellis, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 544, 656 A.2d 25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">We compared <em>Ellis </em>to Judge Pressler\u2019s decision in <em>State v. W.L., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 650 A.2d 1035 (App.Div.1995), where we held that the trial judge\u2019s failure to provide a limiting instruction on Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS) evidence was reversible error. The <em>Ellis </em>court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">Similarly, the trial court erred in this case by failing to give the jury limiting instructions on the difference between substantive use and limited use of Dr. Kabus\u2019 testimony. The omission of limiting instructions was plain error since the jury certainly could have taken her testimony as evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt rather than the victim\u2019s credibility. Accordingly, this error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result,\u201d and reversal and remand is warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>[Ellis, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545, 656 A.2d 25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">If it was reversible error in <em>Ellis </em>not to give a jury instruction on BWS explaining that testimony\u2019s limited use where the subject was diagnosed with BWS, we conclude there is stronger reason to require a special instruction in this case. Here, the trial judge said he would admit the evidence only as \u201cgeneral information\u201d and wanted to avoid jury speculation that Williams had BWS. Under the teaching of <em>Ellis, </em>a specific jury instruction was necessary at minimum to explain the limited purposes for which the State could use the BWS testimony and to point out that Williams was not diagnosed with BWS. In its brief, the State suggests the requirement of a jury instruction depends on the alternative factual context of cases in which BWS evidence is used. However, the thrust of the BWS case authority is that this expert testimony is \u201climited use\u201d testimony, and that point must be made clear to the jury. Otherwise, there is substantial potential for misuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
