The driver and the owner of the other vehicle were insured by defendant, Arnica Mutual Insurance Co. On February 11, 2003, Arnica offered to settle Villanueva\u2019s claim against Arnica\u2019s insureds for the sum of $35,000, based upon its review of liability and damages and its erroneous belief that it had issued a liability policy with a $35,000 limit of coverage. Villanueva accepted the offer and signed a release which she returned on February 24, 2003. Arnica discovered shortly thereafter that it had made a mistake about its own policy limit, and that it actually issued a \u201climited\u201d policy that provided liability coverage of only $10,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Arnica promptly communicated its error to plaintiffs counsel, as evidenced in a letter dated March 11, 2003. It declined to comply with the original settlement agreement and instead offered $10,000 to settle Villanueva\u2019s claim against Arnica\u2019s insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Villanueva filed suit against Arnica, accurately alleging the procedural history and seeking to enforce the settlement agreement. Arnica\u2019s answer included these defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">3. The Defendant acted under a mistaken belief of facts regarding the actual amount of policy limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">4. The relief sought by the plaintiff would amount to unjust enrichment and is not enforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">6. The policy of insurance issued by this Defendant represents the full extent of all liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">7. Plaintiff has failed to show justifiable reliance on the mistaken offer of policy limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">9. In offering the full and actual limits of its policy to the plaintiff, this party has fully performed its obligation under the policy of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">After a hearing on the return date of plaintiffs Order to Show Cause, the Law Division judge issued judgment against Arnica, holding that <em>Dobbs v. New Amsterdam Cas. Co., </em>101 <em>N.J.L. </em>176, 127 <em>A. </em>209 (E. &amp; A.1925), was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and required enforcement of the settlement. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">We are convinced that the governing principle is to be found not in <em>Dobbs, </em>but in <em>Young v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>582, 194 A.2d 488 (App.Div.1963), and <em>Hamel v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super </em>502, 506-08, 559 A.2d 455 (App.Div. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\"><em>Young </em>involved an action to enforce a settlement promised by State Farm to a plaintiff injured by State Farm\u2019s insured. After obtaining the plaintiffs release in that case and issuing a check as promised, State Farm stopped payment when it discovered that its policy had actually expired a week before the accident at issue. Judge Conford, writing for this court, concluded that when a payment of insurance proceeds is induced by a mistake of fact, the insurer can rescind the settlement as long as the settling claimant would not be prejudiced thereby. <em>Young, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585-86, 194 A.2d 488. Because the plaintiff in <em>Young </em>had filed a notice of intention with the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Board pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-65, the plaintiff would \u201cstill enjoy satisfaction of his claim at the hands of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board\u201d in the event of a ruling in defendant\u2019s favor on remand. 80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 586, 194 A.2d 488. Summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff was reversed, and the matter was remanded for determination of \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the [insurer\u2019s] alleged mistake.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 587, 194 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In <em>Young, </em>Judge Conford followed the rationale of his earlier opinion in <em>Great American Ins. Co. v. Yellen, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 156 A.2d 36 (App.Div.1959). <em>Yellen </em>involved a first \u2014 party fire insurance claim that the insurer had rejected but later paid by mistake as a result of a clerical error. The opinion in <em>Yellen </em>stated the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">[O]ne who has paid money under a mistake of fact but for which payment would not have been made may have restitution from the payee notwithstanding that the mistake was unilateral and a consequence of the payor\u2019s negligence, <em>providing, however, that such restitution will not prejudice the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\"><em>[Yellen, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 244, 156 A.2d 36 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">An exception, not applicable here, exists \u201cwhere the insurance company deliberately elects to make payment of a claim on a policy although it is conscious that it does not know all the facts material to its liability to the payee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 156 A.2d 36. Judge Conford suggested in <em>Yellen </em>that <em>Dobbs </em>\u201cappealed] to be guided by the analogy of the binding effect of a compromise of a disputed claim notwithstanding mistake of fact by one of the compromising parties,\u201d in other words, that <em>Dobbs </em>might fit into that exception. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">In fact, <em>Dobbs </em>did not \u201cmention the mistake rule at all.\u201d <em>Young, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 586, 194 A.2d 488. Recognizing the public policy favoring enforceability of settlements, Judge Conford nonetheless referred to enforceability of the settlement in issue as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>subject to considerations \u201cas to the fairness and equity of the settlement\u201d ... [There is] nothing fair about enforcing a \u201csettlement\u201d agreed to by an insurance company when it was under the mistaken impression that it was on the risk when in fact it was not and when its immediate disavowal leaves the other party with all of his rights and remedies against the uninsured party fully intact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 586-87, 194 A.2d 488 (internal citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The judge\u2019s description of the circumstances involved in <em>Young </em>closely resembles the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">By contrast, in <em>Dobbs, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s insurance carrier initially offered to settle its insured\u2019s first-party claim for her employee\u2019s theft of cash and a ring from the insured\u2019s second home. After entering into a settlement and promising payment to its insured, the insurer determined that because the loss was not a burglary, it was not covered under the express terms of the insured\u2019s newly discovered, separate policy on this second home. The insurer then attempted to revoke its offer. With little analysis, the Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the trial judge\u2019s decision that the carrier was bound by the settlement, citing <em>Worcester Loom Co. v. Heald, 78 N.J.L. </em>172, 72 A. 421 (Sup.Ct.1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\"><em>Worcester Loom, </em>however, involved neither a mistake of fact nor an insurance claim. The plaintiff there merely sought to enforce an alleged oral agreement to compromise a contract dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That case stands for little more than the general proposition that an oral agreement to compromise a dispute can itself be an enforceable contract. <em>Id. </em>at 175, 72 A. 421; <em>see also Pascarella v. Bruck, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. 118, </em>124-25, 462 A.2d 186 (App.Div.), <em>certif. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>600, 468 A.2d 233 (1983). Thus the grounding of the <em>Dobbs </em>decision does not support its application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The application of equitable principles supports Arnica\u2019s claim. In its defense of plaintiffs suit, Arnica in effect sought rescission of the settlement agreement. We have held that where an insurance company pays a claim as a result of a unilateral mistake, restitution is an available remedy in the absence of detrimental reliance on the part of the payee. <em>Yellen, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 156 A.2d 36.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">In such circumstances, while the payee has been enriched mistakenly at the expense of the paying party, equity will not unfairly force the payee to disgorge any profit to where that would be to the payee\u2019s detriment. The burden of proving a change of circumstances or other inequities sufficient to bar restitution is upon the payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">[28 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 70:199 (Lord ed.1999) (citing <em>Yellen, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 156 A.2d 36) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">While an insurer\u2019s gross negligence in becoming aware of the coverage provided by its own policy may bar relief, even ordinary negligence will not, so long as the insurer has met its duty of good faith and fair dealing. 27 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 70:112 (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 157).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">The same principles logically govern where payment has not yet been made, that is, where the remedy sought for a unilateral mistake is rescission rather than restitution. In <em>Hamel v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 506-08, 559 A.2d 455 (App.Div.1989),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we discussed the remedy of rescission based upon unilateral mistake and listed the conditions required for such equitable relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">(1) the mistake must be of so great a consequence that to enforce the contract as actually made would be unconscionable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">(2) the matter as to which the mistake was made must relate to the material feature of the contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>(3) the mistake must have occurred notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable care by the party making the mistake, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">(4) it must be able to get relief by way of rescission without serious prejudice to the other party, except for loss of his bargain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\"><em>[Hamel v. Allstate Ins. Co. supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 507, 559 A.2d 455 (quoting <em>Conduit &amp; Foundation Corp. v. City of Atlantic City, </em>2 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 440, 64 A.2d 382 (Ch.Div.1949)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">There can be no question that Arnica\u2019s mistake respecting the policy limits was material to and an essential basis for the settlement offer. The key question is whether plaintiff has been unfairly prejudiced by being put back in the position she was in when she accepted the offer. In weighing the relative equities here, as we must, we find no indication in the record, the briefs, or the arguments of counsel that Arnica\u2019s conduct reflected anything other than simple negligence \u2014 an honest mistake discovered and communicated promptly to plaintiff \u2014 or that plaintiff has suffered any legal prejudice as a result of that mistake. Under these circumstances, it would be unconscionable to enforce that settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We were informed at oral argument that plaintiffs tort action against Arnica\u2019s insured is pending in the Law Division, that there is no statute of limitations problem in that action,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that plaintiff has underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage of $25,000. Obviously, plaintiff is disappointed at having an agreeable settlement disintegrate. But she has failed to demonstrate that she was in any worse position when she learned of the mistake than she would have been had Arnica recognized its $10,000 policy limit when it undertook settlement negotiations with her. Unlike <em>Young, </em>there is no question about the actual Arnica policy limit, and plaintiff has not alleged specific prejudice as a result of detrimental reliance. No material issue of fact remains to be resolved, and unlike <em>Young, </em>a remand is unwarranted. We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>verse the judgment in favor of Villanueva and dismiss her complaint against Arnica.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We have considered one additional question not raised by the parties: whether Arnica\u2019s insureds, whom Villanueva agreed to release in exchange for $35,000, and who are not parties to this action, will be prejudiced as a result of our decision. Because they apparently have not been placed on notice of Villanueva\u2019s action to enforce the settlement against Arnica, or of this appeal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is impossible for us to determine with certainty whether either insured has or will suffer legal prejudice as a result. Obviously, the continuation of Villanueva\u2019s tort action exposes one or both of them to a verdict in excess of Arnica\u2019s coverage. Arnica\u2019s insureds, however, were never entitled to coverage in excess of $10,000, and Arnica does not dispute its obligation to continue to provide a defense in Villanueva\u2019s tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Arnica is required to notify its insureds of our decision in this action. As defendants in Villanueva\u2019s negligence suit, their right to prove detrimental reliance upon the $35,000 settlement, if any, and if proven to seek an appropriate remedy against Arnica, is preserved for that action. <em>Compare Hamel, supra, </em>233 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 509, 559 A.2d 455. While we do not further address the question of prejudice to Arnica\u2019s insureds, we strongly suggest that even where there is no consent-to-settle provision in the policy, as there is not in a standard auto insurance policy, it behooves an insurer to place its own insured on notice of any settlement entered into on the insured\u2019s behalf, as well as any action to enforce or vacate such a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Reversed and remanded for entry of an order dismissing plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-13\"> <em>N.J.SA. </em>39:6A-3.1c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> The decision was conditioned on the insurer\u2019s waiving the statute of limitations on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\"> <em>Worcester Loom </em>was an appeal from judgment entered on a jury verdict. The parties' original contract provided for the plaintiff \"to use its best endeavors to design, construct or reconstruct and perfect a loom,\" and for the defendants to pay for the work at agreed hourly rates. The issue for the jury was whether the parties had subsequently reached an enforceable oral agreement that in exchange for the defendants\u2019 prompt payment of a disputed bill under the original agreement, \"plaintiff would, at its own expense, perfect the loom and make it work.\u201d <em>Worcester Loom, supra, </em>78 <em>NJ.L. </em>at 173, 72 <em>A. </em>421. The jury concluded that the plaintiff had made such an agreement, and the court therefore dismissed plaintiff's claim for payment of an additional invoice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-13\"> In <em>Hamel, </em>an injured party\u2019s attorney mistakenly provided a signed release to the tortfeasor's carrier without the consent of the injured party's UIM carrier, and without realizing that doing so would destroy the carrier's subrogation claim and thus the injured party\u2019s UIM claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> We have some concern, however, with counsel\u2019s indication during oral argument that the Law Division in the tort action has not been apprised of this matter as it relates to readiness for trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> Counsel for both parties to this appeal informed us at oral argument that to their knowledge, the defendants in the auto negligence case have not been given notice of this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
