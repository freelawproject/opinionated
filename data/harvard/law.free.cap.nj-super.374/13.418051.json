Plaintiff is a material supplier that is owed money from Mastro Masonry Contractors, the project masonry subcontractor, for materials plaintiff supplied to Mastro for the project. Consequently, plaintiff sued Mastro, Ernest Bock and Sons, the general contractor, and XL Specialty Insurance Company, the company that issued the payment and performance bond for the project. Mastro is out of business and was never served with the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The primary issue on appeal concerns plaintiffs right to seek payment under the bond. To be so entitled, the Bond Act requires a person to either have a \u201cdirect contract\u201d with the general contractor fiirnishing the bond, or otherwise provide the general contractor with written notice of the person\u2019s intent to become a beneficiary under the bond. Plaintiff acknowledges it did not provide Bock with written notice of its intent to become a beneficiary under the bond; but, plaintiff asserts that a joint checking agreement (the Agreement) it entered into with Bock and Mastro serves as the \u201cdirect contract\u201d required by the Bond Act to qualify plaintiff as a beneficiary and assert a claim for payment under the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge William Todd found that the Agreement did not constitute a \u201cdirect contract\u201d under the Bond Act. The judge also concluded that plaintiff failed to prove its claim for breach of contract against Bock. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The facts are not in dispute. In January 2001, Bock and the Atlantic County Special Services School District entered into a contract for the construction of the school. XL Specialty issued the payment and performance bond. In February 2001, Bock and Mastro executed a purchase order; Mastro was to provide labor, material, and equipment \u201cto complete all unit masonry and unit pavers.\u201d Mastro, in turn, requested a quote from plaintiff for materials and supplies for the job. As a condition to supplying the materials, plaintiff requested that the parties enter into a joint checking agreement, a \u201cprocedure frequently ... done ... with general contractors ... subcontractors, and suppliers.\u201d In fact, plaintiff had such an agreement when working with Mastro on at least two previous jobs. A Bock representative prepared the Agreement. It said, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">In consideration that <em>Dial Block Co., Inc </em>(Supplier), will supply material to <em>Mastro Masonry </em>(Subcontractor), for installation at the <em>Atlantic County Special Services School </em>in accordance with the Subcontractor\u2019s Contract Agreement, Ernest Bock &amp; Sons, Inc., (General Contractor), hereby agrees that the said materials will be paid for by check(s) made payable jointly to the Supplier and Subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Total material cost is not to exceed <em>$125,000.00.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Plaintiffs controller, Barry Pflum, understood that the Agreement did not obligate plaintiff to provide Mastro with materials, and neither Mastro nor Bock were required to order \u201ceach and every item from [plaintiff].\u201d According to Pflum, the purpose of the $125,000 limit was to protect Bock\u2019s \u201cinterest and [Bock\u2019s] interest alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Approximately fourteen months later, Pflum wrote to Bock\u2019s vice president, Anthony DePascale, and informed him that the cost of materials supplied by plaintiff had \u201cfar exceeded\u201d the $125,000 limit. By that time, plaintiff had already supplied Mastro with more than $300,000 in supplies. Pflum requested that the Agreement be amended to raise the cap to $500,000. DePascale rejected Pflum\u2019s request \u201cdue to cost overruns by Mastro Masonry on this project.\u201d DePascale acknowledged that Bock had \u201cexceeded the initial joint check amount,\u201d but explained that Bock had done so because the company \u201cfelt it was in all of our best interests] to continue joint payments to minimize both our exposure.\u201d According to DePascale, Mastro had \u201ccommitted to [Bock] that they will continue to make payments to their vendors given this circumstance.\u201d Finally, DePascale said: \u201cIt would be in your best interest to contact Mastro and make the necessary arrangements.\u201d Plaintiff continued to supply materials to Mastro.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In response to the letter, Pflum stated that if plaintiff did not receive the sum due under its regular payment schedule, $44,728.86, it would stop supplying materials to Mastro. Pflum also asked DePascale for the name, address, and telephone number of Bock\u2019s bonding company. When plaintiff did not receive the payment, it stopped \u201cservicing\u201d Mastro. On August 8, 2002, plaintiff asserted a claim under the bond for $65,840.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">In total, Bock issued $347,602.53 in joint checks to plaintiff and Mastro. At some point, well after the $125,000 cap was reached, Bock stopped issuing joint checks and paid Mastro directly so Mastro could meet its payroll. Bock paid Mastro in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Against this factual background, we turn to whether the Agreement constituted a \u201cdirect contract\u201d within the plain meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-145. If it did, plaintiff could seek payment under the bond without otherwise notifying Bock that plaintiff was a beneficiary of the bond. That statute says, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Any person who may be a beneficiary of the payment bond, as defined in this article, and who does not have a <em>direct contract </em>with the contractor furnishing the bond shall, prior to commencing any work, provide written notice to the contractor by certified mail or otherwise, provided that he shall have proof of delivery of same, that said person is a beneficiary of the bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\"><em>[N.J.SA </em>2A.-44-145 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The motion judge determined that the Agreement was not a \u201cdirect contract.\u201d In a thorough and well-reasoned decision, he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">First question. What\u2019s a direct contract? That term, direct contract, is right there in the statute. It has to mean something. It\u2019s subject to interpretation. It\u2019s obviously not any contract, because if it was any contract it wouldn\u2019t need the word \u201cdirect.\u201d My sense is that ... a [joint checking agreement] like that at issue here is simply not enough. In simple terms, it seems to me that what\u2019s at issue is the question of some essential operative arrangement involving the fundamental work to be done between the two parties in question like an agreement to actually construct the property or an agreement to supply materials for the property, and it seems to me appropriate to treat the [Agreement] as something that is relatively incidental to that particularly in the context of a statute that\u2019s dealing with, on the face of things, this particular type of contracting problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">I think the same is true with respect to the notice issue. Again, the statute is very specific [in its] terms. To paraphrase it slightly, the obligation, if you don\u2019t have a direct contract, is to provide written notice that the person is a beneficiary of the bond. Obviously, that\u2019s easy to do if you want to do it. Write a letter that says I\u2019m a beneficiary of a bond, and it just seems quite clear to me that the statute contemplates that something fairly specific directed to this issue would be presented, that the fact that an entity is involved in the most general sense in a construction project by itself isn\u2019t sufficient to satisfy the intent of this statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">The result is that I don\u2019t believe there is any ... legitimate or reasonable way to treat the plaintiff as having a direct contract with Bock or to conclude on this record that the plaintiff provided the type of written notice required by the statute which means that the bond claim would fail as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">The court also dismissed plaintiffs non-Bond Act contract claims against Bock. The judge said: \u201cthe law with respect to those claims requires an inquiry into the plaintiffs reasonable expectation of compensation, and on this record I don\u2019t think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>there is any reasonable way one could interpret the plaintiff as having a reasonable expectation of payment directly from ... Bock.\u201d In short, the court found no basis for plaintiff to believe that Bock would pay it in the event that Mastro defaulted; Bock\u2019s joint check obligation was otherwise limited to the $125,000 cap in the Agreement, and Bock satisfied that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The trial court must grant summary judgment when the evidence \u201cis so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146, 156 (1995)(intemal quotation omitted). On appeal, we apply the same standard as the trial court to determine whether the grant or denial of a summary judgment motion was correct. <em>Kopin v. Orange Prods., Inc., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 366, 688 A.2d 130, 136 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>409, 694 A.2d 194 (1997). On matters of law, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference, <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Township Comm. of Township of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230, 1237 (1995), and a decision that is based upon a misinterpretation of the law must be reversed. <em>Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123, 136, 527 A.2d 1368, 1375 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">When we interpret <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:44-145 to determine if the Agreement is a \u201cdirect contract\u201d within its meaning, our \u201coverriding goal\u201d is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent underlying its enactment. <em>Brodsky v. Grinnell Haulers, Inc., </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>102, 109, 853 A.2d 940, 944 (2004); <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety v. Gonzalez, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>618, 627, 667 A.2d 684, 689 (1995). To do so, we first examine the statute\u2019s plain language, which is the \u201cclearest indication of that intent.\u201d <em>Med. Soc\u2019y of N.J. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>18, 26, 575 A.2d 1348, 1353 (1990). \u201cIf the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face and admits of only one interpretation, we need delve no deeper than the act\u2019s literal terms to divine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 226, 445 A.2d 399, 402 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>When a statute is silent on an issue, \u201c[a] well-established tenet of statutory construction is that a statute should be construed sensibly and in furtherance of the underlying legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Thomas Group, Inc. v. Wharton Sr. Citizen Hous., Inc., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>507, 517, 750 A.2d 743, 748-49 (2000) (Construction Lien Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44A-1 to -38, silent on interaction between statute and contractual retainage clauses); <em>accord Franklin Tower One, L.L.C. v. N.M., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>602, 613, 725 A.2d 1104, 1110 (1999) (when construing statute, judicial role is to give effect to legislative intent). When both parties have competing interests in how the statute is interpreted, the reviewing court\u2019s \u201ctask is to fashion protections for both interests, if it can reasonably be done, within the four corners of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Thomas Group, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 518-19, 750 A.2d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Here, the term \u201cdirect contract\u201d is not defined in the statute, and the parties\u2019 interests are not merely competing, but are mutually exclusive. Either the Agreement is a direct contract, or it is not. We conclude, as did the motion judge, that a sensible construction of the statute establishes that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The purpose of the Bond Act is to protect material suppliers (among others) that work on public projects from a general contractor\u2019s insolvency. <em>Velez v. Wilkerson Elec. Servs., Inc., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>2, 8, 796 A.2d 919, 923 (App.Div.2002). The Bond Act was amended in 1996 to add the language that is the subject of the instant dispute. <em>See L. </em>1996, c. 81. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-145 now provides that a \u201cperson who ... does not have a <em>direct contract </em>with the contractor furnishing the bond shall, prior to commencing any work, provide written notice to the contractor ... that said person is a beneficiary of the bond.\u201d (emphasis added). One of the goals of the amendment \u201cwas to clearly define the risk assumed by the surety issuing the bond.\u201d <em>Velez, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 10, 796 A.2d at 925 (citing the Sponsor Statement to A-1034, adopted June 17, 1996). The amendment identified potential beneficiaries under the bond by requiring a written notice prior to commencement of the work. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 796 A.2d at 925. As Judge Hoens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>then sitting in the Law Division, explained in <em>Laborers Local Union </em># <em>779 Pension, Welfare, and Annuityfunds v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>345, 351-52, 771 A.2d 712, 716 (Law Div.2000), \u201c[o]ne of the significant goals of the [1996 amendments] was the reduction of uncertainties concerning claims and claimants which plagued the construction industry and, by extension, the surety industry.\u201d The amended provision \u201cserved ... to identify potential claimants and beneficiaries in a uniform and organized fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 771 A.2d at 716; <em>accord Velez, supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 10, 796 A.2d at 925 (observing that \u201cone of the goals of the 1996 amendments to the Bond Act was to clearly define the risk assumed by the surety issuing the bond\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In the context of this legal framework, we examine the meaning of the term \u201cdirect contract.\u201d Neither <em>Velez </em>nor <em>Laborers </em># <em>779 </em>addressed this issue. Indeed, no New Jersey case has discussed whether a joint check agreement constitutes a \u201cdirect contract\u201d for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-145. But, we need not write on a clean slate. A federal statute, the Miller Act, 40 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3131-3134, is considered \u201cthe federal analogue of our Bond Act.\u201d <em>Unadilla Silo Co., Inc. v. Hess Bros., Inc., </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>268, 282, 586 A.2d 226, 233 (1991); <em>see also Morris County Indus. Park v. Thomas Nicol Co., </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>522, 531, 173 A.2d 414, 419 (1961) (referring to Miller Act as \u201ccomparable federal statute\u201d); <em>W. Bank Oil, Inc. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>56, 63, 500 A.2d 32, 36 (App.Div.1985) (characterizing Miller Act as \u201cFederal equivalent of New Jersey\u2019s Bond Act\u201d). Accordingly, we look to federal cases interpreting the Miller Act for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The Miller Act provides a method for suppliers and contractors to protect themselves from uncertainty as to payment. <em>See U.S. ex rel. Light &amp; Power Utils. Corp. v. Liles Constr. Co., Inc., </em>440 F.2d 474, 478 (5th Cir.1971). The \u201cstatute specifically requires formal notice, in writing.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Though worded somewhat differently from the Bond Act, the Miller Act speaks of a \u201cdirect contractual relationship,\u201d just as the Bond Act requires a \u201cdirect contract,\u201d between the general contractor and the person seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to become a beneficiary under the bond. Specifically, 40 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 3133(b)(2) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">A person having a <em>direct contractual relationship </em>with a subcontractor but no contractual! relationship, express or implied, with a contractor furnishing the payment bond may bring a civil action on the payment bond on giving written notice to thexeontractor within 90 days from the date on which the person did or performed theXjast of^he labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material for which the claim is made, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Under this statute, federal courts have construed a joint checking arrangement, such as the one at issue here, as not constituting a \u201cdirect contractual relationship.\u201d <em>See e.g., U.S. ex rel. St. Elec. Supply Co., Inc. v. Hesselden Constr. Co., </em>404 <em>F.</em>2d 774, 777 (10th Cir.1968). The facts in <em>Hesselden </em>are analogous to those in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The United States contracted with Hesselden for the construction of a school. <em>Id. </em>at 775. Travelers Indemnity Company issued the payment bond. <em>Ibid. </em>Hesselden subcontracted the electrical work to Fulkerson Electric Company, and Fulkerson contracted with the plaintiff, State Electric Supply, to provide materials for the project. <em>Ibid. </em>When State stopped delivering materials to the site because Fulkerson was not paying its bills, Hesselden and State entered into a joint check agreement; Hesselden agreed to issue joint checks to Fulkerson and State. <em>Ibid. </em>Shortly thereafter, Fulkerson filed for bankruptcy while owing State money. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The District Court found that the general contractor\u2019s agreement to make all future payments by joint checks to Fulkerson and State, and State\u2019s agreement to continue supplying materials to Fulkerson, did not create the type of direct contractual agreement contemplated by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 777. The Tenth Circuit agreed. It reasoned that because Hesselden did not agree to be responsible for payment for the materials the plaintiff supplied, the agreement was not tantamount to the direct contractual relationship required by the Miller Act. <em>Ibid. </em>The agreement merely obligated Hesselden to \u201cmake further payments by joint checks.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Other federal court opinions are in accord. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>e.g., Maccaferri Gabions, Inc. v. Dynateria, Inc., </em>91 <em>F.</em>3d 1431, 1438 n. 6 (11th Cir.1996) (joint check arrangement did not create direct contractual relationship between general contractor and materialman under Miller Act), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>1167, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1430, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>539 (1997); <em>Light &amp; Power, supra, </em>440 <em>F.2d </em>at 478 (same); <em>U.S. ex rel. Metal Mfg., Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>656 <em>F.Supp. </em>1194, 1198 (D.Ariz.1987) (same); <em>U.S. ex rel. Fordham v. P.W. Parker, Inc., </em>504 <em>F.Supp. </em>1066, 1069-71 (D.Md.1980) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The same reasoning, when applied here, leads to the same conclusion. Plaintiff wanted to ensure it would be paid by Mastro, so, as it had done in the past, it requested the general contractor to issue joint checks to itself and Mastro. It was for that purpose that Bock agreed to issue joint cheeks; at no time did Bock agree to become obligated to pay plaintiff for the materials plaintiff supplied to Mastro. The joint checks represented the money due from Bock to Mastro, not from Bock to plaintiff. Said another way, the direct contract \u2014 to provide materials for the construction project \u2014 was between plaintiff and Mastro, not between plaintiff and Bock. For this reason, no \u201cdirect contract\u201d was created between plaintiff and Bock within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-145.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">This construction of the term \u201cdirect contract\u201d is consistent with the plain language of the Bond Act. We agree with the Law Division that a \u201cdirect contract\u201d must mean more than just any contract. Otherwise, the term \u201cdirect\u201d would have no meaning. Statutes should not be read to render a term completely meaningless. <em>State v. Malik, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 278, 839 A.2d 67, 74 (App.Div.2003), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>354, 851 A.2d 648 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In the absence of such a \u201cdirect contract,\u201d plaintiff was required to give written notice of its status as a beneficiary of the performance bond before it commenced work. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:44-145. The notice must provide \u201cthat said person is a beneficiary of the bond.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff concedes it failed to provide such a written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Plaintiff argues, however, that even though it did not comply with the literal language of the notice provision of the statute, by entering into the Agreement with plaintiff, Bock was placed on notice that plaintiff was supplying materials to the job site, thus satisfying a purpose of the Bond Act \u2014 to notify the general contractor, and consequently the surety, that a person may be submitting a claim under the bond. Although that argument has some surface appeal, it is not convincing for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">First, the Bond Act specifically calls for <em>written </em>notice to the general contractor that the person is a beneficiary of the bond. The Legislature could have provided for another form of notice, but it chose not to. The statutory language is clear on its face. Second, under the Miller Act, the federal analogue to the Bond Act, the cases have rejected any notice other than a written notice. <em>See Maccaferri Gabions, supra, </em>91 F.3d at 1437-38; <em>Light &amp; Power, supra, </em>440 <em>F.</em>2d at 478; <em>Hesselden, supra, </em>404 <em>F.</em>2d at 777. Third, and most significantly, only with a written notice will the uncertainties of who may file a claim under the bond be removed; potential claimants are identified in an organized and uniform fashion, fostering the goal of the 1996 amendments to the Bond Act. <em>See Laborers </em># <em>779, supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 351-52, 771 A.2d at 716-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The requirements to provide notice under the Bond Act are not harsh. All a person seeking to become a beneficiary under the payment bond need do is give written notice of that intent to the contractor before starting work. Plaintiff failed to do so. Consequently, plaintiff has no claim to the performance bond under the Bond Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Finally, we address plaintiffs contract claims. Plaintiff argues that the Agreement was modified by the parties\u2019 conduct. We reject this claim for two reasons. First, Bock never agreed, expressly or implicitly, to be responsible for paying for the materials plaintiff delivered to Mastro. Bock only agreed to issue joint checks \u2014 the checks represented money Bock owed to Mastro. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Second, Bock only agreed to issue the checks up to $125,000. Bock fulfilled that obligation. When plaintiff requested an upward modification, after Bock had already fully performed, Bock declined, and suggested that plaintiff deal directly with Mastro.
