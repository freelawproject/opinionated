During the plea colloquy, the trial judge indicated that defendant\u2019s sentence exposure would be five years and three months in custody:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">THE COURT: But I told your attorney that if you want to do that and you want to plead guilty, because you have no prior indictable convictions, what I would do is if I accept the plea, I would give you four years on this case that the jury has before it right now and on the second indictment, on the third degree, I\u2019ll give you four years, on the fourth degree, I\u2019ll give you fifteen months but the fifteen months will run consecutive to the four years. So you\u2019ll end up with five years and three months; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">THE COURT: So the four will run concurrent to this four and the fifteen months will be consecutive for a total of five years and three months; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Defendant was subsequently sentenced to a term of fifteen months on the criminal sexual contact charge, to a consecutive four-year term on the endangering the welfare of a child count of the same indictment, and to a four-year term for the promoting obscene material charge on which defendant was being tried at the time of the plea, to be served concurrent to the fifteen-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge stated at the time of the sentencing that the \u201ctotal sentence here today is five years and 3 months in State Prison.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On defendant\u2019s appeal on the sentence oral argument calendar, we concluded \u201cthat the sentence is not manifestly excessive or unduly punitive and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d We added, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Pursuant to the agreement between the State and the Public Defender, as defendant has raised the constitutional argument of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>403 (2004), the matter is postponed until a later date for disposition after full briefing on a regular calendar. The Clerk of the Appellate Division shall designate the briefing schedule to be followed by the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Defendant now argues that the \u201cimposition of consecutive prison terms above the presumptive violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to trial by jury and due process of law.\u201d We summarily reject defendant\u2019s contention that the imposition of consecutive sentences violates the principles of <em>Blakely. See State v. Natale, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 238, 861 A.2d 148 (App.Div.2004); <em>State v. Abdullah, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 281, 858 A.2d 19 (App.Div. 2004), <em>certif. granted, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>208, 863 A.2d 365 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the fifteen-month sentence, six above the presumptive term for a fourth-degree crime, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6a(4); 2C:44-lf(e), is unconstitutional. In <em>Blakely, </em>defendant entered into a plea agreement under which he pled guilty to the reduced charge of second-degree kidnapping. \u201cPursuant to the plea agreement, the State recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>mended a sentence within the standard range of 49 to 53 months. [H]owever, the judge rejected the State\u2019s recommendation and imposed an exceptional sentence of 90 months \u2014 37 months beyond the standard maximum.\u201d <em>Blakely, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at\u2014, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2535. In vacating the sentence imposed in violation of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to jury trial, a majority- of the United States Supreme Court noted that \u201cthe facts supporting that finding were neither admitted by petitioner nor found by a jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at\u2014, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537, and further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">Our precedents make clear, however, that the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi[ v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, <em>120 </em>S.Ct. <em>2348, 147 L.Ed.2d </em>435 (2000) ] purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant____In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose without any additional findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(Citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\"><em>See also United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-,-, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>738, 749, 756, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-,-,-(2005) (opinion of the Court by Stevens, J., applying <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines). The <em>Blakely </em>Court concluded that the sentencing judge in <em>Blakely </em>\u201ccould not have imposed the exceptional 90-month sentence solely on the basis of the facts admitted in the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">The Court continued, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">But nothing prevents a defendant from waiving his <em>Apprendi </em>rights. When a defendant pleads guilty, the State is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant either stipulates to the relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding. If appropriate waivers are procured, States may continue to offer judicial factfinding as a matter of course to all defendants who plead guilty. Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial factfinding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial. We do not understand how <em>Apprendi </em>can possibly work to the detriment of those who are free, if they think its costs outweigh its benefits, to render it inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-16\">Bargaining already exists with regard to sentencing factors because defendants can either stipulate or contest the facts that make them applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>[Blakely, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2541-42 (Citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We cannot conceive that the United States Supreme Court intended its <em>Blakely </em>principle to apply to this case in which the defendant \u2014 although not acknowledging aggravating factors beyond the \u201celements\u201d of the offenses \u2014 acknowledged exposure to the sixty-three-month sentence imposed in exchange for his waiver of trial by jury with respect to the matter on which the jury was then deliberating and to separate charges scheduled for trial the following week. <em>See also United States v. Booker, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 762-64, \u2014 L.Ed.2d at--(Breyer, J. opinion of the Court); <em>id., </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 772-76, \u2014 L.Ed.2d at---(Stevens, J. dissenting in part) (concerning impact of plea bargaining with respect to the need for <em>Booker </em>remedy). While the waiver in this case did not expressly include the authority of the judge to find aggravating factors, or an admission of those factors, we do not read <em>Blakely </em>to require vacation of the fifteen-month sentence for the fourth-degree crime because defendant expressly aeknowl\u00e9dged that that sentence and the sixty-three-month aggregate sentence could be imposed as part of his waiver of the right to trial by jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Accordingly, the judgment and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\"> The judge found that aggravating factors 3, 6 and 9 applied, that there were no mitigating factors, and \"that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh the non-existent mitigating factors.\" The defendant had three adult non-indictable convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\"> Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of sentence resulted in amended judgments. Ultimately the promoting obscene material was made concurrent to the criminal sexual contact count and the endangering conviction was made consecutive to the fifteen-month sentence. In any event there is no dispute that defendant received an aggregate sentence of sixty-three months based on the fifteen-month consecutive sentence for the fourth-degree crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-11\"> This is not the occasion to reconsider the remedy imposed by <em>State v. Natale, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 861 A.2d 148 (App.Div.2004), and determine whether the presumptive term in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44\u2014 lf(l) should be severed or read to be advisory. <em>See United States v. Booker, supra </em>(majority opinion of Breyer, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
