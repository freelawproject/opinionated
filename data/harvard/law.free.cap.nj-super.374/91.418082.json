After his motion to suppress was denied, defendant entered a negotiated guilty plea. <em>See R. </em>3:5 \u2014 T(d). Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to three years probation conditioned on serving 180 days in the county jail on weekends. Defendant was also required to earn his high school equivalency diploma while on probation and complete an outpatient drug and alcohol treatment program. Appropriate penalties were also imposed, as well as a six-month driver\u2019s license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">In this appeal, defendant challenges the validity of a search, which led to discovery of the drugs forming the basis of his conviction. We conclude that the search was illegal and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">We set out the facts developed at the suppression motion hearing. In doing so we note that the motion judge found the State\u2019s witness, Patrolman Douglas Whitten of the Lower Township Police Department, to be credible. The judge\u2019s determination in that regard, based on hearing and observing the officer in person, is binding on us. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">On June 30, 2002, at about 3:20 p.m., Whitten, a nine-year veteran of the Department, was in his patrol car in the area of defendant\u2019s residence on Seashore Road responding to a report of a stolen vehicle. The vehicle was described as a green Mercury Cougar. Mr. and Mrs. Sanfillipo had reported that the vehicle had been stolen by their daughter, Dana, earlier in the day, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>defendant, the daughter\u2019s boyfriend, might also be in the vehicle. Whitten also knew that Upper Township had issued an active warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest based on defendant\u2019s failure to appear for court dates. At the time, Whitten was not aware of the underlying charge, which led to the failure-to-appear warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Whitten waited across the street from defendant\u2019s residence and observed a green Mercury Cougar pulling out of the driveway. A young woman, later identified as Dana Sanfillipo, was driving the vehicle and defendant was sitting in the front passenger seat. In addition to Sanfillipo and defendant, a juvenile male was seated in the rear passenger seat. After waiting for the vehicle to pull onto Seashore Road and head southbound, Whitten conducted a motor vehicle stop of the vehicle. Sergeant Jack Beers assisted Whitten on the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Whitten approached the driver\u2019s side and asked Sanfillipo for her driver\u2019s license, as well as the registration and insurance card for the vehicle, while Beers asked defendant to exit the vehicle on the passenger side. At that point, defendant was arrested on the outstanding warrant and handcuffed. It took Beers a couple of minutes to arrest defendant and place him in the rear seat of Whitten\u2019s patrol car, which was parked behind the Mercury Cougar.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">After defendant was placed in the patrol car, Whitten asked Sanfillipo to exit the vehicle and go to the back of the car so that he could speak to her off the side of the road. During the course of Whitten\u2019s conversation with Sanfillipo, which took place at the back of the Mercury and consumed less than five minutes, Sanfillipo asked to give defendant a kiss. Sanfillipo also asked if she could retrieve defendant\u2019s clothing out of the vehicle, but Whitten told her to stay where she was and that he would get it. Whitten would not let Sanfillipo enter the vehicle to get defendant\u2019s clothes because allowing her to do so could jeopardize the officers\u2019 safety. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>As Whitten went to retrieve defendant\u2019s clothing from the front passenger seat area, and throughout the search that ensued, the juvenile remained in the back seat of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Whitten went to the front passenger side of the vehicle, where the door was still open, and picked up defendant\u2019s clothes, which were lying on the floorboard in front of the passenger seat. Underneath the clothing was a New Jersey Bell or Verizon phone book, and lying on top of that was \u201csome green vegetation and stems\u201d that Whitten believed to be marijuana. In the course of his nine years of experience, Whitten had seen mariguana before. Aside from the vegetation, Whitten also spotted an opened box of \u201cPhilly\u201d blunt cigars on the rear passenger floor in front of the rear occupant, which contributed to his belief that the vegetation on the phone book was marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">After making these observations, Whitten retrieved a pair of blue denim shorts that were located behind the front passenger seat. A softball-sized baggie was rolled up inside the shorts. Inside this bag was an additional baggie, and inside of that were several different items, including a clear plastic baggie with a white powdery substance inside, a small electronic scale with a tray that had some white residue on it, and several different types of small, glassine baggies. Based on his training and experience, Whitten suspected that the white powdery substance was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Whitten then asked the juvenile to step out of the vehicle and continued to search the passenger compartment. Whitten discovered a larger baggie with green vegetation in it, which he suspected to be marijuana, wedged in between one of the rear seats and the door. Both Sanflllipo and the juvenile passenger denied ownership of the suspected cocaine and marijuana found in the car. Sanflllipo told Whitten that the shorts might belong to her brother, who occasionally used the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">After gathering the evidence, Whitten charged all the occupants with CDS-possession-related offenses. Whitten did not charge anyone in relation to the stolen vehicle report, because Sanflllipo\u2019s parents \u2014 who arrived at the scene after Whitten had searched the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>vehicle and seized the contraband \u2014 told him they were content with getting their car back and did not want to press charges.</p>\n<p id=\"AaO\">We begin with the settled rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">any warrantless search is <em>prima facie </em>invalid and gains validity only if it comes within one of the specific exceptions created by the Supreme Court. The requirement that a search warrant be obtained before evidence may be seized is not lightly to be dispensed with, and the burden is on the State, as the party seeking to validate a warrantless search, to bring it within one of those recognized exceptions. [State <em>v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211, 230, 440 A.2d 1311 (1981) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In this case, defendant addresses a number of search exceptions in his brief,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the State defends only on the basis of the search incident to arrest exception, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">That doctrine saw its modern genesis in <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>752, 762-63, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685, 694 (1969), in which the United States Supreme Court held that when an arrest is made, the arresting officer has the right to search not only the person arrested but \u201cthe area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d at 694. The permitted area of search thus includes the area within the arrestee\u2019s \u201c \u2018immediate control\u2019 \u2014 construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As we said in <em>State v. Rose, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 104, 813 A.2d 1279 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>429, 824 A.2d 158 (2003), \u201ca search incident to a valid arrest must be limited to the person arrested and the areas within his reach or [grabbable] area.\u201d While the rule as originally stated may have seemed clear, its application to a variety of circumstances was not, particularly where the individual arrested was in an automobile. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>See </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>\u00a7 7.1(a) (3d ed.1996). As a result, seeking to establish a bright-line rule to guide police officers, the Supreme Court extended <em>Chimel </em>beyond its apparent stated purpose and held that when the police have \u201cmade a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, [they] may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile\u201d as well as \u201cthe contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment, for if the passenger compartment is within reach of the arrestee, so also will containers in it be within his reach.\u201d <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>454, 460, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2860, 2864, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>768, 775 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Prior to <em>Belton, </em>our Court had rejected the search of the passenger compartment of an automobile as incident to an arrest for illegal gambling on the basis that the area searched was not within the \u201cimmediate control\u201d of the arrestee, who was handcuffed in the patrol car. <em>State v. Welsh, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>346, 350, 354-55, 419 A.2d 1123 (1980). In <em>Alston, supra, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 235 n. 15, 440 A.2d 1311, the Court noted that the outcome in <em>Welsh </em>would likely not be the same under the rationale of <em>Belton, </em>which had just been recently decided. However, finding that the search in <em>Alston </em>could be sustained under the automobile exception, the Court left \u201cto future consideration the question of the continued viability of our analysis of the scope of the <em>Chimel </em>exception as expressed in <em>Welsh.\u201d Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">It was not until <em>State v. Pierce, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>184, 642 A.2d 947 (1994), that the Court finally addressed <em>Belton </em>in a comprehensive manner, in the context of a search of the passenger compartment of a vehicle following the arrest of the driver for operating the vehicle with a suspended license. After tracing the evolution of the search incident to arrest exception from dictum in <em>Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. </em>383, 392, 34 <em>S.Ct. </em>341, 344, 58 <em>L.Ed. </em>652, 655 (1914), to <em>Belton, </em>the Court took note of widespread scholarly criticism of <em>Belton, </em>as well as a minority of state court decisions from other jurisdictions rejecting or modifying the <em>Belton </em>rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>under state constitutional provisions. <em>Pierce, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 196-203, 642 A.2d 947. Applying the greater protection afforded by our State Constitution against unreasonable searches and seizures, <em>id. </em>at 208-09, 642 A.2d 947, the Court rejected <em>Belton </em>\u201cinsofar as it purports to authorize vehicular searches indiscriminately based only on contemporaneous arrests for motor-vehicle violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209-10, 642 A.2d 947. As a result, the Court saw no need to address the broader applicability of <em>Belton </em>under our State Constitution, noting that \u201cthe issue is significant enough to warrant additional briefing and argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 642 A.2d 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In a concurring opinion, Justice Handler, speaking for Justice Garibaldi and himself, expressed the view that \u201c[bjecause <em>Belton </em>applies <em>Chimel, </em>and does not purport to alter <em>Chimel, </em>it in no way obviates the requirement that the searched area actually be within the immediate control of the arrestee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 642 A.2d 947 (Handler, J., concurring). The evidence in <em>Pierce, </em>he said, \u201csuggests that the search occurred after the arrest of the driver had been completed by his physical restraint and actual removal to the patrol car and, therefore, was not contemporaneous with the arrest of the driver, and that the area searched, the van, was no longer within the physical control of the arrestee.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Being \u201cpersuaded by the <em>Belton </em>Court\u2019s stated intention not to alter <em>Chimel </em>that the concept of control must still have real meaning and be applied in light of surrounding circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 219, 642 A.2d 947, Justice Handler found the <em>Pierce </em>search \u201cinvalid, under both <em>Belton </em>and <em>Chimel, </em>for the straightforward and narrow reason that it was not a \u2018contemporaneous\u2019 incident of the arrest and the passenger compartment was no longer within the \u2018immediate control\u2019 of [the driver] once he had been physically restrained and removed and placed in the patrol car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 642 A.2d 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Other than being a bright-line rule, the <em>Belton </em>extension of <em>Chimel </em>has little to commend it. LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.1(c). It is difficult to fathom how a search of a vehicle\u2019s interior can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>justified on the ground that it is within the area into which an arrestee might reach for weapons or to hide or destroy evidence, when the person arrested is out of the vehicle and securely under police control.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Indeed, a number of Supreme Court Justices have recently expressed varying degrees of misgiving about the <em>Belton </em>rule. In <em>Thornton v. United States, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>615, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2127, 158 L.Ed.2d 905 (2004), a police officer made the determination to pull over defendant\u2019s car based on information that the license tags did not match the vehicle to which they were affixed. <em>Id. </em>at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2129, 158 L.Ed.2d at 911. However, as the patrol car pulled in behind him, but before the officer could effectuate a stop, defendant pulled into a parking lot and left his car. <em>Ibid. </em>The officer detained, questioned and patted down Thornton, revealing drugs for which he was arrested and placed in the patrol car. <em>Ibid. </em>A subsequent search of the car revealed a gun. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court concluded that the arrest of a \u201crecent occupant\u201d of an automobile permits the type of search authorized by <em>Belton, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">To be sure, not all contraband in the passenger compartment is likely to be readily accessible to a \u201crecent occupant.\u201d It is unlikely in this case that petitioner could have reached under the driver\u2019s seat for his gun once he was outside of his automobile. But the firearm and the passenger compartment in general were no more inaccessible than were the contraband and the passenger compartment in <em>Belton. </em>The need for a clear rule, readily understood by police officers and not depending on differing estimates of what items were or were not within reach of an arrestee at any particular moment, justifies the sort of generalization which <em>Belton </em>enunciated. Once an officer determines that there is probable cause to make an arrest, it is reasonable to allow officers to ensure their safety and to preserve evidence by searching the entire passenger compartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2132, <em>158 L.Ed.2d </em>at 914.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Justices Scalia and Ginsburg, concurring, expressed what could only be charitably described as extreme reservations about the <em>Belton </em>rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">The popularity of the practice [of securing arrestees before searching the car] is not hard to fathom. If <em>Belton </em>entitles an officer to search a vehicle upon arresting the driver despite having taken measures that eliminate any danger, what rational officer would not take those measures? <em>Cf. </em>Moskovitz, <em>A Rule in Search of a Reason: An Empirical Reexamination of Chimel and Belton, </em>2002 Wis. L.Rev. 657, 665-666 (citing police training materials). If it was ever true that the passenger compartment is \u201cin fact generally, even if not inevitably,\u201d within the arrestee\u2019s immediate control at the time of the search, 453 <em>U.S. </em>at 460, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2860, it certainly is not true today. As one judge has put it: \u201c[I In our search for clarity, we have now abandoned our constitutional moorings and floated to a place where the law approves of purely exploratory searches of vehicles during which officers with no definite objective or reason for the search are allowed to rummage around in a car to see what they might find.\u201d <em>[United States v.] McLaughlin, </em>[170 F.3d 889,] 894 [ (9th Cir.1999) ](Trott, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\"><em>[Thornton, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2135, 158 L.Ed.2d at 918 (Scalia, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Urging the Supreme Court to \u201cbe honest\u201d about the basis for following <em>Belton, </em>Justice Scalia noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\"><em>Belton </em>cannot reasonably be explained as a mere application of <em>Chimel. </em>Rather, it is a return to the broader sort of search incident to arrest that we allowed before <em>Chimel </em>\u2014 limited, of course, to searches of motor vehicles, a category of \u201ceffects\u201d which give rise to a reduced expectation of privacy, <em>see Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 <em>U.S. </em>295, 303, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>1297, 143 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>408 (1999), and heightened law enforcement needs, <em>see id. </em>at 304, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>1297, 143 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>408; <em>[United States v.] Rabinowitz, </em>339 <em>U.S. </em>[56,] 73, 70 <em>S.Ct. </em>430, 94 <em>L.Ed </em>653 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\"><em>[Thornton, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2137, <em>158 L.Ed.2d </em>at 919-20.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">As a result, the two justices would \u201climit <em>Belton </em>searches to cases where it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The majority, however, declined Justice Scalia\u2019s invitation to re-examine <em>Belton </em>since the issue had not been directly raised in the certiorari petition nor had it been considered by the court below. <em>Id. </em>at -n. 4, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2132 n. 4, 158 L.Ed.2d at 915 n. 4. Justice O\u2019Connor, also concurring, took note of <em>\u201cBelton\u2019s </em>shaky foundation.\u201d <em>Thornton, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2133, 158 L.Ed.2d at 915. (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Finally, Justices Stevens and Souter dissented on the ground that the United States Supreme Court was unwisely extending <em>Belton </em>beyond \u201cthe narrow class of cases it was designed to address ... without supplying any guidance for the future application of its swollen rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d at 923. (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">We conclude that unless and until our Supreme Court definitively decides otherwise,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Belton </em>does not represent the law in New Jersey under the greater protections provided by our State Constitution, <em>see Pierce, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 209, 215, 642 A.2d 947, and we decline to follow it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the search in question must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>be judged under <em>Chimel. </em>Sine defendant was already in custody in the rear of the patrol ear before the vehicle search took place, the interior of the vehicle was not within his \u201cgrabbable\u201d area and, therefore, not under his control. See <em>Pierce, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 218-20, 642 A.2d 947 (Handler, J., concurring). As a result, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In light of our disposition, we have no occasion to consider defendant\u2019s sentencing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> The State stipulated at the suppression hearing that the warrant for failing to appear was based on $280 in unpaid traffic tickets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\"> Defendant argues that this search is invalid under the warrant exceptions for consent and community caretaking, as well as the automobile exception. Defendant also argues that he had standing to contest the search and a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the vehicle. In its brief, the State makes clear that it does not contest defendant\u2019s standing, finds it unnecessary to address the community caretaking and automobile exceptions, and \"never argued below, and is not suggesting on appeal that the police entry was pursuant to a consent to search.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\"> In <em>United States v.

Of these, Justice Montemurro cited <em>Pierce </em>as the only case that had engaged \"in any meaningful analysis under its state constitution\u201d and he found <em>Pierce's </em>criticism of the <em>Belton </em>rule \"well reasoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 907.

In <em>Vasquez v.

Murrell, </em>94 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 489, 764 <em>N.E.2d </em>986 (2002), in which the Supreme Court of Ohio opted to follow <em>Belton, </em>overruling its earlier opinion in <em>State v. Brown, </em>63 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 349, 588 N.E.2d 113, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>862, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>182, 121 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>127 (1992). In a dissenting opinion joined by one other justice, Chief Justice Moyer, pointed out again how \"in applying <em>Chimel </em>to <em>Belton, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>[Supreme Court] stretched the underlying justification supporting <em>Chimel </em>beyond its rationale.\" <em>Murrell, supra, </em>764 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 994 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting). Even more recently, Nevada stated its adherence to prior case law rejecting <em>Belton. Camacho v. State, </em>119 <em>Nev. </em>395, 75 P.3d 370, 373-74 (2003), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>(Oct. 23, 2003), <em>reconsideration en banc denied, </em>(December 17, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
