Troxclair and James Paul Troxclair, individually, appeal from two orders, one entered in April 2003, and the other in December 2003 dismissing their complaint, respectively, against defendants Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) and Aventis Pasteur, Inc. (Aventis). Both orders were later certified as final for the purpose of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>R. </em>4:42-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">James was born on March 22,1988. Between 1988 and 1992, he allegedly received vaccine injections containing thimerosal, a preservative containing mercury used in the manufacture of certain vaccines. The complaint, which was filed on August 21, 2001, alleged that James first began displaying symptoms of neurological damage consistent with mercury poisoning at fifteen months of age and was diagnosed as having mercury poisoning with related mental and physical problems less than one year prior to the filing date of the complaint. Aventis manufactured the vaccines administered to James<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Lilly was the manufacturer of thimerosal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Instead of answering the complaint, Lilly and Aventis filed motions to dismiss pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), asserting that plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because they had not first pursued James\u2019s claim under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 300aa-l to -34 (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">On appeal, plaintiffs essentially contend that the trial judge erred in considering the motion under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e) because sufficient proof was presented to raise a factual question that the inclusion of thimerosal in the vaccines placed the cause of action outside of the Act. The motion judge correctly determined that the motions were properly brought under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e) as turning upon the preclusive application of the Act. We hold that the injuries allegedly caused by the use of thimerosal as a preservative in the vaccines administered to James are vaccine-related as a matter of law under the Act, and plaintiffs\u2019 failure, in the first instance, to file and prosecute a claim in the Federal Claims Court bars their State cause of action on behalf of James against the vaccine manufacturer. Accordingly, we affirm the order of dismissal in favor of Aventis. However, we reverse the order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against Lilly and remand for further proceedings to permit the trial court to determine the status of Lilly as a manufacturer and whether the Act bars the action on James\u2019s behalf against the manufacturer of a component part as distinguished from the manufacturer of the vaccine itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In 1986, Congress enacted the Act, which \u201cprovides a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.\u201d <em>McDonald v. Lederle Labs., </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 371, 775 A.2d 528 (App.Div. 2001). The Act was prompted by two concerns: 1) the costs of insurance and lawsuits had jeopardized the ability of vaccine manufacturers to supply needed vaccines; and 2) the delays, costs, and uncertainties of tort recovery in the courts served as obstacles to compensating victims of childhood vaccines. <em>Owens v. Am. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>Home Products Corp., </em>203 F.Supp.2d 748, 752 (S.D.Tex.2002); <em>McDonald, supra, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 377-78, 775 A.2d 528; <em>see generally Shackil v. Lederle Labs., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>155, 181-86, 561 A.2d 511 (1989) (reviewing the history and purposes of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Thus, the Act establishes a procedure that a claimant must follow before resorting to a traditional tort action against manufacturers of injury-causing vaccines. The Act creates a National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (the Program) to administer compensation for \u201cvaccine-related injury or death.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 300aa-10(a). A claimant must file a petition with the United States Court of Federal Claims, which adjudicates the claim via a special master, a system informally known as the Vaccine Court. <em>Owens, supra, </em>203 F.Supp.2d at 752. Filing the petition and obtaining a final adjudication by the Vaccine Court is a prerequisite to any civil action. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 300aa-ll(a)(2)(A). Indeed, if a claimant files a civil action in state or federal court before exhausting the Act\u2019s procedure, \u201cthe court shall dismiss the action.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 300aa-U(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Act is designed in part \u201cto free manufacturers from the specter of large, uncertain tort liability, and thereby keep vaccine prices fairly low and keep manufactures [sic] in the market.\u201d <em>Schafer v. Am. Cyanamid Co., </em>20 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994). The Act also benefits claimants. Besides providing a streamlined process of adjudication, a claimant is afforded a lower standard of proof, \u201cunder which individuals who suffer injuries within specified intervals after being administered a vaccine, benefit from a presumption that a vaccine caused those injuries.\u201d <em>Owens, supra, </em>203 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 752. Thus, Congress sought to afford \u201can injured party an expedited procedure, thus encouraging the use of the Program and discouraging utilization of the traditional tort-law avenues which ... required proof of causation, injury, negligence and defect.....\u201d <em>McDonald supra, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 378, 775 A.2d 528. A claimant who obtains an award under the Program may choose to accept it, thus waiving any further rights to file a tort action. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 300aa-21(a). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a claimant may decline the award and subsequently pursue the traditional tort remedies. <em>Ibid.; see Owens, supra, </em>203 F.Supp.2d at 753. If, as here, a timely petition in accordance with the Act is not filed with the Vaccine Court, a claimant is barred from later seeking recovery for injuries resulting from an adverse reaction to a vaccine in a state civil action. <em>McDonald, supra, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 371-72, 775 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 300aa-ll(a)(2)(A) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">No person may bring a civil action for damages in an amount greater than $1,000 or in an unspecified amount against a <em>vaccine administrator or manufacturer </em>in a State or Federal court for damages arising from a <em>vaccine-related injury </em>or death associated with the administration of a vaccine ... unless a petition has been filed ... for compensation under the Program for such injury or death____(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Thus, the Act precludes state or federal tort action where the injury is vaccine-related and damages are sought against a \u201cvaccine administrator or manufacturer\u201d until a claimant pursues his remedy under the Program. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 300aa-33(3) further defines \u201cmanufacture\u201d as meaning \u201cto manufacture, import, process, or distribute a vaccine____\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 300aa-33(5) defines \u201cvaccine-related injury or death\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">an illness, injury, condition, or death associated with one or more of the vaccines set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table, except that the term does not include an illness, injury, condition, or death associated with an adulterant or contaminant intentionally added to such a vaccine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">The parties do not dispute that the vaccines administered to James are listed in the Vaccine Table. Rather, the dispute centers upon whether thimerosal is an adulterant or contaminant. Plaintiffs contend on appeal, as they did in response to defendants\u2019 motions, that the injuries are not vaccine-related because they result from the use of the preservative thimerosal, which was added to the vaccine and constituted an \u201cadulterant or contaminant.\u201d In support of their contention, plaintiffs rely upon the affidavits of two experts, a biochemist, Boyd E. Haley, Ph.D., and a board certified toxicologist, Daniel T. Teitelbaum, M.D., both of whom concluded that thimerosal is considered by the medical and scientific community to be an adulterant and contaminant. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tiffs also relied upon a July 1999 report from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which announced that the mercury contained in thimerosal could cause exposure in excess of federal guidelines and recommended that vaccine manufacturers reduce or eliminate thimerosal from the vaccine supply as soon as possible. Thus, plaintiffs argue that they established through their experts a question of fact, which should not have been decided in a summary manner by motion. However, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, the overwhelming federal authority holds that thimerosal is an ingredient used in the manufacture of certain vaccines and, therefore, any injuries caused by it are vaccine-related and subject to the restrictions of the Act. <em>Moss v.

Specifically, Paragraph (3) was amended to include the following underlined language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">The term \u201cmanufacturer\u201d means any corporation, organization, or institution, whether public or private ... which manufactures, imports, processes, or distributes <em>any vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury table, including any component or ingredient of any such </em>vaccine____The term \u201cmanufacture\u201d means to manufacture, import, process, or distribute a vaccine, <em>including any component or ingredient of any such vaccine.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\"><em>[Pub.L. </em>107-296, \u00a7 1714 (Nov. 25, 2002).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Paragraph (5) was amended by adding language stating \u201can adulterant or contaminant shall not include any component or ingredient listed in a vaccine\u2019s product license application or product label.\u201d <em>Pub.L. </em>107-296, \u00a7 1715 (Nov. 25, 2002); <em>see also Pub.L. </em>107-296, \u00a7 1716 (Nov. 25, 2002) (adding similar language to \u00a7 300aa-83(7)). The November 25, 2002, amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-33(3), (5) and (7) were made applicable to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">all actions or proceedings pending on or after the date of enactment of this Act, unless a court of competent jurisdiction has entered judgment (regardless of whether the time for appeal has expired) in such action or proceeding disposing of the entire action or proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\"><em>[Pub.L. </em>107-296, \u00a7 1717 (Nov. 25, 2002).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On February 20, 2003, the Homeland Security Act was amended, repealing the November 25, 2002, amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-33(3), (5) and (7) and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">No inference shall be drawn from the enactment of sections 1714 through 1717 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ... or from this repeal ... regarding the law prior to enactment of sections 1714 through 1717 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.

L. </em>\u00a7 102(c), Feb. 20, 2003, 117 Stat. 528 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Neither the Act nor its regulations define \u201cadulterant or contaminant.\u201d <em>Owens, supra, </em>203 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 754. However, \u201c[i]t appears that every federal court\u201d has uniformly held that thimerosal is not an \u201cadulterant or contaminant,\u201d but rather an ingredient or component of the vaccine and that \u201cinjuries resulting from thimerosal contained in vaccines are vaccine-related under the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Cheskiewicz, supra, </em>843 A.2d at 1265-66; <em>see, e.g., Moss, supra, </em>381 F.3d at 504; <em>Laughter, supra, </em>291 F.Supp.2d at 410; <em>Blackmon, supra, </em>267 F.Supp.2d at 673-75; <em>Owens, supra, </em>203 F.Supp.2d at 754-55, <em>Leroy, supra, </em>2002 <em>WL </em>31730680 at *12-13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Looking at the plain meaning of the Act, the court in <em>Owens, </em>consulted three dictionary definitions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">The definition of an \u201cadulterant\u201d is \u201ca substance which makes an item impure, spurious, or inferior by adding extraneous or improper ingredients.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>58 (2d ed.1992). A medical dictionary similarly defines adulterant as \u201c|a]n impurity; an additive that is considered to have an undesirable effect or to dilute the active material so as to reduce its therapeutic or monetary value.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>30 (27th ed.2000). And a contaminant is \u201c[s]omething that makes impure or corrupt by contact or mixture.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s 9th New Collegiate Dictionary </em>283 (9th ed.1991).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\"><em>[Owens, supra, </em>203 F.Supp.2d at 754-55.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\"><em>Owens </em>then considered whether these definitions apply to thimerosal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">Thimerosal, when used in vaccines, fails to correspond with any of these definitions. Vaccine manufacturers intentionally add thimerosal to vaccine formulas because it deters microbial and fungal growth, thereby maintaining the safety, purity and potency of vaccines. In fact, thimerosal has been widely used as a vaccine preservative since the 1930s, and its use satisfies the FDA\u2019s requirement that preservatives be added to vaccines distributed in multi-use vials. As such, thimerosal cannot be said to \u201cmake impure or corrupt\u201d a vaccine or to reduce a vaccine\u2019s therapeutic value. Furthermore, thimerosal cannot be characterized as having an undesirable effect or diluting the active material found within a vaccine. In fact, the precise opposite is true. As a preservative, thimerosal <em>prevents </em>a vaccine\u2019s corruption. Hence, neither the plain meaning of \u201cadulterant\u201d nor \u201ccontaminant\u201d applies to thimerosal when, as here, it is purposefully used as an ingredient in the approved formulation of a vaccine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 755 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Additionally, the <em>Owens </em>court pointed out that Congress\u2019s use of the words \u201cassociated with\u201d to define \u201cvaccine-related injury\u201d of listed vaccines also requires a finding that thimerosal is an ingredient covered by the Program. <em>Ibid. </em>It then reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">A \u201cvaccine\u201d is defined as a \u201csuspension of attenuated or killed microorganisms,\u201d and \u201ca preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms.\u201d Neither of these definitions indicates that a vaccine is comprised of microorganisms alone. On the contrary, they indicate that a vaccine is a \u201csuspension\u201d or \u201cpreparation\u201d composed of both microorganisms and additional ingredients. And, as explained above, manufacturers of vaccines add thimerosal to the \u201cpreparation\u201d or \u201csuspension\u201d of vaccines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations and footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Concluding that children\u2019s injuries that are linked to vaccine ingredients are \u201cdefinitely \u2018vaccine-related,\u2019\u201d <em>Owens </em>found that \u201cchildren\u2019s injuries cannot be \u2018thimerosal-related\u2019 without being \u2018vaccine-related\u2019 \u201d under the \u201cplain language of the Vaccine Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The approach exemplified by <em>Owens </em>is consistent with that taken by the Vaccine Court itself in the decision in <em>Leroy, </em>cited in the most recent amendment to the Homeland Security Act. There, the Vaccine Court approved the reasoning of <em>Owens </em>and the other cases. <em>Leroy, supra, </em>2002 <em>WL </em>31730680 at *5. Subsequent federal cases have cited <em>Leroy </em>in support of the same conclusion. <em>Moss, supra, </em>381 F.3d at 504; <em>Laughter, supra, </em>291 F.Supp.2d at 411. Likewise, we are in accord with these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Agreeing with defendants that an injury from thimerosal is vaccine-related, the motion judge noted that he had formerly held in two unrelated cases that thimerosal is \u201can FDA-licensed component of the vaccine ... included in multi-dose vaccine vials and is designed to preserve the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d Pointing out that the FDA had approved the use of thimerosal as an ingredient in the vaccines administered to James, the judge found that he was not required at the motion-to-dismiss stage to accept the complaint\u2019s allegation that thimerosal is an adulterant or contaminant. Citing <em>Owens, </em>the judge correctly concluded that thimerosal is a constituent material of vaccines, James\u2019s injuries are vaccine-related, and the Law Division lacked jurisdiction because plaintiff had not first exhausted relief under the Act. We are satisfied that the motion judge correctly found that thimerosal is an ingredient when intentionally used as a preservative in a vaccine and any injuries resulting from its use are vaccine-related under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We also agree, contrary to plaintiffs argument, that the issue was ripe for disposition under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). While a trial court must grant a plaintiff all reasonable inferences from allegations of fact when considering a <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e) motion, it need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>accept a plaintiffs experts\u2019 opinions when they bear upon construction of a statute or a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Body-Rite Repair Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>540, 543, 446 A.2d 515 (1982) (observing that expert testimony \u201chas little or no relevance to the interpretation of statutory language\u201d). Stated simply \u201c[i]t is settled that [t]himerosal, when used as a preservative, is a component of a vaccine rather than an adulterant.\u201d <em>Moss, supra, </em>381 <em>F.</em>3d at 503-04 (citing <em>Leroy, supra, </em>2002 <em>WL </em>31730680 at *4-5). We are satisfied that the federal courts, including the Vaccine Court, have established that thimerosal, when used as a preservative in a vaccine, is an ingredient and injuries related to its use come under the umbrella of the Act as vaccine-related as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Likewise unavailing is plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the February 20, 2003, amendment removing the language from \u00a7 300aa-33(5) that \u201can adulterant or contaminant shall not include any component or ingredient listed in the vaccine product license application or product label\u201d reflects Congress\u2019s intent that thimerosal be treated as an \u201cadulterant or contaminant.\u201d The federal court decisions holding that thimerosal is not an adulterant or contaminant have been rendered under both the original and present version of \u00a7 300aa-33(5). <em>Moss, supra, </em>381 F.3d at 503-04; <em>Owens, supra, </em>203 F.Supp.2d at 754-55. More importantly, the expressed statement of Congress in the 2003 amendment provided that \u201cno inference shall be drawn that [the repeal of the pertinent amendment] affects any change in that prior law or that <em>Leroy </em>was incorrectly decided.\u201d <em>Pub.L. </em>108-7, <em>Div. L. </em>\u00a7 102(c), Feb. 20, 2003,117 <em>Stat. </em>528 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">As previously noted, \u00a7 300aa-ll(a)(2)(A) operates to preclude prior state court action involving vaccine-related injury against a \u201cvaccine administrator or manufacturer.\u201d Although not raised as an issue in this appeal, the appellate record supports the conclusion that Lilly manufactured thimerosal. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that Lilly and other defendants not involved in this appeal sold thimerosal to other defendants, including Aventis, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>then added it to the vaccines in the vaccine manufacturing process. The complaint also expressly distinguished between the \u201cvaccine manufacturers and thimerosal manufacturers.\u201d The certification and brief filed by Lilly in support of its motion to dismiss in the Law Division acknowledged that Lilly was the manufacturer of thimerosal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">We are cognizant that when the distinction between manufacturers of a completed vaccine and a component ingredient has been raised, federal courts have found that tort actions against manufacturers of components, such as thimerosal, are not restricted by the Act. <em>Moss, supra, </em>381 F.3d at 503-04; <em>John and Jane Doe 2, supra, </em>335 F.Supp.2d at 624; <em>Blackmon, supra, </em>267 F.Supp.2d at 678; <em>Liu, supra, </em>219 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 767; <em>Owens, supra, </em>203 F.Supp.2d at 758-59; <em>cf. Laughter, supra, </em>291 F.Supp.2d at 410-11 (staying claims against manufacturers of vaccine and thimerosal pending adjudication in the Vaccine Court). Moreover, the February 2003 amendment to \u00a7 300aa-33(3) repealed the language added by the November 2002 amendment, extending the definition of manufacturer to those who manufacture \u201cany component or ingredient of any such vaccine.\u201d In <em>Moss, supra, </em>381 F.3d at 503-04, the Fifth Circuit specifically held that Lilly was not entitled to the protection of the Act\u2019s restriction on filing lawsuits outside the Program because it manufactured a component (thimerosal) rather than a \u201ccompleted vaccine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Because the issue of Lilly\u2019s manufacturing status as it may relate to \u00a7 300aa-ll(a)(2)(A) of the Act, protecting vaccine manufacturers and administrators, has not been argued before either the motion judge or us, we are constrained to reverse and remand the order of dismissal in favor of Lilly to permit further proceedings. Other than noting the applicable case law, our reversal should not be taken as indicating a position on our part as to whether Lilly is entitled to protection under the Act. We leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that issue to further proceedings in the Law Division, where the facts respecting Lilly\u2019s status as a manufacturer can be presented and argued along with the applicable law. Accordingly, we affirm the order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against Aventis but reverse and remand the order of dismissal in favor of Lilly. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-13\"> Plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed in its entirety on December 1, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-14\"> Aventis manufactured three vaccines containing thimerosal that were administered to James: DTP, DT, and HIB (HbPV).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> The only arguably contrary opinion was <em>King v.
