Defendant, Glenwood Peterson, appeals from a final restraining order entered against him and in favor of his wife, Diane Peterson. Defendant contends that he did not receive a fair trial and the evidence was insufficient to warrant the issuance of a final restraining order. Based on our careful review of the entire record, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The domestic violence complaint, signed by plaintiff on June 4, 2003, alleged acts of harassment on June 1, 2003, that endangered plaintiffs life, health, or well-being. The complaint specified that defendant committed the following acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Defendant started screaming at plaintiff getting in her face and intimidating her/ealled her \u201cbitch, whore,\u201d etc. Defendant made plaintiff get in car and go to dinner with their daughter. Plaintiff was sick with stomach pains/diarrhea and defendant refused to take plaintiff for 1/2 hour. On a daily basis, defendant gets into plaintiffs face, towering over her screaming and using profanities, causing plaintiff to become very scared and nervous. Defendant is 6' 7\" and over 300 pounds. Plaintiff fled with child in fear of her safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The domestic violence complaint also alleged-a history of domestic violence consisting of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">Defendant has threatened to kill plaintiff numerous times, screams in her face and curses her weekly. Prior to 1998, defendant was very physically abusive to plaintiff. Couple of months ago, defendant threw plaintiff off the bed. Has threatened plaintiff by stating that he could do what O.J. did to his wife. Defendant sat on plaintiffs back which required medical attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">On June 13, 2003, the parties appeared for a final hearing without attorneys. A neighbor, Ms. DeCesare, was present to testify on behalf of plaintiff, and defendant had two witnesses: his mother, Bonnie Peterson, who resided with the parties, and a friend, Benjamin Powell. Prior to the hearing, plaintiff, defendant, and the three potential witnesses were all sworn. The hearing was conducted informally with the trial court asking the questions. Neither party was afforded an opportunity to conduct cross-examination, and Mr. Peterson\u2019s witnesses did not testify. When the judge asked plaintiff what happened on June 1, 2003, she testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>[H]e came into the kitchen and he\u2019s asking me, well, he\u2019s demanding some knives that he had bought. And they\u2019re kitchen knives. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re sharp....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">And I said to him, when he started demanding the knives and harassing me about the knives, \u2014 because when my husband harasses me, my husband comes in front of my face and towers over me, stands over me. And he\u2019s yelling and screaming, and he calls me all kinds of nasty names like four-letter whore, crazy bitch, all kinds of sick stuff he says to me, and he\u2019s towering over me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">And when I tried to just turn away to avoid any kind of confrontation or discord \u2014 attitude or action ..., he follows me. If I turn to the left, he steps in front of me. If I turn to the right, he steps in front of me. So I am actually forced to stand still.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">So five, six times I said the same thing; what do you want the knives for? And eventually he kept on demanding and eventually he says to me, well just in case if you\u2019re not here I know where to find them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Okay. I walked out after that, you know, I just left them in the kitchen because I\u2019m not playing around with any knives. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">... I came back downstairs and I went to the kitchen and he says to me he\u2019s demanding let\u2019s go out for dinner, for lunch \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">... And I said to him, I don\u2019t feel well, because I really wasn\u2019t feeling well. I felt sick to the stomach. I was nervous. I was seared. You know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">[THE COURT:] What were you nervous and scared about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">[PLAINTIFF:] Because we have an episode of violence. We\u2019ve had, you now, lots of, he\u2019s always harassing me. Even the night before, which was May 31st, he\u2019s harassing me about some pictures he thinks that I take____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">I had an incident in, domestic violence incident, in \u201998. I got hurt. I ended up having to go in the ambulance to the emergency room....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">[THE COURT:] Did he threaten you with the knife? Did he use the knife on you? Did he threaten you with the knife? Did he take the knife out and threaten you or menace you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">[PLAINTIFF:] He did it before. I\u2019m not bothering with knives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">[THE COURT:] Did he do it on June 1st? Yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">[PLAINTIFF:] No. He didn\u2019t threaten me with the knife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\">[THE COURT:] So what\u2019s the problem here? What\u2019s the act of domestic violence that I\u2019m missing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">[PLAINTIFF:] Because, Your Honor, there [are] so many episodes about this harassment. My husband comes before me and towers over me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>After hearing from both plaintiff and the neighbor, the trial court stated: \u201cOkay. I think I understand____What do you have to say, Mr. Peterson?\u201d Defendant answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">The knife incident, what happened in the past; I go buy certain things, and I look for, you know, they end up missing. And I was telling her if she go out of town or something and I do barbecue. Maybe I barbecue too much because I\u2019m too big. But I do barbecue a lot. It\u2019s one of those knives that cut through anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">But I never have threatened her with a knife____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">[THE COURT:] Do you call her names? Do you have fights with her verbally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">[DEFENDANT:] I will agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">[THE COURT:] Do you intimidate her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">[DEFENDANT:] No. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">[THE COURT:] You intimidate me just by your physical presence. I don\u2019t mean that negatively. You\u2019re a big guy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">[DEFENDANT:] I know, but what I\u2019m trying to say is ... that she picks arguments with me and she comets and] tell[s] me well, people look at you and see you [are] big and tall, and I cannot sit on nobody without crushing their bones because I\u2019m 300 pounds____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">[THE COURT:] Should the two of you be living together or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">[DEFENDANT:] Sir, what happened, I don\u2019t know____ I\u2019m laying in my bedroom sleeping when she say[s] all the incidents are happening and she come[s] in and hit[s] me with a pillow. And my daughter, you know, our daughter comets] and we\u2019re playing pillow fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-18\">And then the next thing I know she\u2019s filing a complaint against me____And can I comment on the last incident that she said happened, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-20\">[THE COURT:] Sure. I want you to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-21\">[DEFENDANT:] Okay. June 1st. What she said [is] totally not correct and [there is] a little bit more added to it because the day before we went to this Indian restaurant in Long Branch____And she loves the restaurant. Our daughter loves the restaurant. And we [were] having a good time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-24\">... Then Sunday morning I told her ... I [have] to start my diet soon, and I got up and I [said] ... I\u2019d like to go to, does everybody want to go to the Indian restaurant? And she said okay. And our daughter, you know, quickly jumped in her clothes and we both were sitting in the car waiting on her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-25\">There [were] no arguments because she hopped in the car with us to go to the restaurant and my mother was upstairs____She came down and I told her ... I was getting ready to take my daughter and my wife out for dinner____I told her I\u2019d be back in a little while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-29\">So if you look in her report, she claims that I drove around for 20 minutes and she had diarrhea and I would not stop to let her use the rest room. That is not true. What happened was,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>[THE COURT:] The issue is not driving around for 20 minutes not letting her use the,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">[DEFENDANT:] I know, but that\u2019s what she complained was my abuse against her on the report, sir----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">[THE COURT:] I think what she\u2019s saying to me, and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong, is that over a period of five or six years, she has perceived [there] to be a pattern of intimidation by you to the point where she just can\u2019t live that way anymore. And she\u2019s afraid. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">[PLAINTIFF:] That\u2019s exactly right. I\u2019m afraid. He has threatened me many times before. And I know. I see, what happened, he walked in the room Tuesday. He has a tendency to wake me up one o\u2019clock, two o\u2019clock in the morning. And he walked in that morning and he shook me forcefully and said something to me and walked out. I don\u2019t even know what it was he said____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">[THE COURT:] Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">[DEFENDANT:] That\u2019s not correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">[PLAINTIFF:] That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">As part of Ms notice of motion for reconsideration, defendant submitted a copy of a police report regarding the \u201cdomestic violence incident in 1998.\u201d A portion of that report dated July 6, 1998, contains plaintiffs statement that defendant \u201cpushed her down, then sat on her.\u201d The police report includes the following narrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">Mr. Peterson states his wife fell when she attempted to leave the home with their daughter Bonnie. Mr. Peterson states he grabbed Bonnie\u2019s arm and a pot of water fell off the stove and he and his wife slipped and he landed on top of her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-14\">Mr. Peterson\u2019s mother confirmed this version of events. It should be noted there was a spilled pot of water and beans on the floor of the kitchen. There were no obvious signs of physical injury to the victim at this time. Neither party wished to endorse complaints or wished for a restraining order. It should be noted Mr. Peterson stated at no time did his wife become hostile towards him and did not assault him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">Our role in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision is limited. A reviewing court is bound by the trial court\u2019s findings \u201cwhen supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\u201d <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 412, 713 A.2d 390 (1998) (citing <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)). Generally, we give particular deference to matrimonial courts because they \u201cpossess special expertise in the field of domestic relations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 713 A.2d 390 (citing <em>Brennan v. Orban, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>282, 300-01, 678 A.2d 667 (1996)). Because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the conflicting testimony presented at the domestic violence hearing on June 13, 2003, it was incumbent upon the trial court to make appropriate credibility determinations. Our review is hampered because the trial court failed to resolve the credibility contest and also failed to make any specific finding that domestic violence had occurred. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29; <em>R. </em>5:7A(d) (\u201c[a] final order restraining a defendant shall be issued only on a specific finding of domestic violence or on a stipulation by a defendant to the commission of an act or acts of domestic violence as defined by the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In this ease, the final restraining order was issued to provide the parties, and their daughter, with an \u201cinterim solution\u201d because the trial court thought it was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">[THE COURT:] Unfortunately, I\u2019m in a situation where I see people who are all credible to me. You seem like a very smart, nice man. She seems like a very smart, nice lady. I\u2019m sure this gentleman is going to stand up and say what a wonderful guy you are. Okay, or he wouldn\u2019t be here. You wouldn\u2019t bring somebody who is going to say he\u2019s not a nice guy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">I\u2019m sure your mom is going to say you\u2019re a nice guy. But where I have to, if I have to make a mistake I have to make a mistake in favor of safety. Do you understand that? Because, let me tell you something right now. Aside from the fact that I\u2019m a judge, I\u2019m a human being. And if I make a mistake that\u2019s going to hurt somebody, I\u2019ll never forgive myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">So if you were in my situation and I can\u2019t really tell who\u2019s being credible or not credible here, I can just tell you that you shouldn\u2019t live together right now. If you want to eventually get involved in some counseling, if you want to do it, that\u2019s a whole bunch of different things. But right now, this lady needs a time to feel safe and cool off and get her feet back on the ground, and your daughter needs the same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">My view is that she should move back into the house. You should move out of the house, find your own place, and get on with your lives, and hopefully you\u2019ll get a lawyer; she\u2019ll get a lawyer, and through the lawyers they\u2019ll negotiate. Maybe you can go to counseling. Maybe you\u2019ll get divorced. Maybe you\u2019ll get back together. I don\u2019t know. But this is an interim solution, because I think that if I say that there was no domestic violence, although I don\u2019t think you intentionally did anything to harm anybody____It\u2019s going to be a psychological disaster____I have no problem in entering the order ... not because you are a bad guy, because it\u2019s the right thing to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The domestic violence complaint signed by plaintiff alleged harassment, a predicate offense for a domestic violence restraining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>order. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19(a)(13). Prior to the issuance of a final restraining order, the allegations in the domestic violence complaint must be proven by a preponderance of the credible evidence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29(a). The relevant portion of the harassment statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">[A] person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, <em>with purpose to harass </em>another, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">a. Makes, or causes to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">b. Subjects another to striking, kicking, shoving, or other offensive touching, or threatens to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">c. Engages in any other course of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts <em>with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy </em>such other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">For the court to have issued the final restraining order on June 13, 2003, it was necessary for plaintiff to have proven, by a preponderance of the credible evidence, that defendant committed one of the three \u201cfree-standing\u201d offenses, outlined in the harassment statute, with the requisite intent. <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 576, 695 A.2d 236 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 525, 641 A.2d 257, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, <em>130 L.Ed.2d </em>351 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">\u201c[C]ourts must consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the harassment statute has been violated.\u201d <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 404, 713 A.2d 390 (citing <em>Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 584-85, 695 A.2d 236). In some cases, \u201ca finding of a purpose to harass may be inferred from the evidence presented\u201d and from \u201c[c]ommon sense and experience.\u201d <em>Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 577, 695 A.2d 236 (citations omitted). In this case, however, there was no finding that defendant acted with a purpose or intent to harass plaintiff, even though \u201csuch a finding is integral\u201d to a determination of harassment. <em>Bresocnik v. Gallegos, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 183, 842 A.2d 276 (App.Div.2004) (citing <em>E.K. v. G.K., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 570, 575 A.2d 883 (App.Div.1990)). On the contrary, the trial court specifically determined that defendant did not \u201cintentionally [do] anything to harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>anybody.\u201d Accordingly, the record fails to demonstrate that a final restraining order was necessary \u201cto prevent further abuse.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The issuance of a final domestic violence restraining order \u201chas serious consequences to the personal and professional lives of those who are found guilty of what the Legislature has characterized as \u2018a serious crime against society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bresocnik, supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 181, 842 A.2d 276 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-18). Once a final restraining order is entered, a defendant is subject to fingerprinting, <em>N.J.S.A </em>53:1-15, and the Administrative Office of the Courts maintains a central registry of all persons who have had domestic violence restraining orders entered against them, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-34. Violation of a restraining order constitutes contempt, and a second or subsequent nonindictable domestic violence contempt offense requires a minimum term of thirty days imprisonment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-30. The issuing court may also impose a number of other wide-reaching sanctions impairing a defendant\u2019s interests in liberty and freedom in order \u201cto prevent further abuse.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We are mindful of the heavy burden on Family Part judges, <em>Brennan, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 678 A.2d 667, and the \u201cburgeoning domestic violence case-load in the Superior Court,\u201d <em>Smith v. Moore, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 123, 689 A.2d 145 (App.Div.1997). But we are troubled by the informality of the proceedings and the failure to afford defendant essential procedural safeguards including the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses and the right to call witnesses in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u201cOur system is committed to a search for truth within the context of the adversary system. Over the years that system has provided a reliable measure of justice.\u201d <em>Graham v. Gielchinsky, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>361, 373, 599 A.2d 149 (1991). A \u201ctrial, although inevitably an adversarial proceeding, is above all else a search for truth,\u201d <em>State v. Fort, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>123, 131, 501 A.2d 140 (1985), and we have recognized that \u201c[c]ross-examination is the most effective device known to our trial procedure for seeking the truth.\u201d <em>Tancredi v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Tancredi, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>259, 262, 244 A.2d 139 (App.Div.1968) (quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Freehold v. Viviani, </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 225, 158 A.2d 704 (App.Div.1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Unfortunately, the procedure resorted to by the trial court did not afford defendant an opportunity to cross-examine his wife, or the neighbor Ms. DeCesare, and it is clear that he was unaware of his right to do so. On appeal, defendant argues that \u201cthe judge showed bias and did not cross-examine for not telling the truth.\u201d Furthermore, in the absence of this critical safeguard, \u201cthe integrity of the fact-finding process\u201d was compromised because the trial court was unable to fully and fairly assess credibility. <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>730, 736, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2658, 2662, 96 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>631 (1987) (quoting <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>308, 316, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974)); <em>see Amoresano v. Laufgas, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>532, 557, 796 A.2d 164 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Nor was defendant permitted to present his own witnesses, even though defendant\u2019s mother and his friend were both present in court for the purpose of testifying. Defendant\u2019s mother not only lived with plaintiff and defendant at the time of the alleged acts of domestic violence, but she also witnessed the disputed incident in 1998, and her testimony may have aided the trial court in making the necessary credibility and factual determinations. Furthermore, as a matter of fundamental fairness, defendant had the right to present witnesses in his defense. <em>Cardell, Inc. v. Piscatelli, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 155, 649 A.2d 107 (App.Div.1994) (quoting 98 <em>C.J.S. Witnesses </em>\u00a7 315 (Supp.1994)) (noting that \u201c[t]he right to present witnesses is \u2018an essential element in the conduct of a trial\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In view of the foregoing, we are convinced that defendant\u2019s notice of motion for reconsideration should have been granted. The trial court undoubtedly exercised its judgment with the best of intentions; however, we are unable to determine to what extent plaintiffs domestic violence claims might have been successfully challenged if defendant had not been deprived of his constitutional right to due process and a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Reversed and remanded for a new trial. We direct the trial court to proceed as expeditiously as possible. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
