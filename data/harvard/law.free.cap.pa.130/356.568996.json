Barnes, 83 Pa. 15, the plaintiffs, under objection and exception to the defendant, adduced testimony tending to show that after the completion of work by plaintiffs under their contract with defendant, suit was brought by them in the matter of an attachment in the state of New York against defendant, and that suit was also brought by defendant in the state of Connecticut against the Connecticut Western Railroad Co.; that the suit brought by defendant against the railroad company was to recover among other things, for alleged underestimates and- extra work upon plaintiffs\u2019 sections, for which they had not been paid; that an agreement was entered into between plaintiffs and defendant in this case that if they would not further prosecute their attachment suit in the state of Connecticut, but would co-operate with the defendant in his suit against the Connecticut Western Railway Co., he would, in case of receiving anything from the Connecticut Western Railway Co., on account of those particular sections for which plaintiffs had a claim against him, pay them from what he received from the railway company on account of other work; that the plaintiffs did co-operate with defendant in his suit against the railway company; that he recovered by way of compromise with the company, a large amount of money, including an allowance for work done by plaintiffs on their sections, which he declined to pay over to plaintiffs.5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\">At the close of the testimony the defendant requested the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">2. That the original suit having been changed from case to covenant, and the first declaration filed having been in covenant on the written sealed contract between the parties, the present testimony so far as it tends to form a parol contract alleged to have been made in the summer of 1872, should be ruled out and not considered by the jury, because it constitutes a different cause of action from that originally sued on, and their verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-7\">Answer: Refused.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for $26,700.

The stipulation being filed, the rule for a new trial was discharged, and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for $17,800.

The legal principles involved were in the main settled when the case was here before. See Collins v. Barnes, 83 Pa. 15. The errors assigned relate principally to matters occurring on the trial below. As, however, the trial appears to have been conducted in accordance with the principles indicated in the former opinion, we see no just cause of complaint. There is no objection to the filing of the amended narr, referred to in the first four specifications of error. There was no change of the cause of action. The objections to the admission of evidence are covered by the former opinion. The real trouble of the plaintiff in error is that he has the verdict of the jury against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
