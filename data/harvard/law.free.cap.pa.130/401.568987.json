Prager, the defendant, had bought a parcel of land from D. B. Hawkins et al. under an article of agreement, and had at once taken possession thereof. The land was not described definitely in the agreement, but was bounded by distinctly visible marks, such as fences, roads, etc. A deed for the land was executed and delivered bearing date March 16, 1863, in which the land was described by courses and distances, but the lines did not conform in some places with the lines of the articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">In 1865, Francis Stroud bought from D.

The offer was objected to, (1) for the reason that it was already in evidence that defendant had accepted the deed for the land, dated March 16, 1863, duly recorded, and the article was merged in the deed and was of no effect; (2) that the article of agreement, not having been recorded, was no notice to Francis Stroud, when purchasing the adjoining property from the same owner at a subsequent date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">By the court: Objection sustained; exception.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-8\">The defendant then renewed the offer of the article of agreement, to be followed by evidence that the defendant entered into possession of the land mentioned in the article, and had held possession thereof openly, notoriously and continuously, from September, 1856, to the date of trial.

As to the evidence of a possession by defendant, adverse, visible, notorious and distinct, of the land upon which the alleged trespasses were committed, I may say that I see in the evidence no sufficient proof of its existence. The fact that neighborly acts are shown, if they do not indicate clearly a claim of right, are not classed in law as adverse to the rightful owner.

Justice Williams:</author>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">' This was an action of trespass brought to recover damages for an injury to land, the bank of a small mill-stream. The defendant denied the title of the plaintiff, and set up title and actual possession in himself. The evidence shows that he had purchased a mill property from David B. Hawkins in September, 1856, by an agreement in writing, which .described the land' by reference to roads, buildings, and fences then on the ground. He w\u00e9nt immediately into possession. His deed was n\u00f3t made until March, 1863, and when made did not adopt the description in the written agreement, but made a new one by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>courses and distances, containing fourteen acres. According to the description contained in the deed, the place of the alleged injury would be outside the lines of Prager\u2019s \u25a0 property. He alleged that he took possession under the articles, and in accordance with the description therein, and' had remained in possession openly, notoriously, and in hostility to all comers, from that time down to the time of trial, a period of more than thirty years. If this was true, he had a good title under the statute of limitations, without regard to the description in his deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">For the purpose of putting his defence before the jury, he offered the article of agreement, to be followed by proof \u201c that the defendant entered into possession of the land mentioned in the article, and has held possession thereof openly, notoriously and continuously from September, 1856, until the present date.\u201d This was objected to for the reason that the article of agreement was merged in the deed. The objection was sustained, and the evidence excluded. This might have been proper if the article had been offered for some other purpose, such as to contradict recitals in the deed; but it was offered as showing the boundaries of his possession when he was put in by his vendor; and he proposed to follow it by showing that his possession had extended to the same boundaries, notwithstanding the deed, down to the time of trial. The boundaries of this pqssession he alleged embraced the locus of the alleged trespass. If this was true, he had a perfect defence to the plaintiff\u2019s action, and in determining the admissibility of the offer we must assume that it was true. If he had been, for over thirty years, as he proposed to show, in the open, notorious, and continuous possession of his mill property, by boundaries which inclosed the bank of the stream on which the alleged trespass had been committed, the plaintiff could not recover. If he had relied on his deed as a defence, he would have been concluded by the description it contained, but he did not. He said, in substance: \u201c My vendor sold this property to me, and described it in the contract by reference to roads, fences, and buildings that I could see. He put me in possession of the land so described, and I have remained in \u25a0 possession ever since, according to the same visible boundaries, and those boundaries include the land in question.\u201d This was a claim of title by possession in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>dependently of the deed, and the fact that he received a deed with a different description of the land from that in the agreement, and recorded it, did not prevent him from setting up such title.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">This view of the subject sustains the second, fourth, and sixth assignments of error, and</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
