Stokes against David R. Mclntire and Thomas Brown. A statement of claim was filed with the prtecipe and served with the writ, assigning breaches by the defendants of a bond executed by the defendants, dated February 10,1882, and providing as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq9\">\u201c We, David R. Mclntire and Thomas Brown, bind ourselves to Samuel P. Shriver and James H. Stokes that the said David R. Mclntire shall cause defence to be made to au action now pending in the Court of Common Pleas No. 1 of Allegheny county, at No. 544 December Term 1881; and that he, the said Mclntire, will pay and satisfy any decree or judgment that may be recovered against said Shriver and Stokes, for or on account of a six tenths interest in the firm of Nellis, Shriver &amp; Co., which was of A. J. Nellis, and that said Mclntire shall indemnify and save the said Shriver and Stokes harmless from any and all loss, liability, damages and costs, on account of or by reason of said action. If the said David R. Mclntire shall fail to pay, then the said Thomas Brown will pay for him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP5\">David R. Mclntire, one of the defendants, filed an affidavit of defence, which after various averments, admitted in para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>graph 6 the execution of the bond sued upon, and stated that on January 5, 1882, Eliza M. Nellis, in order to secure the affiant for certain moneys advanced by him, had executed and delivered to affiant an assignment of certain goods and chattels; that, learning of the action pending at No. 544 December Term 1881, with regard to an alleged interest of A. J. Nellis in said assigned goods and chattels, he was assured by the plaintiffs and their counsel that Eliza M. Nellis had a good title to said goods and chattels, and that no liability could arise by reason of said suit except the cost of employing counsel; that it was agreed at the time said bond was given that the cost of defending said action was to be the limit of liability; \u201cthat in pursuance of said agreement the affiant employed able counsel, who defended said action; and, notwithstanding the fact that affiant was ready and willing at all times to and did perform all the covenants of said obligation, the said Samuel P. Shriver wickedly and maliciously, and for the purpose of injuring affiant, conspired with the plaintiffs in said action and other parties interested in the promotion of proceedings in No. 544 December Term 1881, to prevent a proper defence to be made thereto, and did wilfully and falsely swear, as a witness, being sworn in said cause, to matters and things that were untrue, and throughout the whole litigation was the main witness against Nellis, Shriver &amp; Company, and thereby prevented a proper determination of said cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">A rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence having been taken, and argued, the court, Stowe, P.
