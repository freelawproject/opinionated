McCartney, a residuary devisee under the will of Griswold E. Warner, deceased, presented his petition praying upon the facts therein set out that the court order and direct Franklin Osburn, surviving executor of the will of said decedent, to forthwith make distribution of the residuary real and personal estate of said decedent, so that the petitioner should receive the one half part thereof, and the children of Henrietta W. Osburn the other one half part thereof, and for such other and further relief as the circumstances of this case might require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-13\">An answer having been filed, a hearing was had and after argument, the court, Hawkins, P. J., on October 16, 1888, filed the following opinion and decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-14\">EINDINGS OE EACT.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-15\">The question involved in this case is, whether or not, under the will of Judge Warner, his grandson Harry G. McCartney, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>is now entitled to receive his share in distribution ? The material facts out of which this question arises are these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-4\">Judge Warner by his will having empowered his executors to make sales of his real estate, directed that they should invest the proceeds \u201cuntil the final division \u201d made of his residuary estate, \u201cwhich (estate) I wish to be equally divided between the'heirs of\u201d his daughter Henrietta Osburn, who might be living at the time of said division, and Harry G. McCartney, son of his deceased daughter Jennie W. McCartney, \u201c each to share and share alike.\u201d In the following clause he proceeds thus: \u201cI would rather prefer not to have a division made of my estate until the youngest child of Henrietta arrives at the age of twenty-one years. But should any of the heirs, after arriving to that age, wish to engage in business, and wish to realize any portion of their interest in said estate, my executors can give them such an amount as they may think proper, and take their individual note or notes, bearing interest to be added thereto, and deducted from their respective portions of said estate on the final division of the same. And should any of said heirs aforesaid, at the time of the final division of said estate, be considered by my executors to be incompetent or incapacitated, either in mind or body, or from intemperance, to take charge or manage their respective interests in said estate, my executors are hereby requested to pay such nothing more than the interest annually on their respective portions of said estate, until said incapacity does no longer exist.\u201d He therefore appointed his son-in-law, Franklin Osburn, and David N. White, executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-5\">Mrs. Osburn is 57 years of age, and has eight children, the youngest of whom was born in 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\">At No. 349 March Term 1883, of this court, a petition was presented on behalf of said Harry G. McCartney, setting forth inter alia, that said executors proposed making a distribution per capita, of said estate, and asking that they be restrained therefrom. The executors admitted the purpose and claimed that this was in accordance with a proper construction of the will. This court held that the division should be into two equal parts, one of winch should belong to the heirs of Mrs. Osburn, and the other to the said Harry G. McCartney; and made a decree restraining said executors from making any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>other distribution. This decree was upon appeal to the Supreme Court affirmed: Osburn\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 637.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">There was no question of the time of distribution raised or decided in that case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">After this decision, no further steps were taken by the executors towards division, in respect of that part of the estate located in Pennsylvania, so far as Harry Gr. McCartney was concerned, but they paid large sums in distribution to the Osburn children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">In 1884, Mr. Osburn and Mr. McCartney met -in Chicago, Illinois, and \u00e9ntered into negotiations for the partition of the land which belonged to the estate, located there. They were unable to agree upon a basis of valuation, and Mr. McCartney thereupon insisted that there should be no sale. Mr. Osburn then consulted his counsel, submitted to him copies of the paper-book in the proceedings which, as above stated, had been instituted in this court, in reference to the construction of the will of Judge Warner, and was advised that the will must be construed by the Supreme Court [of Illinois] in order to give title to the different heirs, to the land there; and that in his opinion, no partition could be made until Mrs. Osburn\u2019s youngest child attained majority, but that this question also must be decided by that court. A bill was thereupon filed with this view, on behalf of the executors and the children of Mrs. Osburn, against Mr. McCartney, in which it was alleged, inter alia, that the proper construction of Judge Warner\u2019s will was, that distribution of his residuary estate should be per capita and not per stirpes. Mr. Osburn testified in reference to the purpose of this bill, at a hearing in this court: \u201c It was not my purpose at all in the proceedings in Chicago to obtain partition, but simply to obtain construction of the will, just as McCartney did here. .... I wanted a different construction of the will from that given here, and that is very likely the reason why the papers were drawn as they were, without reference to the injunction made by the court here.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">Part of the land which was the subject of this bill, was bought by Judge Warner, and part by his executors, with personal assets. The Supreme Court of Illinois held: (1) That Judge Warner\u2019s grandchildren took his real estate per capita, but decided, upon a bare reference by counsel in their argument, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the time for division would not arrive until Mrs. Osburn\u2019s youngest child attained majority; and (2) that the personal estate, consisting of the land bought by the executors, should be divided forthwith amongst said grandchildren, per stirpes, which was accordingly done. [See: McCartney v. Osburn, 118 111. 403; Osburn v. McCartney, 121 111. 408.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">Mr. McCartney attained his majorit3r in 1882, and now asks that \u201cfinal division\u201d of the estate be made. The surviving executor, Franklin Osburn, resists the application, upon the ground that such division cannot be made until the youngest child of Mrs. Osburn attains majority, and asks that the former decision of this and the Supreme Court, in Osburn\u2019s Appeal, be reconsidered and reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">CONCLUSIONS OK LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">1. The reasons for present division of this estate, as between Harry G. McCartney and the \u201c heirs \u201d of Mrs. Osburn, greatly preponderate. Mr. McCartney has an absolute and vested interest under the will: Osburn\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 637; he has attained his majorfiy, and it does not appear that he is \u201c incompetent or incapacitated, either in mind or in body, or from intemperance, to take charge of or manage his interest.\u201d There is no allegation that such division would be prejudicial in any way to the estate; and there is no prohibition against such division contained in the will. So far as Mr. McCartney is concerned, there is no reason for the existence of any trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">The executors are not given expressly, nor by necessary implication, control over the time of division. They are, it is true, expressly given power to make sales of real estate, and to invest the proceeds until \u201c final division,\u201d and to make advancements to the \u201c heirs \u201d upon the security of their individual notes ; but manifestly this gives them no power to determine when the final division shall take place. The whole administration, including the exercise of these special powers, might have been ended within the year after Judge \"Warner\u2019s death, without, so far as appears, prejudice to any interest. The expression of a preference by testator, that the \u201c final division \u201d should not take place until the youngest child of Mrs. Osburn should attain majority, was not necessarily directed to the executors, but rather to the \u201c heirs,\u201d and, being merely precatory, it is not to be regarded as binding. Even if addressed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>executors, it gave them no power to postpone peremptorily the final division: Rawle\u2019s App., 119 Pa. 100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">But, assume that the executors were given discretionary power in the premises. They have made a solemn declaration in this and the Supreme Court, that the time for final division had arrived, and have not only since given no sufficient reason for postponement of that time, but have actually made division of a large part of the estate. This implies that in the opinion of the executors, final division could then have been made without prejudice to the estate, and that Mr. McCartney was \u201c competent to take charge of, and manage \u201d his interest; and there is no allegation that these conditions have since changed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">If the solemn declaration of the executors, made as above stated, was not an exhaustion of any alleged discretionary power to determine the time of final division of the estate, their conduct must at least be regarded as either arbitrary or capricious, and cannot be suffered to prejudice the rights of any of their cestuis que trust: Hill on Trustees, 494. If it was wise then, it is wise now, to make final division. There is no reason apparent on the face of the will, in the condition of the estate, nor in the character of this petitioner, why it should not now be made; and there is every reason why it should now be made. Judge Warner has been dead 15 years, and this petitioner\u2019s interest has been compelled to bear its proportion of the costs and expenses of administration, during the whole of that period. Mr. McCartney has attained the age at which the law gave him the right \u201c to take charge of and manage \u201d his property: and there is no reason why he should not exercise that right here and now. The will gave him an absolute and present vested interest in the estate. There is therefore no reason for the continued existence of a trust so far as he is concerned. It is the polioy of the law to encourage the distribution and division of estates and the dissolution of trusts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">2. The question of the proportions in which the beneficiaries named in the will of Judge Warner take, was conclusively settled in Osburn\u2019s App., supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">\u2014A final decree was thereupon entered: 1. That Franklin Osburn, executor, proceed forthwith to make division of the personal estate of Griswold E. Warner, deceased, as between the heirs of Henrietta Osburn and Harry G. McCartney, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>hand over the share of said Harry G. McCartney to him, being the equal one half part thereof.1 2. That said Franklin Os-burn join in the partition in this court of the real estate, of which Griswold E. Warner died seised in the state of Pennsylvania, among the heirs of Mrs. Plenrietta Osburn and the said H. G. McCartney.4 3. That the costs of the proceeding be paid out of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">Thereupon the respondent took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">1, 4.

He has fully vindicated his decree. Upon one point only do we differ from him. He ordered that the costs of this proceeding should be paid out of-the estate. In an ordinary case, this would be correct. In the case in hand, however, the costs have been incurred through the conduct of the executor himself. All that was necessary for his guidance was ruled when the case was here before. See Osburn\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 637. The executor, however, appears not to have been satisfied with our rulings, and to have taken -a different view of the law. We have nothing to say in regard to this, beyond the fact that we cannot permit him to waste the money of the estate in seeking to establish his own views of the law. If he desires to indulge in litigation as a luxury, he must pay for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It is ordered that the costs of this proceeding, both here and below, be paid by the executor personally, and not out of the estate; and with this modification the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
