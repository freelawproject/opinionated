Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-13\">At the trial on August 12,1889, the facts appearing were in substance as follows: On August 29, 1882, upon a judgment for $1,050 in favor of the Clarion. Masonic Lodge against Albert W., Miles C., William A. and Angeline Feely, the interests of the defendants in a tract of land and two town lots were sold to Mr. W. W. Barr, the attorney for the judgment plaintiff, for the sum of $75. On a previous day at which the sale was advertised, the property had been bid up to over $500, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>but after an adjournment Mr. Barr had induced the bidder to withdraw his bid, and at the day of sale there was no competition. The \u00a775 at which the property was knocked down to Mr. Barr but little exceeded the costs on the writ. There were other unsatisfied liens against the interests of the defendants, and at the time of the sale Mr. Barr supposed the interests sold were not worth more than the judgment in his charge. After the sale, Mr. Barr\u2019s client was willing to give up the land upon being paid the amount of its judgment and interest, and an arrangement was made by which, inter alia, one portion of the land was to be conveyed by Mr. Barr to a purchaser for an amount sufficient to discharge the judgment indebtedness, the town lots to be conveyed to a sister, and forty acres of the land, the parcel in dispute, to Miles C. Feely and William A. Feely. This was the arrangement as Mr. Barr understood it at the time, and in carrying it out, a deed was made by him on September 4, 1882, to Miles C., and William A. Feely, for the land in dispute, which deed was delivered to William A. Feely, for himself and brother, on December 12, 1882. Some time afterwards, William A. Feely, brought the deed back to Mr. Barr, saying that \u201c it was not the way they wanted it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">Subsequently William and Miles both requested him to make a new deed to Mrs. Sarah J. Feely, the wife of Miles C. Feely. A deed was drawn, copied from the former deed, dated September 4, 1882, acknowledged August 27, 1884, and delivered. The consideration named in it was \u00a71,200, but no part of it was paid. In the meantime, however, to wit, on June 27,1884, S. H. Hoover had entered a judgment for \u00a7159.66 against Miles C., William A. and A. W. Feely. On this judgment the land in dispute on April 21, 1885, was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale to S. Gr. Hoover for \u00a7450, and sheriff\u2019s deed delivered. At this sale Mrs. Sarah J. Feely had given notice to bidders alleging title in her, and that it had vested \u201c prior to the entry of the Hoover judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">The court, Wilson, P.

Both sides concede that the determination of this case must be settled by the court on the questions of law involved, and the jury will be guided by our instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">The plaintiff requests the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">1.

That resulting trusts can be created only by the payment of a part of the purchase money by the party claiming to be cestui que trust, or by fraud at the time of the purchase on the part of the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale; and both these requirements being entirely wanting in the purchase by W. W. Barr, the evidence in this case fails to establish a resulting trust in him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">Answer: Affirmed.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-10\">3. There is nothing in the testimony of W. W. Barr given in this case, whereby any title, legal or equitable, to the land in dispute became vested in Miles C. Feely, W. A. Feely, and A. W. Feely, which could be taken in execution by their judgment creditor, S. W. Hoover, and the sale on his judgment of the land in controversy, passed no title in the same to the purchaser, S. G. Hoover, the defendant in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-11\">Answer: Affirmed.8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-12\">4.

Justice Mitchell:</author>\n<p id=\"b128-18\">There was no room in this case for the application of the doctrines of resulting trusts, or trusts ex maleficio. The evidence is entirely clear that Capt. Barr made the purchase exclusively in the interests of his clients, the masonic lodge, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>without any previous agreement or arrangement for the continuance of an interest in any of the Feelys. His testimony is uncontraclicted, and it establishes that he expected to have to buy in the land for his clients, and that he considered it worth about the amount of the debt, and therefore that there would be nothing left for the debtors. His adjournment of the sale, and securing the withdrawal of Arnold\u2019s bid, was also solely in the interest of his clients, there being a prior judgment against the same defendants, or at least some of them, open on the docket, which Albert Feely said was paid; but, in the absence of personal knowledge of that fact, Barr, as a prudent lawyer, desired to avoid the risk of bidding the property up to cover the prior judgment., and having to pay the money into court where it might ultimately be awarded to the prior creditor. In all this there was nothing on which to found the notion of a trust of any kind for the Feelys.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Having acquired the title by purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale, Barr seems to have been convinced that the land was more valuable than he had thought, and, as neither he nor his clients desired anything more than the payment of their debt, he was willing to carry out the proposed arrangement, by which the outstanding interests of the other members of the Feely family should be conveyed to him, and the land and its proceeds disposed of to the several parties in accordance with the agreement. This was entirely competent and legal for him to do, and had the deed to Mrs. Sarah J. Feely been made and delivered at that time no question as to its validity could have arisen: Winch v. James, 68 Pa. 297. But the difficulty is that the deed was not so made, nor is there any evidence that such was the agreement at the time. On the contrary, the deed was made to Miles and William Feely, and handed to William on December 12, 1882. There is no doubt that in so doing Barr was carrying out the agreement as he understood it, and there is no evidence that he was not right in such understanding, except the fact that \u201c after a little time,\u201d as Barr says, \u2014 \u201c I cannot tell how long, \u2014 William brought the deed over to me, and said, \u2018 That deed was not the way they wanted it.\u2019 \u201d This may mean either that it was not in accordance with the agreement at the time it was made, or not in accordance with the present desire of the parties; and the rest of Barr\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>makes it clear that the latter was the real meaning. \u201c I told him,\u201d he says, \u201c that was the way I understood it was to be made, and I did not care about making another deed, unless somebody would pay me for it; and he went.away, and after a while he or some one came to me, and said if I would make a deed either he or some one would pay me for it; and then I made a deed, and delivered it to Miles.\u201d This was the deed to Sarah J. Feely. Just when it was made is not clear. It was dated back to September, 1882, the date of the previous deed to William and Miles, but was not delivered until after August 27, 1884. In the mean time the Hoover judgment had been entered, and was a lien on Miles and William Feely\u2019s interest in the land, whatever that was. Whether they had any interest depends on whether or not the deed to them was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">That the leaving of the deed with William was intended by Barr as a delivery does not admit of doubt, and there is no evidence that the other parties refused to receive it as such. On the contrary, they did not return it immediately, \u2014 all the evidence is that of Barr that it was \u201c after a little time; I cannot tell how long;\u201d which may mean a day, or a week, or a month, \u2014 and when they did bring it back it was not with a clear declaration that it was not according to agreement, but only that it was \u201c not the way they wanted it; \u201d which, as already said, might, and under the circumstances must, be taken to mean that it was not according to their present wishes. They left the matter in this indefinite condition for some time. How long is again in doubt, as Barr says, only, \u201c he went away, and after a while he or some one came, and said if I would make a deed,\u201d etc.; but, whatever the time was before they came back to make positive arrangements for a new deed, they did not follow it up, and get the deed, until August, 1884, more than a year and a half after the handing of the first deed to William, and two months after the entry of the Hoover judgment had made the matter urgent. Under such evidence there is not the slightest doubt that the leaving of the deed with William was a delivery; that the title was in William and Miles at the time of the entry of the Hoover judgment; and, whether or not a mere surrender of their deed, and the making of a new one by their grantor, Barr, to Sarah J. Feely, could, under any cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>cumstances, pass the legal title to her', it is quite clear that it could not do so as against the lien of the creditor\u2019s judgment which had previously attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The defendants\u2019 point should therefore have been affirmed, and the verdict directed for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
