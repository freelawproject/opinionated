At the time of the accident his average weekly wage was $80. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 36(3) stipulates that compensation for the loss of an eye shall be paid for a period of two hundred weeks. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 36(3) provides that a permanent partial disability (which includes the loss of an eye) shall be compensated at the rate of sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages or a maximum of $25.00 per week. And subsection (3a) of \u00a7 36(3), providing that a person receiving an award of one hundred and seventy-five weeks or more shall be considered to have a serious disability, specifies that such person, in addition to the award under subsection (b) of \u00a7 36(3), shall automatically be entitled to an extra award of weeks equal to one-third the number of weeks there- \u25a0 tofore awarded with the maximum increased to $40.00 per week. Had the compensation commission not been required to award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the claimant the extra number of weeks at the increased maximum, the award of compensation would have been $5000, but under the added subsection (3a) the award of compensation computed to the nearest number of weeks at the maximum of $40 per week amounts to $10,680.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Specifically, the employer and insurer (King Furniture Manufacturing Company and Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Company), contend: (i) that the title of the act is misleading in derogation of \u00a7 29 of Article III of the Constitution of Maryland; (ii) that the act violates Article 20 of the Declaration of Rights in that it sets up an irrebuttable presumption-of fact that the claimant had a \u201cserious disability\u201d; and (iii) that the act constitutes an arbitrary classification in violation; of Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights and the due process, clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. All are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The first contention is based on the premise that the title is misleading, or rather deceptive, in that it purports to create new' categories or classifications of the seriously disabled but does not expressly define the term \u201cserious disability\u201d in the body of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">One of the relevant provisions of \u00a7 29 of Article lit of the state constitution requires that \u201cevery Law enacted by the General Assembly shall embrace but one subject, and that shall be described in its title.\u201d Another provision states that no law shall \u201cbe construed by reason of its title, to grant powers, or confer rights which are not expressly contained in the body of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The title in controversy reads\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">\u201cAn Act to add new Sections 36 (3a) and 36(4a) to Article 101 * * * amending the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws concerning benefits payable to certain \u00a1persons suffering a permanent partial disability under these laws, in order to create certain new categories of persons having a serious disability, and relating generally to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits of, and the conditions under which payable to, persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>having a \u2018serious disability\u2019 under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">As it is conceded that the General Assembly could have in\u2022creased the compensation for the scheduled disabilities set forth '.in subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 36(3) by repeal and reenactment, the only part of the body of \u00a7 36(3a) which is material in this case merely states that \u201c[a] person who receives under subsection (3) of this section an award for a period of one hundred and seventy-five weeks or more is thereby considered .to have a serious disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">It is severally argued that although the title creates a new 'classification of \u201cserious disability,\u201d the right to be included within the class is not expressly contained in the body of the -act; that the title indicates that the body of the act would set up a standard for and define what constitutes a \u201cserious dis-ability\u201d but all that it does is provide additional compensation for certain disabilities previously scheduled in another section; -and, finally, that the constitutional infirmity lies in the fact that 'the new classification is not adequately defined as the title implies it would be. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">As we read it, the title of the act states in effect that the compensation laws concerning benefits payable to certain persons suffering permanent partial disability were being amended in -order to create a new category of those persons having a serious \u2022disability and to provide for the payment, and the conditions under which payable, of compensation benefits to such seriously -disabled persons, and the body of the act explicitly provides 'that persons receiving an award of one hundred and seventy-\u25a0five weeks or more are \u201cconsidered to have a serious disability.\u201d While it might have been less confusing had the General As\u2022sembly repealed and reenacted \u00a7 36(3) to include the substance \u25a0of \u00a7 36(3a), it is difficult to see how anyone could be deceived \u2022or misled as to the meaning and effect of subsection (3a) or why the term \u201cserious disability\u201d should have been defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The title in controversy, in stating that the purpose of the addition was to \u201ccreate certain new categories of persons having \u2022a serious disability, and relating generally to the * * * [compensation] benefits of, and the conditions under which payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>to\u201d seriously disabled persons, <em>fairly </em>described what was in the body of the act. <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. MTA, </em>232 Md. 509, 194 A. 2d 643 (1963) ; <em>Leonardo v. County Commissioners of St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>214 Md. 287, 134 A. 2d 284 (1957). Moreover, the title was sufficient to inform the legislators and public of the general nature of the subject matter of the act and this was all that was necessary. <em>Jacobs v. Klawans, </em>225 Md. 147, 169 A. 2d 677 (1961) ; <em>Bell v. County Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>195 Md. 21, 72 A. 2d 746 (1950) ; <em>Neuenschwander v. W.S.S.C., </em>187 Md. 67, 48 A. 2d 593 (1946). Clearly, there was nothing in the body of the act which was foreign to the subject matter described in the title. <em>Warren v. Board of Appeals of Department of Employment Security, </em>226 Md. 1, 172 A. 2d 124 (1961) ; <em>Scharf v. Tasker, </em>73 Md. 378, 21 Atl. 56 (1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The addition to \u00a7 36(3) was certainly not intended to set up a new classification for persons suffering a \u201cpermanent partial disability.\u201d Rather, what the Legislature did was to provide that an injured person who was entitled to compensation for one hundred seventy-five weeks or more for some of the scheduled disabilities stipulated in \u00a7 36(3) should thereafter be considered to have a \u201cserious disability\u201d and as a consequence eligible for an extra award of weeks (in addition to the original award) compensable at a higher rate for the total number of weeks awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Even if the title indicates that the body of the act would set forth a standard as to what constitutes a \u201cserious disability,\u201d it does so by stating that a specific award under another section would be considered to be such a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">(\u00dc)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">A number of related claims form the basis of the second contention that the act set up an irrebuttable presumption of fact that violates Article 20 of the Declaration of Rights. Among other things, it is claimed that no evidence is permitted on the ultimate issue of fact of whether a disability is serious and that since disability is determined by reference to the extent of the disability rather than its seriousness, it makes evidence conclusive which is not so by nature and inherent force. In support of this proposition the employer and insurer cite only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 48 A. 2d 600 (1946), but that case is distinguishable from this in that <em>there </em>the racing commission lacked power to adopt a rule substituting an irrebuttable presumption for facts, whereas <em>here, </em>the authorization of the compensation commission to increase the benefits payable to a claimant was a valid exercise of the legislative prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Article 20 states \u201c[t]hat the trial of facts, where they arise, is one of the greatest securities of the lives, liberties and estate of the People,\u201d but this right was in nowise impaired by the creation of an additional classification in the compensation law increasing the payment of benefits to those who come within the category of the seriously disabled. Had the provisions of \u00a7 36(3a) been incorporated into \u00a7 36(3) by repeal and reenactment, it is probable \u2014 indeed it seems to have been conceded\u2014 that this contention may not have arisen. But be that as it may, it is clear that the Legislature intended to increase the benefits of those receiving an award of one hundred and seventy-five weeks or more under \u00a7 36(3) and that it considered those entitled thereto as being in a category it chose to designate as a \u201cserious disability.\u201d The Legislature did not intend a separate determination of seriousness, but rather to include in the \u201cserious disability\u201d category those who were awarded one hundred and seventy-five weeks or more for certain stipulated injuries. Obviously no irrebuttable presumption of fact was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Since it was not necessary for the Legislature to define \u201cserious disability,\u201d no procedural formula as to what constituted that term (other than reference to the categories specified in subsection 3 of \u00a7 36) was required. The adjective \u201cserious\u201d as used in \u00a7 36 (3a) means \u201cgrievous,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>characterized by pain and suffering, but it has no technical meaning and should be considered only in its ordinary sense. <em>Newell v. Moreau, </em>55 A. 2d 476 (N. H. 1947); <em>Cf. State v. Ortega, </em>422 P. 2d 353 (N. M. 1966). As used in compensation law, \u201cserious\u201d connotes no more than that the disability partakes of permanency. <em>Vick v. Springs Cotton Mills, </em>40 S. E. 2d 409 (S. C. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The finding of the compensation commission is subject to review by the courts. Code (1957), Art. 101, \u00a7 56(a); <em>Abell v. Goetze, Inc., </em>245 Md. 433, 226 A. 2d 253 (1967). At the de novo hearing the employer would have the right to introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>evidence, if it has any, showing that the claimant is not covered by the compensation law or that he did not belong in the category of the seriously disabled by showing that he was not entitled to an award of one hundred and seventy-five weeks or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Furthermore, the term \u201cserious disability\u201d fits into the general scheme of workmen\u2019s compensation laws. Such laws are a form of social legislation which impose liability without fault upon employers but limit the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an injured employee. <em>Solvuca v. Ryan &amp; Reilly Co., </em>131 Md. 265, 101 Atl. 710 (1917). The act in question provides for increased benefits to those in the new category. The issues to be proven \u2014 statutory liability and extent of injury \u2014 are the same as those which exist outside of the addition to \u00a7 36(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">(Hi)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The third contention that the act violated the respective due process clauses of the state and federal Constitutions is not based on the fact that the Legislature could not have created a new category and compensated the recipients differently from other persons suffering a permanent partial disability but on the claim that the method chosen for determining who is to be included within the category is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Since compensation laws like other laws are presumed to be constitutional and are construed in such way as will carry out the objectives of their enactment, the burden of showing the unreasonableness of a classification is on the party attacking it. <em>Celanese Corporation v. Davis, </em>186 Md. 463, 47 A. 2d 379 (1946). If there are no facts to sustain the objector, the classification must be upheld. <em>Cf. Allied American Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 150 A. 2d 421 (1959). We cannot say that the categorization of the loss of an eye as a \u201cserious disability\u201d was irrational. Such matters are committed to the judgment of the makers, not the interpreters, of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
