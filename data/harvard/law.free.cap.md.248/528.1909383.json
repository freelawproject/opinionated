The 5 which concern us are 301, 303, 305, 307 and 309 N. Parrish Street. These lots, 45 to 50 feet deep and 10 to 12 feet wide, were improved by 2-story, 4 rooms and bath, brick row houses. The weekly rent was $9.00, which did not include gas, electricity or heat. The 5 properties, owned in fee simple, in the years 1960 to 1963 produced an average annual net return of $954.26. Mrs. Jarvis entrusted the management of all of her properties to her son-in-law, David F. Hayes.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>There were no tenants in 305, 307 and 309 in the early spring of 1964. The tenant in 303 left during the first part of April. On 28 April, William Glick, an employee of the appellee (the \u25a0City), inspected the properties and reported to the Bureau of Building Inspection that they were in poor condition and that 4 of them were vacant and open to the public. He directed the issuance of \u201c30 day notices.\u201d On 21 May notices were sent to Mrs. Jarvis advising her that 305, 307 and 309 were \u201copen to [the] public and in hazardous condition\u201d and alleging the violation of certain ordinances. She was directed to \u201crectify [these \u25a0conditions] by rehabilitating or razing [the] building[s].\u201d She was ordered to obtain the necessary permits within 30 days (21 June) and to \u201ccorrect these * * * conditions on or before\u201d 22 June. Failure to comply, she was told, would \u201cmake it necessary to take action in accordance with the provisions of law.\u201d On the day following (22 May) identical notices were sent in respect of 303 and 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Mr. Glick made another inspection on 4 June. He reported no progress had been made and that the houses had been vandalized. On 11 June Mr. Hayes applied for, paid for, and obtained permits to rehabilitate the houses. He estimated, and the applications (and permits) so state, that the cost per house would be $200.00 and that the work would be completed by 11 \u2022September. He set his men to repairing the windows, doors and plaster and preparing the houses for the installation of plumbing. He explained that, in these circumstances, the doors, windows and plumbing are not put in place until a tenant is ready to move in, otherwise they would promptly be broken or .stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Charles F. Resting, the City\u2019s supervisor of building inspection, inspected the properties on 15 July. He said the \u201cwindows were out,\u201d the \u201cdoors were out\u201d and that \u201cbecause no work had been done\u201d he requested that \u201ca ten-day legal action warning * * * be sent out\u201d to Mrs. Jarvis. That such letters \u25a0or notices were not sent is conceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">On or about 21 July a police officer shot a man who lived at 306 N. Parrish Street. The ensuing excitement and agitation attracted the attention of the press and some local minis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ters, one of whom, the Rev. Mr. Marcus Wood, testified as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cAfter the shooting incident, we received word that there was tension in the community, so I went in the community as a minister and I saw the condition, the vacant houses and so on, and I then came down to the Mayor\u2019s office; I discussed the situation with the Mayor [Theodore R. McKeldin] and he said, \u2018I\u2019ll go up there.\u2019 He called his chauffeur and took us up to Parrish Street, and Channel 13 news cameras were there. We went into the vacant houses, they were already open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Mr. Wood said the Mayor \u201cpromised that he would have Mr. Deitrich [Buildings Inspection Engineer] * * * see that remedial steps would be taken almost immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">There was other testimony produced by the City but little of it rose above the level of adjectival generalities such as \u201csqualid, dilapidated slum areas,\u201d and vague references to \u201cdrinking, glue sniffing and wild parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The record does not disclose what, if anything, the Mayor did about it. About a week later, however, on 27 July, Mr. Deitrich issued a work order to Harford Contracting Co., directing it to raze the dwellings at 303-5-7-9 N. Parrish Street. Since Harford was the lowest of 3 bidders it seems reasonable to assume that the project had been under way for some days before 27 July.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Early in the morning of 29 July, Mr. Hayes, who had just returned from a week\u2019s vacation, visited the properties. The doors and windows had been repaired and were ready to be replaced, and \u201cextensive plastering [had been] done on the inside.\u201d The houses were ready for occupancy, he said, and when a tenant could be obtained the doors, windows and plumbing would \u201cbe installed approximately simultaneously with the occupancy of the house.\u201d The properties had not been posted or boarded up by the City and neither he nor Mrs. Jarvis had any warning of the impending demolition. Satisfied with the efforts of his workmen Mr. Hayes went off on some other business. Later in the day, after a call from his wife, he hurried back to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Parrish Street and saw for himself that the houses were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Mr. Hayes pointed out in his testimony that there was a common wall between 301 and 303 and that in razing 303 considerable damage had been done to the wall and to the roof of 301. He patched the roof but the cost of repairing the wall was more than he felt justified in spending. When the tenant, who had become apprehensive about the wall, moved out he had the house demolished. The suit against the city for damages was filed in October 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The case was tried before Sodaro, J., without a jury, on <em>7 </em>November 1966. In an opinion filed 16 November he found as a fact that the properties were \u201ca public nuisance,\u201d that they were \u201cunsafe and unsanitary,\u201d that they \u201cconstituted a menace to the public health\u201d and that the City\u2019s decision to raze the properties was proper. He held \u201cthat the City under the provisions of the applicable City Ordinances had the right to raze the properties.\u201d He also found that Hayes had expended $561.00 for labor and materials prior to the demolition and $75.00 on 301 after the demolition. Judgment was rendered in favor of Mrs. Jarvis against the City for $636.00. Both Mrs. Jarvis and the City have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Mrs. Jarvis contends the trial judge has misconstrued the applicable ordinances. The City, oddly enough, disclaims the ordinances and insists that, since neither party introduced them into evidence, there was nothing for the trial judge to construe. We think it likely that he had the ordinances in mind, at least, because he held that \u201cunder the provisions of the <em>applicable City Ordinances\u201d </em>the City had the \u201cright to raze the properties.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) However, we shall agree with the City that the ordinances are not properly before us. <em>Strickler v. Bd. of Co. Commrs., </em>242 Md. 290, 298, 219 A. 2d 58 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The City points to the court\u2019s finding that the properties were a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d and a \u201cmenace to the public health\u201d and, in these circumstances, it argues, it was wholly justified, under the police power alone, in abating the nuisance in any peaceable manner, citing <em>Md. Tel. Co. v. </em>Ruth, 106 Md. 644, 68 Atl. 358 (1907); <em>Honolulu v. Cavness, </em>364 P. 2d <em>646 </em>(Hawaii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>1961) ; and <em>Perepletchikoff v. Los Angeles, </em>345 P. 2d 261 (Cal. 1959). It is true, of course, that summary action may be necessary in an emergency to protect the public health or safety, <em>Deems v. M. &amp; C. C. of Balto., </em>80 Md. 164, 30 Atl. 648 (1894), but the situation presented here is, in our judgment, a long way from that kind of emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that Mr. Glick\u2019s visit on 28 April was anything more than a routine inspection. His report (on 303 \u2014 the only one in evidence) consists of a mimeographed form, of the \u201cYes \u2014 No\u201d type, upon which he placed check marks in some of the blank squares. The information thereby conveyed was to the effect that 303 was a row house which had been vacant for a year or more and \u201cneed[ed] extensive work to be made habitable,\u201d that the roof was in place, no walls were missing, windows and doors were broken or unlocked, that no condemnation notice had been posted nor was there a \u201cFor Sale\u201d or \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign in evidence, that there was no indication of fire in the structure, which contained rubbish and debris, that the grounds were unsanitary, that the property was not on the tax delinquency list, that the general quality of the block was poor and that there were more than 4 vacant structures in the block on both sides of the street. Mr. Glick\u2019s recommendation that a 30 day notice be sent hardly signifies an emergency, and even less does the fact that 24 more days passed before the notices were actually mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The notice itself did not have about it an air of urgency. It advised Mrs. Jarvis that her building was \u201copen to [the] public and in hazardous condition.\u201d Nothing was said about its being a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d or a \u201cmenace to the public health.\u201d She was given the choice of \u201crehabilitating or razing\u201d it. It purported to be a \u201ccondemnation\u201d notice (the word \u201cviolation\u201d was stricken out and \u201ccondemnation\u201d inserted) but she was given another 30 days in which to obtain a \u201cproper permit,\u201d which seems odd in view of the statement, in the notice, that completion was required within the same 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Mr. Glick\u2019s report that his inspection on 4 June indicated no progress and that vandals had been active does not seem to have excited anyone. Mr. Hayes obtained the permits on 11 June, within the 30 day period. Each permit states the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>pletion date to be September 1964, a leisurely pace scarcely to' be associated with the concept of emergency. The permit also' stated that it did not \u201cextend the time limit given by the enforcement division nor excuse the appearance for hearings,\u201d' suggesting that nothing drastic would happen without an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Mr. Resting visited the neighborhood on 15 July. The record does not disclose just what he inspected or precisely what his findings were but he said he requested the sending of a \u201c10 day notice.\u201d That no one bothered to see to the sending of such a notice tends to negate the idea that an emergency was-at hand. The notion persists that the only emergency extant was-the desirability of placating an emotionally aroused neighborhood with some sort of an overt act. There is nothing in the record to show that the destruction of Mrs. Jarvis\u2019 property reasonably could have been expected to accomplish such a purpose or that such a purpose had, in fact, been accomplished. We think it is entirely clear that this was not an emergency situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Less than 6 months ago we considered the efforts of the town, of Midland to accomplish the demolition of a structure known as the \u201cOpera House.\u201d <em>Burns v. Midland, </em>247 Md. 548, 234 A. 2d 162 (1967). Judge Oppenheimer, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cA basic requirement of due process in any adver- . sary proceeding, whether that proceeding be private litigation or the exercise of governmental power against an individual, is that the person proceeded against be 'given notice and an adequate opportunity to contest the claim against him. <em>Travelers v. Nationwide, </em>244 Md. 401, 406, 224 A. 2d 285 (1966), and authorities therein cited. These requirements may not be applicable when the necessity for summary action in an emergency situation to protect the public health or safety is clear. <em>Deems v. M. &amp; C. C. of Balto., </em>80 Md. 164, 30 Atl. 648 (1894) ; see also <em>Adams v. Commissioners of Trappe, </em>204 Md. 165, 173-74, 102 A. 2d 830 (1954); <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U. S. 523, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930, 941 (1967); and Annot. 14 A.L.R.2d 73, 78 (1950). Absent such an emergency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>even though the scope of a legislative enactment is within the police power, action under the enactment is invalid unless the procedure complies with constitutional requirements. <em>Londoner v. Denver, </em>210 U. S. 373 (1908); <em>Camara, supra; Town of Somerset v. Board, </em>245 Md. 52, 65-67, 225 A. 2d 294 (1966) ; and cases therein cited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">It is not possible to conclude, from the evidence in this record, that Mrs. Jarvis had <em>any </em>notice of the City\u2019s intention to demolish her property, nor that she was given <em>any </em>opportunity to contest it. The trial judge\u2019s holding to the contrary must, of course, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Despite his finding that the City had the right to raze the property, which, as we have said, was erroneous, the trial judge awarded Mrs. Jarvis $561.00 \u201cfor labor and material for the partial work done on the four houses\u201d and $75.00 for the repair of the roof of 301. In light of what we have said, however, we think Mrs. Jarvis was also entitled to have considered the other evidence of damage which appears in the record and which was not controverted. Mr. Sandler, a real estate expert, said each property was worth $1,500.00, that each lot still owned by Mrs. Jarvis was worth $360.00, making each house destroyed worth $1,140.00. Mr. Hayes, using somewhat the same figures arrived at a valuation of $1,100.00. Mr. Hayes also spoke of an average annual net income of $954.26 for the 5 houses. Then there is the cost of razing 301 which Mr. Hayes said was $350.00. Of course, the trier of fact was not bound by such evidence, even though the City made no effort to counter it by opposing testimony. Nevertheless, such evidence should not have been ignored. We shall remand the case for such further proceedings as may be necessary to resolve the matter of the damages to be awarded to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial on the single issue of additional damages. Costs to be paid by the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
