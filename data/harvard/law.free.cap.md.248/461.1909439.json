The sole limitation is contained in Section 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\"><em>\u201cAnd provided also, </em>that said corporation shall not be authorized to make any bills or notes in the nature or description of bank notes, or to loan any part of the funds deposited to any director of said corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">From this beginning there evolved The Savings Bank of Baltimore (the \u201cBank\u201d), a mutual savings bank which at 31 December 1965 had total assets of more than $341,000,000 and deposits of more than $306,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">On 31 December 1957 The Metropolitan Savings Bank of Baltimore (\u201cMetropolitan\u201d), also a mutual savings bank, was merged into the Bank. Metropolitan had been originally incorporated on 22 March 1867 as the \u201cBeneficial Savings Fund Society of Baltimore\u201d by Chapter 237 of the Acts of 1867, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Chapter 63 of the Acts of 1876 amended its charter to change the name to Metropolitan without otherwise altering the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Commencing in 1869, Beneficial Savings Fund Society offered checking account facilities to its customers, and at the time of Metropolitan\u2019s merger into the Bank, there were 116 such accounts with aggregate balances of $1,917,438. These were continued by the Bank, and although some were closed and some opened, the number remained relatively constant until 1966, when the number of such accounts increased to 644 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>as a result of the Bank\u2019s determination to increase checking account services to its depositors.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Certainly since 1932, and possibly since 1910, the reports of the State Bank Commissioner on his examination of Metropolitan, and later of the Bank, reflected the existence of the checking accounts. These were identified in the Commissioner\u2019s reports as \u201cDemand Deposits (Checking)\u201d in 1932, 1934-1936; as \u201cTime Deposits (Checking)\u201d in 1936; and as \u201cDemand Deposit \u2014 Individual Accounts\u201d from 1937 until 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Date in 1965, the Bank advised the Bank Commissioner of its desire to make checking accounts a service available to all its customers. Its right to do so was questioned by The Equitable Trust Company. The Bank Commissioner sought the advice of the Attorney General, who submitted a formal opinion on 28 March 1966.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>When the Bank questioned the validity of the position taken by the Attorney General, the appellant, Robert W. Thon, Jr., president of the Bank, was advised that it was the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the Bank Commissioner to take steps under Maryland Code (1957), Art. 11, \u00a7 11, <em>as amended, </em>(Supp. 1964), to remove Thon from office. The Bank and Thon then instituted proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ings in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City for declaratory relief and to enjoin the action contemplated by the Bank Commissioner. The appellees, The Equitable Trust Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>(\u201cEquitable\u201d) and Suburban Trust Company (\u201cSuburban\u201d) relying on Maryland Rule 208 a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sought and received leave to intervene in the case; filed an answer; and actively participated in the trial of the case below. From the decree denying the relief prayed and dismissing the bill of complaint, the Bank and Thon appealed. While the Chancellor\u2019s declaration was quite brief, the bill should not have been dismissed. This Court has said time and again that seldom, if ever, should a bill or petition in a declaratory judgment proceeding be dismissed without a declaration of the rights of the parties. See <em>Myers v. Chief of Fire Bureau, </em>237 Md. 583, 207 A. 2d 467 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The principal question raised by the appeal is whether the Bank is prohibited, by the provisions of its charter or by existing law, from permitting its depositors to make withdrawals by check. Under our view of the case, a .subsidiary question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>relating to the right of Equitable and Suburban to intervene, need not be determined <em>by </em>us.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In support of their contention that the decision of the lower court was in error, the appellants contend that neither the charter of the Bank nor any statutory provision is violated when depositors were permitted to make withdrawals by check.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">They cite Maryland Code (1957), Art. 11, \u00a7 41 (a), <em>as </em>amended, (Supp. 1964) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Receipt, investment and withdrawal of funds. </em>\u2014Every Savings institution existing under the laws of the State of Maryland, or which may hereafter be incorporated, transacting strictly a savings bank business, shall be capable of receiving from any person or persons, or bodies corporate or politic, any deposit of money, which shall be invested or loaned out on good security, in the discretion of the directors; provided, no part of the funds of such corporation shall be loaned to any officer, director or employee thereof. <em>The deposits in any sewings institution may be withdremn at such time and in such manner as its bylaws may permit, but such institution may at any time require a depositor to give a notice, not exceeding ninety days, of his intention to withdraw the whole or any part of his deposit. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">which should be read in conjunction with Article VIII of the by-laws of the Bank, apparently adopted on 10 November 1965: \u201cARTICLE VIII \u2014 SPECIAL PURPOSE ACCOUNTS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">Section 1. In addition to the provision for savings accounts, as set forth in Article VII, accounts may be opened for Special Purpose Savings of the type known as Christmas Savings Accounts, Term Savings Accounts, and by other designations; and for Checking Accounts on which the depositor shall have the privilege of drawing by checks payable to the depositor himself or to the order of any other person, firm or corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">Section 2. Such deposits shall be accepted by the bank in such amounts and upon such terms and condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>tions as the President may from time to time fix and determine, subject, however, to these by-laws and to such rules and regulations as the Board of Directors may from time to time enact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">Section 3. Checking Accounts shall be accepted subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">(1) Deposits in Checking Accounts may be withdrawn at any time except as stated below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">(2) The bank may, by a resolution of its Board of Directors posted in the main lobby of the bank and in each branch office, require depositors of such accounts to give 30 days\u2019 notice in writing of any intended withdrawal from such accounts. After the posting of such Resolution and as long as the same remains in effect, the bank may require such period of notice before any withdrawal; except that any check shall be paid when presented if before the posting of such Resolution such check had been drawn and transferred by the depositor to a person, firm or corporation other than the depositor himself and if said check would have been legally payable if said Resolution had not been posted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">(3) The Bank may give notice to any depositor requiring such depositor to withdraw the entire amount in any checking account of such depositor. Such notice shall also advise such depositor that the bank reserves the right after a date specified in said notice not to make payment of any check drawn on such account; and after the date so specified, the bank shall not be obliged to make any payment from such account, except for the purpose of closing such account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">Section 4. Checking accounts shall not be entitled to be credited with interest payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The appellants then point out that the only limitation con* tained in the charter of the Bank appears in Section 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201cProvided always, that such by-laws or rules be not contrary to the constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Maryland; And provided al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>so, that said corporation shall not be authorised to make any bills or notes in the nature or description of bank notes, or to loan any part of the funds deposited to any director of said corporation.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">At the trial of the case below, the appellants were able to show that six mutual savings banks in Baltimore, including Metropolitan, prior to its merger into the Bank, had permitted depositors to make withdrawals by check or to maintain checkings accounts; that the existence of such accounts had been known to the Bank Commissioner since 1910, had been the subject of comments by him, but had not been prohibited; and that in the year 1965, .immediately preceding the threat of action by the Commissioner, the Bank had issued 73,000 treasurer\u2019s checks to depositors making withdrawals and sold 247,-000 money orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The appellants argue, and we think correctly, that this provides ample support for their contention that there is a demand for the service which they propose to provide. It is interesting to note that no one seems to regard this activity as a violation of the charter prohibition \u201cto make any bills or notes in the nature or description of bank notes\u201d and we agree that the prohibition cannot be regarded as an indication of legislative intent, but must be viewed in its proper historical context: <em>i.e., </em>the fact that state banks customarily issued bank notes until about 1866, and the commitment made by the Maryland Legislature in 1813 (Acts of 1813, Chapter 122) \u201cnot to grant a charter of incorporation to any other banking institution to be established in the city of Baltimore before the first day of January eighteen hundred and thirty-five and the end of the session of the General Assembly next thereafter.\u201d This act was construed in <em>Duncan v. The Maryland Savings Institution, </em>10 G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>&amp; J. 299, 309-10 (1838) as meaning that \u201cno charter of incorporation should be granted to any banking institution to be established within the city or precincts of Baltimore, clothed with the valuable and important power of issuing negotiable notes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The appellees have mounted a two-pronged attack on the position taken by the Bank. First, they argue a lack of statutory authority, emphasizing the distinction drawn between mutual savings banks on the one hand, and banks and trust companies on the other, in the regulatory pattern and distinguish <em>Hudson County National Bank v. The Provident Institution for Savings in New Jersey, </em>80 N. J. Super. 339, 193 A. 2d 697, ail\u2019d per curiam 44 N. J. 282, 208 A. 2d 409 (1965), relied upon by the appellants, on the ground that the provisions of the New Jersey statute are not controlling; and second, they urge on the court the doctrinaire classification of banks of deposit, of discount and of circulation recognized in <em>State v. German Savings Bank, </em>103 Md. 196, 63 A. 481 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The expert witness produced by the appellees, Professor Walter A. Morton of the University of Wisconsin, whose field of specialization is money and banking, traced the history of banking from the sixteenth century goldsmiths to the present day. He drew the distinction between the savings banks established in the early nineteenth century and the banks of issue of that day; at least inferentially indicated that the discount, deposit and issue concept was outworn; pointed out that with the establishment of the national banking system in 1865, the power to issue bank notes was effectively restricted to national banks and denied to state banks, and that state banks thereafter prospered because of the increased use of checks as a medium of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The principal thrust of Professor Morton\u2019s testimony, however, was that the basic distinction between a commercial bank and a savings bank is the commercial bank\u2019s ability to create money through the extension of credit. In simple terms, this means that the demand deposits of a commercial bank, being part of the nation\u2019s money supply, can be made available to a borrower by a bookkeeping entry, and may, in fact, never leave the bank. Time deposits of a savings bank are, theoretically at least, fully invested; not immediately spendable; and not regarded by economists as part of the money supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Without presuming to substitute our views for the expertise of a recognized authority, practical considerations cannot be overlooked. We fail to find in the bank\u2019s charter or in the applicable statutes the expression of legislative intent or the denial of authority urged on us by the appellees. Moreover, the circumstance that mutual savings banks have permitted withdrawals by check since 1869, and since 1910 with the knowledge and at least tacit consent of the Bank Commissioner, is not lightly to be swept aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">If, as would seem to be conceded, a depositor of the Bank, on making a withdrawal, has the option of requesting cash, or a treasurer\u2019s check, or of purchasing a money order, it seems abundantly clear to us that according him a fourth option of drawing a check on his own account, whether or not he presents his passbook, is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">From the standpoint of theory only, it seems to us that Professor Morton failed to give proper weight to two aspects of the problem: first, to Mr. Thon\u2019s testimony that it had never been the practice of the Bank to credit the proceeds of a borrowing made by a depositor to the depositor\u2019s account, which would negate the conclusion that money was being created by the extension of credit. Second, Article VIII of the by-laws of the Bank subjected accounts subject to withdrawal by check to the same 30 day notice of withdrawal limitation which was theretofore applicable to savings accounts, as sanctioned by Maryland Code (1957), Art. 11, \u00a7 41 (a), <em>as amended, </em>(Supp. 1964), and this limitation was incorporated in the agreement printed on the signature cards. To us, this negates the assumption that deposits made in accounts subject to withdrawal by check can be characterized as demand deposits. <em>Cf. </em>Maryland Code (1957), Art. 11, \u00a782.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Assuming that the two limitations described in the immediately preceding paragraph are maintained, it is our opinion that the Attorney General was correct in his final conclusion that the Bank could receive deposits subject to withdrawal by checks signed by the depositor, provided that funds so received are invested by the Bank. We cannot agree with the conclusion of the Chancellor that it was unlawful for the Bank to accept and maintain deposits subject to withdrawal by check.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>It follows that the court below was in error in entering a decree denying the relief prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for the entry of a declaratory decree in conformity with this opinion; costs to be paid by appellees, the Equitable Trust Company and Suburban Trust Company.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. 1.

We are of the opinion that no such right exists, and that the practice is contrary to the banking laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Section 41(a) of Article 11 of the Annotated Code of Maryland ordains that \u2018[ejvery savings institution * * * transacting <em>strictly a savings bank business, </em>shall be capable of receiving from any person or persons, or bodies corporate or politic, any deposit of money, <em>which shall be invested or loaned out on good security, in the discretion of the directors; </em>* * * \u2019, and further that the deposits \u2018may be withdrawn at such time and in such manner as its by-laws may permit, * * * \u2019. The statute does not define the business of a savings bank, but the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in <em>Bulakowski v. Philadelphia Sav.

There is no capital stock, nor are there stockholders in such institutions, and it is not a bank in the commercial sense of that word. It is not, however, for all purposes, a charitable society and under certain instances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>has been held to be a business corporation. West\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 186; Bank for Savings v. Collector, 70 U. S. (3 Wall.) 495, 18 L. Ed. 207. The relation between the institution and the depositor is, in some aspects, that of a trustee and cestui que trust (Barrett v. Bloomfield Savings Institution, 64 N. J. Eq. 425, 433, 54 Atl. 543; State v. People\u2019s National Bank, 75 N. H. 27, 29, 70 Atl. 542, 21 Ann. Cas. 1204); * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">This definition is in substantial agreement with that contained in Michie\u2019s <em>Banks and Banking </em>(Vol. 3, 1913), Section 389, viz: \u2018banks of deposit for the accumulation of small savings belonging to the industrious and thrifty.\u2019 In <em>Bank of Redemption v. Boston, </em>8 S. Ct. 772, 125 U. S. 60, 31 L. Ed. 689 (1888), the Supreme Court, in determining the liability of a savings institution for franchise taxes imposed upon \u2018moneyed capital\u2019 emphasized that savings banks were \u2018organized for the purpose of <em>investing the savings of small depositors </em>and not as banking institutions in the commercial sense of that phrase.\u2019 While the wisdom of continuing to characterize savings banks as depositaries for the funds of the poor or small depositors may be questioned, we are of the opinion that the essence of the foregoing definitions prevails and it is to these definitions that we must look in order to find the legislative intendment in using such language as \u2018strictly a savings bank business.\u2019 We conclude, therefore, that the business of a savings bank in this State is strictly limited to receiving deposits of money, which deposits shall be either invested or loaned out (the decision as to such investing or lending being that of the directors) and paying to the depositors, after due allowance for operating expenses, the dividends and interest earned by the investing or lending. Whether the deposits are withdrawn by presentation of a passbook, by an order presented to the bank for payment, or by check is a matter to be determined by the by-laws of the bank. What the statute does require, however, is that the deposits received shall be invested or loaned out by the directors; and what the statute does not permit is the receipt of deposits which are not invested or loaned out, and which are subject to withdrawal by check.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">IT.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">This does not mean, however, that a savings bank cannot acquire the powers of a commercial bank. In 7 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>50, we had occasion to determine whether the Franklin Savings Bank of Frederick was in fact a savings bank, as its name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>seemed to indicate, or a commercial bank, a term we use here for convenience to refer to institutions described in \u00a7\u00a7 28 through 38, inclusive, of Article 11. At that time the Court of Appeals had already decided that \u2018the character of a bank or other institution does not depend upon its name or title, but upon the nature of the business conducted by it and the enterprise in which it is engaged.\u2019 <em>State v. German Savings Bank, </em>103 Md. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In determining that the Franklin Savings Bank was a commercial bank and not a savings bank, it was noted that the bank had, on June 27, 1881, through its Board of Directors, determined that its weekly savings deposits would thereafter be treated as capital stock and its depositors were given certificates which, to all intents and purposes, became certificates of ownership in a commercial bank rather than deposits in a mutual savings bank. Ownership by stockholders alone, however, was not enough to classify a savings bank as a commercial bank (see 5 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>43), and, after examining the totality of the bank\u2019s activities, it was concluded that the bank had \u2018abandoned its savings bank business and is now conducting a general banking business * * * \u2019. <em>State v. Central Trust Company, </em>106 Md. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">It is apparent from a review of the provisions of Article 11 relating to banking institutions that the legislative scheme of regulation is predicated upon the basic difference between mutual savings institutions and banks and trust companies, the latter create credit, the former do not \u2014 therefore Section 77 imposes reserve requirements upon the latter and not the former. See also \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 90. Banks and trust companies are prohibited from carrying bills payable or rediscounts for longer than 90 days (Section 79), from imposing a service charge on deposits restricted by the bank commissioner (Section 83) and from certifying checks unless the drawer has on deposit a sum of money equal to the amount of the check, draft or order (Section 93). A series of other specific sections relating to capital, surplus and stockholders obviously apply only to banks and trust companies, but we think it is significant that the legislature, when such sections may apply to savings banks having capital stock, specifically included language to that effect. See Section 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Of greater significance to the question presently before us is that many of these sections, restricting the activities of banks and trust companies, relate to checking accounts, abuses that are associated with checking accounts, and the creation of credit. When these sections are considered, together with the fact that the ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ation of credit through checking accounts is a basic technique of modern banking, we are not inclined to conclude that the legislature would exclude savings banks from the restrictions imposed upon banks and trust companies if savings banks had the right, under Article 11, to such checking services through the expedient of amending their by-laws and without any further legislative sanction, or, at the very least, an amendment of the charter to convert the savings bank to a bank or trust company and therefore automatically subject it to the restrictions imposed by Article 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">This result is compelled by precedent. In <em>State v. German Savings </em>Bank, supra, the Court of Appeals was called upon to decide, <em>inter alia, </em>whether or not the German Savings Bank was authorized to carry on a general banking business. The bank was incorporated under the general laws of Maryland authorizing the formation of savings institutions for the purpose of conducting a savings bank on April 11, 1895. To authorize it to carry on a general banking business, it was necessary to enact Chapter 266, Laws of Maryland, 1898, to \u2018amend the charter of the bank\u2019 and to \u2018authorize such bank to engage in and conduct a general banking business.\u2019 Thus, it appears that a bank chartered to conduct a savings bank business is limited to \u2018strictly a savings bank business\u2019 unless it amends its charter to obtain the authority needed to conduct a general banking business. In so doing, it subjects itself to the appropriate provisions of Article 11 regulating the conduct of commercial banks, and the legislative scheme of dividing banking institutions into various categories, dependent upon the nature of the business being done, and imposing requirements on each category deemed necessary to protect the public interest, is not frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">We have given careful consideration to the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>Hudson County National Bank v. Provident Institution for Savings, et al., </em>44 N. J. 282, 208 A. 2d 409, decided March 22, 1965. The issue there was whether a savings bank in New Jersey could accept deposits subject to withdrawal by check. The existence of checking accounts in New Jersey Savings Banks was upheld. The New Jersey statute, however, permitted withdrawal of funds \u2018according to the usual custom of savings banks\u2019. The statute was enacted in 1948, and at that time a \u2018number of savings banks had checking accounts * * * \u2019. The Court authorized the continuation of the practice in New Jersey, not so much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>because it was the usual custom of savings banks everywhere to have checking accounts, but because the phrase was so indecisive as to indicate an intent not to forbid the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Section 41(a) of Article 11, on the other hand, is far from indecisive. It plainly states that savings banks must conduct \u2018strictly a savings bank business\u2019 and continues to impose the requirement that the deposits of money received by the savings bank \u2018shall be invested or loaned out on good security * * *\u2019. The statute does not say that such banks may receive deposits solely for the purpose of permitting the depositor to issue orders and drafts upon the bank for checking purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that savings banks in Maryland have no authority to receive deposits which are not invested or loaned out and which are subject to withdrawal by draft or check. This does not mean, however, that deposits received by savings banks which are received for the purpose of investment or lending out may not be subject to withdrawal by check for the convenience of the depositor. What the law forbids, in our opinion, is the depositing of funds in checking accounts <em>per se </em>in saving institutions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">.
