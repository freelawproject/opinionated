Some 40 to 50 friends and relatives had been invited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>celebrate the birthday of Mrs. Maszczenski\u2019s sister, Helen Gajewski. Among the guests were the appellant (Telak), his wife and 7 year old son. They arrived at the Maszczenski home in Pikesville, Baltimore County, around 1:00 p.m. At about 4:30 p.m. tall, husky, 35 year old Telak mounted the diving board, dove into the pool and struck his head against the bottom. Face down, he floated to the surface, paralyzed and \u201cin terrific pain.\u201d Ever since he has been a quadriplegic, helpless and utterly without hope. On 7 May 19'63 he sued the Maszczenskis, Van Dorn (who sold the pool), and Bacharach (architects and professional engineers). On 9 February 1966 trial began before Jenifer, J., and a jury, in the Baltimore County Circuit Court. After 9 days of trial the plaintiff concluded his case whereupon all defendants moved for directed verdicts. At this juncture Judge Jenifer fell ill. The parties chose not to wait for his recovery. They agreed to continue before the same jury and Judge Proctor to whom was read all of the testimony and who read all of the pleadings and examined all of the exhibits. Judge Proctor heard argument on the motions for several days and on 3 March he directed the entry of verdicts in favor of all of the defendants. We agree, regretfully, that his decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">There was a time when swimming pools were appurtenances of the well-to-do. During the past 10 years, however, private residential pools have become both inexpensive and commonplace. In Baltimore County alone, the evidence reveals, 419 private pools were installed between 1956 and 1959. The Maszczenski pool is a fiberglass shell 35 feet long and 15 feet wide. Its maximum depth is 7 feet below the ground level. Its 5 preformed sections, each 7 feet long, were manufactured in Florida by Delorich, Inc. They were delivered to Maszczenski (also called Tony) in the late summer of 1959, arriving in a truck bearing a Florida license. Maszczenski was present during the unloading.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">It was shown that at least one other company, from 1955 to 1961, manufactured and marketed identical pools in at least 4 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where they were approved for use in residences and small motels. When Van Dorn began selling the Delorich pools in 1955 the county authorities required the pool to be approved by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>architect. Van Dorn engaged Bacharach to do whatever was necessary in this regard. The county engineering authorities, in 1956, approved the drawings developed by Bacharach.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Two blocks from the Maszczenski home, a neighbor had installed a Delorich pool. Except that it was <em>7 </em>feet (one section) shorter it was identical with the Maszczenski pool. Along with his brother-in-law, Thomas Gajewski, he visited the property, examined the pool and discussed it with his neighbor for several hours. Shortly thereafter he bought the pool from Van Dorn. Gajewski (on behalf of Maszczenski) applied for the required building permit, submitting with his application copies of Bacharach drawings which had been approved by county authorities in 1956. The zoning, engineering and health officials approved the application (including the Bacharach drawings), and the permit was issued on 5 August 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Maszczenski employed Gajewski to supervise the installation of the pool. Gajewski was a maintenance man at the Bethlehem Steel plant. He could read blueprints and he had built 3 or 4 houses, including his own. When the excavation was finished Gajewski glued the 5 sections together, embedded the shell in the ground and filled it with water. By the end of the year all of the work was finished except for the laying of the tile walkway around the edge of the pool. This was accomplished in the summer of 1960 with the help of Telak who knew \u201chow to lay tile\u201d whereas Gajewski did not. They were close friends, \u201cjust like brothers.\u201d Gajewski explained to Telak how he had put it all together. Since Delorich did not provide a diving board with the pool, Gajewski procured one from another source and installed it for Maszczenski.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Maszczenski\u2019s maintenance of his pool was such that it \u201cwas crystal clear \u2014 at all times.\u201d \u201cIt was very clear\u201d on 4 July 1962. The pool had been used by Maszczenski\u2019s 4 daughters and others all during the .spring, summer and early fall of 1960 and 1961, and during spring and early summer of 1962. Judge Jenifer refused to let Maszczenski answer questions as to whether any one had ever been injured in the pool but his brother Chester, who works for him and who used the pool from time to time, was allowed to say that, prior to Telak\u2019s injury, he had no knowledge of any injuries to anyone using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>pool. An expert witness produced by Telak admitted that no one, including counsel for Telak, had informed him that, between 1956 and 1961, 18 identical pools with similar diving boards had been installed in Baltimore County and adjoining counties, and \u201cthat no word of any injuries in any of those pools\u201d had ever come to the dealer who sold them. The appellees stress Telak\u2019s admission that no pool of the type here involved has ever been proven to be \u201cdangerous or hazardous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Chester testified that once in July 1961 he dove from the diving board and as he \u201ccame out of * * * [his] dive and took a stroke, * * * [he] brushed the ledge of the pool, the upgrade of the pool\u201d with his forehead. He was \u201cnot in any way injured.\u201d There were no \u201cmarks of any kind on\u201d him. He stayed in the water and \u201ckept on fooling around\u201d with his brother, Michael. Eater on he \u201ccasually mentioned\u201d to Tony that he \u201chad touched bottom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Telak, in his original declaration, described himself as \u201can expert swimmer and athletic in build.\u201d When he was a \u201ckid\u201d he dove from the piers into Baltimore harbor. As he grew older he continued to swim and dive in pools in Baltimore and at Air Force bases in this country and abroad. Additional experience was gained over the years in the ocean at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Ocean City, Maryland, Wildwood and Atlantic City, New Jersey and in the Chesapeake Bay and the Santee and Columbia rivers in South Carolina. He swam frequently from the pier of a neighbor at Rock Creek (in Anne Arundel County) where the water varied in depth from 6 inches to 12 feet and where one cannot see the bottom except in shallow water.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Telak stood near the pool and watched his son during much of the time the boy was in the water. It was close to 4:30 p.m. when he and Gajewski put on bathing trunks and walked to the shallow end of the pool where the water was from 3 to 4 feet deep. Telak said he had never before been in the pool. After looking to see if there were any children in the way he \u201cjust shoved off\u201d in a \u201cshallow dive\u201d toward the deep end of the pool. When he stood up he was in about 4 feet of water. He swam over to where his son was standing, spoke to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>went to the ladder and climbed out of the pool. The ladder was about midway on one side where the water was waist deep. He walked to the diving board, intending, he said, to dive so that he could go the length of the pool under water and surface near his son at the shallow end. As he stood on the end of the board he could see Gajewski who was standing on the bottom in about 4 feet of water and who was no more than 15 feet directly in front of him. He \u201cjust shoved off in a normal shallow dive.\u201d He was unable to say precisely where on the bottom he struck his head but he placed on the drawing an \u201cX\u201d mark at what he thought was the spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">It would not be amiss, perhaps, to add that Van Dorn is owned by Wayne Nield and Frances, his wife, and that, as a sideline, they began to sell Delorich pools sometime in 1955. Neither of them has any technical training or experience and their knowledge of the design and manufacture of the pools appears to have been limited to the information contained in the Delorich literature, all of which was made available to the Bacharachs when they were employed by the Nields to prepare drawings for submission to the county authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We shall deal with Telak\u2019s assignments of error in the order in which they appear in his brief and in so doing we shall state whatever additional facts may be necessary. We are required, of course, to consider the evidence and all logical and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in a light most favorable to Telak.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Although Judge Proctor found that Telak was a \u201cguest\u201d of the Maszczenskis\u2019 he restricted his legal status to that of a \u201cbare licensee\u201d to whom is owed only the duty of abstaining from intentional injury. Telak, charging error, claims he is entitled to the status of \u201csocial guest\u201d to whom, he insists, is owed a duty just short of the duty owed to an invitee or business visitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Since the trial below we have considered, in two cases, what status is to be accorded the social guest. <em>Paquin v. McGinnis, </em>246 Md. 569, 229 A. 2d 86 (1967) and <em>Stevens v. Dovre, </em>248 Md. 15, 234 A. 2d 596 (1967). In <em>Stevens, </em>Judge Marbury, who also wrote the opinion in <em>Paquin, </em>said, for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u201cThe duty of a home owner to social guests was first decided by this Court in the recent case of <em>Paquin v. McGinnis, </em>246 Md. 569, 229 A. 2d 86, where we stated the conditions imposing liability on a host as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">* * (1) the host knows or has reason to know of the condition and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such guests, and should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, and (2) the host fails to exercise reasonable care to make the condition safe, or to warn the guests of the condition and the risk involved, and (3) the guests do not know or have reason to know of the condition and the risk involved.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">We further said that * * the guest is expected to take the premises as the host uses them, and he may not expect that they will be prepared for his reception or that precautions will be taken for his safety in any manner in which the host did not prepare or take precautions for his own safety or the safety of the members of his family.\u2019 (Citing authorities.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201cWe think that for the purpose of determining the duty owed to a social guest that he stands in the position of a licensee. While in <em>Paquin </em>we did not specifically state that a social guest was a licensee the standards that were pronounced are those that would be applicable to licensees under the established case law of this state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">It should be observed that in equating \u201clicensee\u201d with \u201csocial guest,\u201d we intended \u201clicensee\u201d to mean a \u201clicensee by invitation\u201d and not a \u201cbare licensee\u201d to whom an owner owes a duty no greater than the duty he owes to a trespasser. <em>Carroll v. Spencer, </em>204 Md. 387, 393, 104 A. 2d 628 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Applying, as we are bound to do, the criteria announced in <em>Paquin </em>and <em>Stevens, </em>Judge Proctor\u2019s direction of a verdict for the Maszczenskis must, nevertheless, be upheld. The only evidence in the record which might be said to provide support for the contention that Maszczenski knew or had reason to know of a condition involving an unreasonable risk of harm to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>guests is the testimony of Chester Maszczenski concerning the incident in 1961 when he brushed \u201cthe upgrade of the pool\u201d with his forehead as he came out of a dive \u201cand took a stroke.\u201d He said he \u201ccasually mentioned\u201d to Tony that he had \u201ctouched bottom.\u201d It cannot be supposed, in the circumstances, that this trivial remark informed Maszczenski, or even suggested to him, that his guests would be exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm if they dived into the pool upon which he had lavished so much time, attention and expense. After all, the pool had been in constant use for 2 full seasons and a good part of the third season without injury to anyone. Maszczenski said he was \u201cnot a great swimmer,\u201d that he had been in the pool only once or twice and that he had never dived from the diving board. On several occasions he drained the pool and got down into it so he could clean it but it can hardly be said that he thereby acquired any information or knowledge he did not already have.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Telak seems to attach much importance to the fact that the maximum depth of the pool was only <em>7 </em>feet whereas the American Public Health Association, Inc. (1957 pamphlet)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> recommends \u201ca minimum safe-water depth of 8 feet for diving.\u201d In the case of diving platforms elevated 9 to 10 feet above the water a depth of 10 feet is recommended. As Judge Proctor said, there is nothing in the record to show that Maszczenski knew or should have known of these recommendations. In any event, the fact that the pool had a maximum depth of 7 feet is not especially significant because the water is only 5 feet deep at the spot where Telak thought he struck his head. Indeed, his first dive, from which he emerged unharmed, was into water which was but 3 to 4 feet deep. Moreover, during the few hours just before he \u201cshoved off in [the] normal shallow dive\u201d resulting in his injury he had acquired personal knowledge of the fact that not more than 15 feet out from the diving board the water was no more than 4 to 4J4 feet deep.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Judge Proctor set forth in considerable detail his reasons for directing a verdict in favor of Van Dorn. We shall discuss, in the order in which Judge Proctor dealt with them, the authorities cited by Telak in support of his assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Restatement, <em>Torts, </em>2d \u00a7 388, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cChattel Known to be Dangerous for Intended Use \u201cOne who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for another to use is subject to liability to those whom the supplier should expect to use the chattel with the consent of the other or to be endangered by its probable use, for physical harm caused by the use of the chattel in the manner for which and by a person for whose use it is supplied, if the supplier</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">(a) knows or has reason to know that the chattel is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">(b) has no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to inform them of its dangerous condition or of the facts which make it likely to be dangerous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\u201c <em>\u2018Reason to knots/ </em>means that the actor has knowledge of facts from which a reasonable man of ordinary intelligence or one of the superior intelligence of the actor would either infer the existence of the fact in question or would regard its existence as so highly probable that his conduct would be predicated upon the assumption that the fact did exist. <em>\u2018Should knots/ </em>indicates that the actor is under a duty to another to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the existence or non-existence of the fact in question and that he would ascertain the existence thereof in the proper performance of that duty.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Restatement, <em>Torts, </em>2d \u00a7 12, Comment a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>We agree with Judge Proctor, in light of the definitions above set forth, that there is no evidence in the record \u201cthat Van Dorn knew that the swimming pool would be dangerous for the intended use,\u201d and that even if it is assumed that the pool was dangerous for its intended use and that Van Dorn knew it, this was readily discoverable by Telak.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Telak next cited \u00a7 399 which provides that \u201ca seller of a chattel, manufactured by a third person, who sells it knowing that it is, or is likely to be, dangerous is subject to the liability as stated in \u00a7\u00a7 388-390.\u201d We had occasion to consider \u00a7\u00a7 388 and 399 in <em>Woolley v. Uebelhor, </em>239 Md. 318, 325, 211 A. 2d 302 (1965). Judge Hammond (now Chief Judge) said, for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cWe find no error in the court\u2019s directing a verdict for Chrysler [Corporation] and Banning [the dealer]. To make Chrysler liable to a user of the highway for a sudden and unanticipated failure of the brakes on the Woolley car, it must have known, or, from facts known to it, realized, that the car was, or was likely to be, dangerous in operation. Restatement, Torts Secs. 388 and 395; <em>Babylon v. Scruton, </em>215 Md. 299; <em>Twombley v. Puller Brush Co., </em>221 Md. 476. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">\u201cThe same considerations applied to Banning and justified its dismissal from the case. A vendor of a chattel which another has manufactured who sells it knowing that it is or is likely to be dangerous has the liability of a manufacturer if the dangerous condition causes the chattel to cause harm, Restatement, Torts Sec. 399, and such a vendor, like a manufacturer, is subject to liability if, although ignorant of the dangerous character or condition, he could have by the exercise of reasonable care discovered it by utilizing the peculiar opportunity and competence which he has or should have as a dealer in such chattels. Restatement, Torts Sec. 402. The evidence discloses that Banning had no actual knowledge of any defect in the Woolley car until after the accident and offers no basis for a finding that it did not at all times exercise reasonable care in respect of the braking system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>We think it is clear, as did Judge Proctor, that \u00a7 399 does not subject Van Dorn to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Sec. 400 subjects \u201c[o]ne who puts out as his own product a chattel manufactured by another\u201d to the same liability \u201cas though he were its manufacturer.\u201d In comment d (under \u00a7 400), it is said \u201cwhere it is clear that the actor\u2019s only connection with the chattel is that of a distributor of it (for example, as a wholesaler or retail seller), he does not put it out as his own product and the rule stated in this section is inapplicable.\u201d The evidence is unmistakably clear that the fiberglass 15' x 35' \u201cAlgiers\u201d pool sold to Maszczenski was manufactured by Delorich, Inc. of North Miami, Florida. It will be recalled that the pool was delivered to the Maszczenski residence in a truck with Florida tags and that there were other pools still to be delivered on the truck. We agree that \u00a7 400 is not applicable to Van Dorn. For much the same reasons Judge Proctor concluded \u00a7\u00a7 401 and 402 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to be inapplicable, a conclusion with which we also agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Finally we come to the mainstay of Telak\u2019s argument. We are urged to enlist in what has been described (erroneously says Van Dorn) as \u201cthe most rapid and altogether spectacular overturn of an established rule in the entire law of torts.\u201d Prosser, <em>The Fall of the Citadel (Strict Liability to the Consumer), </em>50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Minn. L. R. 791, 793-94 (1966). We refer, of course, to the doctrine of strict liability, irrespective of fault, as it is set forth in \u00a7 402 A of the Restatement :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cSpecial Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm to User or Consumer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201c (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">(b) it is expected'to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\u201c(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">The American Law Institute, by the inclusion of 402 A in the Restatement, has provoked violent and highly articulate dissent and there appears to be developing a movement to delete it from the Restatement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whatever we may be persuaded to do in the future in this regard, we find it unnecessary, at this time, to espouse the cause of strict liability. Judge Proctor found that \u00a7 402 A did \u201cnot apply to th [is] transaction.\u201d Assuming, for the sake of argument, that \u00a7 402 A is a correct statement of the law of this state, we must agree that his conclusion is correct. In Comment g it is said that \u00a7 402 A \u201capplies <em>only </em>where the product is, at the time it leaves the seller\u2019s hands, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) It is entirely clear that there was no change in the pool, other than the fastening of the sections together, from the time it left the Delorich plant in Miami until the completion of its installation in Maszczenski\u2019s back yard. It was precisely as represented in the Delorich brochure and precisely as seen by Maszczenski when he inspected his neighbor\u2019s pool (except that the neighbor\u2019s pool was 7 feet shorter). That it was \u201cin [the] condition * * * contemplated\u201d by Maszczenski is beyond question.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In considering whether the pool was a \u201cdangerous instrumentality\u201d Judge Proctor noted that we have \u201cvery carefully avoided defining what constitutes a \u2018dangerous instrumentality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wash. Sub. San. Comm. v. Musgrove, </em>203 Md. 231, 100 A. 2d 27 (1953); <em>Otis Elevator Co. v. Embert, </em>198 Md. 585, 84 A. 2d 876 (1951); <em>Dashiell v. Moore, </em>177 Md. 657, 11 A. 2d 640 (1940); and <em>McVey v. Gerrald, </em>172 Md. 595, 192 Atl. 789 (1937). We express neither agreement nor disagreement with his statement, contenting ourselves with observing that we do not need a definition to be able to say that Maszczenski\u2019s pool was not a \u201cdangerous instrumentality.\u201d But see <em>Cummings v. Borough of Nazareth, </em>233 A. 2d 874 (Pa. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Bacharach\u2019s liability, if it exists at all, must be found in the fragment of Wayne Nield\u2019s deposition that was read into the evidence, the drawings themselves, an excerpt from the Bacharach journal and one of the Nields\u2019 check stubs. The fragment of the deposition is reproduced in Ml:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201c \u2018Q.

Lee Bacharach and Mr. Bacharach his father were both there together.\u2019 Question: \u2018And I know you can\u2019t tell me the words that were exchanged, but tell me the substance of the conversation; that is, what do you recall saying to them, and what they said to you.\u2019 Answer: T had a plan of our of the filtration equipment for the Delorich pool] pool, that is a plan from the Paradise [manufacturers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>people, and I discussed how it could be approved and told them what needed to be done or what was required of us to get an approval, and I just discussed whether they were interested in approving the pool for us, and they said they thought they could work it out after looking at it and discussing it for a short time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">I talked to both intermittently, \u2014 I mean there were three of us in the conversation I remember \u2014 and Lee asked me to give him or get him all the information that we had gotten from the pool company [Delorich] about structure and the strength of fibre glass and different details like that, and of course, the pictures and advertising brochure, and then we just went on from there to get the approval.\u2019 Question: \u2018You mean you delivered all that to Bacharach and Bacharach?\u2019 Answer: \u2018Yes.\u2019 Question: \u2018What did you ask them specifically to do for you when you delivered it to them ?\u2019 Answer: \u2018Well, I told them that we needed the approval of a registered Maryland architect, that was what [was] asked for by the County, and I asked them to do what was necessary to give me that approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">Not being an architect, I didn\u2019t know exactly what was required. I had to leave it up to them.\u2019 Question: \u2018Did they at that time agree to do what was necessary ?\u2019 Answer : \u2018They said they thought they could. They didn\u2019t tell me definitely the first time I was there until they had done more of it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The excerpt from the Bacharach journal and the check stub are also reproduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">\u201cBacharach &amp; Bacharach</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2C\">Journal 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH4\">Maryland</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">\u201cVan Dorn, Inc.

Both are dated 16 March 1956, both are stated to be the product of \u201cBacharach &amp; Bacharach, Architects and Engineers\u201d and both bear the stamp of \u201cAbram F. Bacharach, Professional Engineer and Land Surveyor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">There is no proof in this record that Bacharach had anything more to do with Van Dorn, the Nields or anyone else, in respect of these drawings, after the bill was paid on 10 April 1956. It is conceded that 9 months later, 15 November 1956, the county government adopted a new building code, effective 1 December 1956. Sec. 409.10 g (2) provides that \u201cswimming pools shall be designed, constructed and operated in accordance with the 'Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places\u2019 of The American Public Health Association,\u201d 1949 Edition. In Sec. 19 D of the \u201cRecommended Practice\u201d it is said \u201cin order to be on the safe side the committee recommends that a minimum safe-water depth of 8 feet be provided for diving\u201d from a diving board. Telak argues that because the American Public Health Association pamphlet had been available to the industry since 1949 it \u201crepresented the state of the art at that time\u201d and Bacharach was somehow remiss in not following its recommendations or failing to issue some kind of warning that the recommendations had not been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The Florida Supreme Court, in <em>Bayshore Development Co. v. Bonfoey, </em>78 So. 507 (1918), quoting an early Maine case, <em>Coombs v. Beede, </em>89 Me. 187, 36 Atl. 104 (1896), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u201cMr. Chief Justice Peters, speaking for the court in the Coombs-Beede Case, said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u201c \u2018The responsibility resting on an architect is essentially the same as that which rests upon the lawyer to his client, or upon the physician to his patient, or which rests upon any one to another where such person pretends to possess some skill and ability in some special employment, and offers his services to the public on account of his fitness to act in the line of business for which he may be employed. The undertaking of an architect implies that he possesses skill and ability, including taste sufficient to enable him to perform the required services at least ordinarily and reasonably well, and that he will exercise and apply in the given case his skill and ability, his judgment and taste, reasonably and without neglect. But the undertaking does not imply or warrant a satisfactory result. It will be enough that any failure shall not be by the fault of the architect.\u2019 \u201d 78 So. at 509.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In <em>Smith v. Goff, </em>325 P. 2d 1061, 1064 (Old. 1958) it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cArchitects are only required to exercise ordinary professional skill and diligence and to conform to accepted architectural standards; their contracts do not guarantee perfect plans or satisfactory results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">To the same effect see the cases collected in 5 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Architects, </em>\u00a7 23, p. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Bacharach was not employed, as T\u00e9lale argues, to give an opinion that the pool, as designed by Delorich, was safe. Judge Proctor concluded, correctly we think, that \u201call of the evidence in this case is to the effect that the Bacharach employment was limited to draftmanship, so far as * * * [Telak] is concerned, and that Bacharach had no control over the design.\u201d Indeed, Telak\u2019s expert witness admitted that, for the purpose of obtaining building permits (in another state), his office had also prepared drawings of this type of pool, making no attempt to change the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We have not found nor have we been shown any evidence that Bacharach, in preparing the drawings, did not exercise ordinary professional skill and diligence or that he did not conform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>to accepted architectural standards. Telak points to the American Public Iiealth Association pamphlet and seeks to equate this with \u201cthe state of the art.\u201d It will be recalled that before 15 November 1956 (adoption of the building code) this was merely <em>recommended practice, </em>applicable <em>only to public pools. </em>Telak, as we have said, points also to Architectural Graphic Standards, Fifth Edition, 1956, which he declares is part of the \u201cfund of knowledge available to architects\u201d and in which it is suggested that residential pools be 8 feet deep. Had Bacharach been commissioned to <em>design </em>a swimming pool, perhaps he might have been persuaded to adopt these recommendations. We are unwilling to say, however, that his failure to take them into account is evidence of negligence when his only purpose was to translate another\u2019s design and specifications into drawings to accompany an application for a building permit. That these standards were not to be considered de rigueur seems to have been the opinion of the author of the foreword to Architectural Graphic Standards, who said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">\u201cObviously, such a work must be broad in scope; but it cannot possibly be all-inclusive. Its utility, therefore, must depend upon the experience and good judgment of the authors in the choice of factual material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Telak charges Judge Proctor with an abuse of discretion in that he denied his motion to reopen the case for the production of additional testimony. An assessment of the ruling requires placing it in proper perspective, which in turn calls for a recital of the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">When the court recessed during the afternoon of Thursday, 17 February 1966, the trial was in its seventh day. The court remained in recess until the morning of Thursday, 24 February. Some time during the preceding evening (Wednesday, 23 February) counsel for Telak learned that Telak\u2019s sister, Frances Mazon, the wife of Victor Mazon (Maszczenski), had heard from Mary Maszczenski (Tony\u2019s wife) and Jacqueline Maszczenski (Chester\u2019s wife) that when Chester had dived into the pool the year before, he struck his head against the bottom so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>hard he nearly drowned and had to be pulled out of the pool by Michael, and that Mrs. Mazon said to Mary Maszczenski, \u201cYes, I heard about it from one of the other members of the family who told me about the episode.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The trial was resumed on Thursday, 24 February. Counsel rested Telak\u2019s case that afternoon without making any use of the information acquired the night before. On Friday after hearing argument, from 10:00 a.m. until 5 :00 p.m., on the motions for directed verdicts, Judge Jenifer told counsel he would announce his ruling on Monday. Over the weekend, however, he became ill. As we have said, the parties agreed to continue with the same jury before Judge Proctor. On Monday the testimony was read to him and on Tuesday the motions for directed verdicts were reargued, from 9:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. It was not until after he had indicated to counsel late Tuesday afternoon what his ruling would be that Telak\u2019s counsel moved to reopen the case and proffered the testimony of Frances Mazon. Counsel for Maszczenski, Van Dorn and Bacharach objected strenuously to the reopening of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In denying the motion Judge Proctor made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201cThe request to reopen the testimony was not made until after counsel for Plaintiff knew or should have known the ruling which the Court proposed to make on the Maszczenski motion. It is the opinion of the Court that the request comes too late; that any testimony such as that proffered would constitute an impeachment of the witness, Chester Maszczenski, who was called by Plaintiff to testify in his behalf. Although Plaintiff\u2019s counsel attempted to call him as an adverse witness, Judge Jenifer would not recognize him as such so that the provisions of the Code, Article 35, Section 9, which sets forth the right to impeach an adverse witness does not apply. So far as the Court is aware, it is only under such circumstances, and that alone, that a party to a suit can impeach one of his own witnesses. For both reasons the motion is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Counsel for Telak freely admit that the receipt, of this information \u201cconfirmed [the] suspicions * * * [they] had about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Chester [ever] since he revealed in his deposition 'brushing\u2019 his head.\u201d They confess to having been uncertain \u201cwhat to do about the information and how to get it into evidence.\u201d They considered its admissibility \u201cas rebuttal evidence if Chester should testify in * * * [Tony\u2019s] case or if either of the Maszczenskis should be called\u201d as defense witnesses. It is very clear that their decision not to make use of this information before closing Telak\u2019s case was deliberate, calculated and fully informed. Counsel are not tyros and we must assume they were acutely aware of the possibility of directed verdicts. They could have called Frances Mazon, Mary Maszczenski, and Michael Maszczenski to testify on behalf of Telak. It would have been risky, to be sure, and counsel, understanding the risk, obviously decided against it. So they chose to eat the cake and to try to have it too.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We see here no evidence of an abuse of discretion. On the contrary, it stands out quite plainly that Judge Proctor exercised his discretion carefully and fairly, mindful of the consequences of his ruling and, as well, his duty \u201cto exercise his best judgment considering all of the factors\u201d involved. Since this is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge we shall not disturb his ruling. <em>Willey v. Glass, </em>242 Md. 156, 218 A. 2d 212 (1966) and the cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Finally Telak contends \u201cthe court [Judge Jenifer] committed prejudicial error by refusing to permit the witness William F. Klarner to testify as an expert with respect to safe design construction features of swimming pools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Klarner was called to the witness stand late in the afternoon of the sixth day (16 February) of the trial. Before his testimony in chief had been concluded the court, at 4:20 p.m., recessed for the day and excused the jury. The following is an excerpt from the record extract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">\u201c(The Court) Mr. Klarner, you may be excused until tomorrow morning about ten minutes of ten. Since you are on the stand, now, please do not discuss the case or your testimony with anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201c(The Witness) Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201c(The Court) Until your examination is finished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Counsel did not thereafter call him to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Klarner testified he was employed by Johns Hopkins University. He is in charge of the swimming pools, he said, and he also coaches the swimming teams. He was not allowed to tell about his experiments in the field of diver safety. Judge Jenifer, in response to objections to proffers as to what Klarner would say observed that it \u201cwould allow this witness to go into too many variables as to the depth of diving of different individuals\u201d in situations which may be entirely different from the instant case. Counsel insisted that Klarner was an expert \u201con minimum safety standards for diving.\u201d Again responding to objections Judge Jenifer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I can preclude testimony of any case but I do not think that is the limit of this witness\u2019 qualifications. Although he may be well qualified to state how to make a safe dive and how not to make one, but he hasn\u2019t shown any qualifications as to permit him to express an opinion as to the safety and design and construction of private residential swimming pools, such as the one in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\u201cAll right, you may continue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Counsel continued with Klarner\u2019s testimony until the court recessed for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">There is nothing in the record to indicate that Judge Jenifer finally refused to allow Klarner to testify as an expert. By failing to continue with testimony in respect of his qualifications counsel, in effect, withdrew him as a witness. Moreover, the record is incomplete in that appellees\u2019 counsel were not given an opportunity to cross-examine him concerning his qualifications. However, even if the trial judge\u2019s observation could be construed as a final determination that Klarner was not qualified to express an opinion \u201cas to the safety and design and construction of private residential swimming pools, such as the one in question\u201d he will not be reversed unless it is shown that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>he abused his discretion or was in error as to the law. <em>Hewitt v. Bd. of Censors, </em>243 Md. 574, 582, 221 A. 2d 894 (1966) and the cases therein cited. We do not think he abused his discretion; neither are we aware of any error in law chargeable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Both Van Dorn and Maszczenski contend that \u201cTelak, as a matter of law, either assumed the risk of his injury or was guilty of contributory negligence <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> directly causing it\u201d citing <em>Chauvin v. Atlas Insurance Company, </em>166 So. 2d 581 (La. 1964) and <em>Lindelow v. Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019, Inc., </em>174 Neb. 1, 115 N. W. 2d 776 (1962). In view of what we have already said in this opinion it is unnecessary for us to consider these contentions or reach any conclusions in respect thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">For the reasons herein stated the judgments in favor of the appellees for costs will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\">. \u201cRecommended Practice for Design, Equipment and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other <em>Public </em>Bathing Places,\u201d Tenth Edition (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">. \u201c\u00a7 401.

R. J. 343-59 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\">. Judge Proctor thought the questions of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk were very close. His comment in this regard, in his opinion overruling the motion for a new trial, is of interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">\u201cIn ruling on this phase of the motion, the trial court is bound to consider the question from two points of view: One, would admission of the proffered testimony [see sec. IV of this Court\u2019s opinion, supra] make a substantial difference in the posture of plaintiff\u2019s case before the court and before the jury? The court concedes the possibility that if the testimony proffered turns out to be as suggested, it might be enough to take the case to the jury. This possibility, however, ignores defendants\u2019 contention of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Even assuming the admissibility and truth of the proffered testimony, the case might still be taken from the jury on the ground that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. As the court indicated at the time of the original argument on this motion, this question is quite close and the state of the case might require a directed verdict on that ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
