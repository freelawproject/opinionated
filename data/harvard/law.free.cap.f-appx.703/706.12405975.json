Murphy, Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b730-16\" pgmap=\"730\">After examining Appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this court has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the adjudication of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R, 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p> <p id=\"b730-17\" pgmap=\"730\">Proceeding pro se, Appellant Robert A. Session, a Colorado state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint he filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In addition to the complaint, Session also filed a document titled, \u201cUnited States District Court Judicial Review of a Form 8082 and Motion to Specify.\u201d A United States Magistrate Judge ordered Session to file an amended complaint, clarifying the claims being asserted. Session filed the amended complaint on April 21, 2017. The district court dismissed the action for failure to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court concluded Session\u2019s complaint, even if construed liberally, contained vague, and con-clusory factual allegations\u201d and did not provide fair notice to the Defendants.</p> <p id=\"b730-20\" pgmap=\"730\">Session\u2019s appellate brief, like his complaint, is an incoherent jumble of constitutional, criminal, civil, and administrative law concepts. There is no clear argument as to why the district court\u2019s judgment should be reversed. Having reviewed the record and Session\u2019s appellate brief, this court concludes Session\u2019s appeal is \u201cwithout merit in that it lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact.\u201d Thompson v. Gibson, 289 F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir. 2002). We, thus, dismiss the appeal as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). We deny Session\u2019s motion to proceed informa pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and remind him of his responsibility for the immediate payment of any unpaid balance of the appellate filing fee.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b730-18\" pgmap=\"730\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b730-22\" pgmap=\"730\">. See Rollins v.
