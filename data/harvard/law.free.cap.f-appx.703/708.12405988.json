We deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p> <p id=\"b733-4\" pgmap=\"733\">After his convictions in state court for burglary, sexual assault, theft, and menacing, and his adjudication as a habitual criminal, Thorpe was sentenced to two consecutive fifty-year terms of imprisonment. The district court dismissed his previous \u00a7 2254 application as time-barred and procedurally barred, and we denied a COA. See Thorpe v. Soares, 182 F.3d 933, 1999 WL 314636 (10th Cir. May 19, 1999) (unpublished table decision). The district court dismissed his most recent \u00a7 2254 application for lack of jurisdiction because he did not obtain authorization from this court to file a second or successive application, Thorpe now seeks a COA to appeal that ruling.</p> <p id=\"b733-5\" pgmap=\"733\">To establish his entitlement to a COA, Thorpe must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where, as here, a district court denies a \u00a7 2254 application on procedural grounds, a COA may issue only if \u201cthe prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and .., whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p> <p id=\"b733-6\" pgmap=\"733\">Based on our review of Thorpe\u2019s application for a COA and the record on appeal, we conclude he has failed to establish his entitlement to a COA. Thorpe does not address the district court\u2019s determination that his application was second or successive, let alone persuade us that jurists of reason would find that determination debatable.</p> <p id=\"b733-10\" pgmap=\"733\">Accordingly, we deny a COA, We also deny Thorpe\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis because he has not shown \u201cthe existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised\u201d in his application. Buchheit v. Green, 705 F.3d 1157, 1161 (10th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b732-21\" pgmap=\"732\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32,1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
