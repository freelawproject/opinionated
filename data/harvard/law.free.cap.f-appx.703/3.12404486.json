See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. CIR. R. 34(j). The court has accorded the issues full consideration and determined they do not warrant a published opinion. See D.C. CIR. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p> <p id=\"b28-7\" pgmap=\"28\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b28-8\" pgmap=\"28\">Ashbourne appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on her claims against the Treasury Department, She claims that the Department terminated her probationary employment in violation of the Privacy Act and the Fifth Amendment; Her Privacy Act claims im-permissibly recast a federal personnel management decision as a factual challenge under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 562a(g)(1)(C). See, e.g., Albright v. United States, 732 F.2d 181, 190 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Further, Ashb-ourne received adequate process to protect her interest in her professional reputation. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b28-9\" pgmap=\"28\">In its Notice of Proposed Termination, the Department found that Ashbourne\u2019s description of her work experience at Ashbourne &amp; Company and C.J. Johnson, Inc. was \u201cmisleading.\u201d As to Ashbourne &amp; Company, the Department\u2019s conclusion rested on discrepancies between Ashb-ourne\u2019s resume and e-QIP submissions, all submitted by Ashbourne herself. Ashb-ourne does not challenge the factual accuracy of these records. She therefore has no basis under the Privacy Act for disputing the Department\u2019s determination. See, e.g., Kleiman v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, 956 F.2d 335, 337-38 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p> <p id=\"b28-11\" pgmap=\"28\">As to C.J. Johnson, Inc., the Department\u2019s conclusion rested on discrepancies between Ashbourne\u2019s account \u2014 that she resigned from the company \u2014 and her former supervisor\u2019s' account \u2014 that she was fired. Ashbourne does not challenge her supervisor\u2019s affidavit, but argues that the Department was required to take reasonable steps to verify whose account was true, See Sellers v. Bureau of Prisons, 959 F.2d 307, 312 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The Department satisfied this obligation by giving Ashbourne an opportunity to explain the discrepancy by submitting affidavits with the help of counsel, Ashbourne\u2019s response did not mention the factual discrepancy that forms the basis of this Privacy Act claim. Without notice, the Department was under no continued duty.to verify each factual matter mentioned in her supervisor\u2019s affidavit through an independent inquiry into third-party sources and documents. Cf. McCready v. Nicholson, 465 F.3d 1, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (further inquiry was necessary \u201cin light of McCready having brought her attendance at the committee meeting to the Inspector General\u2019s attention\u201d). When the Department\u2019s further inquiry did not reveal whose account was accurate, the Department followed Doe v. United States, 821 F.2d 694 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc), by including both her and her supervisor\u2019s accounts in her file.</p> <p id=\"b28-12\" pgmap=\"28(34) 29(102)\">Ashbourne\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim also fails. Even if we assume arguendo that Ashbourne\u2019s termination sufficiently \u201cstigmatized ... her reputation\u201d so as to infringe her \u201cprotected liberty'interest in reputation,\u201d Doe v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 763 F.2d 1092, 1111 (D.C. Cir. 1985), she was given a sufficient \u201copportunity to clear [her] name.\u201d Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624, 627, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977). Due process requires only that the Department \u201cmust provide notice of the charges and an opportunity to refute them effectively.\u201d McCormick v. District of Columbia, 752 F.3d 980, 989 (D.C. Cir. 2014). By allowing Ashbourne to challenge the termination decision through affidavits with the help of counsel in accordance with the Civil Service Reform Act, see 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805, the Department afforded Ashb-ourne adequate process.</p> <p id=\"b29-2\" pgmap=\"29\">Pursuant to D.C. Cir. R. 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b): D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
