Tymkovich, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b670-22\">Michael Spaulding was sentenced to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to charges stemming from his sale of methamphetamine. He contends that the district court committed procedural errors when it refused to credit his acceptance of responsibility and rejected the government\u2019s recommended downward departure for substantial assistance. The government agrees with Mr. Spaulding. And after reviewing the record, so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The relevant facts are as follows. Acting as a courier, Mr. Spaulding sold two ounces of methamphetamine to an undercover federal agent. After his arrest, Mr. Spaulding pleaded guilty to distribution of methamphetamine and conspiracy to do the same. He also agreed to help the government investigate and prosecute the other members of the conspiracy. In exchange, the government joined Mr. Spaulding in requesting a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility; it further promised to file a motion for downward departure based on his substantial assistance in the investigation. Ultimately the government recommended a sentence of 77-96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The district court saw the case differently and sentenced Mr. Spaulding to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. It first denied the requested three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. In the district court\u2019s view, acceptance of responsibility requires the defendant to do more than plead guilty and spare the government the expense of trial. The additional conduct could be, for example, taking steps \u201cto deal with the victims\u201d or to combat the defendant\u2019s drug addiction. R., Vol. 3 at 48-50. The court then granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance. But it rejected the government\u2019s recommended sentence and did not explain how the departure affected its sentencing. The next day, Mr. Spauld-ing filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, which the court granted. The case then proceeded to a bench trial (in which Mr. Spaulding admitted his guilt) and a second sentencing proceeding (again with the result of 137 months). On appeal, however, we found that the district court lacked jurisdiction to permit Mr. Spaulding to withdraw his original guilty plea. <em>United States v. Spaulding, </em>802 F.3d 1110 (10th Cir. 2015). Accordingly, all actions taken after the first sentencing were null and void. We said that Mr. Spaulding could file a new direct appeal after the district court reimposed the original sentence, <em>id. </em>at 1113 n.1, and he does so now. The government has filed a brief supporting Mr. Spaulding\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">This court\u2019s earlier opinion suggested that the district court might have committed procedural errors in imposing the sentence at issue, but there was no need to decide the question. <em>See id. </em>at 1113 n.1, 1114 n.3, 1117 n.7. We now agree with the government and conclude that the district court erred, so we vacate Mr. Spaulding\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">First, Mr. Spaulding contends the court erred in its denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Unlike the district court, we do not read \u00a7 3E1.1 of the Guidelines and the relevant commentary to mean that confessing and pleading guilty can never suffice to show acceptance of responsibility. In fact, the Sentencing Commission seems to accept some variation of this, explaining that pleading guilty before trial \u201ccombined with truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense of conviction ... will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n.3. The commentary does not say that additional conduct is required to prove acceptance of responsibility. In fact, the Guidelines further explain: \u201cHowever, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with ... acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n.3. This provision indicates that, absent contradictory evidence that \u201coutweigh[s],\u201d pleading guilty will generally demonstrate acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">To be clear, we do not decide whether Mr. Spaulding had accepted responsibility or not. Whether countervailing evidence outweighs Mr. Spaulding\u2019s confession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>guilty plea is a factual determination that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n.5. And this court would extend \u201cgreat deference\" in reviewing the district court\u2019s factual findings on that score. <em>Id. </em>We hold only that the district court erred in believing that acceptance of responsibility always requires \u201csomething other than simply showing] up in court and plead[ing] guilty.\u201d R., Vol. 3 at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We consider next the district court\u2019s actions on the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance. As the prior panel noted, the district court \u201cgranted the government\u2019s request\u201d but \u201cgave no indication of how it valued Spaulding\u2019s assistance.\u201d <em>Spaulding, </em>802 F.3d at 1114 n.3. \u201cDespite granting the government\u2019s motion, the district court never applied the substantial-assistance departure provisions. Thus, the district court never calculated and never considered an appropriate advisory guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Flailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u201d is procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). On remand, then, the district court should determine the appropriate reduction by considering some or all of the factors described in the Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 (and any other factors it finds relevant), while giving \u201c[s]ubstantial weight ... to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of [Mr. Spaulding\u2019s] assistance.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 cmt. n.3. And it should \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Finally, Mr. Spaulding requests that we reassign the case to a different district judge on remand. We decline to do so. Reassignment is \u201cextraordinary\u201d relief and is therefore appropriate \u201conly when there is proof of personal bias or under extreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Maynard, </em>80 F.3d 1433, 1448 (10th Cir. 1996). Mr. Spaulding has pointed to nothing in the record to demonstrate personal bias. He invokes the district judge\u2019s hostility to plea-bargaining, see <em>Spaulding, </em>802 F.3d at 1116 n.4, but that fact alone does not constitute extreme circumstances justifying reassignment. Mr. Spaulding also cites several decisions granting reassignment when the district court\u2019s sentence had repeatedly been invalidated, but this case does not present the same situation. Because our prior decision concerned only the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, this is the first time the district court\u2019s sentence has been considered on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">We VACATE Mr. Spaulding\u2019s \"sentence and REMAND for resentencing. We DENY the request for reassignment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-13\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
