See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p> </footnote> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b735-15\" pgmap=\"735\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> </p> <author id=\"b735-16\" pgmap=\"735\">Paul J Kelly, Jr. Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b735-17\" pgmap=\"735\">Plaintiff-Appellant Duane Letroy Berry, appearing pro-se, appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim moving for \u201cinjunctive relief and to \u2018shut down the majority of Bank of America branches ... in- order to settle the trust\u2019s debt\u2019 \u201d as frivolous. Order, Berry v. United States, 5:17-cv-00331-R (W-D. Okla. July 7, 2017), ECF No. 7. Mr. Berry has been found incompetent to stand trial on a federal charge based upon a delusional disorder. See United States v. Berry, No. 15-20743, 2017 WL 3777072 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 31, 2017) (Order Authorizing Administration of Medication), appeal docketed, No. 17-2168 (6th Cir. Sept. 28, 2017).</p> <p id=\"b735-20\" pgmap=\"735\">Mr. Berry has also filed a Judicial Notice of \u201cOutrageous Government Criminal Misconduct\u201d claiming that he was improperly removed from federal jurisdiction and placed in state custody. We deny that motion because it is unrelated to Mr. Berry\u2019s claim on appeal in this case and is the same claim as in a separate appeal currently pending before this court by Mr. Berry. See Berry v. Fox, No. 17-6192 (10th Cir. Aug. 22, 2017).</p> <p id=\"b735-21\" pgmap=\"735\">On appeal, Mr. Berry repeats his arguments made at the district court as well as alleges new causes of action not in his initial complaint. We decline to consider the new claims not presented in the original complaint on appeal. Mr. Berry\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 fails as a matter of law because \u00a7 1983 claims apply only to actions by state and local entities and not the United States government. Belhomme v. Widnall, 127 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 1997).</p> <p id=\"b735-22\" pgmap=\"735\">AFFIRMED. All pending motions are DENIED.</p> <footnote label=\"**\"> <p id=\"b735-24\" pgmap=\"735\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
