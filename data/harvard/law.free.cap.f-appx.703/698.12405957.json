Matheson, Jr. Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Samuel Arp, a prisoner of Oklahoma proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny his requests to issue certificates of appealability (\u201cCOAs\u201d) on seven issues and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">Mr. Arp\u2019s central, argument is that the district court, in denying his habeas application, failed to address three claims- he included in his application. We conclude that, even if Mr. Arp properly presented these claims to the district court (which we do not decide), he is not entitled to COAs on any of these claims. Further, Mr. Arp is not entitled to a COA on the four claims the district court did address.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">I, PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">To explain Mr. Arp\u2019s argument before us, we recount the state and federal proceedings in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-19\">1. State Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b723-20\">a. <em>Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-21\">After Mr. Arp stabbed his girlfriend in 2011, an Oklahoma jury convicted him of (1) Assault and Battery with a Dangerous Weapon After Two or More Felony Convictions and (2) Obstructing an Officer. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21 \u00a7\u00a7 645, 540. He received a prison sentence of 60 years on the first count and 30 days on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-22\">b. <em>Direct Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-23\">On direct appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed. <em>See Arp v. State, </em>No. F-2011-971 (Okla. Crim. App. Feb. 20, 2013) (unpublished). Mr. Arp raised three state law evidentiary issues on appeal, arguing that: (1) the State\u2019s expert witness had given wide-ranging testimony about abused women when there was no evidence of ongoing domestic abuse be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>tween Mr. Arp and his girlfriend; (2) Mr. Arp\u2019s girlfriend, whom'the State called to rebut Mr. Arp\u2019s self-defense claim, had testified about Mr. Arp\u2019s uncharged misconduct; and (3) the State, in proving that Mr. Arp had prior felony convictions, had improperly revealed to the jury that he had a murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The OCCA rejected these claims. First, it ruled the trial court had not abused its discretion in admitting the domestic violence expert testimony because there <em>was </em>evidence of domestic abuse. Second, the OCCA determined Mr. Arp had not objected to his girlfriend\u2019s testimony on rebuttal and therefore reviewed for plain error. It concluded he had not shown error, plain or otherwise, because her' testimony, including testimony regarding prior acts of violence, was relevant to rebut his self-defense claim. Third, the OCCA ruled the trial court\u2019s failure to redact information from Mr. Arp\u2019s prior convictions was not an abuse of discretion and that it had not caused the jury to assess an excessive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">c. <em>Post-conviction proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Mr, Arp next filed an application for state post-conviction relief. He raised two claims: (1) his appellate lawyer had been constitutionally ineffective on direct appeal by .leaving out various claims regarding trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) he was factually innocent. Although Mr. Arp styled his second claim as one of \u201cfactual innocence,\u201d the substance of his claim, he explained, was that his trial counsel had failed to present evidence that his girlfriend was under the influence of drugs when he stabbed her and that this information could have bolstered his self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The state district court denied his post-conviction application. On the first claim, it ruled that not one of his underlying trial counsel ineffectiveness theories was meritorious and thus denied his appellate-ineffectiveness claim. On the second claim\u2014 that Mr. Arp was factually innocent because his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to present self-defense evidence \u2014 the district court denied the claim as waived because it could have been, but was not, presented on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Mr. Arp appealed the denial of his post-conviction application. The OCCA affirmed. <em>See Arp v. State, </em>No. PC-2013-1097 (Okla. Crim. App. Feb. 20, 2014) (unpublished). In evaluating Mr. Arp\u2019s ineffectiveness claim under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the OCCA ruled Mr. Arp had failed to show that his appellate counsel had performed deficiently or that Mr. Arp had been prejudiced. The OCCA agreed with the state district court that Mr. Arp had procedurally defaulted his second claim by not presenting it on direct appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">2. Federal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"ato-dedup-0\">Mr. Arp next filed an application for federal habeas relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court understood' Mr. Arp to raise four grounds for relief (grounds three and four appear to overlap): (1) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel; (2) insufficient evidence; (3) the Oklahoma courts\u2019 refusal to decide his factual innocence claim based on a state law procedural bar. violated due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>process; and (4) the Oklahoma courts\u2019 failure to apply Supreme Court law and address the merits of Mr. Arp\u2019s procedurally barred claim also violated due process. <em>See Arp v. McCollum, </em>No. 14-CV-0328-CVE-tlw, 2017 WL 1708027, at *2 (N.D. Okla. May 2, 2017) (unpublished). The district court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">On ground one, the court applied the standard of review prescribed by the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) because the OCCA had adjudicated Mr. Arp\u2019s appellate ineffectiveness claim on its merits. <em>See Arp, </em>2017 WL 1708027, at *2-6; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). It concluded this ground failed under AEDPA because the OCCA\u2019s resolution of Mr. Arp\u2019s claim was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <em>See id. </em>at *4-6; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">On ground two, the district court noted the OCCA\u2019s enforcement of a state procedural bar against Mr. Arp\u2019s factual innocence/evidence sufficiency claim. <em>See Arp, </em>2017 WL 1708027, at *7. The court concluded this bar against, claims that could have been, but were not, raised on direct appeal was an adequate and independent state law ground for the denial of relief. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Arp was thus not entitled to federal relief on this claim. <em>See Thacker v. Workman, </em>678 F.3d 820, 835 (10th Cir. 2012) (explaining that federal habeas relief is barred when a state prisoner \u201cdefaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,\u201d absent a showing of cause and prejudice for the default or a showing of a fundamental miscarriage of justice (quotations omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">On grounds three and four, the district court concluded no relief was available. <em>See Arp, </em>2017 WL 1708027, at *9. These grounds challenged the state courts\u2019 reliance on a procedural bar as violating due process. But the district court explained that \u201cchallenges to state postconviction procedures do not rise to the level of federal constitutional claims cognizable on ha-beas corpus review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Phillips v. Ferguson, </em>182 F.3d 769, 773-74 (10th Cir. 1999); <em>Sellers v. Ward, </em>135 F.3d 1333, 1339 (10th Cir. 1998); and <em>Steele v. Young, </em>11 F.3d 1518, 1524 (10th Cir. 1993) (stating due process challenge to Oklahoma post-conviction procedures not \u201ccognizable in a federal habeas proceeding\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">Having rejected all four grounds, the district court denied relief and entered judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Arp filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">II. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">\u201cA state prisoner whose petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied by a federal district court does not enjoy an absolute right to appeal.\u201d <em>Buck v. Davis, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 759, 773, 197 L.Ed.2d 1 (2017). Before we may exercise jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>over Mr. Arp\u2019s appeal, he must obtain COAs for the issues he wishes to raise. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), (c)(3). A COA may issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cAt the COA stage, the only question is whether the applicant has shown that \u2018jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buck, </em>137 S.Ct. at 773 (quoting <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Mr. Arp has filed a combined opening brief and request for COAs. He asserts seven claims for relief \u2014 the four claims the district adjudicated and three more that he asserts it overlooked. We address Mr. Arp\u2019s claims in two sets: (1) the three claims the' district court did not address and (2) the other four claims it rejected. We conclude Mr. Arp is not entitled to a COA on any of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">1.The Three Direct Appeal Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Mr. Arp explains that he intended to include in his \u00a7 2254 application the three claims he presented to the OCCA on direct appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">1. The trial court erred in admitting testimony from the domestic violence expert;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">2. The trial court erred in admitting testimony from Mr. Arp\u2019s girlfriend about his uncharged misconduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">3. The State wrongly informed the jury that he had previously been convicted of murder and used that information to argue for a more severe sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">He included the three direct appeal claims in a section of his habeas application addressing the procedural history of this case. On the next page, the habeas form directs applicants as follows: \u201cFor <em>this </em>petition, state <em>every </em>ground on which you claim that you are being held in violation of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d ROA at 7, \u00b6 12 (emphases added). Following this instruction, Mr. Arp presented the four grounds (labeled \u201cGROUND I, GROUND II,\u201d etc.) that the district court later considered and rejected. His. three direct appeal claims were not included.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">' Mr. Arp now requests that we grant COAs and remand so the district court can address the three claims he says he intended to raise all along. Citing his status as a pro se litigant, the absence of trained law clerks within the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to assist prisoners, with their filings, his good faith, and the prospect that he will serve a 60 year sentence at age 55, Mr. Arp asks us to overlook his error in not including the direct appeal claims in the appropriate section of his habeas application.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">Even if we could overlook his technical error, we cannot grant Mr. Arp COAs on any of his three claims because he has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitutional </em>right\u201d as required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (emphasis added). His direct appeal claims all raised state law evidentiary issues. They do not implicate federal law and thus cannot serve as a basis for federal habeas relief. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (explaining \u201cfederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law\u201d (quotations omitted)); <em>Hooks v. Workman, </em>689 F.3d 1148, 1180 (10th Cir. 2012) (explaining federal habeas courts \u201csit only to vindicate an applicant\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201cfederal habeas review is not available to correct state law evidentiary errors\u201d (brackets and quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Although a state prisoner may seek federal habeas relief \u201cif a state law decision is so fundamentally unfair that it implicates federal due process,\u201d <em>Leatherwood v. Allbaugh, </em>861 F.3d 1034, 1043 (10th Cir. 2017), Mr. Arp has not argued that his direct appeal claims are anything other than matters of state law. He argued them as state law issues on direct appeal; he described them' the same way in his federal habeas application; and now, in his application for COAs, he argues the direct appeal claims in state law terms. Because \u201c[fjederal habeas relief is not available to correct state law errors,\u201d <em>id., </em>we decline to grant a COA on any of Mr. Arp\u2019s direct appeal claims or to remand them. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>33 Fed.Appx. 446, 448 (10th Cir. 2002) (unpublished)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (explaining that, where \u201c[t]he district court did not address petitioner\u2019s remaining claims,\u201d the \u201coversight [did] not entitle petitioner to a COA ... because even .had the district court addressed these claims, the result would not have been different\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Leopard, </em>170 F.3d 1013, 1017-18 (10th Cir. 1999) (granting COA and remanding when district court failed to address defendant\u2019s motion to amend for inclusion of a claim that was an \u201cevident winner\u201d and that \u201c[a]t the very least ... raise[d] a substantial question\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Mr. Arp has not shown that reasonable \u201cjurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029. We deny his COA requests on these three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">2. The Four Claims Resolved by the District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Mr. Arp\u2019s combined brief and application for COAs states he \u201calso take[s] issue on the remaining four (4) post-conviction grounds\u201d the district court resolved against him. Aplt. Br. at 16. But his COA arguments are directed at the three direct appeal claims, discussed above, not the four claims the district court considered and rejected. Regardless, we conclude Mr. Arp is not entitled to a COA on any of the four claims because reasonable jurists could not \u201cdebate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">On the first ground (appellate counsel ineffectiveness), the district court denied relief under AEDPA. <em>See Arp, </em>2017 WL 1708027, at *2-6; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). In determining whether to issue a COA, \u201c[w]e look to the [district [c]ourt\u2019s application of AEDPA to [Mr. Arp\u2019s] constitutional claims and ask whether <em>that </em>resolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (emphasis added); <em>see Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir. 2004) (\u201cAEDPA\u2019s deferential treatment of state court decisions must be incorporated into our consideration of a habeas petitioner\u2019s request for COA.\u201d); <em>see also Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (explaining that, when state court rejected applicant\u2019s claim under <em>Strickland, </em>federal habeas relief is unavailable \u201cso long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision\u201d (quotations omitted)). For substantially the same reasons given in the district court\u2019s order, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>elude its determination that Mr. Arp\u2019s ineffectiveness claim does not give rise to federal habeas relief under AEDPA is not debatable among jurists of reason. <em>See Arp, </em>2017 WL 1708027, at *4-6. Because the correctness of the district court\u2019s decision under AEDPA is not subject to reasonable debate, Mr. Arp is not entitled to a COA on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Similarly, the district court\u2019s conclusion that an independent and adequate state procedural rule barred his second ground \u2014 regarding the sufficiency of the evidence/his factual innocence \u2014 is not subject to debate among jurists of reason. <em>See Arp, </em>2017 WL 1708027, at *7-9. When, as happened on Mr. Arp\u2019s second ground, a \u201cdistrict court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds,\u201d the prisoner cannot obtain a COA without showing \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right <em>and </em>that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (emphasis added). Mr. Arp has not made either showing, and we therefore decline to issue a COA on his second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The district court rejected Mr. Arp\u2019s third and fourth grounds as \u201cnot ris[ing] to the level of federal constitutional claims cognizable on habeas corpus review\u201d because they challenged Oklahoma's procedural rules regarding post-conviction applications, as opposed to trial errors in his case. <em>Arp, </em>2017 WL 1708027, at *9. Under our precedent, reasonable jurists could not debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s decision to deny relief. <em>See Phillips, </em>182 F.3d at 772 (\u201cThe federal courts on habeas review cannot strike down as unconstitutional a state postconviction procedural rule.\u201d); <em>see also Sellers, </em>135 F.3d at 1339. As we have done in other cases raising similar challenges, <em>see, e.g., Wallin v. Miller, </em>661 Fed.Appx. 526, 534-35 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished); <em>Walton v. Falk, </em>577 Fed.Appx. 893, 894 (10th Cir. 2014) (unpublished), we decline to issue a COA on either of these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">We deny Mr. Arp\u2019s COA requests and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-15\">This order is not binding precedent, except under, the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
