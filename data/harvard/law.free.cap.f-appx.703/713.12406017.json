Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p> <p id=\"b738-4\" pgmap=\"738\">In 1993, Ms. Waugh executed a promissory note for $42,280.00 to the Farmers Home Administration, secured by a mortgage on her home. After she failed to make required payments, the United States brought suit to foreclose on Ms. Waugh\u2019s note and mortgage. It filed a motion for summary judgment supported by the note, the mortgage, an affidavit, and an itemization of the amount due. Ms. Waugh did not respond in opposition to the motion; and the court reviewed the record and granted the motion.</p> <p id=\"b738-5\" pgmap=\"738\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. See Fye v. Okla. Corp. Comm\u2019n, 516 F.3d 1217, 1222-23 (10th Cir. 2008). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We see no error in granting the judgment. Ms. Waugh cites no record evidence that calls into question the validity of the note or the mortgage, or her failure to pay what she was required to pay.</p> <p id=\"b738-8\" pgmap=\"738\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b737-9\" pgmap=\"737(44) 738(46)\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially .assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
