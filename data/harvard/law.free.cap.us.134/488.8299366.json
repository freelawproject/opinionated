This is a petition by a corporation of the State of Kentucky for a writ . of prohibition to th\u00e9 judge of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana, to prohibit him from entertaining jurisdiction of a libel in admiralty <em>in </em>personam, filed April 23, 1889, by the 'Natchez and New Orleans Packet and Transportation Company, also a corporation of Kentucky, against the petitioner, \u201cin a cause of contract civil and maritime,\u201d upon a policy of insurance by' which the petitioner insured against perils of the seas and rivers and other perils a steamboat of the libellant employed in the navigation of the Mississippi Diver.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">By the public statute of Louisiana of February 26, <em>18Z7, </em>c. 21, no insurance company organized under the laws of any other State shall take risks, or transact any business through an. agent in Louisiana, without having filed in the office of the secretary of State a certified copy of a vote of its directors, appointing such an agent there to transact business' and to' take risks, accompanied by a warrant of appointment from the company, containing an express consent that service of legal process on him shall be as valid as if served on the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">By \u00e1 copy of the record of the proceedings'in the District Court, annexed to the return-to the rule to.show, cause why a writ of. prohibition should not issue, it app\u00e9ars that the libellee had filed with the secretary of State of Louisiana a copy of a vote of its directors, as well as a warrant of appointment, appointing \"William M. -Bailey its attorney at' New Orleans,, as required by the statute of Louisiana; that the policy sued on was signed by the' libellee\u2019s president and secretary at Louisville in the State of Kentucky, was not to be binding until countersigned by its authorized agent at New Orleans,' and was countersigned by Bailey ; that a citation to the'libel-lee was issued by the District' Court, and served by the marshal upon Bailey in person; that a' motion'to quash, the libel, and an exception to it, -upon the ground, among others, that neither party was -an inhabitant of . the Eastern District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Louisiana and that the libellee had no' property or credits within the district, were overruled by the District Court, and the libellee ordered to answer; and that the libellee thereupon answered, and took depositions under commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Before the cause had been brought to a hearing, the petition for a writ of prohibition was presented to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">It is admitted that the District Courts of the United States, sitting ih admiralty, have jurisdiction ' of the matter of the libel. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1. But it is argued, iirsupport of the prohibition, that no libel <em>in personam </em>can be sustained against a corporation in a district not within the State in which it is incorporated; and this argument is rested on the latter part of the following provision in the act of March 3, 1887, o. 373, \u00a7 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201c \u201c But no person shall be arrested ih one district for trial in another in any civil action before a Circuit' or' District Court; and no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts against\u2019 any' person' by any original process of proceeding in any other district than-that whereof he is an inhabitant.\u201d 24 Stat. 552.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">A 'brief reference to previous acts of Congress and decisions \u2022of this court makes.it clear that this provision has no application to causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">' By the ancient and settled practice of courts-of admiralty, a libel <em>in personam </em>may be maintained for any cause within their jurisdiction, 'Wherever a monition can be served upon the libellee, or an attachment made of any personal property or credits of his; and this practice, has been recognized and upheld by the rules and' decisions of this court. Rule 2 in Admiralty; <em>Manro </em>v. <em>Almeida, </em>10 Wheat. 473; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Disintegrating Co., </em>18 Wall. <em>272; New England Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit &amp; Cleveland Steam Navigation Co., </em>18 Wall. 307; <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Laird, </em>107 U. S. <em>69; Devoe Manufacturing </em>Co., <em>Petitioner, </em>108 U. S. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The judgment, delivered at October term, 1873, in <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Disintegrating Co., </em>just cited, is. really decisive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The .question there'presented , was-the construction of that ^provision of the Judiciary Act of- September 24, 1789, c. 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u00a7 11, by which, after defining the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts in <em>\u201c </em>suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity,\u201d in which the United States were plaintiffs, or an alien was a party, or the suit was between a citizen of the State where if was' brought and a citizen of another State; and also defining the' criminal' jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts ;\u25a0 it was provided as follows:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\"><em>\u201c </em>But no person shall be arrested in one district for trial in' another in any civil action before a Circuit or District Court; and no civil suit shall be brought before either of said courts \u2022 against an inhabitant of the United States by any.original process in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant,, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the writ.\u201d 1 Stat. 79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Upon a consideration of the acts of Congress upon the subject, and especially of other sections of the Judiciary Act of 1189, of which section 9 conferred upon the District Courts \u201c exclusive original cognizance of' all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,\u201d and jurisdiction concurrent with the Circuit Courts of certain <em>\u201c </em>suits at common law\u201d by.the United States; 1 Stat. 77; section 21 authorized \u201c final decrees in a District Court in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction \u201d to be reviewed in the Circuit Court on appeal, and section 22 authorized <em>\u201c </em>final decrees and judgments in civil actions in a District Court\u201d, to be reviewed in the Circuit Court by writ of error; 1 Stat. 83, 84; it was demonstrated that the provision of section 11, above quoted, restricting \u201c civil suits \u201d to the district of which the defendant was an \u25a0 inhabitant or in which- he might be found, did not include causes of admiralty jurisdiction; and it was therefore adjudged that a libel in admiralty <em>in ypersonam </em>might be maintained against a corporation by attachment of its goods in a district not within the State in which it was incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The provisions of sections 11, 21 .and 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, a,bove quoted, were reenacted in substantially the same words in the Devised Statutes, Dev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 563, els. 4,.8; 629, els. 1-3; 631, 633, 739. ' .</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The provision of section 11 of the act of 1789, embodied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>.\u00a7 739 of tbe Revised Statutes, was reenacted with no material alteration in the act-of March 3, 1873, c. 137, \u00a7 1, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">\u201c But no person shall be- arrested in one district for trial in another in any civil action before a Circuit or District Court ; and no civil suit shall be brought before, either of said courts against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving such process or-commencing such proceeding.\u201d 18 Stat.'470.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The only 'changes (beyond the substitution of \u201c person \u201d for \u201cinhabitant of the United States\u201d) consisted in -insertihg, in' the .middle1, of the sentence, after the words \u201c any original process,\u201d- the words \u201c or proceeding ; \u201d and in substituting, at the .end of the sentence, for the words \u201c serving the writ,\u201d the words \u201c serving such process or commencing such proceeding.\u201d These changes in no way extended the meaning - of the leading words, \u201ccivil action\u201d and \u201ccivil suit;\u201d but. merely affected the mode, of commencing such action or suit, and were probably intended to cover actions at law commenced otherwise than by process, according to the practice, pleadings \u00a1and' forms of proceeding in the courts of the States, which had \u25a0 been \u25a0 made. applicable to the Circuit and 'District Courts of the United States by the act of, 1872,. reenacted in the. Revised Statutes. Act of June 1, 1872, c. 255, \u00a7 5, 17 Stat. 197; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The provisi\u00f3n of.'.the act of 1887 on -which the petitioner relies, differs from' the correspo\u00fading provision of the act of 1875 in two particulars only :</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u25a01st. In the clerical mistake, \u201cprocess of proceeding\u201d for \u201c process or proceeding,\u201d which has been set right by the act of 1888 correcting the enrolment of the act of 1887. Act of August 13, 1888, :c. 866;, \u00a7 1,\" 25 Stat. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">2d. In striking out the last clause, permitting civil 'suits to be brought in the district in which the' defendant is found at the time-of service,, and thus confining them to the district of which he is an inhabitant.. This change, far from weakening the reason'of the, decision in <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Disintegrating </em>Co., above cited, greatly\u2019 strengthens it;.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Courts of admiralty are established. for the settlement of disputes^ between persons engaged in commerce and navigation, who, on the one hand, may be absent from their homes for long periods of time, and, on the other hand, often have property or credits in other places. In all nations, as observed by an .early' writer, such courts \u201c have been directed to proceed at such times, and in such manner, as might best consist with the-opportunities of trade, and least hinder or detain, men from-their employments.\u201d Zouch. Adm. Jur. 141. In the\" same spirit this court has more than once said: \u201c Courts of admiralty have been found necessary in all commercial countries, for the safety and convenience of commerce and. the speedy decision of. controversies, where delay would often be ruin.\u201d <em>The Genesee Chief, </em>12 How. 443, 454; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>11 Wall. 1, 24. To compel suitors in admiralty (when the ship is abroad and cannot be reached by a libel <em>in </em>rem) to resort to the home of the defendant, and to prevent them from suing him jn any district in which he might be' served with a summons or his goods or credits at-. \u2022taehed, would not only often put them to - great delay, inconvenience and expense, but would in many cases amount t\u00f3 a denial of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">In the. present case, the libellee had, in \u00e9ompliance with the law of Louisiana, appointed an agent at New Orleans;- on whom legal process \\might be served, and the monition was there served upon him. This would have been a good service in an action at law in any court of the State or of \u2019the United States in .Louisiana. <em>Lafayette Ins. Co. </em>v. French, 18 How. 404; <em>Ex parte Schollenberger, </em>96 U. S. 369; <em>New England Ins. Co. v. </em>Woodworth, 111 U. S. 138, 146. And no reason has- been or can be suggested why it should not be held .equally good in admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u2019 The District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana having jurisdiction both-of thfe cause and of the parties, the -</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><em>Writ of prohibition </em>is. <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">A similar decision was made in the ease, argued and 'decided at the same time, No. 9, Original, <em>Ex parte </em>The St. Paul Fire and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>MariNB Insurance Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, which, differed only in the petitioner and libellee being a corporation of' Minnesota.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
