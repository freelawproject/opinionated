Therein, under a printed heading as follows:</p> <p id=\"b78-13\" pgmap=\"78\">\u201c REMARKS, ETC.</p> <p id=\"b78-14\" pgmap=\"78\">Enter below, at the time, a record of all appeals and protests, and of all fines and other penalties imposed by the judges. (See sections 2 and 8 of instructions.) \u201d</p> <p id=\"b78-15\" pgmap=\"78\">There appears the following, in writing:</p> <p id=\"b78-16\" pgmap=\"78(11) 79(90)\">\u201c At the conclusion of the second heat, the judges put in Ed Geers, in place of George Eobens, to drive Eoy Willces. At the conclusion of the race, the presiding judge announced that the decision relative to penalties would be announced on the following day, and on the following morning it was announced that L. A. Dawes, the owner of Eoy Wilkes, was fined one thousand dollars, and George Eobens, the driver, five hundred dollars, and ordered both be suspended until fines are paid. The judges awarded Ed Geers one hundred dollars for finishing the race and winning the race,</p> <p id=\"b79-4\" pgmap=\"79\">P. P. Johnston,</p> <p id=\"b79-5\" pgmap=\"79\">Hamilton Busbey,</p> <p id=\"b79-6\" pgmap=\"79\">Judges.</p> <p id=\"b79-7\" pgmap=\"79\">Ed. Tipton, Clerk.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b79-8\" pgmap=\"79\">Assuming that the judges had the power to impose a fine upon the appellant, and that such fine, if imposed, would be a proper set-off, the record is devoid of any competent and sufficient evidence that they exercised \"such power. The entry of what has been quoted from the \u201c Judge\u2019s book,\u201d is a mere recital that on the morning following the race, somebody announced that appellant had been fined a thousand dollars, but it fails to state who imposed the fine, when it was imposed, or for what offense.</p> <p id=\"b79-9\" pgmap=\"79\">It would be an indulgence in pure conjecture to say who had fined the appellant, or what he had been fined for. The by-laws and rules of the National Trotting Association, which were received in evidence, taken in connection with the conduct of appellant, may or may not have warranted the imposition of a fine. It is not necessary for us to determine that question. So far as has been pointed out, or as we have been able to discover in the record, it does not appear that a fine was imposed by any authorized person or for the violation of any rule of the association.</p> <p id=\"b79-10\" pgmap=\"79\">The law will not permit the taking of one man\u2019s property by fine, or otherwise, by a mere statement that some other map has announced that it had been done.</p> <p id=\"b79-11\" pgmap=\"79(21) 80(17)\">It is stated in appellee\u2019s brief that it was admitted that under the authority of the rules of the National Trotting Association the judges imposed the fine in question, but we find no such admission in the record.</p> <p id=\"b80-5\" pgmap=\"80\">It is true that the appellant in his testimony often speaks of the fine, and of having been fined, but there seems nowhere to be an admission of the fine as a lawful imposition upon him., and it is apparent that he only used the word fine as descriptive of the penalty claimed against him.</p> <p id=\"b80-6\" pgmap=\"80\">Counsel for appellant also objected to the book on the express ground that it was not a record of the fine, and was nothing but a memorandum that something had been done, and not of the thing itself, and at the conclusion of the evidence moved the court to exclude from the consideration of the jury all evidence in relation to the fine on the ground, among others, that the fine was not a lawful one.</p> <p id=\"b80-7\" pgmap=\"80\">The defense of set-off is an affirmative one, and a party seeking to establish it must do so by competent evidence.</p> <p id=\"b80-8\" pgmap=\"80\">Because the appellee failed to prove by competent evidence the imposition of the fine in question, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
