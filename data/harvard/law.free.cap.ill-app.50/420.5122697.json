St. 381.</p> <p id=\"b416-19\" pgmap=\"416(42) 417(21)\">The subject of the sale here was an unexpired term of thirty months. Chattels real are subject to sale on execution (Sec. 40, Ch. 77, R. S.); and, when the unexpired term does not exceed five years, without redemption (Sec. 3). One entitled to possession under a sale upon execution may maintain forcible detainer.

Chambers, 73 Ill. 75.</p> <p id=\"b417-5\" pgmap=\"417\">The bill of sale by the sheriff to one Baeppler was of all the right, title and interest of the plaintiff in error, and the other defendant in the execution, in and to a certain lease of the first floor of a certain building, and Baeppler, by a bill of sale, transferred all his interest to the defendant in error.</p> <p id=\"b417-6\" pgmap=\"417\">There can be no doubt of the intent of these papers; they are not governed by any statute other than the statute of frauds; and an assignment of a leasehold estate need not be under seal. 2 Taylor, L. &amp; T., Sec. 428.</p> <p id=\"b417-7\" pgmap=\"417\">There is no apparent error in the record and a supersedeas is denied.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
