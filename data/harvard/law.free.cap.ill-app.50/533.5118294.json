J.</author> <p id=\"b529-12\" pgmap=\"529\">In this record there is a praecipe for a record ordering \u201c an authenticated transcript of the record in this cause and insert therein\u201d\u2014then follow nineteen items to be inserted. The certificate of the clerk is that the record brought up is a \u201c true, perfect and complete transcript of the record according to the praecipe filed.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b529-13\" pgmap=\"529\">The bill of exceptions says that a lot of exhibits \u201c are hereto annexed and made part hereof \u201d and none are annexed, but some documents are filed in this court, with the title and number of this case upon them. They also have indorsed upon them the filing by the clerk of the Circuit Court. They would be no part of the record if the clerk\u2019s certificate was a good one. Stock Quotation Telegraph Co. v.
