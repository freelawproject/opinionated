It is also agreed that said second party shall, when requested so to do, attend any auction sales of books that may occur in his district, for the purpose of purchasing for the association with the money furnished him by them for such purpose, and as per their instructions, any books that may be placed on sale that they may desire. It is also agreed that said second party shall provide, at some central place in his district, a suitable office to transact his said business and to keep a stock of goods, and that he shall put upon the outer door or wall a sign which shall read as follows, viz.: The Home Library Association, Mechanicstown, Maryland, Boss F. Witherow, Manager. It is also agreed that he shall get to commence his work with a stock of not less than $2,500 worth of goods, and that he shall pay at least $1,500 when order is made. It is hereby mutually agreed that the said second party shall at the end of each month retain five dollars (that shall have been paid in during the month) of each paid-up membership fee for the purpose of using to get new goods as they may be desired from time to time, and that he shall, after deducting and retaining the fro rata amounts of his hereinafter named salary, from the remaining amount that shall have been paid him, send the surplus that may exist to. said first party.

Y. Loomis, [Seal.]</p> <p id=\"b115-6\" pgmap=\"115\">Agent for the Home Library Association.</p> <p id=\"b115-7\" pgmap=\"115\">Ross E. Witherow. [Seal.]</p> <p id=\"b115-8\" pgmap=\"115\">In the presence of</p> <p id=\"b115-9\" pgmap=\"115\">Van B. Osler.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b115-10\" pgmap=\"115\">The theory upon which appellee recovered $1,673.50, was that under the clause in the paper, \u201c it is also agreed that said second party shall withdraw from his business all the capital put in by him at the end of this time,\u201d he was entitled to recover from the appellant whatever money he had advanced.</p> <p id=\"b115-11\" pgmap=\"115(32) 116(41)\">What sort of a scheme was being worked by the parties interested, does not appear from this record; but it does appear that the appellee sent to Hill &amp; Harvey, of Baltimore, $1,500, and received from them 300 books and 300 certificates of membership in the Home Library Association, of which the appellee gave no account, and all inquiry as to which, on cross-examination of the appellee as a witness, was denied.</p> <p id=\"b116-5\" pgmap=\"116\">First, the paper upon which the appellee relies is not a contract of the appellant; it is the personal .contract of Loomis only. His description of himself as \u201cSouthern Manager \u201d and \u201cAgent \u201d are merely descriptions.</p> <p id=\"b116-6\" pgmap=\"116\">Second, upon a sealed instrument no one not a party can. sue or be sued. Haines v. McCormick, 132 Ill. 104.</p> <p id=\"b116-7\" pgmap=\"116\">If money has come to the possession of the appellant, either in its own office or of agents receiving for the appellant, which the appellee is entitled to upon a full showing of all accounts, we do not decide that he may not recover it; but no such, case is made on this record, and the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
