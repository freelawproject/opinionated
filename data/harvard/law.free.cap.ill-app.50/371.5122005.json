When the building was nearly completed, early one morning, the wall at the south end showed several' cracks extending from the first floor to the top; the east wall was bowed eastward; at 10:30 a. m. a portion from the center of the east wall fell, demolishing the appellee\u2019s house adjoining.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-11\" pgmap=\"367\">As a consequence this suit was brought.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-12\" pgmap=\"367\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, H.

The plaintiff\u2019s case was made, if at all, on rebuttal.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-5\" pgmap=\"368\">The plaintiff must show fault or negligence of defendant. Hazel v.

His duty is, in the words of Baron Parke, \u201c to keep it in such a state that his neighbor may not be injured by its fall.\u201d Chantler v. Robinson, 4 Exch. 163, 170.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-10\" pgmap=\"368\">When the plaintiff proved that the building fell and injured him, he made out a case. As buildings do not usually or necessarily fall, it was for the jury to say, under all the evidence, whether the explanation on the part of the defendants was reasonably made. Buildings properly constructed do not fall without adequate cause. If there be no tempest prevailing or no external violence of any kind, the fair presumption is that the fall occurred through adequate causes, such as the ruinous condition of the building, which could scarcely have escaped the observation of the owner. The mind is thus led to a presumption of negligence on his part which may, of course, be rebutted. Mullen v. St. John, 57 N. Y. 567.</p> <opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b369-4\" pgmap=\"369\">Opinion of the Court,</p> <author id=\"A-Kl\" pgmap=\"369\">Waterman, J.</author> <p id=\"b369-5\" pgmap=\"369\">- This is an appeal from a judgment rendered for damage done by the falling of appellant\u2019s building, while in course of construction, whereby appellee\u2019s cottage was demolished.</p> <p id=\"b369-6\" pgmap=\"369\">It is conceded that appellant was constructing a large, five-story brick building, and that upon a fair day, no tempest blowing, it fell upon and destroyed the dwelling of appellee; this having been proven, we think it devolved upon appellant to show that the fall was without his fault.</p> <p id=\"b369-7\" pgmap=\"369\">Buildings properly constructed do not fall without adequate cause.</p> <p id=\"b369-8\" pgmap=\"369\">But for the act of appellant in building his large structure, the premises of appellee would not have been harmed; destroyed as they were by the falling of appellant\u2019s manufactory thereon, it is for him to show that he was not at fault. Mullen v. St. John, 57 N. Y. 567; Chantler v. Robinson, 4 Exch. 163, 170; Gorham v. Gross, 125 Mass. 232, 237; Shipley v. Fifth Associates, 106 Mass. 194, 198; Kappes et al. v.

The case is one in which the principle res ipsa loqxdtur is applicable. 2 Thompson on Negligence, 1220.</p> <p id=\"b369-10\" pgmap=\"369\">It is urged, for the first time in this court, that the action should have been brought in the name of a conservator said to have been appointed for Dufalla, who is an insane person. Such objection can not be here urged for the first time.</p> <p id=\"b369-11\" pgmap=\"369\">Until a conservator of a lunatic is appointed, suits are properly brought in the name of the lunatic. Chicago &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Munger, 78 Ill. 300.</p> <p id=\"b369-12\" pgmap=\"369\">There was no competent evidence that a conservator for the plaintiff had been appointed; such appointment is a judicial act, and should be proven by a copy of the record; in the present case, a witness merely incidentally testified that he had been appointed conservator of appellee.</p> <p id=\"b369-13\" pgmap=\"369\">We find no error in this record warranting a reversal of the judgment, and it is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
