Interpleader\u2014Rights of Creditors.\u2014November 3,1887, the Ohio and Western Coal and Iron Company, a corporation existing under the laws of New York, and the firm of Glidden &amp; Curtis, of Boston, Mass., made an assignment by which the firm was to sell, or supervise and con. trol all sales of said company\u2019s articles and products, to furnish advances according to its needs to such extent as they should consider themselves safely secure, at current rates of interest and exchange, to render accounts of sales monthly to said corporation, and charge their commissions, etc. All articles and products of the said corporation were to be consigned to said firm. The contract was to continue in force for five years, from the thirty-first day of October, 1887. Afterward Glidden &amp; Curtis became insolvent and made an assignment to A. D. Bell et al.; previous to this the firm had sold, on credit, to the Pullman Company, products of the Coal and Iron Company to the amount of $30,000. February 8, 1889, the First National Bank of Columbus, Ohio, first learned of the assignment of Glidden &amp; Curtis. It held notes of the Coal and Iron Company to the amount of $30,000, indorsed by Glidden &amp; Curtis, coming due on the 9th and 11th. On the next day, the 9th, it procured an order from the Coal and Iron Company, \u00e1igned by its assistant treasurer, on the Pullman Company, for the payment to its order of the sum of $30,000. Neither the bank nor the Pullman Company had any notice of the relations existing between Glidden &amp; Curtis and the Coal and Iron Company. On the 9th day of February, 1889, the Coal and Iron Company at New York made an assignment to James A. Hall of Columbus, Ohio. The bank, under the order, and the attaching creditors of the Coal and Iron Company, all claimed the money of the Pullman Company, and it filed its bill of interpleader. It was held, that the bank was entitled to be first paid out of the fund.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\" pgmap=\"190\">Memorandum.\u2014Bill of interpleader.

C. Stanwood, the assistant treasurer of the Coal and Iron Company, who resided in Columbus, and had negotiated the loan in question, and was the only officer of the company then in Ohio, and demanded further security from the company. On the next morning, Stan-wood gave the bank an order on the Pullman Company, of Chicago, for $20,000, to be paid out of moneys owing and to become due to the Coal and Iron Company on or about the 15th day of February, and the 15th day of March, 1889.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\" pgmap=\"191\">The Pullman Company was at once notified by telegraph, and the draft sent to Chicago for collection, presented, and protested for non-acceptance on the 11th day of February, and again for non-payment on the 15th day of February and 15th day of March.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\" pgmap=\"191\">On February 11, 1889, the deed of assignment of the Coal and Iron Company to James A. Hall, assignee, was delivered to Hall and filed for record in the Probate Court of Franklin County, Ohio. On February 9th, Marcus A. Thompson, a creditor of the company, began suit by attachment in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, and had his writ served on the Pullman Company as garnishee. This attachment was followed by others at various dates, and on October 5, 1889, the Pullman Company filed its bill of interpleader, admitting its indebtedness to the Coal and Iron Company in the sum of $31,683.63, and bringing in the bank, the Coal and Iron Company and the several attaching creditors to prove their claims to the fund.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\" pgmap=\"191\">To this bill the bank filed its answer on October 28,1889, setting up the draft in question and the facts relating thereto, insisting that said draft when given, operated as an assignment pro tcmito of the fund in question, and asking for a decree for payment thereof.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\" pgmap=\"192\">Upon a hearing in the Circuit Court, a decree giving the fund to the attaching creditors was entered and the bank appealed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-5\" pgmap=\"192\">Appellants\u2019 Brief, Horton, Burley &amp; Howell, Attorneys for First Hational Bank of Columbus.</attorneys><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\" pgmap=\"192\">The bank contended that a corporation may be bound as readily as an individual, by giving to a person the appearance of authority as agent. The salutary doctrine of estoppel may be invoked against corporations as readily as against individuals, to prevent them from misleading or defrauding the public by setting up the lack of strict and formal authority when charged with the consequences of transactions had in good faith with persons held out and apparently authorized as their agents.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\" pgmap=\"192\">If an act performed by an agent would, under ordinary circumstances, be within the authority delegated to the agent, a person dealing with him in good faith, on the faith of his apparent powers, and without notice of facts showing that the act was unauthorized, may hold the principal liable, whether the act was authorized or not.

It was promptly brought to the knowledge of its officers, and although directors\u2019 meetings were held thereafter, not only was no action taken to rescind it, but the officers, so far as the evidence indicates, approved the act; and neither the corporation nor its assignee, though parties to this suit, has sought to defeat the payment.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-5\" pgmap=\"193\">If the corporation had the right to disaffirm the act, it should have done so promptly; and failing in this, it must be held to\" have ratified it.

Cases may be cited upholding the right of a corporation, unrestricted by statute, to make a'preferential assignment. The rule is quite firmly established. Waite on Insolv. Corp\u2019ns, Sec. 162.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-4\" pgmap=\"194\">A creditor has unquestionably the right to pursue his legal remedies against his debtor, so long as he does so in good faith, and if he thus succeeds in obtaining priority, either by suit or by the voluntary act of his debtor, he is entitled to hold the advantage gained, even though the result may be to postpone or even defeat other creditors.

The appellees are all attaching creditors of the Ohio &amp; Western Coal &amp; Iron Company, and the fund in controversy, over $30,000, is in the Circuit Court, in a suit commenced by a bill of interpleader filed by the Pullman Palace Car Company.</p> <p id=\"b197-3\" pgmap=\"197\">November 3, 1887, the Goal &amp; Iron Company and the firm of Glidden &amp; Curtis executed an agreement containing these clauses:</p> <p id=\"b197-4\" pgmap=\"197\">\u201c First. The said firm are to sell or supervise and control all sales of said corporation\u2019s articles and products, and they are to furnish advances on said corporation\u2019s products according to its needs to such extent as they shall consider themselves safely secured therefor at current rates of interest and exchange, and they are to render accounts of sales monthly to said corporation, and charge their commissions at the rate of ten (] 0) cents per ton on the sales of the coal, and two and one-half (2-}') per cent on sales of iron.</p> <p id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\">Second.

On that 8th day of February the bank learned that Glidden &amp; Curtis had that day made an assignment, and the next morning obtained from the Coal &amp; Iron Company an order as follows:</p> <p id=\"b197-10\" pgmap=\"197\">\u201c Columbus, Ohio, February 8,1889.</p> <p id=\"AJz\" pgmap=\"197\">To The Pullman Palace Car Company, Pullman, 111.</p> <p id=\"b197-11\" pgmap=\"197(35) 198(21)\">Please pay to the First National Bank of Columbus, Ohio, or order, the sum of twenty thousand dollars of the money owing by you and to become due to us on or about the 15th day of February, and the 15th day of March, 1889; value received by us, and charge the same to our account.</p> <p id=\"b198-5\" pgmap=\"198\">The Ohio &amp; Western Coal &amp; Iron Co.,</p> <p id=\"b198-6\" pgmap=\"198\">By H.

Upon these facts, which we assume, and do not attempt to prove by collating the evidence, and which will not be conceded to be the facts by any party but the bank, we hold\u2014without undertaking to prove\u2014the law to be, that the bank is entitled to be first paid from the fund in court, the amount remaining unpaid upon the order, which is $16,676.79 after deducting moneys received from other sources, and the residue thereof, after deducting costs and expenses properly chargeable thereon, belongs to Bell and his associates, the trustees.</p> <p id=\"b198-7\" pgmap=\"198\">' The decree of the Circuit Court giving it to the attaching creditors is therefore reversed and the cause remanded with directions that the distribution be thus made:</p> <p id=\"b198-8\" pgmap=\"198\">First. Pay to the First National Bank of Columbus, Ohio, the sum of $16,676.79, with interest at five per cent per annum from March 1, 1889.</p> <p id=\"b198-9\" pgmap=\"198\">Second. Pay the net residue to the appellants, Bell, Stowe and Morrison. And that the Circuit Court award to the said appellants respectively their costs against the said attaching creditors, appellees here.
