Bachman, instead of going away, deliberately came back, renewed the quarrel, and struck this foolish, insulting and, perhaps, intoxicated old man. \" The damages assessed, $600, are in our view, under the circumstances, large \u2014 greater than we think ought to have been allowed\u2014but, if disposed to do so, we could not set aside the judgment for that reason.</p> <p id=\"b258-4\" pgmap=\"258\">No motion for a new trial is shown in the bill of exceptions. A motion for a new trial is not a part of the record, and does not become so by its being copied by the clerk as a part of the proceedings in the cause. Foreman v. Johnson, 40 Ill. App. 456; Gill v.
