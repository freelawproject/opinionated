Appellant claimed that he had been damaged by reason of the delay, which he claimed was due wholly to the fault of appellee, and refused to pay. The damages claimed by appellant arose from the fact that he had a large number of applicants to rent the different floors of the building prior to May 1, 1892, but that the parties applying would not make leases owing to the fact that the entrances to the building were in such a condition that ingress and egress through them was impossible on account of the scaffolding, etc., which appellee had in these entrances for his use in the performance of the work.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-6\" pgmap=\"245\">Appellant\u2019s Bribe, Goorich &amp; Vincent and F.

The contract must be declared on its special assumpsit and an averment made of compliance with the conditions precedent. And it is an error for the court to admit in evidence upon an action in general indebitatus assumpsit a contract which is still executory. Throop v. Sherwood, 4 Gil. 92; Lane v.

Rep. 844.</p><attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-5\" pgmap=\"247\">Appellee\u2019s Brief, M. Salomon, Attorney.</attorneys><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\" pgmap=\"247\">Appellee contended that the plaintiff could recover under the common counts, citing Combs v. Steele, 80 Ill. 101; Fowler v. Deakman, 84 Ill. 130; Michael Bay Lumber Co. v. Jenks, 20 Brad. 369; Zjednoczenie, etc., v. Sadecki, 41 Ill. App. 329.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\" pgmap=\"247\">That damages occasioned by the delay in the completion of the building could not be recovered under the pleadings.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-8\" pgmap=\"247\">General damages are such as the law implies, and presumes to have accrued from the wrong complained of. Special damages are such as really took place, and are not implied by law. 1 Ch. Pl. 395.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-9\" pgmap=\"247\">In this case the law can not necessarily imply that the plaintiff sustained damage by the act complained of, and therefore it is necessary and essential that the declaration should show with particularity the resulting damage.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-10\" pgmap=\"247\">It is a rule of pleading, wherever the damages sustained have not necessarily accrued from the act complained of, and consequently are not implied by law, that, in order to prevent surprise on the defendant, the plaintiff must state the particular damage he has sustained, or he will not be permitted to give evidence of it. 1 Ch. Pl. 396; Furlong v. Polleys, 30 Me. 491.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-11\" pgmap=\"247(33) 248(15)\">In all such cases of contract, the measure of damages is the actual loss sustained by plaintiff, on account of the failure by the defendant to comply with his contract. The loss of probable profits constitutes no part of the damages. Taylor v. Macguire, 13 Mo. 517.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\" pgmap=\"248\">Sedgwick, in his treatise on the measure of damages says: \u201c In all cases growing out of the non-performance of con-' tracts, and in those of the infringement of rights, or the nonperformance of duties created or imposed by law, in which there is no element of fraud, willful negligence or malice, the compensation recovered in damages consists solely of the direct pecuniary loss.\u201d Sedgwick on Damages, 36; Watson v. The Ambugate, N. &amp; B. R. Co., 3 Eng. L. &amp; E. R. 497.</p> <opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b248-6\" pgmap=\"248\">Opibioh of the Court,</p> <author id=\"ACp\" pgmap=\"248\">Gary, P. J.</author> <p id=\"b248-7\" pgmap=\"248\">\u25a0 This is an action for work done under a contract for constructing the iron arch entrances, etc., of a building. The contract required the work to be done by March 15, 1892, and payment to be made within thirty days after the work \u25a0was done, provided that the architect should certify that it had been done to his satisfaction.</p> <p id=\"b248-8\" pgmap=\"248\">The work was not finished by March 15, and June 22, 1892, the architect did certify that the entire work was finally completed May 21, 1892, but omitted any reference to his own satisfaction.</p> <p id=\"b248-9\" pgmap=\"248\">The appellant claimed damages for the delay, alleging that parts of the building could not be occupied because the entrances were obstructed. We shall not pass upon the question of damages further than to say that there is a good deal of evidence in support of the claim of the appellant.</p> <p id=\"b248-10\" pgmap=\"248\">The declaration was the common counts, in assumpsit, among which was the count for work and materials; pleas, general issue, and set-off of the damages, but the latter is too vague and general to be regarded.</p> <p id=\"b248-11\" pgmap=\"248\">The appellant\u2019s objection that the declaration should be special, is not good. \" The suit was not commenced until after the architect\u2019s certificate was procured. Nothing further remained for the appellee to do. In such a case, the common count suffices. Fowler v. Deakman, 84 Ill. 130; Zjednoczenie v. Sadecki, 41 Ill. App. 329.</p> <p id=\"b248-12\" pgmap=\"248(19) 249(35)\">The architect\u2019s certificate that the entire work was completed, implies that it was done as the contract required, and to the satisfaction of the architect. FTo objection appears to have been made to the form of the certificate until the case arrived here; payment was refused because, and only because, of the delay.</p> <p id=\"b249-4\" pgmap=\"249\">The completion of the work on time was not a condition precedent to the action, but damages resulting from the delay may be recouped. Spencer v. Dougherty, 23 Ill. App. 399, and cases there cited. And the recoupment needs no special plea; it is had under the general issue. Wadhams v. Swan, 109 Ill. 46.</p> <p id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249\">What would be the natural consequences of obstructing the entrances to the building after March 15th, must have been obvious to the appellee, and no special notice to it of what they would be, was necessary. For them it is responsible, so far as the appellant was thereby injured.</p> <p id=\"b249-7\" pgmap=\"249\">It is for the jury to say from the evidence whether readiness for occupancy of any portion of the building was delayed by such obstructions; if it was, a fair rent of that portion during the period while readiness for occupancy was so delayed, .may be recouped.</p> <p id=\"b249-8\" pgmap=\"249\">JSTo inquiry as to what use the appellant had for the premises, is admissible, or Avhether he could or could not have rented them. Green v. Mann, 11 Ill. 613; Korf v. Lull, 70 Ill. 420; Benton v. Fay, 64 Ill. 417.</p> <p id=\"b249-9\" pgmap=\"249\">The rental value only is to be considered in estimating the damages.</p> <p id=\"b249-10\" pgmap=\"249\">The case was tried Avithout a jury, and it is not quite clear from the record why the court found for the appellee for the full contract price with interest.</p> <p id=\"b249-11\" pgmap=\"249\">Propositions of law contemplating allowance of damages for delay, Avere rejected, and one holding that the appellee was entitled to recover the whole contract price, if it had performed the work, sustained.</p> <p id=\"b249-12\" pgmap=\"249\">We may suspect that it was considered that recoupment should have been specially pleaded, but at all events it is clear that the appellant was entitled to some damages, and got none.</p> <p id=\"b249-13\" pgmap=\"249\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
