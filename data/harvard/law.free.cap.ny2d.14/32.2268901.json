That section provides: \u201cNo races or contests for speed shall be held and no person shall engage in or aid or abet in any motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed on a highway without the permission of the authorities of the state, city, town or village having jurisdiction and unless the same is fully and efficiently patrolled for the entire distance over which such race or contest for speed is to be held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The term \u201cdrag race\u201d is explained in Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary (p. 684) as \u201can acceleration contest between automobiles\u201d with special reference to \u201chot rods\u201d. The author of the book, \u201c Hot Rod It \u201d,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> states: \u201c On closed airstrips, rodders also began competing in acceleration or drag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>races for the fastest time over a quarter mile from a standing point. Back of dragging is the same competitive spirit that makes you want to beat the other cars from a stop light. Drag racing, though, like all hot rod competition, is done on a runway, a special course, or a roadway under careful supervision to insure safety and fair treatment to all competitors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Although the term \u201c drag race \u201d has not been defined specifically by the Legislature, its import may be discerned from the language used in the particular statute which appellant stands convicted of having violated, which says that \u2018\u2018 no races or contests for speed shall be held * * * on a highway without the permission of the authorities \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The information hy which this criminal prosecution was instituted charges appellant with <em>\u201c </em>drag racing\u201d. This, as just indicated, refers to holding races or contests for speed upon highways. \u2018 \u2018 Drag racing \u2019 \u2019 may be inspired by the same competitive spirit that makes some drivers want to beat other cars from a stop light, but it requires something more than this. Violation of this statute means that, at least by implication, some race course must have been planned by the competitors along a street. It is not enough that an automobile operated by defendant and one by his codefendant left an intersection abreast when the traffic light changed to green and, thereafter, travelled abreast at about 55 miles an hour, each car jockeying for position. If this is what these defendants did, they were clearly guilty of speeding, perhaps of reckless driving, and it may be that they were guilty of other misdemeanors or traffic infractions as well. From that circumstance it does not follow, however, that they were <em>\u201c </em>drag racing \u201d on the public street. Not every competitive encounter between two automobiles accelerated from a street intersection upon a change in the traffic signal constitutes a <em>\u201c </em>drag race \u201d, even though they may jockey for position by passing and repassing each other. It is not indicated that this is a commendable manner of driving or that these defendants were not guilty of other crimes or offenses. We hold merely that the evidence before us is not sufficient to convict appellant beyond a reasonable doubt of \u2018 \u2018 drag racing \u2019 \u2019 in violation of section 1182 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Judges Fuld, Scileppi and Bergan concur with Judge Van Voorhis; Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye and Burke dissent and vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Judgment reversed and information dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\"> Fred Horsley.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
