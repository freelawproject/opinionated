Prac, Act, \u00a7 580)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>We agree with the Appellate Division that, in this notion for inducing breach of contract and unfair competition, the successful plaintiff was entitled as a matter of right to interest on the amount of the recovery, measured from the date of the accrual of the cause of action,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in accordance with the decisional law upholding the right to such interest in actions to recover for property damage stemming from intentional torts. (See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>135 N. Y. 96,104-105; <em>Flamm </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>296 N. Y. 262, 268; see, also, <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Long Is. Daily Press Pub. Co., </em>9 N Y 2d 255, 257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We perceive no basis for differentiating this case from suits involving other classes of intentional torts, such as actions for conversion, fraud, duress, trespass or replevin, in which pre-verdict interest has been held to be recoverable as a matter of right. (See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>135 N. Y. 96, 104-105, supra; <em>Flamm </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>296 N. Y. 262, <em>supra.) </em>The need is as great in this case as in those others since the purpose of the award of interest is to afford a plaintiff \u201c full indemnification\u201d for the defendant\u2019s wrongful interference with his property rights. (See <em>Flamm </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>296 N. Y. 262, 268, <em>supra.) </em>While this court has recently declined to discard the decisional rule\u2014which it has frequently criticized (see, e.g., <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>135 N. Y. 96, 104-105, <em>supra; Flamm </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>296 N. Y. 262, 268, supra)\u2014that interest in actions involving <em>negligent </em>injury to property must be left to the discretion of the trier of facts (see <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Long Is. Daily Press Pub. Co., </em>9 N Y 2d 255, <em>supra), </em>it is generally recognized that interest is awardable as a matter of right in all other tort actions in which damages are recovered for the destruction of, or injury to, property rights. (See 1950 Report of N. Y. Law Rev. Comm., pp. 110-116.)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">This being so, we need not decide whether section 480 of the Civil Practice Act \u2014 in effect when the court awarded interest \u2014 may be broadly read, as Special Term did, to include a tort action for inducing breach of contract as one <em>\u201c </em>based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>breach of performance of a contract \u2019 And, since the motion for the allowance of interest was made and granted prior to the effective date of the new CPLR (cf. <em>Simonson </em>v. <em>International Bank, </em>14 N Y 2d 281, 290), there is no occasion for us now to consider the impact and scope of its section 5001(a), expanding the right to interest in property damage actions. We note, however, to quote the authors of the comprehensive work on the new statute, that that provision \u2018 \u2018 is phrased broadly and is designed to obliterate all distinctions that may turn on the form of the action * * <em>*, </em>the type of property involved, or the nature of the encroachment upon the plaintiff\u2019s property interests.\u201d (5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, N. Y. Civ. Prac., par. 5001.05, at p. 50-16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Concerning the other arguments advanced by the defendant, we would merely say that we have examined them and find them without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The order affirming the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi and Bergan concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. CPLR 5501(a) provides, in part, that \u201cAn appeal from a final <em>judgment </em>brings up for review: 1, any non-final judgment or order which necessarily affects the final judgment * * * [and] 2. any order denying a new trial\u201d. (Italics supplied.) If taken literally, this section might bar review of such nonfinal orders on appeal to this court (pursuant to the new enactment [CPLR 5512]) from the <em>order </em>of the Appellate Division embodying the final determination. (See <em>Purchasing Assoc, </em>v. <em>Weitz, </em>13 N Y 2d 267, 275.) However, we do not so read the section in view of the evident intent of the drafters of the CPLR not to curtail the power of review in this respect previously vested in this court under section 580 of the Civil Practice Act. (See N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1958, No. 13, pp. 125-126.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. The fact that the plaintiff was here awarded interest from the date of the commencement of the action, rather than from any earlier date, affords the defendant no basis for complaint. (See <em>High Quality Homes </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>283 App. Div. 954, 955; <em>Adler </em>v. <em>Pilot Ind., </em>192 Misc. 774; see, also, 5 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, N. Y. Civ. Prac., par. 5001.10.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
