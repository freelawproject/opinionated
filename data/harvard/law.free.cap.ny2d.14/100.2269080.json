The grounds for relief advanced by petitioner were: that he is a qualified and successful practitioner certified since 1959 by the State of New York under article 153 of the Education Law; that respondent is the most important association of psychologists in the State numbering among its members most of the psychologists in the State and acts as spokesman for the profession and that membership therein is \u201c a tangible thing of value\u201d to any psychologist. The petition asserts, too \u2014 although this is denied and the contrary was found below\u2014that respondent\u2019s by-laws call for the admission to membership of all qualified psychologists and that respondent in 1959 invited petitioner to join but later denied his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In answer respondent points out that it is not a public or governmental body but a private corporation governed by its own by-laws. One of those by-laws (art. Ill, \u00a7 <em>%) </em>makes it a condition for admission to membership that the applicant \u2018\u2018 have completed at least two years of graduate work in psychology in a recognized graduate school or one year of graduate study plus one year of experience in professional work that is psychological in nature \u201d. Petitioner has not taken any postgraduate work and his only college degree is that of Bachelor of Science. The by-law above described contains another subdivision authorizing acceptance into membership -\u2018 In exceptional cases \u2019 \u2019 of persons not possessing the educational qualifications but nonetheless deemed qualified provided the Board of Directors by a two-thirds vote so determines. The Board of Directors (thrice) declined to do so in petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The principal law issue is as to whether the association is in such a monopolistic position or is so nearly an arm of the State itself that equal protection and due process constitutional requirements make it unlawful for it to reject qualified and certified applicants. Before taking up that law issue, we should first dispose of petitioner\u2019s factual contention that the association itself had by official action decided to admit all State-certified psychologists and had invited petitioner himself to apply for membership. Special Term found to the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>writing this: \u2018 \u2018 The petitioner received through the mails a circular soliciting applications for membership. He contends this was equivalent to an election thereto. It was no such thing. At best, it was only an invitation to apply for membership pursuant to the association rules \u201d. The Appellate Division, affirming without opinion, presumably concurred in this finding and it is well based in the record. What petitioner describes as an <em>\u201c </em>invitation \u201d to join was a circular letter addressed to petitioner and all other certificate holders notifying them that as such they had already met the <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>basic eligibility requirements for membership in the State Association \u201d. Enclosed with this letter was, however, an information sheet and an application blank which alluded to the requirement o<em>f </em>graduate academic work in psychology \u201d. The by-laws, contrary to the allegation in the petition, have never been amended to eliminate this standard. We agree with the courts below that it was never waived as to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Since, therefore, respondent\u2019s directors were under no duty to accept petitioner\u2019s bid although they could have done so in their discretion, authority to dismiss the petition would ordinarily be found in the decisions which deny mandamus-type relief as to such discretionary matters <em>(Matter of Gimprich </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of City of N. Y., </em>306 N. Y. 401). However, petitioner\u2019s demands for what he considers to be \u201c equal protection \u201d and \u201c due process \u201d rights call for further examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Petitioner\u2019s claims of constitutional deprivations are summarized in these statements from his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201c The association is in effect the State and, therefore, its unreasonable and arbitrary refusal of membership to petitioner is State action and consequently a violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201c The association as spokesman and representative for all psychologists in New York has monopoly power over the profession and cannot restrict the professional activities and diminish the reputation of an applicant by unreasonably and arbitrarily excluding him from membership.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">We will assume that if the factual matters in those statements were established as factual truths, the application thereto of the cited legal principles would follow (see discussion in <em>Railway </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Mail Assn. </em>v. <em>Corsi, </em>293 N. Y. 315, affd. 326 U. S. 88). But there is no showing in this record that respondent association is \u201cin effect the State \u201d or that it has \u201cmonopoly power over the profession \u201d or that its refusal to accept petitioner was \u201c arbitrary or unreasonable Let us take up first the last of those allegations, that is, the charge of arbitrariness and unreasonableness in the rejection of petitioner\u2019s application. Petitioner, although a psychologist of repute, has not only never had graduate study in that science or branch of learning but has never passed a State examination. Until the enactment in 1956 of new article 153 of the Education Law, there was no official certification of psychologists in New York State (see Judge Froessel\u2019s instructive opinion in <em>National Psychological Assn. </em>v. <em>University of State of N. Y., </em>8 N Y 2d 197). The new article, unlike other statutory schemes for controlling other professional groups, \u201cis a certification rather than a licensing law, i.e., it does not prohibit anyone from rendering psychological services, but proscribes the professional use by noncertificants of the title \u2018 psychologist \u2019 and its derivatives, for remuneration \u201d <em>(National Psychological Assn, </em>opinion, <em>supra, </em>p. 200). Lack of certification limits the practice of noncertificants since they are not allowed to use the title \u201c psychologist \u201d in offering their services to the public (Education Law, \u00a7 7601). Significantly, the new statutes themselves require (for certification of persons who have not previously practiced as psychologists) an even higher standard than that imposed by respondent\u2019s by-law. Section 7605 of the Education Law prescribes for certification of such a new-pledged psychologist that, before even taking the examination, he must have received a doctoral degree based on studies of primarily psychological content in an approved graduate program (plus two years\u2019 experience). Petitioner gained State certification without examination or graduate study by the application to him of a \u201c grandfather clause \u201d (\u00a7 7605, subd. 5) which excused from these requirements one who had practiced psychology for at least 12 years prior to July, 1958. Respondent\u2019s demands of its members, being less rigorous than those of the State itself, could hardly be held to be arbitrary or unreasonable as matter of law. Petitioner puts reliance on <em>Falcone </em>v. <em>Middlesex County Med. Soc. </em>(34 N. J. 582 [1961]) but the <em>Falcone </em>opinion (of which more hereafter) was careful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>to say (p. 598) that the New Jersey court would sympathetically support \u201c action which is designed to advance medical science or elevate professional standards \u201d while striking down action having no relation to such elevations or advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Petitioner\u2019s next assertion is that \u201c The association is in effect the State \u201d and its action, therefore, \u201c State action If this were so, the by-law\u2019s limitation, although not in itself unreasonable as a prerequisite, might be illegal as against the fact of State certification. But the attempt to identify this private corporation with the State is farfetched. It stands on these facts: of the 17 members of the statutory (see Education Law, \u00a7 7604) Advisory Council, which aids in formulating State policies, 8 are members of respondent\u2019s Board of Directors; respondent association works closely with the Advisory Council in setting up recommendations as to unprofessional conduct, etc., and in proposing revisions to article 153 of the Education Law; respondent association in its publications boasts that it is exercising leadership \u201c in this state-wide poll of all psychologists \u201d. All these together, argues petitioner, add up to \u201c State action \u2019 \u2019 and make respondent a \u201c State agency \u201d, citing such cases as <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Condon </em>(286 U. S. 73). We do not agree. Petitioner\u2019s showing of co-operation between this professional group and the State\u2019s own Advisory Council falls well short of the <em>Nixon </em>case\u2019s test : \u2018\u2018 whether they [political party committee] are to be classified as representatives of the State to such an extent and in such a sense that the great restraints of the Constitution set limits to their action\u201d (286 U. S., supra, p. 89). Co-operation and leadership, advice and reliance on advice \u2014 these are shown, but not shown is delegation by or agency of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The last of petitioner\u2019s relied-on \u201c facts \u201d is that the association \u201chas monopoly power over the profession \u201d, but even petitioner sees that \u201c monopoly \u201d as operating only to \u201c restrict the professional activities and diminish the reputation\u201d of nonmembers. As to downgrading of petitioner\u2019s reputation, exclusion from any selective group of high-standard professionals leaves the rejected one\u00ae without desired kudos and prestige \u2014 but no court has ever taken it on itself to review such selections. As to nonmembership in respondent association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>restricting petitioner\u2019s professional activities, there is just no proof at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The courts, it seems, interfere in such matters only when there is a showing of \u201c economic necessity \u201d for membership. Typical of such interventions is the <em>Falcone </em>case (34 N. J. 582, <em>supra). </em>Dr. Falcone, although his ethics, competence and experience were undisputed, and although be met all the requirements of the by-laws, failed of admission to his county medical society because there was applied to him \u2018 \u2018 an unwritten membership requirement of four years of study at a medical college approved by the A. M. A.\u201d (opinion, p. 586). The Supreme Court of New Jersey ordered him admitted to membership because he proved both monopoly and economic necessity. He could not \u201c successfully continue his practice of surgery and obstetrics \u2019 \u2019 without <em>\u201c </em>the use of local hospital facilities \u201d (opinion, p. 587) and the local hospitals would not (and could not if they were to keep their own accreditations) allow him to remain on their staffs after he had been refused membership in the county medical society. The New Jersey courts on this whole picture could do no less than order the medical society to take him in.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">A word about the New York decisions cited by petitioner. <em>People ex rel. Bartlett </em>v. <em>Medical Soc. of County of Erie </em>(32 N. Y. 187) is authority for the use of mandamus as a remedy but it is otherwise irrelevant. The <em>Bartlett </em>case was decided in 1865 at a time when applicable statutes (Rev. Stat. of N. Y., part I, ch. XIV, tit. VII, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 17, 34 [1 Rev. Stat. (4th ed.) 856]) decreed that no one not a member of the local medical society could practice as a physician. Bartlett, fulfilling all the stated requirements, was accepted as a county society member, then immediately expelled because of alleged unethical conduct before admission. The holding of this court was that the expulsion contravened the organization\u2019s own by-laws. <em>Matter of Rice </em>v. <em>Flushing Hosp. </em>(266 App. Div. 689) is even more wide of the mark since it upheld only the right of a layman to become a member of a hospital association, once he showed conformity to the by-laws. There is no decision in New York (or elsewhere to our knowledge, see survey of all the cases at 89 A. L. R. 2d 964) which even looks toward court interposition in a case like the present one.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The order should he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi and Bergan concur. , . , ,</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
