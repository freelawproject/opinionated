Dismissal by the court of whole indictment or count for insufficiency of proof at the trial constitutes final acquittal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>84 R Y. 478; <em>People ex rel.

A jury disagreement does not permit retrial as to any part of indictment from which a defendant is discharged. <em>(People ex rel.

The People are estopped from moving any count of carnal abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>as a felony, because the question of the prior conviction was litigated at the first trial in favor of respondent, and because on the second trial such count was moved as a misdemeanor. <em>(Hinchey </em>v. <em>Sellers, </em>7 N Y 2d 287; <em>Israel </em>v. <em>Wood Dolson Co., </em>1 N Y 2d 116; <em>Matter of Martinis </em>v. <em>Supreme Court of State of N. Y., </em>20 A D 2d 79 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Litt-Chinitz, </em>38 Misc 2d 864.) VIII. The carnal abuse charge having been moved as a misdemeanor at the second trial, the People are now estopped from moving it as a felony. <em>(People v. Chessman, </em>13 N Y 2d 793; <em>Matter of Martinis </em>v. <em>Supreme Court of State of N. Y., </em>20 A D 2d 79; <em>People ex rel. Pulko </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>244 App. Div. 382.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"APK\">Since the respondent Bishop was never placed in jeopardy of conviction for the crime of carnal abuse as a felony, subjecting him to trial for such offense will not constitute double jeopardy. When the respondent sought and obtained an order vacating the 1937 judgment of conviction\u2014on the strength of which he was charged in the 1960 indictment with the felony of carnal abuse \u2014 any and all danger of his being convicted of such crime upon the trial of that indictment was eliminated. In other words, by procuring the vacatur of the earlier judgment, the respondent rendered his conviction of the felony impossible as a matter of law and, consequently, the trial judge\u2019s dismissal of the felony charge at the close of the People\u2019s case, rather than constituting a dismissal of that charge on the merits, simply reflected and confirmed the then existing situation. When, therefore, the order vacating the 1937 judgment was reversed on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>14 A D 2d 376, affd. 11 N Y 2d 854) and that conviction was reinstated, the People were (and are) free to proceed against the respondent \u2014 after the trials on the 1960 indictment had terminated in disagreement and mistrials\u2014upon a superseding indictment charging the respondent with carnal abuse as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis, Burke and Scileppi concur; Judge Bergan taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
