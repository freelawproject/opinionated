The determination of probable cause by the Magistrate issuing a search warrant should not be set aside if the underlying affidavit shows any basis at all for the issuance of a warrant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-5\">Scileppi, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1Z\">Defendants were convicted of the crime of bookmaking (Penal Law, \u00a7 986) on the basis of evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. Prior to the trial, defendants moved to suppress the evidence so seized on the ground that the search warrant was issued without a sufficient showing of probable cause. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The affidavit of a member of the New York State police, which accompanied the application made to a Judge of the Erie County Court for the afore-mentioned search warrant, stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201c That your deponent has been conducting an investigation relative to gambling being carried on at the above premises [556 Lakeview Avenue in the Town of Orchard Park, Erie County, New York].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">\u201c That on April 25, 1962 your deponent observed one James Faliero, a known gambler, whose true name is Mariano Faliero, BPD No. 36771, entering the said premises * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\"><em>\u201c </em>That on April 26, 1962, your deponent, and other investigators working with deponent, observed the said James Faliero again entering said premises.

S. 132; <em>Dumbra </em>v. <em>United States, </em>268 U. S. 435; <em>Aderhold </em>v. <em>United States, </em>132 F. 2d 858). It is not a matter for technical rules or tight and exact definition. The question always is: what in the common judgment of reasonable men would be regarded as good, sound cause, remembering that we seek only probable, not absolute cause ? * * * Whether probable cause is present in a particular case must be determined from the facts of that case <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>279 F. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>712, 714, cert. den. 364 U. S. 850).\u201d A decision with regard to a finding of probable cause involves not merely a question of fact but rather a mixed question of fact and constitutional law (N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 12; U. S. Const., 4th Amdt.; <em>Dumbra </em>v. <em>United States, </em>268 U. S. 435; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U. S. 132; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Richmond County News, </em>9 N Y 2d 578). This court, then, must, as arbiter of constitutional issues, make an independent appraisal of the facts and circumstances obtaining in each case to determine whether the Magistrate who issues the search warrant could reasonably find from the proof before him that there was a sufficient showing of probable cause for the issuance of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In the instant case, assuming the facts as set forth in the affidavit here to be true, as we must, we conclude that observations by police officers of several allegedly known book-makers entering on various occasions a private dwelling wherein there were located two unlisted telephones, and nothing more, does not rise above a bare suspicion that the crime of book-making was being committed on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In cases involving substantially similar facts, viz., observation of known book-makers entering a private dwelling wherein several telephones were located, the courts have consistently held that such a showing was not sufficient to establish probable cause (see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gebell, </em>209 F. Supp. 11; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bosch, </em>209 F. Supp. 15; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Betz, </em>205 F. Supp. 927; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>149 F. Supp. 707; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>113 F. Supp. 359; cf. the following eases in which probable cause was found to have been established where, in addition to observations of known gamblers entering-certain premises wherein several telephones were located [only one in Smith], it was shown that a bet had been placed by calling a telephone number at the premises <em>[Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>191 Md. 329]; or that there was reliable confidential information of gambling- activities on the premises <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>303 F. 2d 49] or that the telephones on the premises were frequently being used to contact other known gamblers <em>[Clay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>246 F. 2d 298, cert. den. 355 U. S. 863; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>208 F. Supp. 747]). The search warrant issued here, then, was invalid. It follows, therefore, that the evidence seized pursuant thereto was illegally obtained and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>inadmissible <em>(People </em>v. <em>Politano, </em>17 A D 2d 503-504, affd. 13 NY 2d 852).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction should be reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b204-5\">Bergan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFQ\">(dissenting). On five different days, three in immediate sequence in one period, and two in sequence in another period, a Senior State Police Investigator observed the frame dwelling at 556 Lakeview Avenue in Orchard Park. In this period there were eight entrances into the premises by men described by the police investigator as known gamblers or book-makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">One of these men entered the premises twice; two others each entered three times. One was described as a \u201c known gambler \u2019\u2019who had been arrested for failing to have a gambler\u2019s stamp; another was a \u201cknown bookmaker\u201d on parole for robbery; another was a \u201cknown bookmaker \u201d. Six \u201clarge envelopes \u201d were carried into the premises, one by each of the two described men on each of the last three days of the observation. These observations were made during <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>normal bookmaking hours \u2019 \u2019. There were two unlisted telephones in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">All this seems to meet the test being laid down now in the opinion of the court that the evidence must be such that the Magistrate \u201c could reasonably find from the proof before him that there was a sufficient showing of probable cause for the issuance \u201d of a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">These observations shown in the application for the search warrant must be viewed together. They reveal repeated consort of known gamblers in the premises. They show access which follows a systematic pattern, including the repeated carrying into the premises of large envelopes by the known gamblers. The existence of two unlisted telephones in the house, viewed in isolation, would usually have no significance, but in this context of usage of the premises it has significance. In total effect this proof could reasonably mean to a careful Magistrate that these premises were used as a regular office for book-making. To hold the warrant based on this affidavit invalid is to place unduly high barriers against reasonable searches under judicial control. The test is not \u201c absolute cause\u201d but \u201cprobable cause\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>13 N Y <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>2d 28, 35). The affidavit on application for the warrant considered by the District Court of Appeal in <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(189 Cal. App. 2d 526) was in some respects similar to the one submitted to the Magistrate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Fuld and Van Voorhis concur with Judge Scileppi; Judge Bergan dissents in an opinion in which Judges Dye and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Judgment reversed, informations dismissed and fines remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
