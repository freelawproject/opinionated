The Board found that the company had violated the above sections by its discriminatory layoff and refusal to reinstate employee Anna Magee because of her union organizational activities and because she testified on behalf of the union at a Board representation hearing. In addition, the Board found that the company had violated section 8(a) (1) by interrogating employee Magee about her union activities. Affirmatively the Board\u2019s order required the company to offer em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ployee Magee reinstatement, to make her whole for any monetary loss she may have suffered and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The only question presented is whether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings of violations of the Act. The respondent company takes the position that \u201cthere is simply no truth in the Board\u2019s findings\u201d and seeks by considering the findings in detail in the light of the record to show that they are based on misquoting, suppressing, and misstating the testimony. Some of the Board\u2019s factual findings are open to doubt, but we are unable on consideration of the whole record to say that there is no substantial evidence to support the ultimate conclusion that the company violated the Act. The requested enforcement must therefore be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
