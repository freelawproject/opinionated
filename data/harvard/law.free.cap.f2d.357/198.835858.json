Later in that year the Bank brought suit against Bellaire to recover, among other things, the unpaid balance of said loans. One consequence of that suit was a stipulation and written agreement between the Bank and Bellaire, dated August 18,1955, which provided, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201c(2) Bellaire Pipeline Contractors, a Texas corporation, agrees to and hereby does sell, transfer, assign and set over unto West Texas State Bank, plaintiff above named, all of its right, title and interest in and to the accounts receivable, equipment and all other property of whatsoever kind or nature, both real and personal, including any and all amounts now due from the Mountain States Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, defendant, and Cable Construction Company, now owned by it, for and in consideration of the payment to it of the sum of Twenty thousand and No/100 Dollars ($20,000.00), in cash, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and of the indemnity agreement, covenants and releases hereinafter referred to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-19\">\u201c(3) West Texas State Bank agrees to indemnify Bellaire Pipeline Contractors, a Texas corporation, <em>and to pay any and all debts, liabilities and other obligations, including corporation income taxes, if any, of Bellaire Pipeline Contractors, </em>* * incurred or due and owing by the Bellaire Pipeline Contractors, * *, as of the date of this instrument * * (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-21\">On January 15, 1957, the District Director of the Internal Revenue, Austin, Texas, made an assessment against Bel-laire for withholding taxes for the second quarter of 1955 in the amount of $6,708.-31, inclusive of penalties and interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such taxes are as yet unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"ApD\">On January 14, 1963, the Government filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the Bank to collect said taxes on the theory that it was a third party beneficiary under the aforementioned contract. Jurisdiction was alleged under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1345 and 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7402(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bank answered, inter alia, that the Government\u2019s claim is barred by the four-year Texas statute of limitations, 16A Vernon\u2019s Texas Civil Statutes Annotated (Revised), Art. 5527.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Both parties made motions for summary judgment, accompanied by affidavits, pursuant to Rule 56 F.R.Civ.P., and the District Court rendered judgment for the Bank on the ground that the Texas statute of limitations constituted a bar. 233 F.Supp. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">On appeal, the Government contends (1) a state statute of limitations cannot bar the federal government from bringing a suit on contract when it is acting in its <em>sovereign capacity </em>to collect taxes; and (2) regardless of the foregoing, a state statute cannot bar a suit brought to recover taxes from a transferee pursuant to the provisions of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6901.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Bank responds that the Government is not acting in its sovereign capacity to collect taxes, but rather in a proprietary capacity in attempting to enforce a contract, which makes it subject to the state statute. The Bank further contends, (1) appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; (2) the transferee theory of liability asserted by the Government was not raised by the pleadings and thus cannot be argued on appeal; and (3) the District Director\u2019s assessment of tax liability was arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In concluding that the Texas statute constituted a bar to the Government\u2019s suit, the District Court relied upon the holding in United States v. Scott (8 Cir. 1948) 167 F.2d 301. We conclude that reliance on <em>Scott </em>is improper and that it can be easily distinguished, both in law and fact, from the present case. In <em>Scott, </em>the defendant had assumed all of the taxpayer\u2019s debts, one of which was a fixed tax liability determined by the Board of Tax Appeals. The court held that in its suit to collect the debt pursuant to the contract the Government was not limited by the six-year <em>federal </em>statute of limitations applicable to the collection of taxes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but rather the additional time allowed under Missouri law, applicable to such contracts, was available to the Government. In <em>Scott </em>the court evidently relied on United States v. John Barth Co., 279 U.S. 370, 49 S.Ct. 366, 73 L.Ed. 743 (1929), for the proposition that the Government may have a contractual right in addition to and separate from its statutory right to collect a tax, and that the running of the federal statute of limitations did not bar its greater or additional right under the contract. The court\u2019s statement that the Missouri statute of limitations was binding on the Government is dictum. The contract in <em>Scott </em>did not limit the Government; it allowed additional time in which to sue, which was in effect \u201can additional and special right.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the extent, if any, our conclusions are in conflict with the holding in <em>Scott, </em>we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">In support of its contention that the Government is acting in a \u201cproprietary\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>as opposed to a \u201cgovernmental\u201d capacity and should be treated as an ordinary citizen, subject to the state statute, the Bank also relies on United States v. National Bank of New York, 28 F.Supp. 144 (S.D.N.Y.1939). In that case, the United States contended that the endorsement of the payee of one of its checks was a forgery and that defendant was liable on its guarantee of prior endorsements. The court concluded that when the Government <em>abandoned </em>its position of sovereignty and entered the domain of the marketplace to sue on an endorsement as any citizen can do, it was subject to the defense of laches. We do not consider this district court case as binding authority ; even so, it is easily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In the instant case the Government has not abandoned its governmental position, since this is a suit to collect taxes. To the contrary, it is acting within its sovereign capacity and is immune from time restrictions imposed by a state statute. We disagree with the conclusion reached by the trial court and reverse. United States v. Summerlin, 310 U.S. 414, 60 S.Ct. 1019, 84 L.Ed. 1283 (1940); Davis v. Corona Coal Co., 265 U.S. 219, 44 S.Ct. 552, 68 L.Ed. 987 (1924); United States v. 93 Court Corporation, et al. (2 Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 386; United States v. Parker House Sausage Company (6 Cir. 1965) 344 F.2d 787; United States v. Borin (5 Cir. 1954) 209 F.2d 145; United States v. Dobbins (5 Cir. 1944) 139 F.2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The Government\u2019s second theory is that the Bank is a transferee at law because it assumed all of the debts of taxpayer for a valuable consideration including most, if not all, of the taxpayer\u2019s assets. In such circumstances, it is argued that such a contract creates transferee liability as a matter of law, and that its suit may be brought within six years after assessment against the transferor. The trial court seemed to recognize the principle relied on by the Government but concluded, \u201c * * * there seems to be some measure of probability that a trans-feror and transferee theory might have been tenable, but that is moot now and will be left to its own uncertainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In view of the fact that the liability of the Bank as a transferee at law was mentioned by the trial court, is argued on this appeal, and will in all likelihood arise in further proceedings in the district court, we consider it appropriate to discuss the subject, although the pleadings did not clearly raise the issue in the trial court. We believe there was sufficient exposure of the transfer theory in the Government\u2019s complaint by way of reference to the written agreement between the Bank and Bellaire, to-wit, \u201cBellaire Pipeline Contractors, Inc. * * * agrees to * * * <em>transfer </em>* * * all of its property * * * \u201d etc., to defeat the Bank\u2019s contention that the Government is attempting to \u201ccollect on an entirely different theory\u201d than originally used. (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See Maxwell v. United States (5 Cir. 1964) 334 F.2d 181, 184. We leave to the district court the task of determining whether the Bank actually is a transferee as contemplated by the law, but suggest that the Government be granted leave to amend its complaint pursuant to Rule 15 F.R.Civ.P. because it is clear that \u201cjustice so requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">We consider it unnecessary to deal with any of the other contentions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not- inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">. $3,592.63 Withheld income tax</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">1,413.58 Accrued and withheld old age benefit taxes</p>\n<p id=\"ah-dedup-0\">1,251.55 Penalties</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">450.55 Interest to January 15, 1957</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">$6,708.31 Total</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-11\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1345:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, suits or proceedings commenced by the United States, or by any agency or officer thereof expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress.
