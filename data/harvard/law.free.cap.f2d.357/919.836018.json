N. L. R. B. v. C. Malone Trucking, Inc., 1 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 92, 95; N. L. R. B. v. Whitin Machine Works, 1 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 883, 884-885.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">As to the discharge, employee Sanchez had been admittedly active in union activities aiming at a more militant union attitude toward company policy resulting in contracting out work. The events leading up to her discharge included-management admonitions concerning her union activities; the presentation of a memorandum critical of her for causing the erroneous disconnection of a customer\u2019s telephone \u2014 a frequent occurrence during this period of the company\u2019s operations \u2014 and a resulting emotionally charged exchange between her and her supervisor; an allegation that she had bribed the customer not to complain to the company (subsequently denied by the customer); a declaration by a supervisor on the day of the heated exchange that Sanchez was \u201calready out of the department\u201d because of bribery; and a written notice of discharge mailed seven days later assigning deficiencies in work and insubordination as the causes of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">The background of the employee\u2019s union activity and management\u2019s expressed concern about it, the shifting reasons for discharge, and the precipitate oral declaration of discharge following the emotional incident persuade us that the Board\u2019s finding was supported by the evidence. In so concluding, we do not disregard the evidence of generally amicable relationships between union and company, nor -the fact that other union activists were retained by the company. N. L. R. B. v. Corning Glass Works, 1 Cir., 1961, 293 F.2d 784. A violation of the Act does not need to be wholesale to be a violation. Nachman Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 7 Cir. 1964, 337 F.2d 421, 424; N. L. R. B. v. Nabors, 5 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 272, 276, cert. denied, 344 U.S. 865, 73 S.Ct. 106, 97 L.Ed. 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">The evidence of threats was confined to separate private talks with employee Sanchez, and one Danielson. The conversation between Sanchez and the supervisor lasted three hours, that with Danielson an hour and a half. The company and employee versions differ, but we cannot say that the evidence as to talk of a \u201cbad atmosphere\u201d, of possible transfer to another department, of ceasing union talk within or outside working hours, of the taking of \u201cnecessary measures\u201d if \u201ccomments * * * and the atmosphere continued\u201d was so lacking in credibility as not to support the Board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
