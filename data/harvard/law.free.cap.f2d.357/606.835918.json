Subtle distinctions are constantly drawn; more perfect refinements continue to evolve. At the same time, however, there are a small number of more basic questions which cut across the whole of this evolutionary process, questions so fundamental to the very notion of criminal justice that they must continue to be asked \u2014 and, insofar as pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>sible, answered \u2014 if the criminal law is truly to reflect the moral sense of the community. This appeal poses one of those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">After a trial before Judge Tenney without a jury, Charles Freeman was found guilty on two counts of selling narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174, and sentenced to concurrent terms of five years on each count. Although Freeman denied commission of the substantive offense, his principal allegation at trial was that, at the time of the alleged sale of narcotics, he did not possess sufficient capacity and will to be held responsible for the criminality of his acts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In rejecting this contention, the District Court understandably relied upon the familiar M\u2019Naghten<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rules which, in their traditional formulation, permit acquittal only when it is proved that, \u201cat the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\u201d 10 Clark and Fin. 200, 210 (1843). Since he could not find that Freeman\u2019s condition satisfied the rigid requirements of this test, Judge Tenney had no alternative but to hold the defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for a new trial. In so doing, we of course express no opinion as to the result which will or should be reached on the retrial. We do indicate, however, that the trial judge can in no way be faulted for following the M\u2019Naghten test since, in so doing, he was unquestionably pursuing the course adopted by District Courts in this Circuit in the absence of appellate guidance on the subject.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">THE EVIDENCE OF SALE</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">If the issue of criminal responsibility is put to one side for the moment, the facts of Freeman\u2019s case do not rise above the routine. The government\u2019s evidence established that on the evening of June 24, 1963, narcotics agents Coursey and Fluhr met one James Lockhart, an informant (or, in the more polite lexicon of the government, a \u201cspecial employee\u201d), in uptown Manhattan. After making the usual search of the informant in order to be sure he did not possess narcotics prior to contact with the suspect, Lock-hart and Coursey walked to the corner of 110th Street and Broadway while Fluhr remained behind. Lockhart introduced Freeman to Coursey and, after some preliminary discussion, Freeman stated, \u201cI hear you want to buy some heroin.\u201d When Coursey indicated that he did and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>inquired about the price, Freeman replied that it would be $230 a \u201cpiece.\u201d<footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At Freeman\u2019s suggestion, the three men then proceeded to the close-by Gold Rail bar, where Freeman gave Coursey a sealed brown paper bag in return for which Coursey mistakenly paid the defendant $130 instead of the stipulated $230. Coursey then left the bar and met Agent Fluhr and Agent Casale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Together they performed a field test on the contents of the brown paper bag which revealed the presence of heroin. A chemical analysis subsequently confirmed this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Shortly thereafter, Coursey was notified by car radio that Lockhart had called him. Coursey returned to 110th Street and Broadway and entered a taxi in which Freeman and Lockhart had been riding. When Freeman asked if Coursey was trying to \u201cbeat\u201d him out of $100, Coursey explained that the failure to make full payment in the bar had been a mistake and he turned over an additional $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">On August 1, 1963, a second transaction took place; in many respects it was a sequel to the first. This time, Coursey and a different informant, Alfred Roach, entered Marvin\u2019s Bar on Broadway near 111th Street. Freeman, standing at the bar, said that he had been sick, but, nevertheless, had heard that Coursey had been buying large amounts of heroin and indicated that he would like to make another sale. A price of $235 per ounce was agreed upon and Freeman and Coursey adjourned to the men\u2019s room where Freeman handed Coursey another brown paper bag.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Coursey made payment, this time in the correct amount, and departed. A field test on the contents of the bag showed that it contained heroin and a chemical analysis confirmed the accuracy of this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">While Freeman admitted taking part in the transactions of June 24 and August 1, he presented a different version of his participation. He testified that rather than being the culprit, he was merely a conduit being used by the informant to pass the brown paper packages to Agent Coursey. The money which the agent paid, Freeman said, was not his to keep, but was turned over to the informant who had furnished him in each instance with the brown paper bag. Judge Tenney chose to discredit Freeman\u2019s version of these transactions and we see no reason to disagree with his resolution of the credibility issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">THE DEFENSE OF LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">As is not uncommon in cases in which the defense is raised, the bulk of the evidence directly relating to the issue of criminal responsibility took the form of expert psychiatric testimony of witnesses called by both the government and the defense. Freeman\u2019s expert witness at trial was Dr. Herman Denber, Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at New York Medical College and Director of Psychiatric Research at Manhattan State Hospital. Dr. Denber, who had examined the defendant on the previous afternoon, testified that Freeman was. not only a narcotics addict, but also a confirmed alcoholic. The Doctor noted that Freeman\u2019s body had become accustomed to the consumption of large amounts of heroin over a fourteen-year period, and that the defendant was in the habit of drinking one or two bottles of wine daily to increase the potency of the narcotics. In addition, he observed, Freeman regularly imbibed six to nine \u201cshots\u201d of whiskey each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Describing his examination in some detail, Dr. Denber testified that Freeman displayed no depth or variation in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>emotional reactions, spoke in a flat monotone and paused for excessively long periods before responding to questions. Dr. Denber also noted that as a result of taking impure narcotics for so long a time, Freeman suffered from frequent episodes of toxic psychosis <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> leading to a clouding of the sensorium (inability to know what one is doing or where one is) as well as delusions, hallucinations, epileptic convulsions and, at times, amnesia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The witness testified, moreover, that Freeman had suffered \u201cknock-outs\u201d on three occasions while engaging in prize fighting, and that these had led to a general vagueness about details. Finally, Dr. Denber observed that Freeman had experienced \u201cinnumerable brain trau-mata\u201d which produced such organic and structural changes as destroyed brain tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Restricted to stating a conclusory opinion within the confines of M\u2019Naghten, Dr. Denber initially averred that Freeman was incapable of knowing right from wrong, even under a strict interpretation of that limited test. However, upon amplifying this conclusion, the defense expert acknowledged that Freeman had an awareness of what he was doing on the nights of June 24 and August 1 in the sense that he possessed cognition that he was selling heroin. The Doctor also added that Freeman was not in \u201csuch a state of toxicity that he did not remember the dates. He told me the story [of the narcotics transactions] clearly, but it is my feeling about him, in particular, that as far as the social implications or the nature or meaning of what this meant to him at that moment he was not aware of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">To respond to Dr. Denber\u2019s testimony, the government called on Dr. Robert S. Carson, a former staff physician at Payne-Whitney Clinic of The New York Hospital and Clinical Instructor in Psychiatry at Cornell University. Dr. Carson testified that Freeman was able to distinguish between right and wrong within the meaning of the M\u2019Naghten test despite his heavy use of narcotics and alcohol. He noted that Freeman possessed the capacity to enter into purposeful activity such as the sale of narcotics, and he expressed the opinion that the defendant had been aware of the wrongfulness of his acts. In support of this view, Dr. Carson pointed to the fact that on the evening of August 1, 1968, Freeman had been sufficiently fearful of being apprehended that he had suggested that the transfer of naroctics take place in the privacy of the men\u2019s room of Marvin\u2019s Bar. In summary, Dr. Carson significantly acknowledged that Freeman had \u201csome limitations\u201d on his ability to distinguish right from wrong, but not to the degree required by the M\u2019Naghten test.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Our examination of the record and medical reports also reveals that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>thirty-five year old defendant possessed a minimal education and at the time of trial had been continuously addicted to narcotics for approximately 15 years, consuming as much as three bags of heroin a day. On several occasions, moreover, Freeman had sought medical help to relieve him of his addiction. In 1959, he voluntarily committed himself to the Federal Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, but departed after a week. In addition, he received treatment for his addiction at Metropolitan Hospital in New York in the years 1961, 1962 and 1963, each time without success. The defendant also had an extensive criminal record relating to his use of drugs. Between 1951 and 1960, he was successfully prosecuted five times by the New York City authorities for possession of narcotics, his sentences ranging from sixty days to six months.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is of considerable interest that on June 24, the date of the first transaction with Agent Coursey, Freeman had tested some \u201cbad stuff\u201d (impure narcotics) in addition to taking a strong sleeping pill, and testified that during the afternoon of the 24th, he was in a \u201cnod\u201d (a stupor). Indeed, on the day following the first transaction, he was so ill that he entered Metropolitan Hospital for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The record also discloses that prior to the trial Freeman\u2019s counsel moved for a psychiatric examination in order to determine the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Freeman was ordered to Bellevue Hospital where he was examined between June 19 and June 23 and found sufficiently competent to be tried.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Thereafter, Freeman\u2019s lawyer applied to the court for the appointment of a private psychiatrist to re-examine Freeman\u2019s competency to stand trial. Judge Bryan appointed Dr. Carson, who later testified for the government and whose revealing report agreed with the Bellevue finding that Freeman could be tried. The Doctor\u2019s conclusions, which were based on two examinations of Freeman at the Federal House of Detention, disclose these significant findings: \u201cMr. Freeman responded slowly to questions and commands * * * demonstrated a definite delayed reaction time as if it took him a few moments to comprehend the questions * * * on several occasions [he] complain [ed] that he had difficulty in expressing his thoughts * * * [Freeman has a] very poor employment record * * * He states that in addition to heroin he has taken large amounts of cocaine and wine * * * [and] while under influence of drugs he has had difficulty with memory. In addition, he has noted difficulty with co-ordination, and at times has felt very \u2018leary and scared and suspicious of everything.\u2019 T worry about myself mentally. People feel there is something wrong with me mentally. I don\u2019t talk too much. I can\u2019t read a book. I can\u2019t concentrate * * He feels depressed and annoyed by the noise of other people. He understood the nature of the charges * * * and appeared unusually acceptant of his imprisonment. He demonstrated difficulty with mental calculations.\u201d The report of Dr. Carson concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">My examination of Charles Freeman reveals deviations from normal responses that are consistent with an opinion that there is a dulling of his thinking process. His vagueness in recalling certain specific events, his slowness in answering questions, and his difficulty performing rather simple mental calculations as well as his apparent indifference to his imprisonment are quite typical of a clinical condition frequently termed \u201cDulling Organicity.\u201d This condition is considered to be the result of a general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ized, chronic, not overly severe damage to the higher thinking areas of the brain. I can detect no evidence [of] brain disease upon neurological examination. The diminished sensation on right leg is best explained as being the result of damage to the peripheral nerve and is not indicative of any central nervous system damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">I do not consider Charles Freeman to be incompetent to understand the nature of the charges against him or to assist in his own defense. The quality and severity of his impairment is of insufficient extent to render him currently incompetent. In this latter regard my opinion is in agreement with the findings of Belle-vue Psychiatric Hospital. I am also in agreement with Bellevue Hospital\u2019s opinion that Charles Freeman can be described as a * * * so-ciopathic personality with schizoid traits. My additional finding of a dulling of thinking processes raised the question of Mr. Freeman\u2019s ability to care for himself without rather close supervision. The finding of impaired thinking processes in the absence of neurological signs is usually the result of repeated noxious influences on the brain. The most common cause in Mr. Freeman\u2019s age group is prolonged and excessive use of drugs and/or alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The time for determining Freeman\u2019s \u201ccompetency to stand trial\u201d or to assist counsel is past and, accordingly, the propriety of that determination is not before us on this appeal. We are now concerned with whether the Court at trial should have applied a test less rigid than that provided by M\u2019Naghten,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> so that the essential examination and psychiatric testimony could have been directed towards Freeman\u2019s capacity to exercise will or appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct, rather than being confined to the relatively narrow inquiry required by M\u2019Naghten.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">THE ISSUE RAISED AT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">We shall first dispose of the government\u2019s contention that the defense did not offer a proper objection to the Court\u2019s rulings on the test to be applied. We need not tarry long on this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">When questioning Dr. Denber, Freeman\u2019s counsel inquired if, under a \u201cstrict interpretation\u201d of M\u2019Naghten, Freeman would be considered criminally responsible. Before Dr. Denber could answer, the government objected on the ground that the question inadequately defined the standard the doctor was to apply in giving his response. Judge Tenney, without ruling directly on the government\u2019s objection, declared that \u201cThis Court is following the M\u2019Naghten rule in this case.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus put on notice by the Court as to the governing standard, Freeman\u2019s counsel promptly agreed that he would not inquire of Dr. Denber whether Freeman was capable of conforming his actions to the law in terms of any definition of criminal responsibility other than that provided by M\u2019Naghten.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The government urges that the foregoing colloquy was not sufficiently specific, and accordingly asks us not to consider whether Freeman\u2019s competency was determined by the appropriate standard. Cf. United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965). It argues that Freeman\u2019s counsel never objected to the court\u2019s decision to employ the M\u2019Naghten Rules and, in addition, failed to offer alternative tests of criminal responsibility for the court\u2019s consideration. This failure, the government asserts, prevented Judge Tenney from passing meaningfully on the adequacy of M\u2019Naghten with the result that we are deprived of the insight which prior judicial consideration could have provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We are persuaded that the colloquy with counsel referred to above sufficiently enlightened the court as to the point being raised. Fed.R.Crim.P. 51; see also Jackson v. United States, 250 F.2d 897 (5th Cir. 1958). The exchange between Judge Tenney and Freeman\u2019s counsel indicates quite clearly that the Judge understood counsel\u2019s desire to elicit evidence which would have been relevant if the Judge determined to employ tests of criminal responsibility broader and more liberal than M\u2019Naghten. We think it equally clear, moreover, that counsel reasonably interpreted the Judge\u2019s statement that M\u2019Naghten was the rule in this Circuit as a direction from the Bench to restrict questions addressed to the expert witnesses solely to psychiatric information which would be admissible under the \u201cright-wrong\u201d test. Even if counsel had made elaborate offers of proof of Freeman\u2019s incompetency under the alternative tests, it is probable that Judge Tenney would have adhered to his decision in view of the long-standing use of M\u2019Naghten in the District Courts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Since it is apparent that both Court and counsel were fully cognizant of the issues being raised \u2014 and since any further showing would have been an exercise in futility \u2014 it is entirely proper that we consider the governing principles on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">It need scarcely be observed that the sufficiency of the M\u2019Naghten Rules as a test of criminal responsibility would not be an open question to us if the Supreme Court had definitively spoken on the issue. Bound by Supreme Court precedent, we would of course be compelled to follow any decision of that body which adopted M\u2019Naghten as the exclusive criterion in federal prosecutions, regardless of our dissatisfaction with such a test. As a distinguished attorney and former Secretary of State has recently and perceptively observed in another context, federal judges are hardly empowered to satisfy a mere \u201cdesire for change in the law in accordance with the decider\u2019s own conception of right. [They] may conscientiously be seeking to administer justice, but it is personal justice \u2014 the justice of Louis IX or Harun al-Rashid, not that described on the lintel of the Supreme Court Building, \u2018Equal Justice Under Law.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Despite the government\u2019s arguments to the contrary, however, we do not believe that the Supreme Court has placed its stamp of approval on M\u2019Naghten, and we find the cases cited for this proposition to be readily and clearly distinguishable. Thus, Davis v. United States (I), 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895), and Davis v. United States (II), 165 U.S. 373, 17 S.Ct. 360, 41 L.Ed. 750 (1897), do not represent a square holding as to the sufficiency of M\u2019Naghten. The former was concerned with the issue of burden of proof \u2014 rather than the applicable standard \u2014 while the latter primarily involved a claim that the trial court\u2019s charge was so narrow as not even to give the defendant the full benefit of M\u2019Nagh-ten. Neither case, in short, raised the question whether M\u2019Naghten should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>replaced or supplemented by alternative tests.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Subsequent cases are equally barren of direct challenges to M\u2019Naghten. Hotema v. United States, 186 U.S. 413, 22 S.Ct. 895, 46 L.Ed. 1225 (1902), merely held a jury charge sufficiently broad to embrace the particular defense there asserted. Matheson v. United States, 227 U.S. 540, 33 S.Ct. 355, 57 L.Ed. 631 (1913), in which the charge strikingly foreshadowed the much later-developed <em>Durham </em>rule, turned on the fact that the instructions actually given were essentially those requested by the defendant. The remaining decisions cited by the government, finally, concern not a test to be applied in federal prosecutions, but rather the constitutional propriety under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d clause of state adoptions of M\u2019Naghten or variations of M\u2019Naghten. In Leland v. State of Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 800, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 1008, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1952), for example, Mr. Justice Clark wrote: \u201cThe science of psychiatry has made tremendous strides since that test was laid down in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, but the progress of science has not reached a point where its learning would <em>compel us to require the states to eliminate the right and wrong test from their criminal law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Our duty to supervise the administration of criminal justice in the courts of this Circuit can hardly be subject to the same restrictions as our power to impose constitutional requirements upon unwilling state tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Our conclusion that the Supreme Court has not definitively spoken on the issue is in accord with that of a substantial number of the Courts of Appeals which have considered the question. Although the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that only the Supreme Court or Congress<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> could modify M\u2019Naghten, Sauer v. United States, 241 F.2d 640 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 940, 77 S.Ct. 1405, 1 L.Ed.2d 1539 (1957), the District of Columbia, Third and Tenth Circuits adopted a contrary position. After an exhaustive analysis of the decisions in this area, Chief Judge Biggs, who has for many years advocated change and has authored exceptionally scholarly works on the subject, including his trail-blazing dissent in United States ex rel. Smith v. Baldi, 192 F.2d 540 (3d Cir. 1951), concluded that the Third Circuit need not feel \u201cconstrained to adhere to and uphold the M\u2019Naghten Rules.\u201d United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751, 771 (1961). And Chief Judge Murrah, who has been an appellate judge for over a quarter of a century and has been in the forefront of judicial and administrative reforms, speaking for the Tenth Circuit, observed that since criminal responsibility was a rule of decision of the federal courts based upon common law concepts, it was always appropriate to \u201cre-examine and re-appraise\u201d it. Wion v. United States, 325F.2d 420, 425 (1963), cert. denied 377 U.S. 946, 84 S.Ct. 1354, 12 L.Ed.2d 1309 (1964).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It also seems significant that in the face of a proliferation of cases in the area of criminal responsibility, the Supreme Court has consistently refrained from granting certiorari to consider this issue, despite inconsistent results among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>state courts and federal circuits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At least one writer has suggested that the Supreme Court\u2019s inaction in this area is not mere coincidence, but is motivated by a desire to encourage the Circuits to discuss and develop alternative tests before making a definitive ruling.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">After considerable reflection on the issues presented, we therefore conclude that we cannot escape our duty to consider whether the M\u2019Naghten Rules or the M\u2019Naghten Rules augmented by the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d test should continue to remain the test of criminal responsibility in this federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We are here seeking a proper test of criminal responsibility. That we are not instead deciding the initial question\u2014 whether lack of such responsibility, however defined, should be a defense in criminal prosecutions \u2014 itself seems significant and worthy of at least some brief comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The criminal law, it has been said, is an expression of the moral sense of the community. The fact that the law has, for centuries, regarded certain wrong-doers as improper subjects for punishment is a testament to the extent to which that moral sense has developed. Thus, society has recognized over the years that none of the three asserted purposes of the criminal law \u2014 rehabilitation, deterrence and retribution \u2014 is satisfied when the truly irresponsible, those who lack substantial capacity to control their actions, are punished.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">What rehabilitative function is served when one who is mentally incompetent and found guilty is ordered to serve a sentence in prison? Is not any curative or restorative function better achieved in such a case in an institution designed and equipped to treat just such individuals? And how is deterrence achieved by punishing the incompetent? Those who are substantially unable to restrain their conduct are, by definition, unde-terrable and their \u201cpunishment\u201d is no example for others; those who are unaware of or do not appreciate the nature and quality of their actions can hardly be expected rationally to weigh the consequences of their conduct. Finally, what segment of society can feel its desire for retribution satisfied when it wreaks vengeance upon the incompetent? Although an understandable emotion, a need for retribution can never be permitted in a civilized society to degenerate into a sadistic form of revenge.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">A recognition that traditional notions of crime and punishment were inapplicable to the truly \u201cirresponsible\u201d hence came early to Anglo-American criminal law. We turn now to a consideration of those early stirrings.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">M\u2019Naghten and its antecedents can, in many respects, be seen as examples of the law\u2019s conscientious efforts to place in a separate category, people who cannot be justly held \u201cresponsible\u201d for their acts. As far back as 1582, William Lam-bard of Lincolns\u2019 Inn set forth what can be viewed as the forerunner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>M\u2019Naghten test as we know it: \u201cIf a man or a natural fool, or a lunatic in the time of his lunacy, or a child who apparently has no knowledge of good or evil do kill a man, this is no felonious act * * * for they cannot be said to have any understanding will.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> By 1724, the language had shifted from \u201cgood or evil\u201d to the more familiar emphasis on the word \u201cknow.\u201d Thus, in Rex v. Arnold, 16 How. St.Tr. 695, 764 the \u201cWild Beast\u201d test was enunciated. It provided for exculpation if the defendant \u201cdoth not <em>know </em>what he is doing, no more than * * * a wild beast.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">By modern scientific standards the language of these early tests is primitive. In the 18th Century, psychiatry had hardly become a profession, let alone a science. Thus, these tests and their progeny were evolved at a time when psychiatry was literally in the Dark Ages.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In the pre-M\u2019Naghten period, the concepts of phrenology and monomania were being developed and had significant influence on the right and wrong test. Phrenologists believed that the human brain was divided into thirty-five separate areas, each with its own peculiar mental function. The sixth area, for example, was designated \u201cdestructiveness.\u201d It was located, we are told, above the ear because this was the widest part of the skull of carnivorous animals.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Monomania, on the other hand, was a state of mind in which one insane idea predominated while the rest of the thinking processes remained normal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Of course, both phrenology and monomania are rejected today as meaningless medical concepts since the human personality is viewed as a fully integrated system. But, by an accident of history, the rule of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case froze these concepts into the common law just at a time when they were becoming obsolete. A discussion of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case will demonstrate how this came about. Daniel M\u2019Naghten suffered from what now would be described as delusions of persecution.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Apparently, he considered his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>major persecutor to be Robert Peel, then Prime Minister of England, for M\u2019Nagh-ten came to London with the intention of assassinating the chief of the Queen\u2019s government. His plan would have succeeded but for the fact that Peel chose to ride in Queen Victoria\u2019s carriage because of her absence from the city, while Drum-mond, his secretary, rode in the vehicle which normally would have been occupied by Peel. M\u2019Naghten, believing that the Prime Minister was riding in his own carriage, shot and killed Drummond in error.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">After a lengthy trial in 1843, M\u2019Nagh-ten was found \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d M\u2019Naghten\u2019s exculpation from criminal responsibility was most significant for several reasons. His defense counsel had relied in part upon Dr. Isaac Ray\u2019s historic work, Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity which had been published in 1838. This book, which was used and referred to extensively at the trial, contained many enlightened views on the subject of criminal responsibility in general and on the weaknesses of the right and wrong test in particular. Thus, for example, the jury was told that the human mind is not compartmentalized and that a defect in one aspect of the personality could spill over and affect other areas. As Chief Judge Biggs tells us in his Isaac Ray lectures compiled in The Guilty Mind, the court was so impressed with this and other medical evidence of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s incompetency that Lord Chief Justice Tindal practically directed a verdict for the accused.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">For these reasons, M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case could have been the turning point for a new approach to more modern methods of determining criminal responsibility. But the Queen\u2019s ire was raised by the acquittal and she was prompted to intervene. Mid-19th Century England was in a state of social upheaval and there had been three attempts on the life of the Queen and one on the Prince Consort. Indeed, Queen Victoria was so concerned about M\u2019Naghten\u2019s acquittal that she summoned the House of Lords to \u201ctake the opinion of the Judges on the law governing such cases.\u201d Consequently, the fifteen judges of the common law courts were called in a somewhat extraordinary session under a not too subtle atmosphere of pressure <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> to answer five prolix and obtuse questions on the status of criminal responsibility in England. Significantly, it was Lord Chief Justice Tindal who responded for fourteen of the fifteen judges, and thus articulated what has come to be known as the M\u2019Naghten Rules or M\u2019Naghten test. Rather than relying on Dr. Ray\u2019s monumental work which had apparently impressed him at M\u2019Naghten\u2019s trial, Tindal, with the Queen\u2019s breath upon him, reaffirmed the old restricted right-wrong test despite its 16th Century roots and the fact that it, in effect, echoed such uninformed concepts as phrenology and monomania. In this manner, Dr. Ray\u2019s insights were to be lost to the common law for over one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>hundred years except in the small state of New Hampshire.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The foregoing necessarily abbreviated historical account makes manifest some of the critical infirmities of the M\u2019Naghten test, not the least of which are the manner in which it was formulated and the charged atmosphere in which it was spawned. Even contemporaries questioned the validity of a rule that was not the product of the case-by-case method traditional with common law judges. Thus, Mr. Justice Maul\u00e9, the fifteenth member of the panel summoned by the House of Lords, concurred in the use of the right-wrong test but expressed deep reservations about answering questions put to the judges abstractly without the benefit of a concrete case and argument.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Sir James Stephen, the noted historian, was another who found fault with the system which produced M\u2019Naghten. He observed that \u201cevery judgment delivered since the year .1843 has been founded upon an authority which deserves to be described as in many ways doubtful.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Dr. Henry Maudsley, Isaac Ray\u2019s English contemporary, remarked not long after the M\u2019Naghten Rules were enunciated, that the judges were adhering to \u201can absurd dictum which has long been discredited by medical science.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">But the principal objection to M\u2019Naghten is not that it was arrived at by this extraordinary process. Rather, the rule is faulted because it has several serious deficiencies which stem in the main from its narrow scope. Because M\u2019Naghten focuses only on the cognitive aspect of the personality, i. e., the ability to know right from wrong, we are told by eminent medical scholars that it does not permit the jury to identify those who can distinguish between good and evil but who cannot control their behavior. The result is that instead of being treated at appropriate mental institutions <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> for a sufficiently long period to bring about a cure or sufficient improvement so that the accused may return with relative safety to himself and the community, he is ordinarily sentenced to a prison term as if criminally responsible and then released as a potential recidivist with society at his mercy. To the extent that these individuals continue to be released from prison because of the narrow scope of M\u2019Naghten, that test poses a serious danger to society\u2019s welfare.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">Similarly, M\u2019Naghten\u2019s single track emphasis on the cognitive aspect of the personality recognizes no degrees of incapacity. Either the defendant knows right from wrong or he does not and that is the only choice the jury is given. But such a test is grossly unrealistic; our mental institutions, as any qualified psychiatrist will attest, are filled with people who to some extent can differentiate between right and wrong, but lack the capacity to control their acts to a substantial degree. As the commentary to the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code observes, \u201cThe law must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>recognize that when there is no black and white it must content itself with different shades of gray.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A further fatal defect of the M\u2019Nagh-ten Rules stems from the unrealistically tight shackles which they place upon expert psychiatric testimony. When the law limits a testifying psychiatrist to stating his opinion whether the accused is capable of knowing right from wrong, the expert is thereby compelled to test guilt or innocence by a concept which bears little relationship to reality. He is required thus to consider one aspect of the mind as a \u201clogic-tight compartment in which the delusion holds sway leaving the balance of the mind intact. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Prominent psychiatrists have expressed their frustration when confronted with such requirements. Echoing such complaints, Edward de Grazia has asked, \u201cHow [does one] translate \u2018psychosis\u2019 or \u2018psychopathy\u2019 or \u2018dementia praecox\u2019 or even \u2018sociopathy\u2019 or \u2018mental disorder\u2019 or \u2018neurotic character disorder\u2019 or \u2018mental illness\u2019 into a psychiatric judgment of whether the accused knew \u2018right\u2019 from \u2018wrong.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In stronger and more vivid terms, Dr. Lawrence Kolb, Director of the New York Psychiatric Institute, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University and Director of the Psychiatric Service at Presbyterian Hospital, expressed a similar viewpoint when he declared that \u201canswers supplied by a psychiatrist in regard to questions of rightness or wrongness of an act or \u2018knowing\u2019 its nature constitute a professional perjury.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">Psychiatrists are not alone in their recognition of the unreality of M\u2019Nagh-ten. As long ago as 1930, Mr. Justice Cardozo observed that \u201ceveryone contends that the present definition of insanity has little relation to the truths of mental life.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> And Mr. Justice Frankfurter, as a witness before the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, declared with his usual fervor: \u201cI do not see why the rules of law should be arrested at the state of psychological knowledge of the time when they were formulated. * * * I think the M\u2019Naghten Rules are in large measure shams. That is a very strong word, but I think the M\u2019Naghten Rules are very difficult for conscientious people and not difficult enough for people who say, \u2018We\u2019ll just juggle them.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">The tremendous growth of psychiatric knowledge since the Victorian origins of M\u2019Naghten and even the near-universal disdain in which it is held by present-day psychiatrists are not by themselves sufficient reasons for abandoning the test. At bottom, the determination whether a man is or is not held responsible for his conduct is not a medical but a legal, social or moral judgment. Ideally, psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>chiatrists \u2014 much like experts in other fields \u2014 should provide grist for the legal mill, should furnish the raw data upon which the legal judgment is based. It is the psychiatrist who informs as to the mental state of the accused \u2014 his characteristics, his potentialities, his capabilities. But once this information is disclosed, it is society as a whole, represented by judge or jury, which decides whether a man with the characteristics described should or should not be held accountable for his acts. In so deciding, it cannot be presumed that juries will check their common sense at the courtroom door. As Professor Wechsler has rightly commented, \u201cIt\u2019s not to be expected that juries will lightly accept the proposition that one who seemingly knew in a true sense did not know. One would expect jury skepticism and the system is the healthier for that jury skepticism.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The true vice of M\u2019Naghten is not, therefore, that psychiatrists will feel constricted in artificially structuring their testimony but rather that the ultimate deciders \u2014 the judge or the jury \u2014 will be deprived of information vital to their final judgment. For whatever the social climate of Victorian England, today\u2019s complex and sophisticated society will not be satisfied with simplistic decisions, based solely upon a man\u2019s ability to \u201cknow\u201d right from wrong. It is in this respect that the vast strides made in public awareness and acceptance of psychiatry and psychiatric methods may even be more significant than the scientific developments which gave rise to them. Few areas of modern American culture\u2014 from the personnel offices of our giant corporations to the pages of our mass-circulation magazines \u2014 have been untouched by the psychiatric revolution. In this setting, a test which depends vitally on notions already discredited when M\u2019Naghten was adopted can no longer be blandly accepted as representing the \u201cmoral sense of the community.\u201d To continue to apply such medically discarded concepts would be to follow a negative approach which is the result of a holdover of long outmoded attitudes rather than a policy decision grounded in reason or science.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Efforts to supplement or replace the M\u2019Naghten Rules with a more meaningful and workable test have persisted for generations, with varying degrees of success. Perhaps the first to receive judicial approval, however, was more an added fillip to M\u2019Naghten than a true substitute: the doctrine which permits acquittal on grounds of lack of responsibility when a defendant is found to have been driven by an \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d to commit his offense.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In one form or another, the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d test has become encrusted on the law of several jurisdictions, including the District Courts of this Circuit, and is now a familiar part of the vocabulary of millions since it was successfully invoked by the defendant of Robert Travers\u2019 celebrated novel and motion picture, \u201cAnatomy of a Murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">As it has commonly been employed, however, we find the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d test to be inherently inadequate and unsatisfactory. Psychiatrists have long questioned whether \u201cirresistible impulses\u201d actually exist; the more basic legal objection to the term \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d is that it is too narrow and carries the misleading implication that a crime impulsively committed must have been perpetrated in a sudden and explosive fit. Thus, the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d test is unduly restrictive because it excludes the far more numerous instances of crimes committed after excessive brooding and melancholy by one who is unable to resist sustained psychic compulsion or to make any real attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>control his conduct.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In seeking one isolated and indefinite cause for every act, moreover, the test is unhappily evocative of the notions which underlay M\u2019Naghten \u2014 unfortunate assumptions that the problem can be viewed in black and white absolutes and in crystal-clear causative terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In so many instances the criminal act may be the reverse of impulsive; it may be coolly and carefully prepared yet nevertheless the result of a diseased mind.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d test is therefore little more than a gloss on M\u2019Naghten, rather than a fundamentally new approach to the problem of criminal responsibility. It is, as one professor explained, \u201ca relatively unobnoxious attempt to improve upon M\u2019Naghten.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">With the exception of New Hampshire, American courts waited until 1954 and Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion for the District of Columbia Circuit in Durham v. United States,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> for legal recognition that disease or defect of the mind may impair the whole mind and not a subdivided portion of it. The <em>Durham </em>court swept away the intellectual debris of a century and articulated a test which was as simple in its formulation as its sources were complex. A defendant is not criminally responsible, wrote Judge Bazelon, \u201cif his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect.\u201d <footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The advantages of <em>Durham </em>were apparent and its arrival was widely hailed. The new test entirely eliminated the \u201cright-wrong\u201d dichotomy, and hence interred the overriding emphasis on the cognitive element of the personality which had for so long plagued M\u2019Naghten. The fetters upon expert testimony were removed and psychiatrists were permitted and indeed encouraged to provide all relevant medical information for the common sense application of judge or jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">Finally, <em>Durham </em>ended to a large degree the \u201cprofessional perjury\u201d decried by psychiatrists \u2014 the \u201cjuggling\u201d of legal standards made inevitable by M\u2019Naghten and rightly deplored by Justice Frankfurter. Too often, the unrealistic dogma of M\u2019Naghten had compelled expert witnesses to \u201cstretch\u201d its requirements to \u201chard cases\u201d; sympathetic to the plight of a defendant who was not, in fairness, responsible for his conduct, psychiatrists had found it necessary to testify that the accused did not know his act was \u201cwrong\u201d even when the defendant\u2019s words belied this conclusion. In its frank and express recognition that criminality resulting from mental disease or defect should not bring forth penal sanctions, <em>Durham </em>brought an end to this all too-frequent practice of \u201cwinking\u201d at legal requirements, a practice which had contributed little to the self-respect and integrity of either medicine or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">In the aftermath of <em>Durham, </em>however, many students of the law recognized that the new rule, despite its many advantages, also possessed serious deficiencies. It has been suggested, for example, that <em>Durham\u2019s </em>insistence that an offense be the \u201cproduct\u201d of a mental disease or defect raised near-impossible problems of causation,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> closely resembling those encountered by the M\u2019Naghten and irresistible impulse tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">The most significant criticism of <em>Durham, </em>however, is that it fails to give the fact-finder any standard by which to measure the competency of the accused. As a result, psychiatrists when testifying that a defendant suffered from a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d in effect usurped the jury\u2019s function. This problem was strikingly illustrated in 1957, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>when a staff conference at Washington\u2019s St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital reversed its previous determination and reclassified \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d as a \u201cmental disease.\u201d Because this single hospital provides most of the psychiatric witnesses in the District of Columbia courts, juries were abruptly informed that certain defendants who had previously been considered responsible were now to be acquitted. Blocker v. United States, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 41, 288 F.2d 853, 860 (1961) (Burger, J. concurring). It seems clear that a test which permits all to stand or fall upon the labels or classifications employed by testifying psychiatrists hardly affords the court the opportunity to perform its function of rendering an independent legal and social judgment.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In 1953, a year before <em>Durham, </em>the American Law Institute commenced an exhaustive study of criminal conduct including the problem of criminal responsibility. In the ensuing months and years, under the scholarly direction of Professors Herbert Wechsler of Columbia University, its Chief Reporter, and Louis B. Schwartz of the University of Pennsylvania, Co-Reporter, the leading legal and medical minds of the country applied themselves to the task. Gradually and painstakingly a new definition of criminal responsibility began taking shape as Section 4.01 of the Model Penal Code was evolved. Before its penultimate articulation, drafts and redrafts of the section were submitted to and revised by an advisory committee comprised of distinguished judges, lawyers, psychiatrists, and penologists. After committee approval was obtained, successive drafts were debated and considered by the Council, and later by the full membership, of the Institute. Nine long years of research, exploration and consideration culminated in the definitive version of Section 4.01, which was finally adopted by the Institute in 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Section 4.01 provides that \u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> For reasons which will be more fully set forth, we believe this test to be the soundest yet formulated and we accordingly adopt it as the standard of criminal responsibility in the Courts of this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The gravamen of the objections to the M\u2019Naghten Rules is that they are not in harmony with modern medical science which, as we have said, is opposed to any concept which divides the mind into separate compartments \u2014 the intellect, the emotions and the will. The Model Penal Code formulation views the mind as a unified entity and recognizes that mental disease or defect may impair its functioning in numerous ways. The rule, moreover, reflects awareness that from the perspective of psychiatry absolutes are ephemeral and gradations are inevitable. By em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ploying the telling word \u201csubstantial\u201d to modify \u201cincapacity,\u201d the rule emphasizes that \u201cany\u201d incapacity is not sufficient to justify avoidance of criminal responsibility but that \u201ctotal\u201d incapacity is also unnecessary. The choice of the word \u201cappreciate,\u201d rather than \u201cknow\u201d in the first branch of the test also is significant; mere intellectual awareness that conduct is wrongful, when divorced from appreciation or understanding of the moral or legal import of behavior, can have little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">While permitting the utilization of meaningful psychiatric testimony,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> the American Law Institute formulation, we believe, is free of many of the defects which accompanied <em>Durham. </em>Although it eschews rigid classification, the Section is couched in sufficiently precise terms to provide the jury with a workable standard when the judge charges\u2019in terms comprehensible to laymen.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Expert testimony, in short, will be admissible whenever relevant but always <em>as </em>expert testimony \u2014 and not as moral or legal pronouncement. Relieved of their burden of divining precise causal relationships, the judge or jury can concentrate upon the ultimate decisions which are properly theirs, fully informed as to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Under the American Law Institute formulation, an inquiry based on meaningful psychological concepts can be pursued.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The most modern psychiatric insights will be available, but, even more importantly, the legal focus will be sharper and clearer. The twin branches of the test, significantly phrased in the alternative, will remove from the pale of criminal sanctions precisely those who are in no meaningful sense responsible for their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">We do not delude ourselves in the belief that the American Law Institute test is perfect. Perfection is unattainable when we are dealing with a fluid and evolving science. Furthermore, we are aware that the Courts of Appeal for the District of Columbia, Third and Tenth Circuits have not adopted the American Law Institute test <em>haec verba, </em>but have employed their own language approaching the objectives of the Model Penal Code formulation.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> As an illustration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>in the scholarly opinion of Chief Judge Biggs in United States v. Currens, supra, the Third Circuit adopted the second branch of the Model Penal Code test\u2014 substantial capacity to conform one\u2019s conduct to the requirements of the law\u2014 but deleted the first, referring to \u201cappreciation\u201d of wrongfulness. While we can understand that Court\u2019s reluctance to stress the cognitive element of the personality in light of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s emphasis on that aspect, we cannot accept its formulation; the gravamen of psychiatric objections to the M\u2019Naghten Rules, as we have seen, was not that they looked to the cognitive feature of the personality, undeniably a significant aspect of the total man, but that they looked to this element <em>exclusively. </em>In Wion v. United States, supra, Chief Judge Murrah in his thoughtful opinion adopted Section 4.01, but added a proposed jury instruction relating to the defendant\u2019s capability of \u201cknowing\u201d what he was doing; for reasons we need not labor, we prefer the Model Penal Code\u2019s use of \u201cappreciate\u201d rather than \u201cknow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We believe, in sum, that the American Law Institute test \u2014 which makes no pretension at being the ultimate in faultless definition \u2014 is an infinite improvement over the M\u2019Naghten Rules, even when, as had been the practice in the courts of this Circuit, those Rules are supplemented by the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d doctrine. All legal definitions involve elements of abstraction and approximation which are difficult to apply in marginal cases.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The impossibility of guaranteeing that a new rule will always be infallible cannot justify continued adherence to an outmoded standard, sorely at variance with enlightened medical and legal scholarship. No one would suggest that a physician-expert called to state an opinion with respect to a litigant\u2019s orthopedic or neurological condition should be restricted in his reply to a single isolated cause to the exclusion of other relevant and important findings and conclusions \u2014 much less to concepts developed at the outset of Victoria\u2019s reign. In a criminal trial, when life and liberty hang in the balance, such arbitrary limitations on expert and jury are all the less defensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The genius of the common law has been its responsiveness to changing times, its ability to reflect developing moral and social values. Drawing upon the past, the law must serve- \u2014 and traditionally has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>served \u2014 the needs of the present. In the past century, psychiatry has evolved from tentative, hesitant gropings in the dark of human ignorance to a recognized and important branch of modern .medicine. The outrage of a frightened Queen has for too long caused us to fotego the expert guidance that modem psychiatry is able to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Since Freeman\u2019s responsibility was determined under the rigid standards of the M\u2019Naghten Rules, we are compelled to reverse his conviction and remand the case for a new trial in which the criteria employed will be those provided by Section 4.01 of the Model Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> And lest our opinion be misunderstood or distorted, some additional discussion is in order. First, we wish to make it absolutely clear that mere recidivism or narcotics addiction will not <em>of themselves </em>justify acquittal under the American Law Institute standards which we adopt today. Indeed, the second clause of Section 4.01 explicitly states that \u201cthe terms \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct.\u201d We approve and adopt this important caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">There may be instances where recidivists will not be criminally responsible, but this will be for determination in each individual case depending upon other evidence of mental disease augmenting mere recidivism with the ultimate determination dependent upon the proper application of the standards we have adopted. But, we stress, repeated criminality cannot be the <em>sole </em>ground for a finding of mental disorder; a contrary holding would reduce to absurdity a test designed to encourage full analysis of all psychiatric data and would exculpate those who knowingly and deliberately seek a life of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Nor may narcotics addiction without more be the sole evidence of abnormality under the American Law Institute test. We have observed that the defense of lack of responsibility is essentially an acknowledgment on the part of society that because of mental disease or defect certain classes of wrongdoers are not properly the subjects of criminaFpunishment. In light of the severe penalties imposed by Congress for the possession and sale of narcotics, it would be unwise at this stage of medical knowledge, for a court to conclude that those addicted to narcotics should be, for that reason alone, immune from criminal sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">Secondly, in order to avoid any misapprehension as to the thrust of our opinion some mention should be made of the treatment to be afforded individuals found to lack criminal responsibility under the test we adopt. There is no question but that the security of the community must be the paramount interest. Society withholds criminal sanctions in cases of incompetence out of a sense of compassion and understanding. It would be obviously intolerable if those suffering from a mental disease or defect of such a nature as to relieve them from criminal responsibility were to be set free to continue to pose a threat to life and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\">A verdict of \u201cnot guilty by reason of incompetency\u201d has, in the past, been equivalent in the federal judicial system to a simple \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict because of the existing void in provisions for commitment and treatment. As a result of the comparatively recent adoption by various federal courts of more enlightened tests of responsibility, we trust that Congress will explore its power to authorize commitment of those acquitted on these grounds.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Such was the result of <em>Durham </em>in the District of Columbia; shortly after that decision, Congress provided for mandatory post-trial commitment in all cases in the District resulting in acquittals on grounds of lack of responsibility.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Pending Congressional ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>tion, however, we are confident that the several states will continue to step into the breach as they have in the past. Accordingly, we suggest tliat those adjudged criminally irresponsible promptly be turned over to state officials for commitment pursuant to state procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Effective procedures for institutionalization and treatment of the criminally irresponsible are vital as an implementation to today\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Throughout our opinion, we have not viewed the choice as one between imprisonment and immediate release. Rather, we believe the true choice to be between different forms of institutionalization \u2014 between the prison and the mental hospital. Underlying today\u2019s decision is our belief that treatment of the truly incompetent in mental institutions would better serve the interests of society as well as the defendant\u2019s.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Our opinion thus far has been confined to the issue of criminal responsibility. Freeman\u2019s appeal was not limited to this one question; citing Escobedo v. State of Illinois,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> he also claimed error in the introduction of his inculpatory statements at trial. Since we are returning this case to the District Court for retrial we shall comment on Freeman\u2019s assertion that such alleged statements made at the time of apprehension were improperly admitted into evidence. Freeman was arrested by agents Wilkocki and Leader at his mother\u2019s apartment in Harlem. He was informed of the charge against him, told to dress and taken to a waiting government car. Wilkocki testified that he informed Freeman of his right to remain silent but failed to advise him that he was entitled to the assistance of counsel. Freeman, on the other hand, testified that he was, indeed, told, \u201cWell you can get a lawyer. You don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d The defendant went on to assert, however, that although he asked for permission to call an attorney while still in his mother\u2019s home, and, again, in the car and at Narcotics Bureau Headquarters he was never given the opportunity to do so. Wilkocki denied such requests were ever made. Although he did acknowledge that Freeman requested permission to call his wife and that there was \u201csomething to do with bail but I am not sure.\u201d In any event, Freeman denied making any inculpatory statements at all to Wilkocki.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">After a voir dire examination dealing with Freeman\u2019s \u201cright to counsel,\u201d Judge Tenney, over objection,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> permitted Wil-kocki to testify that in the car as well as at Narcotics Bureau Headquarters, Freeman admitted selling heroin to Coursey on June 24 and August 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">In his decision, Judge Tenney did not specifically resolve the contradictions in the testimony of Freeman and Agent Wilkocki with respect to whether Freeman did on the three occasions request permission to call an attorney and, in turn, whether such requests were refused. Because of the retrial, we believe it might be helpful if we gave a general indication of our views on the issue raised without, however, attempting to dispose of the question on the merits. As we observed in United States v. Cone, 354 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1965), United States v. Robinson, 354 F.2d 109 (2d Cir. 1965), and United States v. Drummond, 354 F.2d 132 (2d Cir. 1965), cases involving inculpatory statements made in the absence of counsel must be considered ad hoc in each instance and resolved on the particular factual pattern presented. While we approved the admission into evidence of such inculpatory statements in the three cited cases, the instant case is not rigidly controlled by those decisions for the facts differ materially. Unlike Drummond, Freeman made disclosures upon apprehension in response to <em>interrogation </em>and after an alleged denial of an opportunity to call counsel. This is in sharp contrast, for example, to Drummond\u2019s threshold disclosures which were volunteered and spontaneous. It need hardly be added, moreover, that Freeman\u2019s questioned mental condition may be a further distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>guishing feature. As we indicated in <em>Drummond </em>the surrounding circumstances and atmosphere as well as the condition of the accused will be important elements for the Trial Judge to consider in determining the penumbral point when the right to counsel attached.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The Court is indebted to William E\u201e Hellerstein, Esq. who represented Freeman as assigned counsel, for a thorough and effective presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-5\">.

As evolved by the District Courts of this Circuit, the M\u2019Naghten test has been supplemented by the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d rule, which provides for acquittal when it is proved that a defendant, at the moment of commission of his crime, was unable to obey the law and alter the course of his conduct even if he knew that his conduct was wrongful. At trial, Freeman\u2019s counsel conceded that the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d rule had no application to the present case. As applied to Freeman, consequently, the governing principles were pure and undiluted M\u2019Naghten.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">.

Dr. Denber defined a \u201cpsychosis\u201d as \u201ca disorder of the brain in which the individual\u2019s reality appreciation is altered and in which symptoms of thinking and feeling become abnormal.\u201d The term \u201ctoxic psychosis\u201d refers to a \u201cstate of impaired mental functioning with clouding of the senses, non-awareness of time and place produced by some compound, usually medicinal, taken in excess over and above the usual .requirements that are prescribed, and usually have been taken for a period of time by the individual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\">. Dr. Denber testified that because of Freeman\u2019s extensive and prolonged use of narcotics such as heroin, cocaine, morphine, and benzedrine, amphetamines and sleeping pills, he did not derive satisfaction from the standard \u201cfix\u201d and was not, in any respect, just an ordinary drug addict. This massive infusion of drugs produced a condition which made Freeman at times, as he put it, so \u201cmessed up with the stuff\u201d that he would fall \u201cknocked cold in the street,\u201d with resultant head and other injuries. In addition, Freeman suffered from vomiting and chills and approximately twelve times a year for the last eight years, experienced auditory and visual hallucinations as well as paranoid delusions. For example, Freeman saw people in miniature and heard them eall his name from under his bed. Indeed, Freeman told the Doctor, \u201cAt times I would think something was wrong with my head. I think the drugs I was using was eating up my brain.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">.

At sentencing the Court recommended that the defendant be given a thorough physical and psychiatric examination for the purpose of determining which institution, the United States Public Health Service Hospital, Lexington, Kentucky, or the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri, would be more beneficial for him. This latitude which the trial judge had at the time of sentencing was unavailable, he believed, at the trial in assessing Freeman\u2019s criminal responsibility because of the restrictive M\u2019Naghten Rules. The trial judge explained to Freeman at the sentencing, \u201cthe defense witness [Dr. Denber] testified that [you] did know the nature and quality of [your] acts but [you] did not appreciate the extremely bad social consequences [your] acts could have, and I believe under the rules we have here that of itself is insufficient to indicate the defense of -insanity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b660-13\">.

Court of Appeals amplified its definition of mental disorder for the purpose of making \u201cit very clear that neither the court nor the jury is bound by ad hoc definitions or conclusions as to what experts state is a disease or defect.\u201d To reinforce its decision, the Court redefined mental disease and defect to include \u201cany abnormal condition of the mind which <em>substantially </em>affects mental or emotional processes and <em>substantially </em>impairs behavior controls.\u201d McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847, 851 (1962) (Emphasis added). It thus adopted a formulation which closely approximates the recommendation of the American Law Institute in its Model Penal Code. See infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\">. American Law Institute, Model Penal Code (final draft) (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">We have adopted the word \u201cwrongfulness\u201d in Section 4.01 as the American Law Institute\u2019s suggested alternative to \u201ccriminality\u201d because we wish to indude the case where the perpetrator appreciates that his conduct is criminal, but, because of a delusion, believes it to be morally justified. See People v. Schmidt, 216 N.Y. 324, 110 N.E. 945, L.R.A. 1916D 519 (1916) (Cardozo, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b671-5\">. We note that while the Model Penal Code permits, and, indeed, encourages the production of full psychiatric data and information at trial, such testimony can have weight only if the underlying examination of the defendant was thorough. In most instances, one hour of psychiatric examination of the defendant in the House of Detention in preparation for trial is not an adequate substitute for a complete psychiatric and neurological work-up of the defendant in a hospital under the care and guidance of a staff of experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Moreover, as we have indicated, for many years pyschiatrists have urged, almost with one voice, the replacement of the M\u2019Naghten rule. Their persuasive advocacy of change is now meeting with gradual success, as modern psychiatric theories of normal and deviant personality development and functioning have gained increasing acceptance. It is desirable, therefore, that the altered standard for criminal responsibility which has been adopted today should not become the <em>causa sine qua non </em>of unseemly contests between psychiatric experts. We may anticipate a weakening of public confidence in the value of psychiatric concepts and a reaction against them if this should result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b671-12\">. In framing charges, the following caveat is interesting: \u201cI believe that mental disease is a complex and intricate matter and we cannot make it simple and understandable to everyone just by inventing simple words or phrases to describe it.\u201d 112 Cong.Rec. 2855 (1966) (Remarks of Senator Thomas J Dodd).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b671-15\">. The opportunity that psychiatrists will now have to present their findings and conclusions in their own scientific language should remove a barrier which made such experts reluctant to give testimony in cases turning on M\u2019Naghten. We trust that they will also now make themselves available to be called on for testimony under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act or where the court may desire the opinion of an independent expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b671-16\">. New York State, on July 1, 1965, rejected M\u2019Naghten and adopted a test based largely upon the American Law In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>stitute formulation. Section 1120 of the New York Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws c. 40, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">A person is not criminally responsible for conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity to know or appreciate either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">(a) The nature and consequence of such conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">(b) That such conduct was wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">In addition, Vermont has provided by statute that \u201cThe M\u2019Naghten test of insanity in criminal cases is hereby abolished.\u201d Vermont Stat.Anno. \u00a7 13:4802. And in 1957, Vermont enacted as its rule for determining criminal responsibility, a formulation strikingly similar to Section 4.01 of the Model Penal Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks adequate capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform Ms conduct to the requirements of law. Vermont Stat. Anno. \u00a7 13:4801.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Connecticut, also, does not adhere to a strict M\u2019Naghten formulation. Its test for criminal competency states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-15\">To be the subject of punishment, an individual must have mind and capacity, reason and understanding enough to enable him to judge of the nature, character and consequence of the act charged against him, that the act is wrong and criminal, and that the commission of it will justly and properly expose him to penalty. State v. Davies, 146 Conn. 137, 148 A.2d 251, cert. denied, 360 U.S. 921, 79 S.Ct. 1441, 3 L.Ed.2d 1537 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">It would be incongruous, indeed, if the federal courts which have traditionally concerned themselves with formulating guidelines for fairer trials were to remain frozen to the old M\u2019Naghten Rules while the state courts in this Circuit pursued the more modern and enlightened course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b672-18\">.

As Professor Wechsler observed, commitment after a verdict of \u201cnot guilty by reason of criminal incompetency\u201d is not only desirable but necessary in the sound administration of justice: \u201c * * * I also believe that it is part of any proper system that when a defendant in a criminal case asks for exemption from conviction and condemnation on the ground of irresponsibility, that it is appropriate that there should be as a requirement of law a civil commitment if that defense is sustained. And that, as a matter of fact, is now the law of New York as a result of a statute [N.Y.Code Crim.Proc. \u00a7 454] passed two or three years ago. Now, how long should the detention last? Well, it certainly ought to last long enough to allow a full diagnostic study and a determination as to whether it is safe to release the offender from his own point of view and from the point of view of others. The New York statute justified detention on grounds of public danger so long as that danger endures.\u201d Remarks, op. cit. supra note 39 at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"AEV\">We believe that such institutionalization will deter \u201cnormal\u201d defendants from choosing to defend on the ground of irresponsibility. The prospect of commitment to a mental institution for an indeterminate period is much less desirable than a fixed term in prison. See Pried, \u201cImpromptu Remarks,\u201d 76 Harvard L. Rev. 1319 (1963). See also Report, Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, op. cit. supra, note 42 at 104-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\">. Indeed, the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate has been concerned with M\u2019Naghten, <em>Durham </em>and their progeny. Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut, a member of that Committee and Chairman of a sub-committee which made an exhaustive study of the operation of <em>Durham </em>as refined by <em>McDonald, </em>supra, revealed his perceptiveness in a statement on the subject of criminal responsibility. 112 Cong.Rec. 2853-2856 (1966). Senator Dodd recognizing that \u201cthe mental patient and his status under criminal law constitute a problem that has defied solution throughout history,\u201d nevertheless firmly rejected M\u2019Naghten and cautioned against retreating to its precepts and adopting \u201cless satisfactory procedures because of peripheral rather than substantial difficulties involved in maintaining [Durham}.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">Speaking of the need for proper treatment of those found not guilty by reason of incompetency, Senator Dodd observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">I do not want the courts to revert to injustice because it is too difficult or too expensive or too inconvenient to make justice work * * *. What I am saying is that we should be more concerned with determining whether or not an offender is mentally incompetent than with inventing techniques, definitions and procedural devices to keep insanity pleas to the minimum. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">The thin line between criminal responsibility and irresponsibility because of mental disease is not always clearly visible. Thus, we are confronted with questions of policy regarding how we want to react to marginal cases. It seems that the general public and certain segments of the legal profession and law enforcement would like to treat them as criminals rather than as patients. And yet, if we send even marginal cases to the mental hospital and rehabilitate them so that they no longer break the law, we have scored a success. On the other hand, if we send such marginal cases to prison, they may come back to haunt society after their release, more mentally disturbed, more irresponsible, and more crime prone than ever before, because whatever the prison does to men it does not cure mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">This is the type of reasoning which has led me to support in principle a rather general and inclusive rule of criminal responsibility instead of a narrow and restrictive one * * *. The important thing is to render the dangerous person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>harmless. And it is best to do this by correction rather than simply by incarceration * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">We must make sure- that we do not attack the law when the deficiency, may be elsewhere, for example, in the release procedures from our institutions. * * * By definition, a mentally ill person must be committed to an institution for an indeterminate period of time. We owe the public the protection of keeping him there until cured * * *. I believe this procedure is by far sounder than the \u201costrich approach\u201d of sending mentally diseased men and women to prison, hoping that they will be miraculously cured and rehabilitated in a place we know to be traditionally incapable of producing such resurrections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b675-14\">. 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed. 2d 977 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b675-16\">. The government\u2019s contention that an inadequate objection was made is without merit. Cf. United States v.

As we stated in Drummond, supra:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">Had Drummond asked for counsel at the beginning of the interview when he was informed of that right, or had he plainly indicated a desire not to talk before counsel arrived, and then had the agents refused him access to counsel and questioned him relentlessly, the case might be different. Certainly we are not deciding that the police may lightly disregard an accused\u2019s request to consult counsel during pre-arraignment questioning, even where the questioning is legitimately motivated. In fact, the denial of a request to call counsel during a pre-arraignment interview may, in other circumstances, render any incriminating statements inadmissible. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b676-18\">The coercive or noncoercive context in which the admissions were made; i.e., the spontaneity or responsive nature of the statements, the physical conditions of interrogation, the period lapsing after arrest before the statements were made, the intelligence level of the defendant, his legal sophistication, his subjective state of mind and Health are all relevant to the ultimate determination. 354 F.2d at 147, 146 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b676-6\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"att-dedup-0\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Though it is a bit difficult to cast aside the belief that one who plans to perform certain acts and does them according to plan should be held responsible for his conduct, I realize that that belief is out of style these days, and that modernists hold that one\u2019s will may be so meaninglessly exerted as not to have any causal relationship to conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Therefore, I am happy to concur with my colleagues in promulgating for the time being the standard of responsibility for one's conduct that is set forth in the American Law Institute\u2019s May 4, 1962 Official Draft of its Proposed Model Penal Code, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">Section 4.01 Mental Disease or Defect Excluding Responsiblity</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">(1) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to eonform his conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-14\">(2) The terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">Modern beliefs, which have apparently been validated by responsible empirical studies, regarding the determinants of a person\u2019s conduct, require of the judiciary that we modernize our judge-made rules that relate to the relationship between intent-activation and conduct. In so doing we but simply continue the process of judicial adaptation to new discoveries, new conditions, even new terminologies, which adaptation has been the peculiarly significant genius of our judge-made common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">I say \u201cfor the time being,\u201d for though we now have been persuaded that we should be dissatsfied with the M\u2019Naghten Rules because of the discoveries which, whether for good or ill, have in the six score years since M\u2019Naghten changed our concepts of \u201cmental disease,\u201d it is nevertheless also true that the scope of serious expert inquiry into the control of conduct has not halted, and tomorrow we may find that Section 4.01 needs further judicial emendation in the light of tomorrow\u2019s further discoveries. In the present case, then, I join my brothers in remanding the case to the district court for a new trial, the trial to be so conducted as to permit the introduction of testimony germane to a factual resolution of behavioral responsibility contemplated by the above-quoted Section 4.01, and, in which, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the evidence shall have been closed, the finder of fact shall determine the defendant\u2019s responsibility for his alleged criminal conduct by recourse to that Section\u2019s standards.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
