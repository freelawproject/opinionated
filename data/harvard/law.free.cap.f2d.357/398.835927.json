I., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b447-17\">Before WORLEY, Chief Judge, and RICH, SMITH, and ALMOND, Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-18\">SMITH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissed appellant-opposer\u2019s opposition to the registration of appellee\u2019s mark \u201ctechni-rite\u201d for \u201cdata presentation equipment, namely, dimensional gauges and electronic recording and indicating apparatus and equipment used in association therewith.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (141 USPQ 932) The opposition was based on appellant\u2019s prior use of the marks \u201crec-ti/rite\u201d and \u201crecti/riter\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ownership of registrations <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> therefor for similar goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">The sole issue is likelihood of confusion under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). The board found that while the goods of the respective parties were related, the marks were not likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">Appellee argues that the goods, markets and distribution channels are different. Appellee points out that the respective goods have different utility, are technical in nature, are relatively expensive (450 dollars and up), and all prospective purchasers thereof would exercise discrimination in their selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">While the record supports specific differences in the goods, this is not the test to be applied in determining likelihood of confusion. See Vandenburgh, Trademark Law &amp; Procedure, Section 5.41 (1959). Similarly, markets and distribution channels are but factors which may be considered in resolving the sole issue before us, which is whether applicantappellee\u2019s mark</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-23\">* * * so resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another -and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive: * * * 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">We now consider the respective marks to determine whether it would be likely to regard the goods as coming from the same source. See Hoge, Lanham Act\u2019s Housekeeping Amendments, 52 T.M.R. 1245, 1249 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Considered in their entireties the marks in issue are similar because of their common use of the phonetic suffix \u201crite.\u201d The phonetic suffix \u201crite\u201d suggests the words \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrite.\u201d In the first connotation it imparts to the respective marks the concept of correctness in the recording devices. In its second connotation it suggests that the record is written. As stated by appellee\u2019s witness Gipple:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">* * * we had felt that there was a rather broad usage in connection with the selling and marking of technical products with names that used the word \u201crite\u201d as a suffix, and we brought this to the attention of Mr. Salter, our patent counsel, and suggested that he make a search restricted to technical products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The result of the search made by Mr. Salter supported the above statement and was made of record. Exhibit A consists of 17 registrations of trademarks in which \u201crite\u201d is the suffix. They support the testimony of appellee\u2019s witness Ondis that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">* * * at the time the corporation was formed we had a rather clear plan as to the type and nature of the products that would be designed and manufactured by us. We decided to adopt a name that would have some relation to those products, and since the products were all technical in the sense that they were other than consumer, we decided to adopt a name that incorporated some portion of the word \u201ctechnical\u201d and we used \u201ctechni\u201d. We then decided to take the suffix \u201crite\u201d which, as we analyzed it, had a dual meaning; the first meaning might be compared to the word \u201cright\u201d implying correctness or excellence, and the second meaning of the suffix \u201crite\u201d alluding to the fact that the equipments were writers, recording instruments that wrote caligraphi-cally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Thus, as we consider the entire marks in issue it is necessarily against a background of the common and well recognized usage of trademarks in which the phonetic suffix \u201crite\u201d has been used. The recognized meaning which it imparts to the entire mark is the same in all marks in issue but it is not sufficiently distinctive as applied to such marks to indicate either appellant or appellee as the source or origin of the goods to which it is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Some effort was made by appellant to suggest that since the suffix \u201crite\u201d was used in several of its trade names, i. e., \u201cservo/riter\u201d, \u201coscillo/riter\u201d and \u201cevent/riter\u201d to designate particular of its products, the public had associated appellant as the source of goods on which marks ending with the suffix \u201crite\u201d was employed. It is not seen on this record how this result can follow from such use. Instead, the record establishes that the suffix \u201crite\u201d was a common suffix prior to appellant\u2019s adoption of its mark. Thus, taken alone, the suffix \u201crite\u201d so lacks in distinctiveness that it cannot be said to support appellant\u2019s position. See Servo Corp. of America v. Servo-Tek Products Co., 289 F.2d 955, 48 CCPA 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">We think we are supported in our decision by the results of a survey made by McGraw Hill Company for appellant. Appellant in its brief has summarized the record concerning this survey as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APz\">In November of 1962, McGraw Hill Research, a department of McGraw Hill Publishing Company, conducted an advertising survey including specifically an inquiry as to what \u201ctrade name\u201d was used by the Opposer-Appellant, Texas Instruments Incorporated, on oscillographic recorders. Of the three hundred and eighty-six responses, two hundred and seventy-eight did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>know Texas Instruments made oscillo-graphic recorders, eighty-two knew Texas Instruments made oscillographic recorders but did not know the \u201ctrade name\u201d, nine incorrectly identified the oscillographic recorder by the name \u201crecti/riter\u201d (which is Opposer-Appel-lant\u2019s trademark for galvanometric recorders), six correctly identified the oscillographic recorder as \u201coscillo/ riters\u201d, three identified Opposer-Ap-pellant\u2019s oscillographic recorder as \u201ctechni-writer\u201d (Exhibits 1, 23a, 23b, 23c, 23d, 24, 25a and 25b; R. 47-61; R. 64-69). .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">We would add that the responses were received from a total of 2000 questionnaires which McGraw Hill sent to a randomly selected list of subscribers to its publication \u201cElectronics.\u201d It seems but reasonable to assume that if appellant\u2019s position was correct more responses would have associated appellant with \u201crite\u201d and \u201criter\u201d type marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Distinctiveness of the marks in issue therefore must be found in their prefixes and in the effect of such prefixes in imparting distinctiveness to the entire mark with which they are used. The prefix \u201cteehni\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark imparts to its mark as a whole an entirely different meaning than does appellant\u2019s prefix \u201crecti.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Appellant cites The Magnavox Corp. v. Multivox Corp. of America, 341 F.2d 139, 52 CCPA 1025 where we found a likelihood of confusion between the marks \u201cMagnavox\u201d and \u201cMultivox,\u201d as applied to the goods of the parties, and argues that the facts before us in that case are remarkably similar to the facts in the present case. Appellant states in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">* * * the suffix \u201crite\u201d is no weaker than the suffix \u201cvox\u201d as applied to the goods involved and that the prefixes \u201crecti\u201d and \u201cteehni\u201d have as much in common as \u201cmulti\u201d and \u201cmagna\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Appellee answers this argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">* * * the suffix \u201cvox\u201d is not thought to be nearly as descriptive as the suffix \u201cRite\u201d, nor are the prefixes \u201cTeehni\u201d and \u201cRecti\u201d thought to be nearly as similar as the prefixes \u201cMulti\u201d and \u201cMagna\u201d, both of which comprise the same number of letters, start with the same letter, and have generally the same meaning and significance. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">We find appellee\u2019s reasoning more persuasive and, concerning the marks, we think the facts in the present case are more similar to those in New Castle Products, Inc. v. American Door Co., 291 F.2d 954, 48 CCPA 1036, where we found no likelihood of confusion between the marks \u201cModernfold\u201d and \u201cMagna-Fold\u201d when applied to similar goods. See also American Grease Stick Co. v. Chemplast, Inc., 341 F.2d 942, 52 CCPA 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">The board considered this survey evidence, discussed supra, as to whether or not it formed a basis from which a conclusion of actual confusion could be reached. We find, as did the board, that the survey falls short of establishing actual confusion. We point out, however, that even though the proofs fail to establish actual confusion, it is sufficient to sustain an opposition if the proofs establish a \u201clikelihood\u201d of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers. Even when tested against this concept, the survey proofs are insufficient and unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Considering the marks as applied to the goods of the parties, as required by the terms of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d), including the technical nature of the goods, their high cost, their respective markets and channels of distribution, the discrimination of prospective purchasers, and the differences in the marks, we agree with the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">MARTIN, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\">.
