BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The broad legal question here is whether the Texas Long Arm statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> tries to reach as far as the State of Washington and, concluding that Texas would hardly grope for less than its reach, whether the Federal Constitution reduces the grasp. Reduced to the bio-logico-legal terms of this record, the question in the <em>Hcmson-Denckla </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concept is whether the corporation has \u201c * * <em>* </em>purposefully [availed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the * * * State\u201d when, under the contractual relationship, in addition to a few roving human inspectors, visitors, veterinarians, or ambassadors of good will coming to Texas, its regular representatives are pure bred male chicks under a sort of fowl bare-boat charter-lease whose Texas mission is to fertilize the eggs of purchased female chicks of like lineage whose progeny is to carry on the good name of the strain to the mutual advantage of the Vendor-Lessor and Buyer-Lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-22\">The District Court, after removal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the cause from the State Court by the nonresident Defendant Washington corporation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sustained the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction over the person of the Defendant. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-23\">The facts are without material dispute. Heisdorf and Nelson Farms, the Vendor-Lessor, is a State of Washington corporation engaged in the chicken breeding business. Vendor-Lessor entered into a written franchise hatchery contract with appellant Atwood Hatcheries, a Texas corporation, the Buyer-Lessee. The Buyer-Lessee brought this suit in the Texas State Court alleging that Vendor-Lessor breached the franchise hatchery contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>and seeking damages therefor. Service of process was accomplished on Vendor-Lessor\u2019s general manager while he was attending a national convention in Dallas, Texas. Buyer-Lessee\u2019s State Court petition acknowledged the Defendant\u2019s nonresident status and stated that Vendor-Lessor is \u201cengaged in and doing business in the State of Texas by virtue of the fact that [it] * * * leases to the Plaintiff, male chickens for the purpose of breeding stock.\u201d The Vendor-Lessor removed the case to the federal District Court and filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Court lacked jurisdiction over it, inasmuch as its contacts with the State of Texas were insufficient to render it subject to the jurisdiction of a Court of that State. The \u201ccontacts\u201d with the State of Texas were developed by affidavit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which establishes that Vendor-Lessor had from time to time entered<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> into as many as five separate franchise hatchery contracts with Texas hatcheries. In addition Vendor-Lessor employed three field representatives, one of whom calls on the Texas franchise hatcheries for consultation and advise three or four times a year. The field representatives are not authorized to and do not solicit or accept orders. On rare occasions, however, an order may be communicated through a field representative to Vendor-Lessor\u2019s Washington office. Also on rare occasions a geneticist or veterinarian employed by Vendor-Lessor visits and consults with a Texas franchise hatchery. None of Vendor-Lessor\u2019s places of business are located in Texas. Except for its leased male chicks, it has never maintained a stock of goods, nor does it maintain a bank account, or telephone listing in Texas. It has never had any employees, agents, or representatives regularly residing in Texas. And whether it ought to have or not, it has never paid taxes to Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">It is an understatement to say that the contract<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is extraordinary. Neither for this Buyer-Lessee nor for the other four in Texas is it a single shot proposition. Rather, it contemplates a continuing relationship with the joint use of breeding stock under the most careful restrictions and supervisory powers to assure the maintenance of a good public image and the purity and poultry soundness of the Leghorn chickens introduced into Texas under Vendor-Lessor\u2019s \u201cH&amp;N-Nick Chick\u201d trade name. The opening line of the contract recites that Vendor-Lessor, \u201cengaged in the business of poultry breeding, * * * has developed special breeding stocks * * * with distinctive family lines not available to the public * * Par. 1 provides for the sale to Buyer-Lessee of \u201cparent female chicks\u201d subject to all \u201cterms, conditions, and restrictions of this\u201d contract. Subject to similar conditions, in par. 2 Vendor-Lessor agrees \u201cto lease to [Buyer-Lessee] sufficient sexed H&amp;N \u2018Nick Chick\u2019 Leghorn parent stock male chicks for mating only with like sexed H&amp;N <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>\u2018Nick Chick\u2019 Leghorn parent stock females purchased by\u201d Buyer-Lessee. Presumably because this has some relation to production or productivity, Vendor-Lessor at its discretion is to fix the \u201cratio of male chicks to be leased for mating.\u201d Under par. 2 the activities of these leased male chicks are carefully circumscribed during life and even life itself, the time and consequences of death are likewise controlled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under par. 6 Buyer-Lessee agrees that the \u201cparent stock female chicks purchased and male chicks leased * * * will be used to produce hatching eggs to the extent that [Buyer-Lessee] can obtain sales for H&amp;N \u2018Nick Chick\u2019 Leghorns * * * \u201d and that it \u201cwill make certain that any eggs produced by such chicks * * * which are not acceptable for hatching purposes will be placed in commercial egg market channels for human consumption only * * Par. 7 prescribes that \u201cNo person other than [Buyer-Lessee] shall be permitted to hatch any eggs produced by the H&amp;N parent stock chickens purchased and leased * *</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Under par. 8 Buyer-Lessee agrees to \u201ctake necessary action to insure that all H&amp;N parent stock * * * are carefully and continually supervised and inspected * * To \u201cavoid the possibility of H&amp;N parent stock * * * becoming mixed with other chickens or eggs * * Buyer-Lessee agrees under par. 9 that it will \u201cnot keep or maintain * * * any White Leghorn or other white egg commercial laying type chickens except breed crosses or H&amp;N parent stock.\u201d All of this is made doubly sure in par. 10 in which Buyer-Lessee agrees \u201cthat positive measures will be taken * * * to absolutely insure that female H&amp;N parent stock \u00cd\u00d1ick Chick\u2019 Leghorns purchased hereunder will be mated only to male H&amp;N parent stock \u2018Nick Chick\u2019 Leghorns leased hereunder. * * * \u201d Complete segregation is required.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And by par. 11 Buyer-Lessee agrees to \u201ckeep its premises * * * clean and orderly to the satisfaction of [Vendor-Lessor]\u201d and to \u201cuse * * * skill and judgment in accordance with good poultry husbandry in raising, housing, feeding, managing and testing all H&amp;N parent stock chickens * * which activities \u201cshall be open to inspection by\u201d Vendor-Lessor \u201cat all reasonable times.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">And if successful in raising the chicks to the point of sale, Buyer-Lessee\u2019s right to sell is severely circumscribed. Buyer-Lessee agrees \u201cthat all chicks hatched from eggs produced by the H&amp;N parent stock chickens purchased and leased * * * will be sold under the name of Atwood Hatcheries, Inc. H&amp;N \u2018Nick Chick\u2019 Leghorns\u201d (par. 6) and if sold \u201cthrough the agency of dealers or other sales outlets * * this may be done \u201conly if a written contract has been entered into * * * after being first approved by [Vendor-Lessor]\u201d (par. 16). Moreover, in the non-poultry phases the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Buyer-Lessee put itself under the domination of Vendor-Lessor. Thus the Buyer-Lessee binds itself to maintain good books and records subject to audit at any time by Vendor-Lessor (par. 17) and to \u201csubmit * * * whenever requested, copies of all printed advertising, and radio and television scripts, concerned with the sales * * * of H&amp;N \u2018Nick Chick\u2019 Leghorns\u201d and to discontinue their use if \u201cdisapproved by [Vendor-Lessor]\u201d (par. 18). The contract was for an indefinite period terminating only after 60 days\u2019 notice plus \u2014 in a sort of a poultry-perpetuity rule \u2014 the lives in being of the chicks, chickens, male, female, purchased or leased.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">It is against this relationship that Texas and Federal policies must be assayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The problem of whether a foreign corporation may be subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts of the forum state divides itself along lines of state and national interest. The first inquiry is whether state law provides for the exercise of jurisdiction under the circumstances of the case presented. Conditioned on an affirmative answer to this is the question whether the exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to state law violates the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">The precision of Revised Civil Statutes of Texas article 2031b eliminates the first inquiry.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Article 2031b (note 1, supra) authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction over a foreign corporation where it is \u201cdoing business\u201d in Texas. And \u201cdoing business\u201d is defined to include \u201centering into contract by mail or otherwise<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with a resident of Texas to be performed in whole or in part by either party in this State * * Since the exigencies of the case as a prelude to the discussion of the Federal question require it, we now declare what was more hesitatingly suggested in Lone Star<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and even more guardedly assumed in Jack Tar<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that \u201cthe Texas purpose [in enacting article 2031b] was to exploit to the maximum the fullest permissible reach under federal constitutional restraints.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>In this setting there can be no doubt that Texas intends \u2014 if it has the power \u2014to reach this contract and the parties to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Now posed is the second question \u2014whether the Texas statute as thus applied offends the Federal Constitution. Constitutional restrictions on the power of a state to acquire jurisdiction over a foreign corporation have been the subject of several recent and far-reaching decisions of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The more restrictive notions of Pennoyer v. Neff, 1877, 95 U.S. 714, 24 L.Ed. 565, were discarded in International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 1945, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95, and replaced by the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d principle.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This principle was continued and expanded in further decisions,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> culminating in McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 1957, 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> McGee was followed by Hanson v. Denckla, 1958, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283, which served notice that \u201cit is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Turning to the case at hand, it is apparent that Vendor-Lessor\u2019s activities in Texas satisfy the federal constitutional requirements. It entered into contracts with several Texas hatcheries. It collects rentals and royalties under these contracts. It retains ownership of the male chicks leased to the Texas hatcheries. It reserved detailed, far-reaching, systematic, and continuous supervisory rights over all Texas activities, thus en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>abling it to exploit completely the economic potential of the Texas market and all the while preserving its trade reputation, integrity, and the salability nationwide of H&amp;N \u2018Nick Chick\u2019 Leghorns. Added to this, occasionally field representatives, geneticists, veterinarians, or the like employed by Vendor-Lessor traveled to Texas for consultation with the Texas hatcheries with the mutual aim of making business, the chick business, better and better. And, finally, it is out of this contractual arrangement that the controversy in suit arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Texas has an immediate and continuous interest in this continuing relationship. The Vendor-Lessor believes that Texas needs its special breed of \u201cH&amp;N Nick Chick.\u201d So much so that it sets up an elaborate mechanism to assure the purity and perfection of the strain. More than that, Vendor-Lessor believes it needs Texas, and the business profits the Texas business will generate. Cf. Delray Beach Aviation Corp. v. Mooney Aircraft, Inc., 5 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 135, cert. denied, 1964, 379 U.S. 915, 85 S.Ct. 262, 13 L.Ed.2d 85. From the Texas point of view the Vendor-Lessor must take the bitter \u2014 amenability to personal jurisdiction \u2014 with the sweet.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">In engaging in these activities Vendor-Lessor purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Texas, thus invoking the benefits and protections of Texas law. It assumed the risk of trial in Texas in choosing to come into this State.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We therefore hold that a Court of Texas may, consistent with the Federal Constitution and without offending \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\u201d assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">The cause must therefore be reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">. Vernon\u2019s Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2031b:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-8\">\u201cArt. 2031b.

The Supreme Court of Texas has now promulgated a rule of procedure (Tex. Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 120a) to permit a special appearance thus making it unnecessary, and in many ways now inappropriate, for us to be \u201cmaking\u201d Texas law on jurisdiction over nonresidents, a responsibility foisted on us. See Thode, \u201cIn Personam Jurisdiction; Article 9031b, The Texas \u2018Long Arm\u2019 Jurisdiction Statute; And The Appearance to Challenge Jurisdiction in Texas and Elsewhere,\u201d 42 Texas Law Rev. 279, 310-341.

Since the Court did not merely quash the service of process, it presumably thought that under no circumstances was this nonresident corporate defendant amenable.

The affidavit states that each Texas franchise hatchery contract \u201cwas entered into when the defendant [Heisdorf] affixed its signature to the contract at its principal office in the State of Washington, and was not entered into in the State of Texas.\u201d See note 14, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\">. It is little wonder that the trial Court made a misstep as to contract Long Arm. The Buyer-Lessee made no factual response to the Vendor-Lessor\u2019s affidavit (note 5, supra) which, referred to the contract but did not set it forth. At the heart of the ease, it is made available to us by an exhibit to a brief to which Vendor-Lessor withdrew objections provided we accepted its contention that it had not in fact exercised within Texas any of the numerous supervisory powers reserved. Accepting this, as we do, it is without legal significance for it is the retention of powers, and not the exercise thereof, that is important. See generally Sun-X Glass Tinting, Inc. v.
