Hulick petitions for review of a decision of the Tax Court, Withey, Judge (T. C. Memo 1964-300) (unreported), confirming petitioner\u2019s income tax deficiency for the year 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The Commissioner disallowed as a deduction the sum of $600.00 paid by the petitioner as expenses for the care of a dependent child in order that the petitioner might be gainfully employed. A married woman seeking such a deduction must file a joint return. Since Mrs. Hulick admittedly filed an individual return, the sole question was whether during 1960 she was married to her husband. The provision which allows the deduction carries its own definition for the determination of the taxpayer\u2019s marital status: \u201cA woman shall not be considered as married if she is legally separated from her spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance at the close of the taxable year.\u201d Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 214(c) (3) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 214) (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We agree with the court below that an order of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia granting custody of her child and an award of maintenance for herself and minor child against her husband did not effect a legal separation from her spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance. Although she did obtain a divorce in 1961, she was still married to her husband in 1960. Cf. West v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 131 F.2d 46, 47 (9th Cir. 1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">If the consequences of the situation in which she found herself were burdensome, as indicated by Congress\u2019 later amendment of the definition of a woman \u201cnot to be considered as married\u201d to include any woman deserted by her husband and who has applied to a court for support, they were, nevertheless, irremediable. The act provides that the amendment shall apply only with respect to taxable years ending after the date of its enactment. Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 214 (c)(3), as amended, 77 Stat. 4 (Pub.L. 88-4) (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Nor can we heed the petitioner\u2019s appeal to do equity. \u201c[Allowance of deductions from gross income does not turn on general equitable considerations. It \u2018depends upon legislative grace; and only as there is clear provision therefor can any particular deduction be allowed.\u2019 \u201d Deputy v. duPont, 308 U.S. 488, 493, 60 S.Ct. 363, 366, 84 L.Ed. 416 (1940); United States v. Olympic Radio &amp; Television Inc., 349 U.S. 232, 235-236, 75 S.Ct. 733, 99 L.Ed. 1024 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
