The sole question here is the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Plaintiff Daniels was employed by Norman Kightlinger in renovating and improving the transmitter station of the Cook Broadcasting Company, defendantappellee herein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson was an employee of the latter company.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Preparatory to the removal of a gas furnace, the plaintiff disconnected one of the gas lines after Johnson had undertaken, at plaintiff\u2019s request, to turn off the master valve on a propane gas supply tank near the building and had told plaintiff that he had done so. Such cooperation had been authorized by Johnson\u2019s employer, the defendant. Plaintiff alleged that Johnson in fact neglected to shut the valve completely off and that as a result propane gas remained in the line unknown to plaintiff and exploded when plaintiff disconnected the line, to his serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In substance the trial court found that Johnson actually had turned the gas off as he had undertaken to do; that the \u201csmall\u201d explosion resulting in minor injury to plaintiff was caused by the \u201cbleeding\u201d of gas from the line and its contact with the unexpired pilot light of a hot water heater; that plaintiff himself did not take ordinary or necessary precautions for his own safety and was negligent, and that Johnson had not been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">The trial court in directing entry of judgment denying recovery, concluded that \u201cthe law followed the facts\u201d found. We agree, for a reading of the record, including the supplements filed by plaintiff with leave of this court, is convincing that there was substantial competent evidence to support the lower court\u2019s findings of fact. Rule 52(a) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948) ; McSorley\u2019s Inc. v. United States, 323 F.2d 900 (10th Cir. 1963); Continental Materials Corp. v. Gaddis Mining Co., 306 F.2d 952 (10th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">Without merit is plaintiff\u2019s contention (argued at length in a supplemental brief) that the testimony of Johnson that he \u201cproceeded to shut off the gas\u201d was merely conclusional and hence insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that the gas had been shut off. The fair purport of this testimony in context was as the court found; and counsel\u2019s present highly technical attack on its phrasing is not strengthened by his apparently studious avoidance of clarification at the trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. Kightlinger was the principal owner of KFRM, Inc., which at the time was about to take over the transmitter station and with this in view was carrying on improvement work under an agreement to hold Cook Broadcasting Company harmless from any damage or loss while the latter continued to occupy the premises. It was by reason of this agreement that KFRM was made a third party defendant by Cook. The trial court having denied recovery by plaintiff on the finding that Cook was not liable, KFRM, Inc., also was thereby discharged from liability on the third party complaint. These circumstances, although presented in some detail in the record and briefs, do not affect the determinative question before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-14\">.
