They developed a friendly relationship and began to \u201cpal around\u201d together. On July 23, 1963, they traveled together in Berry\u2019s automobile to Mount Enterprise, Texas. While the automobile was being repaired, appellant entered the Merchants and Planters State Bank, which is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and bought a number of travelers checks. This is the Bank which was later burglarized. Berry testified he \u201cmight have\u201d burglarized the Bank on that occasion if he had not had car trouble, but that appellant was unaware of his intentions to do so. Four days later, appellant and Berry returned to Mount Enterprise from Fort Worth; and around midnight Berry broke into and entered the Bank and stole several thousand dollars worth of cash, savings bonds, blank cashier\u2019s cheeks and various other items of value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Berry testified he did not know whether appellant ever entered the Bank on the occasion of the burglary or whether appellant was aware of what transpired. However, he also stated that appellant \u201cmight have went in.\u201d After the burglary the two men returned together to Fort Worth and then separated. The evidence is clear, strong and convincing that appellant was in possession of a good portion of the stolen property immediately after the burglary and that Berry divided \u201cthe take\u201d with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The court overruled appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal. The appellant did not testify but he claims that the evidence at most creates only a suspicion and does not establish guilt. It is argued that he and Berry were good friends and that Berry planned and committed the crime without his knowledge even though he was in the car with Berry. He claims that he was intoxicated on the night of the burglary, and that Berry gave him a portion of the stolen property to induce him to remain silent. The Government contends that the jury was amply justified in believing that appellant and Berry planned the burglary, that the first trip to Mount Enterprise was for the purpose of permitting the appellant to observe the outlay of the bank and its facilities, and that he received his share of the stolen property. Moreover, it is argued there was some evidence that appellant actually entered the bank on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Appellant first argues that according to the uniform decisions of this Court and particularly our holding in Vick v. United States, (5 Cir. 1954) 216 F.2d 228, the District Court should have granted his motion for acquittal, since none of the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with every \u201creasonable hypothesis\u201d of his innocence. We said in <em>Vick </em>at 216 F.2d 232:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cIn circumstantial evidence cases, this Court has said repeatedly that to sustain conviction the inferences reasonably to be drawn from the evidence must not only be consistent with guilt of the accused but inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis of his innocence. Kassin v. United States, 5 Cir., 87 F.2d 183, 184; Rent v. United States, 5 Cir., 209 F.2d 893, 899; McTyre v. United States, 5 Cir., 213 F.2d 65, 67. In such cases the test to be applied on motion for judgment of acquittal and on review of the denial of such motion is not simply whether in the opinion of the trial judge or of the appellate court the evidence fails to exclude every reasonable hypothesis, but that of guilt, but rather whether the jury might reasonably so conclude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">We have consistently followed the rule that inferences reasonably to be drawn from, the evidence must not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but inconsistent with every reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>able hypothesis of his innocence. See Williamson v. United States, (5 Cir. 1964) 332 F.2d 123, footnote 11; Curtis v. United States, (5 Cir. 1961) 297 F.2d 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">After a careful examination of all the evidence and taking the view most favorable to the Government,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that the jury had ample evidence to reject appellant\u2019s \u201chypothesis of innocence\u201d as being \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Without attempting to determine the factual issues ourselves, it seems unreasonable to conclude that Berry arranged to have appellant accompany him on his two trips to Mount Enterprise, allowed him to witness the crime, and then felt compelled to <em>give </em>him a sizeable portion of the stolen property to keep him quiet. When viewed in light of the strong evidence pointing to appellant\u2019s actual involvement in the crime, the \u201chypothesis\u201d weakens even further. For example: (1) appellant and Berry were closely associated; (2) they traveled together to Mount Enterprise four days before the crime; (3) appellant entered the Bank to buy travelers cheeks; (4) they returned to Mount Enterprise where Berry admittedly burglarized the Bank; (5) Berry refused to deny unequivocally that appellant entered the Bank or aided in the crime; and (6) appellant undoubtedly possessed a sizeable portion of the stolen property subsequent to the crime. The evidence was entirely sufficient to support the verdict of the jury and the trial court correctly denied the motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Five police fingerprint cards were admitted into evidence because they contained appellant\u2019s genuine signature. They were offered for the limited purpose of establishing the fact that he bought the travelers checks at the Bank in question four days prior to the crime, and to prove the authenticity of his signature at the time of purchase. Such evidence supports the conclusion that the appellant was in the burglarized Bank only a short time before the actual commission of the crime. Appellant argues that the cards revealed that he had been arrested by the police on at least five previous occasions and that they poisoned the minds of the jurors. Nowhere on the cards is it expressly revealed that appellant had been arrested, or that he had been charged with or convicted of a crime. The Court carefully instructed the jury to disregard the cards except for the limited purpose for which they were offered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Evidence of other arrests or other crimes not covered by the indictment is not ordinarily admissible against a defendant. However, the general rule is that if such evidence tends to prove facts relevant to the crime charged in the indictment, it is not rendered incompetent merely because it also reveals that an arrest may have been made or a crime may have been committed. Under the clear and cautionary instructions of the Court this evidence was admissi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>We. Hardin v.
