The Board\u2019s Decision and Order are reported at 151 N.L.R.B. No. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The Board found that respondent violated: (1) Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by threatening to discharge employees and to close the respondent\u2019s restaurant if they selected the Union; (2) Section 8(a) (3) and (1) by its discriminatory discharge of Stephen Stogden because of his union activity; and (3) Section 8(a) (5) and (1) by refusing to recognize and bargain with the Union. We find substantial evidence on the whole record to support these findings and we deem it unnecessary to restate the evidence upon which the Board relied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">At the hearing, the Company called for the production of prehearing affidavits which Stogden, the discharged employee, had given to the Board and the Union. General Counsel produced a \u201ccopy of the affidavit given the Board agent\u201d and an unsigned statement apparently taken by the Union. On further examination, Stogden testified that from time to time he went over to the union hall and that he gave two or more statements (he was not certain as to the number) but he did not recall signing any of those given to the Union. Both counsel for the General Counsel and counsel for the Union stated that the documents produced for Company inspection were the only such documents in their respective \u201cfiles.\u201d Counsel for the Company then moved to strike all of Stogden\u2019s testimony \u201cfor failure of the Government to provide us with all the affidavits, pretrial statements of this witness.\u201d The Board\u2019s rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon which the Company relies provides for production of a statement \u201cin possession of the general counsel, if such statement has been reduced to writing and signed or otherwise approved or adopted by the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ais-dedup-0\">The Company now contends that the statements of counsel for General Counsel counsel for the Union that they had no other statements of Stogden in their \u201cfiles\u201d were evasive and should not be treated as denials of <em>possession </em>of other Stogden statements which should have been produced. But counsel for the Company did not specifically indicate dissatisfaction with or objection to the sufficiency of responses of opposing counsel. In the absence of specific objection the trial examiner was justified in interpreting the responses as assurances that there were no other statements the production of which was required by the Board's rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">We conclude that the failure to strike Stogden's testimony was not error. In fact, the only statement affirmatively shown to have met the specifications of the Board\u2019s rule \u2014 that is, a statement adopted by the witness and in the General Counsel\u2019s possession \u2014 was produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-9\">. See 151 N.L.R.B. No. 58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-10\">. Sec. 102.118 of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, Series 8 as amended, 29 C.F.R. Section 102.118 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-13\">\u201cAfter a witness called by the general counsel has testified in a hearing upon a complaint under section 10(c) of the act, the respondent may move for the production of any statement of such witness in possession of tbe general counsel, if such statement has been reduced to writing and signed or otherwise approved or adopted by the witness. Such motion shall be granted by the trial examiner. If the general counsel declines to furnish the statement, the testimony of the witness shall be stricken.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
