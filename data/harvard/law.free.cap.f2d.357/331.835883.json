The case was tried on August 5, 1965, in the Eastern District of Virginia before Judge Hoffman and a jury. Following conviction, the Judge remanded appellant to the custody of the Attorney General under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010-5024 (1958). The sole question on this appeal is whether the trial court properly admitted evidence of an episode occurring five years earlier in which Dutsch shot and wounded his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">At the time of the phone call in question appellant was 21 years old, but he had lived with his adoptive parents only about eight months in the preceding five years. In March of 1965, his father had co-signed a note for Dutsch\u2019s purchase of a Ford convertible. Dutsch then left his home in Virginia Beach for Los An-geles. He failed to meet the first payment on the car, and when the father was financially unable to make payment, the bank repossessed the car, acting upon information given them by Mrs. Dutsch as to the son\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-18\">Immediately following the repossession appellant telephoned his mother, on April 14, 1965. She testified to the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-19\">\u201cHe said, \u2018You had my car repossessed,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Son, the bank did that,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Well\u2019 said, \u2018I\u2019m coming back to Norfolk\u2019; said, \u2018I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get there,\u2019 said, \u2018but I\u2019ll be back,\u2019 and said, \u2018I\u2019ll get you this time\u2019; says, \u2018I won\u2019t miss,\u2019 says \u2014 says, \u2018I\u2019m going to show you all you\u2019re not as damn smart as you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>think you are,\u2019 and I can\u2019t remember exactly \u2014 he said \u2014 he says, \u2018You can have the law there, or whatever you please, but,\u2019 said, \u2018I\u2019ll not miss this time.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The prosecuting attorney then asked the witness the significance of the words \u201cI\u2019ll not miss this time,\u201d and before she was permitted to explain, the court admonished the jury that evidence of any prior incident was relevant to show only (a) whether Dutsch intended a threat by the use of the quoted language; and (b) whether the call was of such a nature as reasonably to have induced fear in his mother. The Judge specifically cautioned the jury that the prior incident should not be considered as evidence of a \u201cpropensity or disposition on the part of the defendant to commit this particular crime for which he is charged * *</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Mrs. Dutsch then related that about five years previous to the phone call, when the defendant was 16 years old, he became \u201crather upset\u201d when his parents were unable to buy him a car, and that soon afterward her son shot her. It was disclosed in chambers, out of the jury\u2019s presence, that following this incident Dutsch was convicted of attempted murder and committed as a juvenile offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\"> In arguing that testimony concerning the 1960 incident was improperly admitted, the theory of defense counsel is that it related primarily to defendant\u2019s character and his disposition to commit offenses similar to the one charged, and further that the lapse of five years between the two events rendered evidence of the earlier one inadmissible. However, a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875 (c) requires a showing that a threat was intended, see Seeber v. United States, 329 F.2d 572, 577 (9th Cir. 1964).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Evidence that the defendant harmed his mother in 1960, shortly after she had refused to buy him a ear, was relevant to show that when he called, after the Ford was repossessed, and told her \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get you this time,\u201d and \u201cI won\u2019t miss,\u201d he intended to threaten the same type of harm he had previously inflicted on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">A. prosecutor may not establish a defendant\u2019s guilt by offering testimony of unrelated offenses. Lovely v. United States, 169 F.2d 386 (4th Cir. 1948). Bolstering the case in this fashion is forbidden. However, relevant testimony is not rendered automatically inadmissible because it discloses prior criminal conduct, see 1 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 216 (3d ed. 1940). Here the event testified to was directly related to the offense charged, the significance of the words spoken over the telephone, otherwise arguably ambiguous, becomes clear only in light of the 1960 shooting. And the trial judged precautionary instruction, repeated in the final charge, emphasized the limited purpose for which the testimony was admitted. Under these circumstances, the trial court was clearly within the bounds of its discretion in permitting this testimony. Cf. United States v. Hutchison, 352 F.2d 404 (4th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Counsel in this case was appointed for the defendant before August 20, 1965, the effective date of the Criminal Justice Act, which provides compensation for services of court-appointed counsel. See 78 Stat. 552, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3006A (d). He has represented his client with great ability and earnestness both in the District Court and on appeal. The court expresses its appreciation for his conscientious performance of professional duty. It is concluded, however, that there was no error in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-13\">. \u201cWhoever transmits in interstate commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-12\">. It is unnecessary under subparagraph (e) of \u00a7 875 to show an intent to extort money; repossession of the Ford related solely to the motive for the call and alleged threat. See United States v. Pennell, 144 F.Supp. 317 (N.D.Cal.1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
