Although appellant alleges his constitutional rights were violated in several ways, he chiefly attacks the admission of certain testimony respecting incriminating statements which were made by him. Appellant\u2019s petition failed to show these alleged incriminating statements. Accordingly the District Court denied his application without hearing upon the ground that the petition failed to show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-22\">The petitioner\u2019s failure to provide evidence of the incriminating statements has been remedied in this court by the appendix to appellee\u2019s brief. In this ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>pendix there appears the unpublished opinion of the State District Court of Appeal on review of the judgment of conviction. The nature of the incriminating statements is set forth in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Under these circumstances further consideration by the District Court is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
