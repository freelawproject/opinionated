In 1951 or 1952 he hurt his back while longshoring for appellant Independent Stevedore Company. In the years that followed, his condition was aggravated by other back injuries which he sustained while longshoring for Independent. On May 26, 1957, while still employed by Independent, he was disabled by a further back injury while moving timber on a cargo vessel. He has not worked since.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-23\">Appellants recognized the work-connected nature of the employee\u2019s disability, paying medical expense plus compensation for temporary total disability from May 26, 1957, to July 5, 1960. During this period, on February 25, 1958, the employee submitted to a spinal fusion. Following the operation, the employee wore a chair brace for three months and took heat treatments, but his condition continued to worsen. His physician informed him that he would be unable to work as a longshoreman again. He then filed a claim for permanent partial disability, based on the May 26, 1957, accident. In October 1960 appellants settled this claim by paying the employee additional compensation. The employee\u2019s back difficulty continued, culminating in an acute attack accompanied by a temporary paralysis. He then filed the pres-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>exit claim for permanent total disability, which the deputy commissioner allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Appellants concede the employee\u2019s permanent total disability, but contend that the record does not support the deputy commissioner\u2019s conclusion that it was causally related to the employee\u2019s May 26, 1957 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The deputy commissioner reached his conclusion in two steps. First, he found that as a result of the May 26, 1957, accident, the employee \u201csuffered an acute lumbosacral strain which necessitated a spinal fusion from the 4th lumbar to the 1st sacral vertebraes on February 25, 1958.\u201d Second, he found \u201cthat as a result of the surgical operation on February 25, 1958, associated with pre-existing osteo-arthritic changes in the lumbo-sacral spine the disability of the claimant herein became permanent and total in character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Appellants attack the first finding on the ground that no witness testified directly that the operation and the accident were related. But the lack of such direct testimony is not controlling. The deputy commissioner may infer a causal relationship from the general circumstances. Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Donovan, 300 F.2d 741 (5th Cir. 1962); Hampton Roads Stevedoring Corp. v. O\u2019Hearne, 184 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir. 1950). See also Sentilles v. Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corp., 361 U.S. 107, 109, 80 S.Ct. 173, 175, 4 L.Ed.2d 142 (1959), where the Court said: \u201cThe jury\u2019s power to draw the inference that the aggravation of petitioner\u2019s tubercular condition, evident so shortly after the accident, was in fact caused by that accident, was not impaired by the failure of any medical witness to testify that it was in fact the cause.\u201d We have sustained a deputy commissioner\u2019s inference of causal relationship from general circumstances even where the only direct evidence on the issue was a statement of medical opinion that no causal relationship existed. Crescent Wharf &amp; Warehouse Co. v. Cyr, 200 F.2d 633, 637 (9th Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">As noted, the employee perforhaed heavy work up to May 26, 1957, the day of the last injury. He ceased work immediately and remained totally disabled for nine consecutive months, at which time he submitted to a spinal fusion. These facts afforded a sufficient basis for the deputy commissioner\u2019s inference that the accident and the operation were related, particularly where, as here, there was no direct testimony to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">The deputy commissioner\u2019s second finding \u2014 that the employee\u2019s total disability resulted from \u201cthe surgical operation on February 25, 1958, associated with pre-existing osteo-arthritic changes in the lumbo-sacral spine \u2014 \u201d was also a permissible inference from the record. It was supported both by the unbroken sequence of events from accident to surgery to permanent total disability, and by the medical evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\"> While it is true that a doctor testified that only forty per cent of the employee\u2019s total disability was due to the spinal fusion, the fact that the fusion was not the sole cause of the disability is irrelevant. \u201cIt is well settled in compensation law that it is sufficient to justify an award if the accident was only a concurring cause * * Old Domin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ion Stevedoring Corp. v. O\u2019Hearne, 218 F.2d 651, 653 (4th Cir. 1955). See also John W. McGrath Corp. v. Hughes, 289 F.2d 403 (2d Cir. 1961); Hampton Roads Stevedoring Corp. v. O\u2019Hearne, 184 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir. 1950). It is enough if the accident \u201caggravated, accelerated, or combined with the disease or infirmity to produce the death or disability for which compensation is sought\u201d (1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 12.20 p, 192.23), and \u201cthe relative contribution of the accident and the prior disease is not weighed?\u2019 1 Larson, supra, pp. 192.48-.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Appellants contend that the natural progression of the employee\u2019s arthritis would have resulted in total disability even if the accident (and fusion) had not occurred at all; and therefore, appellant\u2019s contend, the accident and fusion cannot be said to be related to the employee\u2019s permanent disability. But there was testimony that the fusion <em>accelerated </em>the employee\u2019s total disability, possibly by as much as five years. The law is clear that for purposes of compensation liability to hasten death or disability is to cause it. Friend v. Britton, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 139, 220 F.2d 820, 823 (D.C.Cir. 1955); 1 Larson, supra \u00a7 12.-30 p. 192.49. If an employee is incapacitated from earning wages by an employment injury which accelerates a condition which would ultimately have become incapacitating in any event, the employee is incapacitated \u201cbecause of\u201d the employment injury, and the resulting \u201cdisability\u201d is compensable under the Act. 44 Stat. 1425 (1927), 44 Stat. 1427, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 902(10), 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The Arizona Supreme Court recently applied this principle of compensation law to facts similar to those of the present case in Schreven v. Industrial Comm., 96 Ariz. 143, 393 P.2d 150 (1964). The claimant, who had a congenital back deformity, sustained a lumbo-sacral strain in an employment accident, and was disabled. A doctor testified that the injury had \u201ctriggered\u201d the claimant\u2019s disability, but \u201cthe back strain did not worsen the congenital abnormality\u201d and \u201cbecause of this defect petitioner would have reached the point where he was disabled from heavy work even if this injury had not taken place.\u201d 393 P.2d at 152. The Arizona Industrial Commission denied compensation for permanent disability; the Supreme Court of Arizona reversed. The medical testimony, the court said, was \u201cthat the injury did not medically cause the spinal condition but that it did bring on the symptoms earlier than would have been anticipated.\u201d \u201cTherefore,\u201d the court concluded, \u201clegally, the injury was the proximate cause of the disability.\u201d 393 P.2d at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">BARNES, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">. A doctor testified that \u201cThis man\u2019s generalized muscular weakness, <em>secondary to his surgical procedures </em>for an unstable and chronic lumbar sprain, associated with osteoarthritic aching processes of the same joints, has practically incapacitated him\u201d (emphasis added). This testimony specifically identifies the spinal fusion as a contributory cause of claimant\u2019s disability. The testimony of another doctor was similar. \u201cHe had had a fusion; this contributed a great deal to it, but all of this, I am sure, was the breaking point io throw him off to give him his total time off.\u201d Asked what effect the fusion had on the rest of claimant\u2019s back, the doctor answer, \u201cI think the fusion had a great deal to do with the rest of it, truly, in that that low back segment, when it is stabilized, when it is fused, has pain that disappears, because there is no motion and it throws any motion on the back above that level.\u201d \u201cThe fusion,\u201d he said, places an \u201cextra load\u201d on \u201cthe other part of the back.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
