Freeman, 357 F.2d 606 (2d Cir. 1965), decided today, we are asked to overturn Albert Malafronte\u2019s conviction for selling narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174, on the same grounds as those urged in <em>Freeman. </em>Malafronte was tried by Judge Levet without a jury and was sentenced, as a second offender, to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. At trial, Malafronte defended on the ground that he was criminally incompetent at the time of the alleged offense and because the trial judge, in assessing this defense, applied a standard which we have today declared in <em>Freeman </em>to be outmoded and hence insufficient, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">On the evening of December 5, 1962, narcotics agent James Bailey, working in an undercover capacity, met Malafronte and co-defendant Joe Comager in front of the Senator Bar on 96th Street and Broadway. Malafronte asked Bailey if he was \u201ca friend of Joe\u2019s\u201d and upon Bailey\u2019s affirmative response, the two entered the bar. Inside, Bailey and Mal-afronte encountered co-defendant, Ralph Braceo, who, after several drinks, asked Bailey if he was \u201cready to do business.\u201d Bailey acknowledged his readiness, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Braceo suggested after some discussion that the sale take place elsewhere. Accordingly, Bailey left the bar and was driven by Comager to a deserted section of Harlem in the vicinity of 119th Street and the East Side Drive. Bailey and Comager waited in the parked car until Braceo and then Malafronte arrived. Malafronte entered the parked vehicle and handed Bailey a dark gray package sealed with Scotch tape for which Bailey paid Braceo $4000, stating that an additional $600 would be forthcoming in a few days. Chemical analysis established that the package, weighing approximately 215 grams, contained heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Two days later, Bailey met Malafronte and Braceo at a Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s Restaurant on Lexington Avenue and 45th Street. After complaining about the poor quality of the drugs and his loss of money on the transaction, Bailey paid Malafronte the promised $600, but only after exacting from Braceo the assurance that \u201cwe will make it up for you on your next deal.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The main thrust of the defense to the government\u2019s case at trial consisted of an effort to establish that Malafronte, because of mental incompetency, was not responsible for his acts. In this case, as in <em>Freeman, </em>Dr. Herman C. Denber testified as an expert witness for the defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He stated that he had performed a psychiatric examination of Malafronte on January 23, 1964, at the Federal House of Detention in New York, for the purpose of determining whether the defendant was competent to stand trial. The Doctor\u2019s report<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and testimony at trial revealed that Malafronte was a chronic alcoholic who had consumed two to four pints of rye whiskey daily for a period of fifteen years. As a result, the Doctor said, Malafronte had run the gamut from \u201cpassing out\u201d to being hospitalized for delirium tremens, and had suffered several epileptic seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">Describing his interview with Mala-fronte, which lasted for little over one hour, the witness testified that Mala-fronte, who had an eighth grade education, spoke in a \u201clow, monotonous voice,\u201d was rather depressed \u201cand his whole general emotional response was markedly blunted.\u201d When Malafronte was asked by the Doctor about the alleged narcotics sale, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t remember selling anything to a federal agent. Most of the time I am drunk. I keep drinking all day long, morning and night. * * * I\u2019d have to be out of my mind if I ever did a thing like that [sell narcotics].\u201d In summary, Dr. Denber noted that Malafronte was a chronic alcoholic whose heavy drinking had caused damage to the cells of the brain leading to difficulty in making moral judgments and an inability to understand the significance of his acts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>In view of this condition, the Doctor stated, it was his opinion that at the time of the alleged sale, Malafronte was unable to distinguish right from wrong within the meaning of the M\u2019Naghten test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">To establish the full extent of Mala-fronte\u2019s alcoholic habit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s wife was called to testify. Mrs. Mala-fronte stated that she and the defendant had been married for five years and that for the last two or three years her husband\u2019s drinking had become \u201creal bad. * * * All he wanted to do was to go in the bar and drink, that is all he wanted, liquor to drink.\u201d Moreover, Mrs. Malafronte said that she provided the sole support for her three children by a previous marriage and gave her husband some \u201cdrinking money\u201d every day. When the defendant was not drinking, she noted, he spent most of his time in bed. Asked to describe what she had observed when her husband experienced a convulsive seizure, Mrs. Malafronte explained that, on one occasion, \u201cHe was shaking from head to toe, he was very white and shivering and came in with a pint of liquor and he drank it all and before you knew it he gave one loud scream and down he fell in like an epileptic fit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The government relied upon the psychiatric testimony of Dr. George H. Hys-lop to rebut Malafronte\u2019s defense of lack of responsibility. Dr. Hyslop had examined the defendant for approximately one hour during the week prior to testifying and had reviewed reports <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the defendant\u2019s condition. The witness stated that in his opinion Malafronte at the time of the alleged sale was able to-distinguish right from wrong. Dr. Hyslop based this conclusion upon Malafronte\u2019s ability to engage in purposeful conduct during the transactions in the Senator Bar, East Harlem and the Horn &amp; Hardart\u2019s Restaurant. The Doctor noted emphatically, \u201cI don\u2019t care what background he [Malafronte] may have with respect to alcohol. There is nothing to indicate that he was drunk and confused and didn\u2019t know what he was doing. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">While Dr. Hyslop acknowledged that Malafronte denied any recollection of the narcotics transaction, the government\u2019s expert was able to find no evidence of an inability to adjust to life, a characteristic of people suffering from mental disorders. Thus, Dr. Hyslop pointed out that Malafronte had been employed intermittently and possessed \u201cnormal sexual instincts.\u201d Moreover, the Doctor could find no sign of organic brain damage. He considered Mala-fronte to be alert and responsive to questions and generally aware of his condition; Malafronte had adjusted well to jail, the expert noted, and during recreation periods had made friends, played cards, viewed television and read newspapers. Finally, Dr. Hyslop observed that Malafronte possessed a psychopathic personality with criminal tendencies; but, the Doctor explained, this characterization meant simply that Malafronte failed to learn from experience and refused \u201cto use good judgment with respect to his drinking habits in spite of knowing what [they are] costing him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Because of the conflicting conclusions of the defense and government experts, the trial judge was confronted with the problem of determining which testimony to credit. Although noting that the defense medical witness was an \u201ceminent psychiatrist,\u201d the District Judge felt constrained to agree with Dr. Hyslop\u2019s testimony and concluded that under M\u2019Nagh-ten, Malafronte had failed to raise a reasonable doubt of his competency and capacity to commit the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>We recognize here, as we did in <em>Freeman, </em>that the able District Judge cannot be faulted for relying on the M\u2019Naghten Rules. This test ordinarily augmented by \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had been commonly employed in the district courts to assess criminal responsibility. Since, as in <em>Freeman, </em>we are urged here to declare the M\u2019Naghten Rules no longer the law to be applied in adjudicating criminal responsibility in this Circuit, our exten-tive discussion in United States v. Freeman, will suffice to explain our conclusions. We reverse and remand for a new trial in light of that opinion. In making this disposition, of course, we are not passing on the merits of the claims in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, as in <em>Freeman, </em>we are indicating that the test utilized by the court and the framework in which the psychiatrists testified were too restrictive in view of the modern scientific and legal standards to which we have today given recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The Court is indebted to Theodore Krieger, Esq. who represented Malafron-te as assigned counsel, for a thorough and effective presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">. Braceo and Comager were indicted with Malafronte as co-defendants. Braceo was a fugitive and Comager pleaded guilty to a superseding indictment; therefore, Mal-afronte was tried alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\">. Dr. Denber\u2019s qualifications are set forth in <em>Freeman, </em>357 F.2d at 609.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\">. Dr. Denber\u2019s report recommended that Malafronte be committed to Bellevue Hospital for further psychiatric and neurological examination to determine his competency to be tried. The document states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">This individual shows a progressive deterioration due to chronic alcoholism. He has signs of organic damage, as evidenced by the convulsive seizures and peripheral neuropathy. It is very questionable if he can be held accountable for any acts that he is alleged to have committed. In view of the history, the shifting nature of his life (his changing from job to job), the great difficulty in interpersonal adaptation, the apathy and dullness, and the emotional reactions, one must consider the possibility of simple schizophrenia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">Upon commitment and examination, Bel-levue concluded that Malafronte was competent to stand trial. The Hospital\u2019s report to the court described Malafronte\u2019s condition this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-15\">This man has been a chronic alcoholic for many years and has at times shown some vague paranoid symptomatology commonly seen in alcoholism. There is no present evidence of any psychotic process. He shows no striking organic changes. Epilepsy has been a consideration, but there is no clear record of this either.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\">. As Dr. Denber put it, \u201canyone whose brain is so saturated with alcohol as is the case with this man, * * * is not capable of distinguishing right from wrong. * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b679-13\">. Malafronte was not a drug addict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b679-14\">. Among the reports Dr. Hyslop had studied were those of Dr. Denber and Belevue Hospital. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">. The trial judge did not supplement the M\u2019Naghton Rules with the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d test because Malafronte\u2019s counsel advised the court that \u201cNowhere during the course of the defense have we ever contended or interposed the defense of irresistible impulse.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">In <em>Freeman, </em>we made it clear that M\u2019Naghten implemented by \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d was equally unsatisfactory. Moreover, we are unpersuaded by the government\u2019s contention that the defense did not offer a proper objection to the Judge\u2019s rulings on the test to be applied in assessing Malafronte\u2019s criminal responsibility. When questioning Dr. Denber, Mala-fronte\u2019s counsel asked if the defendant was \u201csuffering from a mental disease.\u201d The government\u2019s objection to this query was sustained, the Court saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think this Court has ever adopted the <em>Durham </em>[Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 45 A.L.R.2d 1430] test.\u201d Malafronte\u2019s counsel then proceeded to frame questions in light of the M\u2019Naghten Rules, but informed the Court, \u201cI just want to get that exception out and go on to something else.\u201d For the reasons stated in <em>Freeman, </em>we believe the question of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s application is properly before this Court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b680-20\">. Nor are we to be understood as saying that alcoholism without more constitutes a \u201cdisease or defect of the mind.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b680-6\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ajo-dedup-1\">(concurring in the result).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">I concur in the result.
