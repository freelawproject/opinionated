S. District Court denying appellant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, appellant assigns as grounds for relief several alleged defects in a state court conviction, which conviction led to the revocation of his parole from federal custody. He further asserts that the District Court erred in not granting him a hearing on his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">Appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit. Since petitioner was at the time of the filing of his petition and is now in federal custody as a result of the revocation of his parole from a federal conviction, \u201che has no grounds for review in this Court of his state conviction whether improperly obtained or not.\u201d Washington v. Hagan, 3rd Cir., 1960, 287 F.2d 332, cert. denied, 1961, 366 U.S. 970, 81 S.Ct. 1934, 6 L.Ed.2d 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">Thus there was no need to hold a hearing in this case. Even if we construe the petition as attacking the revocation of appellant\u2019s parole, we are satisfied that the Parole Board had before it sufficient evidence to justify revocation. As stated in Wright v. Settle, 8th Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 317, 319, the question of whether a parole violation has occurred is subject to being raised in habeas corpus \u201conly on the narrow basis that what was before the Board compelled the conclusion as a matter of law that there had been no violation of the conditional release or parole, and that the Board therefore acted without authority in making the revocation.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
