While in the forest, defendant shot Christopher Gailey twice, once in the back and once in the knee, with a twelve-gauge shotgun. Christopher Gailey died as a result of these wounds. On 24 January 2000, defendant was indicted by the grand jury of Montgomery County for the murder of Christopher Gailey, felonious larceny, and felonious possession of stolen goods. On 13 November 2003, a jury found defendant guilty of all charges. On 18 November\n   2003, the same jury returned a binding recommendation of death, and the trial court sentenced defendant accordingly. The trial court consolidated the two remaining offenses for judgment and sentenced defendant in the presumptive range to an active term of incarceration of ten to twelve months. Defendant appealed his convictions and sentence of death to this Court pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7A-27(a). We find no error in defendant's conviction or his sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before his 1998 escape from a North Carolina Department of Corrections work release program in which he was serving a sentence for numerous felony breaking or entering and felony larceny convictions, defendant met Vanessa Smith and they became romantically involved. Immediately following defendant's escape from the work release program, he met Smith in a parking lot, and the couple began moving around from hotel to hotel in this state, which Smith paid for with proceeds from a large settlement arising from her father's death. The couple also traveled to and resided sporadically in Chicago, Illinois; Spokane, Washington; San Diego, California; and Denver, Colorado, continuing to live primarily from the proceeds of Smith's settlement and spending large amounts of money on illegal drugs. Notably, while in Spokane, Smith paid a friend, Byron Johnson, five hundred dollars for a copy of his birth certificate and another identifying document. Defendant subsequently obtained a driver's license from the State of Washington in the name of Byron Johnson. Defendant's travels eventually brought him back to North Carolina, and in the summer of 1999, defendant, identifying himself as Byron Johnson, moved into a mobile home near Badin Lake, and Smith soon moved in with him. This mobile home was owned by Robert Johnson. In addition to defendant and Smith, Robert Johnson, Christopher Gailey, and Danny Lanier and his family resided in the mobile home. Christopher Gailey and defendant were long-time friends, but Smith never considered Gailey a friend. Life at the mobile home consisted of heavy partying, drinking, and drug abuse. Much of the drugs were provided by Gailey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 9 July 1999, the day of the murder, defendant told Smith and Gailey he had stashed some firearms in a cabin in the Uwharrie Forest, and they should retrieve them to sell the firearms for drugs. Robert Johnson testified he saw the three leave in Danny Lanier's truck, while Smith testified they left in Gailey's vehicle, a GMC pickup truck valued at $16,000. The three arrived that evening at the Uwharrie Forest, after which they entered the forest and walked for what Smith described as at least an hour. Smith smoked marijuana while defendant and Gailey used cocaine. Gailey carried a .45 caliber handgun, while defendant carried Gailey's twelve-gauge shotgun with a black pistol grip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As they walked single file down a very narrow trail, defendant pushed Smith to the ground. He then fired the shotgun twice, first delivering a heavy buckshot blast into Gailey's back, and then firing lighter birdshot into Gailey's knee. Smith testified that she and defendant then went to the nearby cabin to sit and wait for Gailey to die. According to Smith's testimony, for seven to eight hours after defendant shot Gailey, he would creep over on his stomach to Gailey's body to throw rocks at him to discover if he would make a noise. During this waiting period, defendant told Smith that Gailey would never call her a \"bitch\" again and that he could not believe Gailey turned on him and was going to \"rat him off\" by reporting his location to the authorities. Eventually, defendant and Smith left the forest. On their way out, defendant told Smith that their story would be someone in the forest shot Gailey, and\n   that a guy named Dustin had reason to want to harm Gailey. Smith testified that she heard Gailey fire his handgun numerous times as the couple left the forest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Next, at defendant's direction Smith drove back to the trailer to get their belongings and to steal Gailey's wallet which included Gailey's automated teller machine (ATM) card. Smith ingested eight Xanax pills and then, driving Gailey's truck picked up defendant near the Uwharrie Forest, where he had previously hid the shotgun used in the murder. The couple then drove to Shallotte, North Carolina, to see Smith's friend, Jeff Brantley. Apparently Smith and defendant talked to some of the partygoers at Brantley's residence, one of whom was Jeffrey Page. Defendant wanted to sell Gailey's truck to Page for eight hundred dollars, and he explained to Page that the truck was owned by a \"fellow\" he shot in the forest. Smith testified she did not remember much that occurred in Shallotte, save a few times when defendant forced her to use Gailey's ATM card, until she woke up two days later at her former lesbian lover Lilly Efird's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Page decided to purchase the truck, and on 12 July 1999, drove to Albemarle, North Carolina along with Brantley, and two other men, to acquire the funds for the purchase. Upon their return to Shallotte, Page purchased the truck from defendant. Page subsequently sold the truck to a junk dealer in South Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant, eight hundred dollars in hand, left for Denver once again. Smith and Efird traveled to Shallotte, and Smith borrowed, or according to Efird stole, Efird's money and car in order to travel to Denver to see defendant, believing she was pregnant with defendant's baby. After she arrived in Denver, she argued with defendant and became afraid he was going to kill her. Therefore, she returned to North Carolina and turned herself into the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police, recounting the facts of the murder. Defendant was soon arrested in Denver. He made no incriminating statements and continually denied committing the murder during his postarrest interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Gailey's body was discovered on 11 July 1999 when Wesley Hopkins drove by it during an all-terrain vehicle expedition in the Uwharrie National Forest. John Butts, M.D., the State's Chief Medical Examiner, stated the autopsy of Gailey showed a shotgun wound to the back that exited in five different locations on the victim's right chest. This wound caused extensive bleeding and damage to his lung, ribs, and large blood vessels. According to Dr. Butts, this wound would have rendered the victim unconscious in a matter of minutes, and death would have followed relatively quickly. Additionally, the shot to the knee incapacitated Gailey such that he would have been unable to move or seek medical assistance. Dr. Butts was of the opinion it would have been extremely unlikely, considering the amount of blood lost, a person with those wounds would have survived even one or two hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Law enforcement found at the scene of the crime five spent shotgun shells, numerous live .45 caliber cartridges in a pouch attached to Gailey's belt loop, a full magazine for a .45 caliber handgun, and a .45 caliber handgun with one expended .45 caliber round casing still chambered. A yellow container found on or near Gailey's body contained $1,944.05 in currency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant presented no evidence during the guilt-innocence proceeding of the trial. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of first degree murder based on a theory of malice, premeditation, and deliberation; larceny; and felonious possession of stolen goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the penalty proceeding, the State presented victim impact evidence by way of Gailey's mother, father, and sister. Defendant presented testimony of family members, a former teacher's assistant, and an expert who opined defendant would adapt well to prison life. The statutory aggravating circumstances submitted to the jury for consideration were: (1) The murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest; (2) the murder was committed for pecuniary gain; and (3) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The jury answered all of these aggravating factors in the affirmative. The jury also found two nonstatutory mitigating factors: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Scott Allen was deeply affected by the death of his grandfather; and (2) Scott Allen's death would have a detrimental impact on his mother, father, daughter, and other family members. The jury found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating circumstances were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances and that the aggravating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to impose a sentence of death. The jury therefore returned a binding recommendation of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     GUILT-INNOCENCE PROCEEDING ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant alleges the prosecution violated his right to a fair trial by the knowing use of false testimony. This Court has previously stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [I]t is established that a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment. The same result obtains when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears. Further, with regard to the knowing use of perjured testimony, the Supreme Court has established a standard of materiality under which the knowing use of perjured testimony requires a conviction to be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury. Thus, [w]hen a defendant shows that testimony was in fact false, material, and knowingly and intentionally used by the [S]tate to obtain his conviction, he is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

We note today there is a difference between the knowing presentation of false testimony and knowing that testimony conflicts in some manner.

In fact, if inconsistent information is elicited from a witness, the party who called that witness may impeach him or her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1 Rule 607 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, defendant argues the prosecution violated defendant's constitutional rights by offering two portions of Smith's testimony. First, defendant contends Smith's testimony she and defendant waited seven to eight hours in the Uwharrie Forest for the victim to die and they left the scene while he was still alive was demonstrably false testimony and known to be so by the prosecution. Second, defendant contends Smith's testimony that she \"heard, I'm assuming it was Chris empty his gun out\" was also demonstrably false and known to be so by the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As to defendant's first contention, we note the length of time it took the victim to die in this case is not easily proved. While the State Medical Examiner, Dr. John Butts, testified Gailey would not have survived as long as seven to eight hours, that testimony was his medical opinion. It cannot be said either Smith's statement or the opinion of Dr. Butts is verifiably false, much less that Smith's statement was knowingly false when elicited. In fact, during closing arguments, the prosecution admitted that Smith's perception of time \"may not have been correct.\" Merely because inconsistent testimony is presented, it does not follow that such testimony is knowingly and demonstrably false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Similarly, the testimony about the \"emptying\" of the victim's handgun, while unlikely to be accurate, cannot be said to have been known as false by the prosecution. Smith was a confessed drug addict and under the influence of drugs at the time of the murder. This, along with her prior convictions and other circumstances of her lifestyle revealed at defendant's trial, made her a witness with less-than-perfect credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, the prosecution did not violate defendant's constitutional rights by submitting conflicting testimony when nothing in the record tends to show the prosecution knew the testimony was false. The prosecution could have truly believed Smith was\n   simply mistaken and did not hear as many shots as she thought due to her drug abuse or just plain fear. Because we are unpersuaded the prosecution knew Smith intended to make false statements, we overrule defendant's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CLOSING ARGUMENT ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant claims the prosecution's closing arguments in both the guilt-innocence and penalty proceedings violated notions of fundamental fairness because the prosecution \"plugged a crucial hole\" by mentioning evidence outside the record. Defendant notes five instances in which he alleges the prosecution's argument contained facts outside the evidence presented: (1) Defendant devised a plan to lure Gailey into the woods in order to murder him; (2) a cache of firearms was never discovered in the woods; (3) the weather was hot on 9 July 1999 in the Uwharrie forest, which purportedly explained why Gailey's shirt was found lying on the ground; (4) that it would be impossible for Smith to inflict the deadly wounds upon Gailey due to the height differential between them; and (5) Gailey fired his .45 caliber handgun once, after which the handgun jammed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In a hotly contested trial, such as a capital case, \"[t]he scope of jury arguments is left largely to the control and discretion of the trial court, and trial counsel will be granted wide latitude.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Call,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571580\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/349/382/#p419\">\n    349 N.C. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=508%20S.E.2d%20496\">\n    508 S.E.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (1998). Counsel may argue any facts in the record and any reasonable inference that may be drawn from any facts in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=508%20S.E.2d%20496\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, defendant did not object to any statements now complained of during the arguments before the trial court and now argues the trial court should have intervened\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu.\n   </em>\n   However, we will not find error in a trial court's failure to intervene in closing arguments\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   unless the remarks were so grossly improper they rendered the trial and conviction fundamentally unfair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=508%20S.E.2d%20496\">\n    508 S.E.2d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagree with defendant's contentions, and we find no error in the trial court's decision concerning this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant's first contention that no evidence supported the statement made by the prosecution that defendant devised a plan to lure the victim into the forest is without merit. Defendant concedes in his brief that some evidence existed in the record to draw this inference - namely Smith's testimony that the victim did not usually hike in the woods, the victim did not want to go into the woods, and defendant talked the victim into entering the woods. It is a reasonable inference both the prosecution and the jury could make that defendant previously contrived a plan to lure his long-time friend into the forest for the purpose of ending his friend's life. Therefore, the prosecution's argument was consistent with N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1230(a), which allows argument of any conclusion based on counsel's analysis if the conclusion is consistent with the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, a reasonable inference could be made that no firearms existed at the site where the body was found. As stated earlier, defendant allegedly told his victim he had stashed firearms in a cabin in the forest and they should retrieve the firearms to sell them. Smith testified that while they were walking in the forest, defendant changed his story about where the firearms were located. In addition, the only testimony concerning a weapon found at the scene of the crime was testimony about the victim's .45 caliber handgun. Because of the testimony establishing the only weapon at the scene of the crime was the handgun, it is reasonable to infer that in fact no firearms existed and thus the assertion made by defendant about the firearms constituted nothing more than a ploy to lure the victim into the forest for his execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A reasonable inference could also be drawn that the victim removed his own shirt during the hike into the woods. This matter is relevant because a photograph of the crime scene showed a large rock atop Gailey's shirt. Smith testified \"[i]t was hot\" on the day of the shooting, and a crime scene photograph of the victim's body clearly shows his shirt removed. It is reasonable to infer that the victim removed his shirt before he was shot and before the rocks were thrown at him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant also takes issue with the prosecution's argument asserting it \"would be hard to imagine\" Smith shooting the victim because of her size. The jury had the opportunity to observe Smith's physical characteristics when she testified.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4730916\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/320/179/#p199\">\n    320 N.C. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=358%20S.E.2d%201\">\n    358 S.E.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 (discussing how \"evidence is not only what [jurors] hear on the stand but what they witness in the courtroom.\"),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600992,599913,599204,599758\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/970/\">\n    484 U.S. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20S.%20Ct.%20467\">\n    108 S.Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20406\">\n    98 L.Ed.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). The jury also heard testimony from Dr. John Butts, the State Medical Examiner, which confirmed the wounds traveled in such a manner that one could reasonably infer the shotgun pellets traveled slightly downward. Because the jury could see Smith's height, and could infer the pellets from the shotgun blast to the back traveled in a downward motion, it is a reasonable inference that it is unlikely Smith inflicted the wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant posits no evidence existed in the record tending to show the victim fired a firearm during the altercation. However, Smith testified she heard Gailey fire his handgun multiple times. Likewise, the crime scene technician testified a spent casing remained in Gailey's .45 caliber handgun. The prosecution needed to present no further evidence on this point in order to support a reasonable inference that Gailey fired his handgun during the time frame surrounding the murder. Similarly, we find it unnecessary for the State to present expert testimony on exactly what it means for a spent casing to be found inside a semiautomatic .45 caliber handgun, as it is a reasonable inference the handgun simply jammed. Therefore, the assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PENALTY PHASE ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant claims the prosecution abused its discretion by proceeding capitally in this case after enactment of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-2004(a) (2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We note first that defendant did not make this argument at trial, and we generally will not consider a theory on appeal that differs from the constitutional theory argued at the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Benson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2566216\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/323/318/#p321\">\n    323 N.C. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321-22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20S.E.2d%20517\">\n    372 S.E.2d 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (1988). Nonetheless, defendant's argument before this Court lacks merit. Defendant claims because the prosecution decided to proceed capitally, based in large part upon the testimony of two accomplices, it abused the discretion granted by section 15A-2004(a). As prosecutors have often realized, \"to try the devil, you have to go to hell to get your witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    See e.g., State v.

In doing so, defendant left the victim totally incapacitated, guaranteeing he would be unable to seek medical assistance or defend himself.

Defendant argues because he did not take the nearly $2,000 the victim had in his possession, the murder could not have been for pecuniary gain. However, considering the victim had a firearm, which he tried to fire at least once, and, according to eyewitness testimony, was still conscious, the jury could have reasonably believed defendant did not take the money because of fear of his victim. We find submission of the pecuniary gain circumstance was supported by substantial evidence, and therefore overrule defendant's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant also argues submission of the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstance violated the bar against double jeopardy because the jury did not find defendant guilty under the felony murder rule, and both the felony murder allegation and pecuniary gain aggravator were based on the same evidence. Thus, according to defendant, as the jury did not return a verdict of guilty on a theory of felony murder, the trial court was prohibited from submitting pecuniary gain as an aggravating circumstance.

Contrary to the instructions given it by the trial court, the jury did not mark anything on the verdict form concerning felony murder under either a robbery with a dangerous weapon or attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon theory; however, the jury did find defendant guilty of first-degree murder on a theory of malice, premeditation, and deliberation.

Additionally, the United States deposited a reservation to the ICCPR stating, \"[t]he United States reserves the right, subject to its Constitutional constraints, to impose capital punishment on any person (other than a pregnant woman) duly convicted under existing or future laws permitting the imposition of capital punishment....\" S.Rep. No. 103-35, at 8 (1993). We decline to overrule our prior law on this issue.
