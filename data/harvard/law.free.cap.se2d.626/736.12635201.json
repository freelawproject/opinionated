For the reasons stated herein, we grant a new trial as to Lopez, but find no error as to Sanchez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence tends to show that on 15 September 2003, an employee of Overnite Trucking (\"Overnite\"), a freight company, contacted Detective J.M. Ferrell (\"Detective Ferrell\"), a High Point police detective and drug enforcement agent, regarding suspicious freight that had arrived. Detective Ferrell went to Overnite's loading docks and investigated the package. The package, a small refrigerator, had been shipped from a location in California near the Mexican border. Detective Ferrell testified that the package appeared suspicious because the shipping location was known as a high narcotics area, an unusually high shipping cost was listed on the label, and the package had been dropped off for shipping rather than picked up at a verifiable address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Overnite granted Detective Ferrell permission to remove the box to perform a narcotics detection dog sniff. The dog alerted to the package, indicating that there were narcotics in the container. A search warrant was obtained. When searched, the package revealed a small refrigerator containing two bundles packaged in a manner that suggested they contained narcotics. A controlled delivery to the shipping address was arranged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The package was delivered to 7654 Jackson School Road, Brown Summit, North Carolina. Detective Ferrell posed as a trucking company worker and delivered the package to Lopez, the addressee on the carton. Lopez paid Detective Ferrell for the delivery after it was placed in the living room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Approximately ten minutes after the delivery was complete, law enforcement officers executed a previously obtained search warrant. Along with other co-defendants, Lopez and Sanchez were standing outside the house near a vehicle with a hidden compartment, and were handcuffed and taken into the house. The officers discovered that the shipping carton had been opened, the small refrigerator removed, and the enclosed bundles laid on top of the refrigerator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The refrigerator and bundles were dusted for latent prints. Prints were found on both the right and left sides of the refrigerator. An analysis of the prints showed that those taken from the left side of the refrigerator matched Lopez's prints, and the prints from the right side of the refrigerator matched Sanchez's prints. An examination of the bundles revealed a heroin mixture weighing 1,985 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lopez testified at trial that he did not know the refrigerator contained heroin, and that he had been hired by a man named \"Eric\" to check on the house at 7654 Jackson School Road and receive the appliance delivery. Lopez stated that he had received a delivery at that address for \"Eric\" on a previous occasion. Lopez stated that he did not open the box or refrigerator, and did not see the heroin until it was presented as evidence at trial. Sanchez did not testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury found both Lopez and Sanchez guilty of trafficking by possessing more than twenty-eight grams of heroin and conspiracy to traffic by possessing more than twenty-eight grams of heroin. Lopez and Sanchez were each sentenced to consecutive sentences of 225 to 279 months respectively. Lopez and Sanchez appeal together from their respective judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lopez and Sanchez first contend the trial court erred in denying their motions to dismiss all charges for insufficient evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"`Upon defendant's motion for dismissal, the question for the Court is whether there is substantial evidence (1) of each essential element of the offense charged, or of a lesser offense included therein, and (2) of defendant's being the perpetrator of such offense. If so, the motion is properly denied.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prior to the entry of the police, the evidence shows that Lopez and Sanchez removed the packaging from the refrigerator, and that its contents, the packaged heroin, were emptied\n   onto the top of the refrigerator. Lopez and Sanchez then exited the house to stand with two other men near Lopez's vehicle, which contained a hidden compartment. Although neither Lopez nor Sanchez had exclusive control of the premises, when taken in the light most favorable to the State, sufficient other incriminating circumstances were shown to provide evidence of knowledge and constructive possession sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sanchez next contends the trial court committed plain error in omitting an element in its jury instruction for the charge of conspiracy. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We first note that Sanchez did not object to the jury instructions at trial, and therefore failed to preserve this issue for review. N.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(2). Sanchez requests, however, that the Court review this issue for plain error. \"[P]lain error ... is error `so fundamental as to amount to a miscarriage of justice or which probably resulted in the jury reaching a different verdict than it otherwise would have reached.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Parker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"132292\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/350/411/#p427\">\n    350 N.C. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=516%20S.E.2d%20106\">\n    516 S.E.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (1999) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, Sanchez asserts that the trial court failed to name the crime alleged to be the object of the conspiracy. However a review of the jury instructions reveals that the trial court specifically instructed the jury that in order to find Sanchez guilty of conspiracy, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \"the agreement was to commit the offense of trafficking in a controlled substance of more than twenty-eight grams of heroin.\" As the trial court specifically named the crimes alleged to be the object of the conspiracy, we find this assignment of error to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Lopez next contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it must find Lopez knew he possessed heroin in order to convict him of trafficking. Sanchez contends that the trial court committed plain error in failing to give the same instruction. Although we agree the failure to give the instruction requested by Lopez was error entitling him to a new trial, with respect to Sanchez, we do not find that the failure to give the instruction rises to the level of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The case of\n   <em>\n    State v.
