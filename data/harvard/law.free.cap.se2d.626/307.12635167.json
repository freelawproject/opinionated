Defendant argues primarily on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of burglary and breaking or entering because the child victim consented to his nighttime entries into her parents' house. Defendant also makes a related argument pertaining to the jury instructions. Because the State presented evidence that defendant could not have reasonably believed that the child victim, a 13-year-old, had authority to consent to defendant's entry into her parents' home for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse with her and because the trial court properly instructed the jury on this issue, we find no error. Although we also hold that defendant's other contentions on appeal are without merit, we remand this case for the correction of certain clerical errors detailed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show the following. In September 2003, defendant, age 45, began an Internet correspondence with the victim, D.N.K., age 13. D.N.K.'s online username, at the time, was \"I'masexygirl.\" Defendant initiated the correspondence by sending D.N.K. a message saying: \"A sexy girl can make men do unbelievable things.\" When defendant told D.N.K. that he was 45 years old, she informed him that he was too old to have a relationship with her, but that they could still be friends. Later, she told him that she was 13 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The two continued to correspond over the Internet for about a month. During the course of their conversations, defendant asked D.N.K. if she was a virgin, and she replied that she was. Defendant told her that he wanted to have sex with her and that, because he was older and more experienced, he knew \"how to be gentle and easy so that you can be fulfilled as a woman and not be hurt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant told D.N.K. that he wanted to see her, and encouraged her to sneak out of her parents' house to meet him. When D.N.K. refused to do so, the two made plans for defendant to come to D.N.K.'s house on Tuesday, 30 September 2003, between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. D.N.K. gave defendant her home address and supplied him with a floor plan of her house. Defendant promised that he would bring some Cherry Coke mixed with alcohol to help D.N.K. \"relax.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the designated evening, defendant arrived at D.N.K.'s house wearing a camouflage shirt, pants, and hat, with a camouflage net over his face. As previously arranged, he signaled D.N.K. with a red penlight through the basement window of her house. When she saw the light, D.N.K. opened the basement door for defendant. After defendant entered the house, the two began hugging and kissing, and D.N.K. invited defendant to go up to her bedroom. Defendant instructed D.N.K. to go upstairs, close her bedroom door, turn her bedroom lights off, and open her window. After D.N.K. did so,\n   defendant climbed through the bedroom window, handed her two bottles of Cherry Coke mixed with alcohol, and hid in D.N.K.'s closet. Once D.N.K. was sure her parents had gone to bed, defendant got into D.N.K.'s bed with her, performed oral sex on her, and engaged in sexual intercourse. Defendant left the house around 4:30 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At approximately 11:00 p.m., on 2 October 2003, defendant again arrived at D.N.K.'s house, signaled her with the penlight, entered her bedroom by climbing through her window, gave her alcohol mixed with Coke, hid in her closet until her parents went to sleep, and then had intercourse with her and performed oral sex on her. He left before D.N.K. awoke in the morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 8 October 2003, defendant went to a football game at D.N.K.'s middle school. He took her to a fast food restaurant and then dropped her off at the school. Later that night, at around 8:00 p.m., defendant went to D.N.K.'s home, signaled her with the penlight, and entered through her bedroom window. He and D.N.K. both hid in her bedroom closet, where they had intercourse and then fell asleep. While they were asleep in the closet, D.N.K.'s mother entered the bedroom. Although D.N.K. was still asleep, defendant awakened and quickly pulled his legs and feet into the closet, so that D.N.K.'s mother did not see him. Later, after D.N.K.'s parents had gone to sleep, defendant and D.N.K. had intercourse in her bed, and defendant left at about 4:30 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The next day, defendant e-mailed D.N.K. and told her that her mother had almost caught them. He said he wanted to end the relationship, explaining that he was too old for her, that \"he could spend 20 years in prison for statutory rape if he got caught,\" and that \"we cannot be sneaking around the next four years till you are of age.\" The same day, D.N.K.'s parents learned about D.N.K.'s relationship with defendant and called the police. In two separate statements to the police, defendant admitted that he had entered D.N.K.'s house three times while her parents were at home and that he had had sexual intercourse with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted, with respect to the events of 30 September 2003, of first degree burglary, indecent liberties with a child, statutory sexual offense against a person 13, 14, or 15 years old, and statutory rape of a person 13, 14, or 15 years old. As for the events of 2 and 8 October 2003, he was convicted of two counts of felonious breaking or entering and two counts of statutory rape of a person 13, 14, or 15 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court sentenced defendant to a total of four consecutive sentences of 240 to 297 months, based on his convictions for burglary, rape, and sexual offense. He also received a suspended sentence of 16 to 20 months for his indecent liberties conviction and suspended sentences of 6 to 8 months for each of his breaking or entering convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant argues on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motions to dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence as to the burglary and felonious breaking or entering charges. In ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss, the trial court must determine whether the State has presented substantial evidence (1) of each essential element of the offense and (2) of the defendant's being the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    State v.

D.N.K., a minor \"inmate\" of the house, opened the basement door to defendant as they had pre-arranged, and then, following his instructions, opened her bedroom window for him. Defendant committed a constructive breaking since the window and door were only ajar because defendant induced D.N.K. to open them, and, as we have discussed, defendant's behavior showed that he knew D.N.K. lacked authority to consent to defendant's entry.

It sounds to me as if the question you're asking is whether or not an occupant of the dwelling would be an owner or tenant for purposes of these instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   THE FOREPERSON: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: That is, a person having authority to consent to the entry by another person. And in that regard, I instruct you that occupants in the dwelling do not always have authority to consent to entry by others. Although certainly any occupant of the dwelling may under certain circumstances have consent - or have authority to consent to the entry of the dwelling by others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although one may consent to entry by another into an occupied dwelling, that consent is not a valid consent unless there was authority to grant that consent. It is no defense to a burglary charge if a defendant is given consent to enter by one not having authority to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Now, in determining whether or not this defendant had consent of an owner or tenant to enter into the home of [D.N.K.'s father], if you find that he did enter into the home, it would be up to you, as jurors, to determine, based on all of the circumstances as they existed at the time, whether or not that person had authority to grant that consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    For example, you should consider the time of entry, the purpose of the entry, and the reasonableness of the belief, if any, of the defendant that any person consenting to his entry had authority to grant that consent.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Defendant argues that the trial judge's answer to the question focused on whether the person allowing entry actually had authority to consent, without properly taking into account the importance of defendant's perception of whether that person had such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Our standard of review in cases involving jury instructions is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This Court reviews [a trial court's] instructions [to the jury] contextually and in [their] entirety. The charge will be held to be sufficient if it presents the law of the case in such manner as to leave no reasonable cause to believe the jury was misled or misinformed.... Under such a standard of review, it is not enough for the appealing party to show that error occurred in the jury instructions; rather, it must be demonstrated that such error was likely, in light of the entire charge, to mislead the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Evid. 402, 403, and 404(b) to the trial court's admission of photographs removed from his computer, showing children engaged in sexual acts or posed in sexual positions. We need not reach the merits of these issues because, even if we assume that the trial court erred in admitting the photographs, defendant has failed to demonstrate prejudice warranting a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In order to be entitled to a new trial, defendant must show that there is a reasonable possibility that, had the evidence not been admitted, a different result would have been reached at his trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(a) (2005) (defining prejudicial error and placing the burden on defendant to make a showing of such error). Here, defendant twice confessed to the police that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with D.N.K. on three occasions in her parents' house. Moreover,\n   the e-mail correspondence and defendant's appearance at D.N.K.'s middle school leave little doubt that defendant knew D.N.K.'s age. Finally, he made great efforts to conceal himself from D.N.K.'s parents and told D.N.K. that if he was caught with her, he could spend 20 years in jail. We can perceive no possibility that the jury would have acquitted defendant absent the admission of the photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant's final argument pertains to the trial court's failure to find any mitigating factors during defendant's sentencing hearing.
