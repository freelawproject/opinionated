Because the 30-day filing requirement set forth in Code \u00a7 15.2-2314 is not an aspect of the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal, the County's failure to timely file its petition for a writ of certiorari cannot be raised for the first time before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal also involves the interpretation of a 1941 zoning ordinance and whether a garage apartment built over 50 years ago\n   presently qualifies as a lawful nonconforming use. Because the relevant zoning ordinance permitted only one principal dwelling on a single lot, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Donald J. and Jaki S. McCarthy (the McCarthys) own approximately 1.475 acres of real estate located in Fairfax County. The property is currently situated in a residential zoning district known as R-1, meaning that there cannot be more than one dwelling unit on any one lot nor can \"a dwelling unit be located on the same lot with any other principal building.\" Fairfax County Zoning Ordinance (Zoning Ordinance) \u00a7 2.501. The property is developed with a single-family dwelling, built in 1945, and a two-story detached garage that contains an apartment on the second floor. The garage apartment was constructed in 1950.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 5, 2004, a zoning inspector informed the McCarthys that the existence of the garage apartment violated Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 2.501.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The McCarthys appealed the violation notice to the BZA. They claimed that the garage apartment was a qualified nonconforming use on the basis that it was lawfully established under the 1941 Fairfax County Zoning Ordinance (1941 Ordinance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1941, the subject property was zoned as agricultural. In the \"Agricultural District,\" permitted uses included any use that was allowed in the \"Rural Residence District.\" 1941 Ordinance \u00a7 III(A)(2). Permitted uses in the Rural Residence District included a \"[s]ingle family detached dwelling\" and a \"[p]rivate garage which shall not be used to house more than two vehicles in excess of those used by the residents of the premises on which the garage is located.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 IV(A)(1), IV(A)(7). The term \"single-family dwelling\" was defined as \"[a] dwelling constructed to accommodate only one family, and containing only one housekeeping unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 I(6). The 1941 Ordinance defined the term \"garage\" as \"[a] building used for the housing or storing of motor driven vehicles\" and listed it as an example of an \"accessory building\" in the definition provided for that term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 I(1), I(9). No structure in the agricultural district could be erected \"on a lot or building site containing an area of less than one-half ... acre.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 III(C)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At a public hearing before the BZA held on May 25, 2004, the McCarthys argued that there was nothing in the 1941 Ordinance prohibiting \"a property from having two dwelling units.\" They presented testimony from the daughter of the original owner of the subject property. She stated that the \"apartment was built with the specific intended use as a dwelling.... The apartment was built in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance in effect at that time. It has been continually operated as a rental apartment ever since.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After hearing the evidence, the BZA agreed with the McCarthys and voted to overturn the decision of the Zoning Administrator. One member of the BZA noted that the language in the 1941 Ordinance was ambiguous. Another member stated, \"it sounds to me like, as long you [sic] had enough room, a half-acre per structure, you could still do a structure on something other than a lot.\" Since the 1941 Ordinance specifically said \"one or more,\" the member reasoned that the second dwelling would have been allowed. The perceived ambiguity in the 1941 Ordinance, coupled with the fact that the garage apartment had been continually used since it was built, led the BZA to find in favor of the McCarthys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a letter to the McCarthys, the BZA confirmed its May 25, 2004 action but advised the McCarthys that the date of the BZA's final decision was June 2, 2004. On July 1, 2004, the County petitioned the circuit court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.2-2314, for a writ of certiorari to review the BZA's decision. The circuit court granted the writ and ordered the BZA \"to make a verified return of its record.\" The circuit court subsequently heard the appeal and affirmed the decision of the BZA. The court concluded that the BZA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   had not \"applied erroneous principles of law [or] that its decision was plainly wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The County appealed from the circuit court's judgment to this Court. In the opening brief, the County admits that, under the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    West Lewinsville Heights Ass'n v. Board of Supervisors,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Va.%20259\">\n    270 Va. 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633853\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/618/311/\">\n    618 S.E.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), its petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of the BZA's final decision was not timely filed. The County, however, argues the timeliness of the petition for a writ of certiorari cannot be raised for the first time before this Court. The BZA did not participate in the proceedings before the circuit court, nor did the McCarthys question the timeliness of the petition in the circuit court. The BZA, however, entered an appearance in this Court to address the issue of timely filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We will first address the issue concerning the timeliness of the County's petition for a writ of certiorari and whether that issue can be raised for the first time in this Court. We will then consider the merits of the County's assignments of error challenging the decision of the circuit court finding that the McCarthys' garage apartment is a lawful nonconforming use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Timeliness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The provisions of Code \u00a7 15.2-2314 govern appeals from a final decision of a board of zoning appeals to a circuit court. In pertinent part, the statute states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning appeals, or any aggrieved ... department, board or bureau of the locality, may file with the clerk of the circuit court for the county or city a petition specifying the grounds on which aggrieved within 30 days after the final decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Code \u00a7 15.2-2314. Thus, under the terms set forth by the General Assembly, the County had 30 days from the BZA's final decision to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even though the County admits that it did not file its petition within that 30 days, the question that remains is whether the timeliness of the petition for a writ of certiorari can be questioned for the first time before this Court. Stated differently, is the failure to file the petition within the required 30-day period a defect in the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction and therefore a claim not capable of being waived?\n   <em>\n    See Earley v. Landsidle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875354\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/257/365/#p371\">\n    257 Va. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=514%20S.E.2d%20153\">\n    514 S.E.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156 (1999) (\"[t]he lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time during a proceeding,\" including on appeal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have not previously determined the nature of the 30-day period specified in Code \u00a7 15.2-2314 for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the final decision of a board of zoning appeals. The County, however, asserts that we decided this issue in\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County v.

We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There, the question was \"whether the successful applicant before the board of zoning appeals must be made a party to the certiorari proceeding within the thirty-day period prescribed by\" former Code \u00a7 15.1-497 (now Code \u00a7 15.2-2314).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 237,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=302%20S.E.2d%2019\">\n    302 S.E.2d at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that, because the statute required\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   only that an aggrieved person file a petition for certiorari within the prescribed thirty-day period and that the petition specify the grounds upon which the petitioner is aggrieved .... no action other than the filing of a proper petition within the prescribed period [was] necessary to complete the institution of the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 238,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=302%20S.E.2d%2019\">\n    302 S.E.2d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, in order to prevail, the McCarthys had to show that the 1941 Ordinance permitted, in the Agricultural District, multiple single-family dwellings on a lot. In order to determine if the garage apartment was permitted on the subject property under the 1941 Ordinance, the definition of the term \"lot\" must be examined:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A piece or parcel of land abutting on a street whose area, in addition to the parts thereof occupied or which may hereafter be occupied by a building and buildings accessory thereto, is sufficient to furnish the yards, and minimum area required for compliance with this ordinance. The word lot shall include building site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1941 Ordinance \u00a7 I(13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We agree with the County's argument that, under the definition of the term \"lot\" in the 1941 Ordinance, only one principal dwelling was permitted on a single lot. The critical portion of the definition is the clause \"in addition to the parts thereof occupied or which may ... be occupied by\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   building and buildings accessory thereto.\" (Emphasis added.) This clause limited the number of principal buildings permitted on a single lot to one building but permitted more than one accessory building. Thus, a lot consisted of a piece of land abutting on a street whose area, in addition to the area occupied by\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   building and accessory buildings, met the yards and minimum area requirements of the 1941 Ordinance. Although the term \"building site\" is not defined in the 1941 Ordinance, the definition of the term \"lot\" specifically included a building site. The McCarthys overlook this portion of the definition in their argument that the term \"building site\" is separate and distinct from the term \"lot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We agree with the McCarthys' argument that the use of the word \"parts\" in the definition meant that lots could have different parts or areas occupied by buildings. That conclusion, however, does not change the clear language of the 1941 Ordinance permitting only one principal building on a lot. The word \"parts\" merely referenced the fact that, if a lot had a principal building and one or more accessory buildings, \"parts,\" as opposed to a \"part,\" of the lot would be occupied by buildings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This interpretation of the 1941 Ordinance is consistent with the interpretation given to it by officials charged with its enforcement. At the BZA hearing, it was pointed out that such officials had \"consistently allowed one dwelling unit per lot or building site under the Ordinance since [19]41.\" Furthermore, a member of the BZA who had worked in Fairfax County under the 1941 Ordinance stated, \"I know of no circumstance at all where legally two structures, residential, two units, residential units, were permitted on one lot.\" \"A consistent administrative construction of an ordinance by the officials charges with its enforcement is entitled to great weight.\"\n   <em>\n    Masterson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2096639\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/233/37/#p47\">\n    233 Va. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=353%20S.E.2d%20727\">\n    353 S.E.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord Board of Supervisors v.

Since the County's failure to timely file its petition for a writ of certiorari was first raised in this Court, the issue is waived and we will not address it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Furthermore, since the 1941 Ordinance permitted only one principal dwelling on a lot, the County has overcome the presumption of correctness afforded the BZA's final decision. The BZA's decision that the garage apartment is a lawful nonconforming use was \"plainly wrong and in violation of the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance.\"\n   <em>\n    Masterson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2096639\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/233/37/#p47\">\n    233 Va. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=353%20S.E.2d%20727\">\n    353 S.E.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of the BZA's expressed concern about displacing the garage apartment after approximately 54 years of use.
