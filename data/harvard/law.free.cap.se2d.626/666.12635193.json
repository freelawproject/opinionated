Plaintiffs' claims under the State Tort Claims Act arose out of a fire on 3 May 2002 at the Mitchell County jail. The fire claimed the lives of inmates Jason Jack Boston, Mark Halen Thomas, Jesse Allen Davis, and Danny Mark Johnson and seriously injured inmate O.M. Ledford, Jr. Plaintiffs contend that the inspector for DHHS was negligent in his inspection of the Mitchell County jail and that DHHS failed to properly train the inspector to perform his duties as an inspector of county jails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Our Supreme Court has held that the public duty doctrine applies \"`to state agencies required by statute to conduct inspections\n   <em>\n    for the public's general protection\n   </em>\n   '\"\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

Although DHHS acknowledges that the General Assembly has placed a duty on DHHS to perform inspections of local detention facilities to ensure the health and welfare of prisoners in such facilities, it argues that these inspections \"benefit the public\" because \"[t]he inmates addressed in these statutes are members of the public....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   If we were to accept this facile argument, we would effectively eviscerate the Tort Claims Act, since State agencies would be able to argue that any duty that they owed was necessarily to a member of the public since all residents of North Carolina are members of the public. This Court must, however, be ever vigilant not to act as a super-legislature that imposes its notion of public policy in the face of statutory determinations otherwise. It is for the General Assembly, and not judges, to decide questions of public policy regarding how and when the State may be sued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For 100 years, North Carolina's courts have recognized that governments owe a private duty to inmates to maintain their health and safety. In connection with that duty, our General Assembly has specifically provided that DHHS has the duty to inspect local detention facilities, including jails, in order to ensure the protection of jail inmates. Since this duty is for the benefit of the inmates and not for the general public, the public duty doctrine does not apply. We, therefore, hold that the Industrial Commission properly denied DHHS' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the fire at the Mitchell County jail, plaintiffs filed separate affidavits of claim in the Industrial Commission pursuant to the Tort Claims Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. Art. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 143-291\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2005). The claims of all five plaintiffs were consolidated before the Industrial Commission on 27 August 2003. Because this appeal is before us on DHHS' motion to dismiss, we treat the factual allegations in plaintiffs' affidavits of claim as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Hunt v. N.C.

A law review commentator has cogently explained the development of the general rule:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The public duty doctrine provides that, absent a special relationship between the governmental entity and the injured individual, the governmental entity will not be liable for injury to an individual where liability is alleged on the ground that the governmental entity owes a duty to the public in general. The doctrine has been commonly described by the oxymoron, \"duty to all, duty to none.\" ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the historic tort barrier of governmental immunity crumbled and states provided waiver mechanisms, state courts resurrected the [public duty doctrine] to provide limits to governmental tort liability when their legislatures had not done so. Thus, state courts embraced the public duty doctrine to confine liability to specific types of governmental actions, namely those not undertaken for the public in general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Frank Swindell, Note,\n   <em>\n    Municipal Liability for Negligent Inspections in Sinning v.

DHHS requires that following the inspection, the inspector \"shall forward a copy of the inspection report to the Secretary [of DHHS] within ten days after the inspection if there are findings of noncompliance\" with any of certain specified standards, including the standards for \"Fire Safety.\" 10A N.C.A.C. 14J.1302(b)(2) (2003).

Further, in arguing that the statutes establish no duty requiring that DHHS correct any jail conditions, the dissent disregards the nature of plaintiffs' claim. Plaintiffs allege a negligent inspection of the jail and not a negligent failure to correct the conditions. There is no need to decide whether the public duty doctrine or any other theory would preclude liability for a failure to correct the conditions in the Mitchell County jail. Although not addressed by the dissent, the sole pertinent question under\n   <em>\n    Stone, Hunt,\n   </em>\n   and the subsequent Supreme Court decisions for such a negligent inspection claim is the purpose of the duty to inspect: whether it was for the protection of the general public or specific individuals. The General Assembly was specific in providing that the purpose of the inspection is to protect the inmates from harm, a purpose further reflected in DHHS' regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   DHHS' suggestion that the statutes and regulations necessarily are for the benefit of the public because \"[t]he inmates addressed in these statutes are members of the public\" deserves little comment.

In 1992, the Supreme Court noted that \"North Carolina courts and lawmakers have long recognized the state's duty to provide medical care to prisoners\" and pointed out that the \"legislature has codified this duty in a statute\" that required the Department of Corrections to prescribe standards for health services to prisoners.\n   <em>\n    Medley v.

As support for an additional common-law duty to inmates, the Court quoted from a 1926 decision relating to jail inmates: \"`The prisoner by his arrest is deprived of his liberty for the protection of the public; it is but just that the public be required to care for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.'\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20S.E.2d%20654\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20S.E.2d%20654\">\n    412 S.E.2d at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spicer v.

Each of the examples given by the dissent - such as a restaurant patron, a patient, or a legal client - involves the general public. They do not involve the unique situation faced by inmates and the express assumption by the State of a duty to those inmates. Indeed, if we were to embrace the view of the dissents in this case and in\n   <em>\n    Myers,\n   </em>\n   it is difficult to identify any negligence claim asserted against the State that would fall outside the scope of the public duty doctrine. The result would be to judicially amend the State Tort Claims Act to require all plaintiffs to prove either a special relationship or a special duty as an element of their claim under the Tort Claims Act. To do so - based on a judicial\n   assessment of the policy implications for the State and its taxpayers - would be to sit as a super-legislature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Even if we could conclude that the statutes and regulations imposed a duty to inspect for the benefit of the public, as required by\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunt,\n   </em>\n   we would still hold that plaintiffs fall within the \"special relationship\" exception to the public duty doctrine.

Thus, neither case disputed the existence of a \"special relationship\" between jail inmates and DHHS, but rather only addressed the issue of causation under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The issue of causation is not, however, before this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   DHHS and the dissent have cited no cases suggesting in any manner that causation is relevant to a determination of the applicability of the public duty doctrine.

Accordingly, we affirm the Industrial Commission's denial of DHHS' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Judge McGEE concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Judge TYSON concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    While the inspections are also expected to assess the security of the jails - relating to the public's protection - there is no allegation in this case that DHHS was in any way negligent with respect to security.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    We, in any event, disagree with the dissent's construction of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-223 (2005), which provides that \"if the Secretary determines that conditions in the facility jeopardize the safe custody, safety, health, or welfare of persons confined in the facility, the Secretary may order corrective action or close the facility....\" The dissent suggests that this language means that the Secretary is not required to act. When, however, the entire statute - and not just this phrase - is considered, the plain language of the statute establishes that the Secretary is required to take action, but may choose between ordering corrective action or closing the facility. The Secretary \"shall\" give notice of his determination (including \"the inspector's report\") to the local governing body, each local official responsible for the facility, and the senior resident superior court judge for the superior court district in which the facility is located. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-223(1). The governing body, if it does not initiate corrective action or close the facility, may request a contested case hearing to address (1) whether the facility meets the minimum standards, (2) whether the conditions in the facility jeopardize the safe custody, safety, health, or welfare of the inmates, and (3) the appropriate corrective action to be taken and a reasonable time to complete the action. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-223(3). On appeal to the superior court, \"[t]he issue before the court shall be whether the facility continues to jeopardize the safe custody, safety, health, or welfare of persons confined therein.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-223(6). Thus, the statute relied upon by the dissent underscores that the duty of inspection is for the benefit of the specific individuals confined in the jail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3.\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    These cases include\n    <em>\n     Simmons v.

Also, under this statute, the State \"should provide services to local governments to help improve the quality of administration and local confinement facilities. These services should include inspection, consultation, technical assistance, and other appropriate services.\" This language reinforces the legislative intent that defendant's role in providing statewide minimum standards and bi-annual inspections of local jails is for the benefit of the public and not for these individual claimants. This statute clearly does not impose either the categorical or derivative responsibility on the State to ensure county jail facilities comply with certain regulations or to create any liability to any individual for its failure to do so.

Under the statute, the local governing body, and not the State, is charged with the duty to bring the facility into conformity with and maintain the standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   This statute also demonstrates the Legislature's intent that the State's role in county jails is limited to inspect and report on county correctional facilities to the county governing authorities for the benefit of the public generally.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=499%20S.E.2d%20747\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Further, N.C.
