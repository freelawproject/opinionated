(Riverwood) in 2001. Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, Edwards purchased 90% of the stock in Riverwood in exchange for which he agreed to pay BTI $800,000.00 in three payments. Edwards made the first payment of $250,000.00 at closing on 30 April 2001, and the remaining payments of $250,000.00 and $300,000.00 were to be secured by promissory notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After entering into the stock purchase agreement, Edwards claimed that prior to his purchase, BTI made inaccurate statements to him regarding the following as to Riverwood's: \"established\" sales force; general ledger trial balance; and general ledger reflecting ownership of certain equipment that was actually owned by third parties. Edwards raised his concerns with the chief operating officer of BTI, Daniel Timberlake (Timberlake). In response to Edwards' concerns, Timberlake wrote Edwards a letter dated 18 January 2002 that stated if Edwards made the second payment due under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the third payment of $300,000.00, originally \"due and payable on or before\" 15 February 2002, would be delayed indefinitely. Edwards did not respond to the 18 January 2002 letter. He did not make the second $250,000.00 payment, or the third $300,000.00 payment, or sign a new promissory note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As of October 2002, Edwards had paid a total of $5,250.00 in interest payments under the terms of the promissory note. However Edwards did not make further payments toward the principal balance owed despite BTI's demand to do so. On 2 July 2003, BTI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   filed a complaint alleging breach of the stock purchase agreement, default of promissory note, and misrepresentation. On 5 September 2003, Edwards filed an answer and counterclaims which included claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, securities fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of the stock purchase agreement and breach of a January 2002 agreement. BTI answered Edwards' counterclaims on 29 September 2003 and filed a motion to dismiss Edward's counterclaims. On 10 May 2004, the trial court heard BTI's motion to dismiss. Edwards's oral motion for leave to amend his counterclaims was denied in open court. In an order signed 17 May 2004, the trial court granted BTI's motion to dismiss Edward's counterclaims with prejudice for failure \"to state proper claims for which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\" Edwards subsequently filed a motion requesting the trial court to reconsider its denial of his motion to amend, which was also denied. Edwards appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal defendant raises two substantive issues whether the trial court erred by: (I) granting plaintiff's motion to dismiss defendant's counterclaims and (II) denying defendant's motion for leave to amend his counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a preliminary matter we must determine whether the appeal is from an interlocutory order and therefore is subject to dismissal. An order or judgment is interlocutory if it is made during the pendency of an action and does not dispose of the case but requires further action by the trial court in order to finally determine the entire controversy.\n   <em>\n    Cagle v.

Defendant contends the claims asserted by both parties involve identical\n   issues of fact and that defendant would be prejudiced if these factual issues are not heard by the same jury. Defendant argues he is entitled to an immediate appeal because the trial court's order exposes him to the possibility of inconsistent verdicts upon \"overlapping factual issues.\" After carefully reviewing the pleadings and the procedural development of this case, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although BTI's claims remain viable and therefore not a final determination of the rights of the parties, we hold defendant would be deprived of a substantial right if an immediate appeal is not allowed. Defendant shows that plaintiff's claims of breach of a stock purchase agreement, default on a promissory note and negligent misrepresentation and his counterclaims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, securities fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of a stock purchase agreement and breach of a January 2002 agreement involve identical issues of fact. Defendant's defense of fraud would be presented in plaintiff's trial on the breach of contract claim and defendant's trial on fraud in the inducement. Therefore, there exists the possibility of inconsistent verdicts resulting from the same factual issues. Accordingly, the trial court's dismissal of defendant's counterclaims affects a substantial right which would prejudice defendant if we did not hear this appeal. Therefore, we will reach the merits of defendant's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant first argues the trial court erred by granting plaintiff's motion to dismiss defendant's counterclaims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

In his counterclaim for negligent misrepresentation, Edwards pleads a legal conclusion that \"such misrepresentations were made negligently,\" that \"Timberlake, Inc. had a financial interest in such misrepresentations,\" that \"Edwards relied upon Timberlake, Inc.'s negligent misrepresentations,\" that \"such reliance was reasonable,\" and that \"Edwards has been damaged by Timberlake's negligent misrepresentations in an amount to be established at trial.\" However, Edwards failed to allege BTI or its \"representatives\" owed any duty to Edwards or breached any duty owed. Further, there was no allegation that the information provided was prepared without reasonable care, or that any supposed breach was a proximate cause of the injury. Edwards has failed to allege sufficient facts which, if taken as true would state a claim for negligent misrepresentation. We affirm the trial court's dismissal of Edwards' claim of misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Securities Fraud\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Edwards' counterclaim for securities fraud does not allege a specific violation of the North Carolina Securities Act (Act) other than a conclusory statement that \"the above-described conduct constitutes a violation of the North Carolina Securities Act, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 78A-1, et seq.\" From the face of the counterclaim, it is presumed Edwards intended to assign liability for a violation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 78A-8(2) and N.C.G.S. \u00a7 78A-56(a)(2) which imposes civil liability upon any person who:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Offers or sells a security by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (the purchaser not knowing of the untruth or omission), and who does not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the untruth or omission ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 78A-56 (a)(2) (2005). Defendant has not made any of the allegations required to sustain a claim for relief under the Act. Specifically, Edwards does not allege the stock he purchased was a \"security\" by virtue of the terms of the Act, nor is it specifically alleged that BTI sold such a security \"by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact,\" other than Edwards conclusory allegation that \"representatives\" of BTI provided him with false information. Edwards further fails to allege he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. Edwards merely offers conclusions of law and attempts to allege the elements of a claim for securities fraud only in general terms, but has not pled facts sufficient to state a claim for securities fraud.

Edwards' claim for relief is based on the alleged breach of Article 11, Section E of the Agreement, which sets forth certain representations and warranties of BTI in connection with Edwards' purchase of Riverwood stock. Article IX, section A of the Agreement sets forth a limitation on the survival of such representations and warranties as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Section A. - Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties of the Seller and the Company shall survive the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement for a period extending two (2) years from the Closing Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As the Agreement was executed on April 30, 2001, and Edwards does not allege that any notice whatsoever was provided to BTI within the prescribed two-year limitation period\n   of any breach or nonconformity of any representation or warranty, Edwards' claim is therefore barred by the express terms of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"A legal insufficiency may be due to an absence of law to support a claim of the sort made, absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim, or the disclosure of some fact which will necessarily defeat the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    State of Tennessee v.

As Edwards' claim for breach of the Agreement was filed in his counterclaim on 4 September 2003, it is more than 2 years after the parties initially entered into the Agreement (30 April 2001) and therefore, barred by an express limitation contained in the Agreement. Such an insurmountable bar to recovery on the claim requires that the claim be dismissed. \"A counterclaim is sufficient to withstand the motion [12(b)(6)] where no insurmountable bar to recovery on the claim appears on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Chrysler Credit Corp. v.

At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, counsel for BTI explicitly argued Edwards' alleged claim for breach of the Agreement was barred by the express terms of the Agreement. The trial court properly dismissed the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Breach of the 18 January 2002 \"Agreement\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In his final counterclaim, Edwards claims the letter sent by BTI to Edwards 18 January 2002 constitutes an \"agreement\" that BTI has allegedly breached by filing the underlying action. Edwards alleges that \"[he] and Timberlake, Inc. reached an agreement in January 2002 pursuant to which Timberlake, Inc. agreed to delay the payment on the $300,000 Note indefinitely. By filing this suit, Timberlake, Inc. has breached such agreement.\" The letter states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With respect to our final amount of $300,000 due in February, we are willing to extend the payment thereof indefinitely to allow you ample opportunity to grow the business. Additionally, if you are able to effectively merge all of your business interests into a single corporate organization, we would be willing to \"contribute\" our remaining 10% interest in Riverwood if that helps you clean up all of the structural and ownership issues you currently face. Please let me know if there is anything further you may need in this regard. Please let me know if the above is agreeable to you.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The 18 January 2002 correspondence was a unilateral offer made to Edwards. Edwards does not allege he accepted the offer, but characterizes the correspondence, standing alone, as an \"agreement\" between the parties. We find this letter falls short of an agreement because Edwards failed to accept the terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At the hearing on BTI's Motion, BTI's counsel explicitly argued the letter was, at most, merely an offer, that Edwards never alleged any consideration for the \"agreement.\" We agree. Here, Edwards has not established the existence of a valid contract or a meeting of the minds with respect to the January 2002 letter. The trial court properly granted plaintiff's motion to dismiss defendant's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant next argues the trial court erred by denying his motion for leave to amend his counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Denial of a motion to amend by the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Nationsbank of North Carolina, N.A. v.

The trial court entered its order denying the motion after \"having considered the pleadings, legal briefs and arguments of counsel.\" The transcript indicates that the trial court specifically reviewed Rule 15 in open court after hearing defense counsel's argument. Pursuant to Rule 15, Edwards would have been able to amend his counterclaim, without leave of court, at any point prior to the responsive pleading being filed. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 15. However, it was only after having been served plaintiff's responsive pleading and having notice of plaintiff's motion to dismiss, that Edwards moved orally to amend his pleadings at the hearing. Such an undue delay of time in making a motion to amend is a valid reason for denying such motion. On this record, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying Edwards' request for leave to amend his pleadings. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because plaintiff's motion to dismiss defendant's counterclaims was properly granted, and because defendant's motion for leave to amend was properly denied, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Judges McCULLOUGH and TYSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
