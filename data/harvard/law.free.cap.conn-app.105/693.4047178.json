The defendant claims that the court improperly allowed a special condition of probation to be added that was in violation of the terms of the plea agreement and in violation of his constitutional right to due process. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">In April, 2002, the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to injury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals of, children in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the same time, the defendant admitted violating the terms of probation that had been imposed for a 1997 conviction of risk of injury to children. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result of plea negotiations, the defendant was to serve four years incarceration for violating probation. For the charge of risk of injury to a child, he would receive a five year suspended sentence with five years of probation, to be served consecutively to the sentence on the violation of probation. Additionally, the state recommended the following special conditions of probation: substance abuse evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary, sex offender evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary, that the defendant stay away from United Methodist Church in Newtown and that he make no contact with the victim or the victim\u2019s family.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court sentenced the defendant to four years of incarceration for violating probation and five year s of incarceration for risk of injury to a child, execution of that sentence suspended after four years of incarceration. Thereafter, the defendant was to be placed on probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>for five years <em>\u201cwith the condition that [he] submit to any psychiatric or psychological evaluation that the department of adult probation deems appropriate and that [he] submit to any treatment that may be indicated as a result of that evaluation. </em>Further condition will be that [the defendant] submit to a substance abuse evaluation treatment and testing as is deemed appropriate by the [office] of adult probation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) All of the foregoing conditions were explicitly recited by the court. In addition, the court expressly acknowledged that the defendant would not have to comply with sex offender registration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The defendant was released from custody and began his probation on November 30, 2005. His probation officer, David Carter, initiated proceedings in December, 2005, to modify the conditions to include sex offender evaluation and treatment if necessary. On February 14, 2006, Carter formally filed a motion for modification of probation, and a hearing was held on May 22, 2006. The court granted the state\u2019s motion after concluding, in a memorandum of decision, that the modification of the conditions of probation was reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation and to the charge for which he had been convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">\u201cProbation is the product of statute. . . . Statutes authorizing probation, while setting parameters for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>doing so, have been very often construed to give the court broad discretion in imposing conditions.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 167, 540 A.2d 679 (1988).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cOn appeal, we review whether the trial court abused its statutory discretion in imposing a condition of probation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>33 Conn. App. 432, 447, 636 A.2d 852, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 906, 640 A.2d 117 (1994). \u201cIn reviewing the issue of discretion, we do so according it every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ... A defendant who seeks to reverse the exercise of judicial discretion assumes a heavy burden.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u201c[T]he puipose of probation is to provide a period of grace in order to aid the rehabilitation of a penitent offender; to take advantage of an opportunity for reformation which actual service of the suspended sentence might make less probable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 164.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>keeping with the continuing supervision and authority given [to] the court under the statute, the court could modify or enlarge the conditions whether any such condition had been imposed at the time of sentencing or otherwise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 169. \u201c[I]n determining whether a condition of probation [is proper] a reviewing court should evaluate the condition imposed under our Adult Probation Act in the following context: The conditions must be reasonably related to the purposes of the [Probation] Act. Consideration of three factors is required to determine whether a reasonable relationship exists: (1) the purposes sought to be served by probation; (2) the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers; and (3) the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly allowed a special condition of probation to be added that was in violation of the terms of the plea agreement and in violation of his constitutional right to due process. The state argues that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the condition of sex offender evaluation and treatment expressly was excluded from the terms of his probation. The state further maintains that the court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion because the modification reasonably was related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The record does not support the defendant\u2019s argument that sex offender evaluation and treatment specifically were excluded in the plea agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What is evident is that the defendant bargained for a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>that included a term of probation. \u201cIf he accepts the offer of probation, [the defendant] must accept all of the conditions. ... In accepting probation, the defendant accepted at the time of sentencing the possibility that the terms of his probation could be modified or enlarged in the future in accordance with the statutes governing probation.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Thorp, 57 Conn. App. 112, 121, 747 A.2d 537, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 913, 754 A.2d 162 (2000). Because the defendant accepted a sentence that included probation, modification of the terms of probation is not a violation of his constitutional rights, as long as the modified conditions reasonably relate to his rehabilitation and the preservation of the safety of the general public. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>240 Conn. 639, 647-49, 692 A.2d 1273 (1997). We therefore review the court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">At the hearing, Carter testified that he moved to modify the conditions on the basis of (1) guidelines adopted by the court support services division mandating that probationers with the defendant\u2019s profile participate in sex offender evaluation and treatment programs, (2) the defendant\u2019s convictions of risk of injury to children and (3) the findings of a sex offender evaluation undertaken at the request of the parole board.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That evaluation, dated October 3, 2003, classified the defendant\u2019s dangerousness rating as mild and his recidivism for commission of the same or similar offenses as high. The recommendation was that the defendant participate in sex offender treatment, accept full responsibility for his behavior and undergo a polygraph examination to determine the accuracy of his account of the underlying events.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Carter also testified that he had not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>arrangements for the defendant to begin psychological or psychiatric evaluations, as ordered by the court at sentencing, pending the outcome of his motion, because he wanted the defendant to be evaluated by \u201csomeone that had the professional expertise to make assessments on whether or not [the defendant] was a risk to reoffend as a sexual offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The defendant\u2019s trial attorney, Robert Lacobelle, testified that the defendant would not have agreed to sex offender evaluation and treatment as a condition of any plea and that the condition specifically was excluded from the plea agreement. When questioned by the court as to what would happen if the required psychological treatment indicated \u201csome sort of an underlying sexual deviancy\u201d and that the defendant needed to undergo sex offender treatment, Lacobelle vaguely suggested that \u201ca judge that had indicated that based on his evaluation, he wasn\u2019t getting sex offender treatment, wouldn\u2019t have imposed it.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The facts of the underlying risk of injury to a child conviction suggest that sex offender evaluation and treatment is a condition of probation that is reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s reformation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The office of adult probation is charged with encouraging and overseeing the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation and with protecting the general public. Without a sex offender evaluation, it is not known what, if any, services the defendant would need to help him avoid reoffending and what steps would be necessary to protect the public. Furthermore, the parties do not dispute that the defendant agreed to a condition of probation that required him to undergo psychological or psychiatric evaluation and any treatment deemed necessary. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in granting the state\u2019s motion because the condition comports with the purposes sought to be served by the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>probation and the legitimate purpose of law enforcement in rehabilitating him and in protecting the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-12\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.

The underlying case in this appeal dates back to December, 2001, when the defendant, while on probation for the 1997 case, approached a child in the parking lot of United Methodist Church in Newtown. On the basis of his conduct toward the child, the state charged him with risk of injury to a child and violation of probation, for which the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\"> Although the transcript of the defendant\u2019s plea canvass and sentencing discloses the court\u2019s express finding regarding sex offender registration, it is silent as to the issue of sex offender evaluation and treatment.

The\u2014if Your Honor looks at the\u2014the various subsections and what probation\u2014what conditions can be imposed under . . . whatever the probation statute is\u2014psychological evaluation is something different, at least in my mind, than sex offender treatment because they\u2019re specifically enumerated separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. It says psychological evaluation deemed appropriate, that [the defendant] submit to any treatment that may be indicated as a result of that evaluation. So, it\u2019s your understanding that if the evaluation came back saying he needs sex offender evaluation, that [the sentencing judge] wouldn\u2019t have said he\u2019s got to go to it?</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s what I said. . . .
