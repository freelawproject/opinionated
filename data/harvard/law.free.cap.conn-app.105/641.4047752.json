He claims that the court improperly denied (1) his motion to set aside the default and (2) his motion for appointment of counsel. Because we reverse the judgment on the basis of the defendant\u2019s first claim, we do not need to address the defendant\u2019s second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The following procedural history is relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The plaintiff, Timothy J. McMahon, filed his complaint on October 25, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record discloses that on January 7, 2005, the plaintiff filed a motion for default against the defendant for his failure to plead in response to that complaint. On January 10, 2005, the motion was granted. The record thereafter discloses that the defendant filed his answer entitled \u201c[Plea] in Response to the Plaintiffs Complaint\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>on January 13, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgment on that default was rendered on September 8, 2006, in the amount of $450,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 17-32 provides: \u201c(a) Where a defendant is in default for failure to plead pursuant to Section 10-8, the plaintiff may file a written motion for default which shall be acted on by the clerk upon filing, without placement on the short calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\u201c(b) If a party who has been defaulted under this section files an answer before a judgment after default has been rendered by the judicial authority, the clerk shall set aside the default. If a claim for a hearing in damages or a motion for judgment has been filed the default may be set aside only by the judicial authority. A claim for a hearing in damages or motion for judgment shall not be filed before the expiration of fifteen days from the date of notice of issuance of the default under this subsection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The defendant\u2019s answer was filed on January 13,2005, which was three days after the default was granted by the deputy chief clerk of the court and several months before the judgment was rendered on September 8, 2006. The court should have set aside the default pursuant to \u00a7 17-32 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\"> The plaintiff served a complaint against the defendant seeking damages for personal injuries resulting from a physical altercation between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\"> On January 13, 2005, the defendant also filed a \u201cMotion to Deny Default for Failure to Plead,\u201d which the court, <em>Gallagher, J., </em>dismissed as moot on February 8, 2005, because the motion for default had been granted already. The pleading, as filed by the defendant, is designated in the court\u2019s docketing statement as a \u201cmotion to open default.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
