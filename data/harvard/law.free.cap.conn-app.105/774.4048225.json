The trial court faulted the attorney for persisting in his claim that the attorney-client privilege had not been waived at the criminal trial and for calling for a grand jury investigation without sufficient evidence to support a good faith belief of criminal misconduct by a governmental entity. Although we agree with the court\u2019s finding that the attorney violated rules 3.1 and 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, we do not agree with its findings that he violated rules 1.2 and 8.4. Therefore we deny the writ in part and grant it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The plaintiff in error, John F. O\u2019Brien (plaintiff), an attorney, filed a writ of error on December 23, 2003, to challenge the finding of the trial court, <em>Mia\u00f1o, J., </em>that the plaintiff had violated rules 1.2, 3.1, 3.3 and 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, and to seek review of the sanctions imposed on him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court maintains that, after a hearing, it properly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the plaintiff had failed to counsel his client properly, had filed a motion for investigation without a good faith belief that a crime had been committed by a government entity, had misstated the law and had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The plaintiffs writ challenges both the court\u2019s underlying findings and the propriety of the sanctions imposed on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The record discloses the following relevant facts and procedural history. From June 25 to July 9, 2003, the plaintiff was trial counsel for T,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whom the state had charged with two counts of custodial interference in the first degree; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-97;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because of her unauthorized removal of her children from this state. T\u2019s turbulent relationship with her former spouse was a recurring theme at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>During the state\u2019s cross-examination of T on July 1, 2003, the prosecutor, assistant state\u2019s attorney David L. Zagaja, asked T if she recalled having communicated with one of her former attorneys about her \u201cdesires\u201d in her dissolution action. T responded: \u201cThere were numerous communications. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to.\u201d The prosecutor then asked T, while reading from a document: \u201cDo you recall telling [your attorney], \u2018now that I have a boyfriend with more money than him at First Financial Resources in Topsfield, [Massachusetts], I want to take all his money and leave him with nothing. No house, no kids, no money, after f_ing all of Singapore.\u2019 Do you recall communicating that to [your attorney]?\u201d T responded: \u201cNo, that was definitely not my communication to her. That\u2014those are [my former husband\u2019s] words.\u201d The prosecutor then disclosed that he had been reading from a copy of an e-mail communication, dated January 29,1999, between T and her former attorney in her dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Upon reviewing the document, T confirmed that it was a communication with her former attorney, but continued to insist that she was not the declarant of the passage that the prosecutor had read aloud. She opined: \u201cThere\u2019s some piece here missing or something. I don\u2019t know why ... I don\u2019t know if [my attorney] cut in between something . . . .\u201d The prosecutor then offered the e-mail into evidence and provided T\u2019s attorney, the plaintiff here, with an opportunity to examine it. After the examination, the plaintiff informed the court that he had \u201c[n]o objection\u201d to its admission. The court then entered the document into evidence as state\u2019s exhibit eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">On the next day of trial, during the plaintiffs redirect examination of T, the plaintiff, for the first time, described state\u2019s exhibit eleven as a \u201cconfidential, privileged message\u201d between T and her former attorney. Noting that the plaintiff had not protested the entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>the document into evidence on the previous day, the prosecutor immediately objected to this characterization. In response, the plaintiff withdrew the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">T then testified that, upon looking through her records the previous evening, she had found an original copy of state\u2019s exhibit eleven. This copy, entered into evidence as defendant\u2019s exhibit F, plainly demonstrated that several lines of text were missing from the state\u2019s version of the e-mail, resulting in a gap in the communication immediately preceding the vitriolic passage that had been quoted in court the day before. T testified that exhibit F, by filling in the gap, demonstrated that she had been reciting her former husband\u2019s words to her attorney, rather than declaring them as her own position. At this juncture, no question was raised by either counsel or by the court as to who had redacted the e-mail or how it had come into the state\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On July 9, 2003, after T\u2019s acquittal of the criminal charges against her, she directed the plaintiff \u201cto move the [trial] court to make an inquiry into exactly how the state\u2019s attorney came to possess the document that he introduced as Exhibit [eleven] in the trial . . . and who altered it. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff made an oral motion for the court to apply for an investigation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>filed a written motion entitled, \u201cMotion for the Court\u2019s Application for an Investigation.\u201d The written motion alleged that exhibit eleven was \u201c[a] [n]ever previously disclosed by the state to the defendant or her trial counsel that the state possessed the privileged document and intended to use it against her at trial; [b] [absolutely protected by the unwaived attorney-client privilege, between the defendant and her former divorce attorney . . . [c] [unlawfully and/or unethically obtained by the state without the defendant\u2019s knowledge or consent; and [d] [ajltered and fabricated in a substantial, material and prejudicial manner by the deletion or redaction of an entire paragraph of material text from the first page.\u201d Although the motion primarily called on the court to apply for an investigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47c,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it also requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the court \u201ctake any other measures it deems in accord with law and prudence to protect the integrity of the Court and the judicial process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">On July 11, 2003, the trial court conducted its first hearing on the plaintiffs motion. The court faulted the plaintiff for his failure to file affidavits in support of his motion and ordered him, and the prosecutor, to fill this procedural gap. Anticipating what these affidavits might contain, the court divided the plaintiffs motion into two specific assertions of misconduct: an alleged violation of the attorney-client privilege and a request for the court\u2019s filing of an application for an investigation under \u00a7 54-47c to inquire into possible evidence tampering. With respect to the first assertion, the plaintiff admitted that he was unprepared to argue the attorney-client privilege claim. With respect to the second, the plaintiff expressly acknowledged that an application for a \u00a7 54-47c investigation would be unwarranted if the prosecutor were to submit an affidavit demonstrating that he had received state\u2019s exhibit [eleven] in its altered state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The affidavits subsequently submitted by the prosecutor and the plaintiff disagreed about the provenance of exhibit eleven. The prosecutor\u2019s affidavit asserted that he had received exhibit eleven in its redacted version from T\u2019s former husband on June 20, 2003, and that he had represented finding the e-mail in the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>marital residence after T had vacated it on May 4, 2000. The affidavits filed by the plaintiff and T denied that T had left any communication with her attorney at the family residence and surmised that someone other than her former husband had altered the e-mail. The plaintiffs affidavit also reiterated his contention that the e-mail was \u201cprivileged\u201d and confidential.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">On September 17,2003, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision denying the plaintiffs motion for an investigation. With respect to the alleged violation of the attorney-client privilege, the court ruled that, even if the contents of exhibit eleven had fallen within the privilege, the plaintiff and T had waived the privilege by failing to claim it when the e-mail was first introduced into evidence. With respect to the request for a \u00a7 54-47c investigation, the court ruled that \u201cno valid reasons\u201d and \u201cno empirical facts\u201d had been presented that would afford the court \u201ca reasonable belief that the assistant state\u2019s attorney [or] any other attorney or member of a governmental agency either [had] violated a privilege or had knowledge of, or participated in, the purported deletion of the subject five lines from state\u2019s exhibit [eleven].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The court then initiated the proceedings that gave rise to the present writ of error. The court stated that \u201cinasmuch as counsel for the acquitee has made no effort to even articulate some semblance of a basis for either claim, the question then becomes one of whether counsel has made his claims in good faith and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>honored his obligations to the court.\u201d The court concluded it had \u201creason to believe\u201d that the plaintiff had violated rules 1.2, 3.1, 3.3 and 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct and issued an order continuing the matter to provide the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard as to whether sanctions should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">On November 6, 2003, the plaintiff filed a \u201cReply to Memorandum of Decision and Motion Not to Impose Sanctions,\u201d in which he averred that he had filed his postacquittal motion in good faith and that he lacked any malicious or improper motives. Nonetheless, he continued to refer to exhibit eleven as a \u201cprivileged communication.\u201d Relying on that characterization, he faulted the prosecutor for failing to inquire into the origins of the altered exhibit and opined that the prosecutor had an ethical duty to disclose its existence to the defense before introducing it into evidence at T\u2019s criminal trial. At the same time, he repeated that \u201c[neither [T] nor I accuse any particular person of wrongdoing in connection with state\u2019s exhibit [eleven] . . . because we have absolutely no evidence surrounding this document except that which is presented in the subject motion, in argument and in this memorandum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">On December 9, 2003, after a second hearing, the trial court, unpersuaded by the plaintiffs reply,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> imposed sanctions on the plaintiff. Incorporating by reference its findings in its September 17, 2003 memorandum of decision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court recited the relevant procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>history and concluded that the plaintiffs filing of the motion had violated four of the Rules of Professional Conduct, warranting the imposition of sanctions. The court held that the plaintiff (1) had violated rule 1.2 by calling for an investigation in response to the wishes of his client in derogation of his professional obligations as an officer of the court, (2) had violated rule 3.1 by making frivolous assertions without any good faith basis for his claims, (3) had violated rule 3.3 (a) (1), which requires candor toward the tribunal, by his \u201cconcerted effort not to know the status of the law\u201d regarding attorney-client privilege and (4) had violated rule 8.4 by pursuing claims on behalf of his client that improperly insinuated wrongdoing by the office of the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The plaintiff challenges the validity of each of the court\u2019s criticisms of the legitimacy of his filing of his motion for a judicial investigation into the prosecutor\u2019s introduction of exhibit eleven at his client\u2019s trial. Before we address each of the plaintiffs individual claims, we must identify the standards that govern our appraisal of his writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">It is fundamental that \u201c[t]he Superior Court possesses inherent authority to regulate attorney conduct and to discipline the members of the bar.\u201d <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>523, 461 A.2d 938 (1983). \u201c[Courts] may of their own initiative, and without complaint, set on foot inquiries as to professional conduct and fitness . . . .\u201d <em>In re Peck, </em>88 Conn. 447, 457, 91 A. 274 (1914). Nonetheless, although \u201cthe power of the courts is left unfettered to act as situations, as they may arise, may seem to require, for efficient discipline of misconduct\u201d; id.; \u201cin a matter involving attorney discipline, no sanction may be imposed unless a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct has been established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>276 Conn. 285, 307, 885 A.2d 178 (2005). \u201c[C]lear and convincing proof denotes a degree of belief that lies between the belief that is required to find the truth or existence of the [fact in issue] in an ordinary civil action and the belief that is required to find guilt in a criminal prosecution. . . . [The burden] is sustained if evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that the facts asserted are highly probably true, that the probability that they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 307-308, quoting <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>245 Conn. 277, 290-91, 715 A.2d 712 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The standard of review that governs a writ of error in which an attorney disputes a trial court\u2019s disciplinary order similarly is well established. \u201c[0]ur role is limited to reviewing the record to determine if the facts as found are supported by the evidence contained within the record and whether the conclusions that follow are legally and logically correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>93 Conn. App. 832, 837, 890 A.2d 622 (2006); see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Muellner, </em>283 Conn. 510, 517, 932 A.2d 382 (2007). In conducting our review, we must decide whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion is supported by clear and convincing evidence; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McWeeny, </em>260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Conn. 296, 322-23, 796 A.2d 516 (2002); mindful that \u201c[t]he weight to be given to the evidence and to the credibility of witnesses is solely within the determination of the trier of fact. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>62 Conn. App. 507, 511, 772 A.2d 160 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Guided by these principles, we will divide our review of the plaintiff\u2019s challenges to the court\u2019s decision into three parts. We will first consider his claims with respect to the court\u2019s decision finding him in violation of rules 3.1 and 3.3 because of his persistent reiteration of his argument that state\u2019s exhibit eleven was inadmissible into evidence because it was a document protected by the attorney-client privilege. We will then consider his claims with respect to the court\u2019s decision finding him in violation of rules 1.2 and 8.4 because of his request for a judicial investigation into the alteration of the communication between his client and her former counsel that came into evidence as state\u2019s exhibit eleven. Finally, we will address the propriety of the sanctions imposed on the plaintiff by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">We begin our analysis of the merits of the plaintiffs writ of error by addressing the trial court\u2019s disciplinary findings with respect to his invocation of the attorney-client privilege. The court found that, in ignoring settled law, the plaintiff violated rale 3.1 because he lacked a good faith basis for his claim that exhibit eleven was protected by an \u201cunwaived attorney-client privilege.\u201d In addition, the court found that the plaintiff violated rale 3.3 (a) (1) because his persistence in ignoring the undisputed law of attorney-client privilege demonstrated \u201ca lack of candor with the court.\u201d We agree with both of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Rule 3.1</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Rule 3.1 prohibits an attorney from filing frivolous claims. As of 2003, the rule provided in relevant part: \u201cA lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rules of Professional Conduct (2003) 3.1. In <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golart, </em>206 Conn. 454, 464, 538 A.2d 1017 (1988), our Supreme Court concluded that an \u201caction is frivolous ... if the lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The objective \u201creasonable attorney\u201d standard governs the determination of whether a lawyer\u2019s claim is frivolous. See <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 255, 828 A.2d 64 (2003); <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>103 Conn. App. 601, 615, 931 A.2d 319, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 929, 934 A.2d 244 (2007); 2 G. Hazard &amp; W. Hodes, The Law of Lawyering (3d Ed. Sup. 2007) \u00a7 27.12 (\u201c[rjule 3.1 adopts an objective as opposed to a subjective standard\u201d); 2 Restatement (Third), Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 110, comment (d), p. 172 (2000) (\u201cfrivolous position is one that a lawyer of ordinary competence would recognize as so lacking in merit that there is no substantial possibility that the tribunal would accept it\u201d). In addition, we recently have recognized that, although a claim need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>not be based on fully substantiated facts when filed, once it becomes apparent that the claim lacks merit, an attorney violates rule 3.1 by persisting with the claim, rather than withdrawing it. <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 619 (\u201crule 3.1 prohibits an attorney from asserting ... a claim on which the attorney reasonably is unable to maintain a good faith argument on the merits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs repeated assertion that exhibit eleven was \u201cabsolutely protected by the unwaived attorney-client privilege\u201d violated rule 3.1 because the plaintiff ignored settled law that an attorney\u2019s failure to make a timely objection to the admission of a document is a waiver of the privilege. We agree with the court that even a modicum of legal research would have informed the plaintiff that his belated assertion of the privilege was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">\u201cThe power to waive the attorney-client privilege rests with the client or with his attorney acting with his authority. 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 93, p. 341; see also <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>112 Conn. 521, 523, 152 A. 882 (1931) .... [I]f the holder of the privilege fails to claim his privilege by objecting to disclosure by himself or another witness when he has an opportunity to do so, he waives his privilege as to communications so disclosed. 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 93, p. 343. This result is reached because once the confidence protected has been breached, the privilege has no valid continuing office to perform.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gebbie </em>v. <em>Cadle Co., </em>49 Conn. App. 265, 274, 714 A.2d 678 (1998).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>In the absence of any dispute about the underlying facts, we conclude that the trial court properly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the plaintiff violated rule 3.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The plaintiffs continued assertion of an attorney-client privilege that he had waived was inexcusable and unprofessional.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Rule 3.3 (a) (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Rule 3.3 requires an attorney to act with candor toward the tribunal. As of 2003, the rule stated in relevant part: \u201c(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly: (1) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rules of Professional Conduct (2003) 3.3. The commentary to rule 3.3 provides: \u201cLegal argument based on a knowingly false representation of law constitutes dishonesty toward the tribunal. A lawyer is not required to make a disinterested exposition of the law, but must recognize the existence of pertinent legal authorities.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3, commentary. The commentary also states: \u201cThere are circumstances where failure to make a disclosure is the equivalent of an affirmative misrepresentation.\u201d Id.; see also <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, </em>486 U.S. 429, 441 n.14, 108 S. Ct. 1895, 100 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The trial court found that the plaintiff had violated rule 3.3 by \u201cmaking the claim of attorney-client privilege and yet, apparently, making no effort to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>applicable law at the time the issue arose and counsel filed the pleadings.\u201d The court focused on the plaintiffs \u201cpersistent assertions of the inadmissibility of state\u2019s exhibit eleven despite counsel\u2019s failure to object to its admissibility . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The plaintiff cannot and does not disagree with the trial court\u2019s description of his repeated representations about the validity of his attorney-client privilege representations at trial. Despite his own failure to object to the admission of exhibit eleven into evidence, he again and again faulted the prosecutor for having violated T\u2019s attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The plaintiff defends his persistence in his claim of privilege by arguing that his waiver of the privilege was ineffective because it was not voluntary and intelligent. He argues that, until T discovered the original e-mail between herself and her dissolution counsel, he did not have an opportunity properly to appraise the admissibility of exhibit eleven. We are not persuaded. As the trial court points out, before the prosecutor moved for admission of exhibit eleven into evidence, he elicited from T the fact that the exhibit was a communication with her attorney. The plaintiff was then shown a copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of the exhibit and expressly stated that he had no objection to its admission. Even now, the plaintiff has not identified the further information that he would have needed to enable him to ascertain the exhibit\u2019s privileged status in timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">On this state of the record, we must uphold the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs knowing and unjustifiable persistence in misrepresenting the law constituted a lack of candor with the court that justified the imposition of sanctions under rule 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The plaintiffs personal belief that the facts of record permitted an argument that he had not waived the privilege was never buttressed by a single citation of supporting authority.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s finding, therefore, was supported by clear and convincing evidence. See <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McWeeny, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">We turn now to the trial court\u2019s determination that, by filing a motion for judicial investigation into the circumstances that permitted an altered document to be admitted into evidence at T\u2019s criminal trial, the plaintiff violated rules 1.2 and 8.4 (4) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The trial court found that the plaintiff violated rule 1.2 because he did not make his request in his own capacity as an officer of the court. The court found that the plaintiff violated rule 8.4 (4) by pursuing claims on behalf of his client that improperly insinuated wrongdoing by the office of the state\u2019s attorney. We address each violation in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Rule 1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Rule 1.2 concerns the scope of representation and allocation of authority between the client and the lawyer. In 2003, rule 1.2 (e) required a lawyer to advise the client about limitations on the lawyer\u2019s conduct that are contained in the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The commentary to rule 1.2 stated in relevant part that \u201ca lawyer is not required to pursue objectives or employ means simply because a client may wish that the lawyer do so.\u201d Rules of Professional Conduct (2003) 1.2, commentary. The trial court found that, in asking for an investigation into the auspices of state\u2019s exhibit eleven, the plaintiff had acted, not as an officer of the court, but out of \u201ca desire to fulfill [T\u2019s] wishes and a complete abandonment of any duty whatsoever to the court.\u201d Faulting the plaintiff for having moved for a judicial inquiry without any factual support for his allegations of official misconduct, the court found that the plaintiff lacked a good faith basis for his challenge to the integrity of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The court\u2019s finding of professional ineptitude on the part of the plaintiff cannot be faulted. It is clear that the plaintiff never presented, either orally or in his affidavits, sufficient evidence for the court to have had a reasonable belief that a government entity had altered the e-mail between T and her dissolution attorney. He repeatedly acquiesced in the court\u2019s exoneration of the state\u2019s attorney<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and acknowledged the difficulties inherent in his invocation of \u00a7 54-47c without citing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>alternate statutory or common-law route for the court to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">It is not equally clear, however, that the plaintiffs failure to assist the court more fully in pursuing the inquiry that he himself had requested is clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff did not act in good faith. The fact remains that, albeit inadvertently, the prosecutor introduced an altered document into evidence at T\u2019s criminal trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If T had not kept good records herself, the adverse inferences that a jury might have drawn from state\u2019s exhibit eleven might not have been rebutted. Unlike the circumstances before this court in <em>Brunswick v. Statewide Grievance </em>Committee, supra, 103 Conn. App. 601, in this case, <em>someone </em>brought to the prosecutor an altered document that was entered into court proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Although the plaintiffs presentation of this vexing case left much to be desired, his complaint about the alteration of a crucial trial document must be placed within the proper context. Voicing a complaint about a fraud on the court was fully consistent with basic jurisprudential principles that undergird our judicial system. Unquestionably, the trial court has a \u201ccontinuing obligation to see that no falsehood or fraud was perpetrated on the court.\u201d <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>13 Conn. App. 330, 339, 537 A.2d 157, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 806, 540 A.2d 374 (1988). \u201cA judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing . . . high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved.\u201d Code of Judicial Conduct, canon 1. An attorney admitted to practice in this state has taken an oath that he \u201cwill not knowingly allow anything dishonest to be done in court, and . . . will inform the court of any dishonesty of which [he has] knowledge . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-25. These all-embracing commitments by the bench and bar are central to our system of justice. Furthermore, these principles have a statutory counterpart in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155, which makes it a felony to destroy or to tamper with evidence while an official proceeding is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff violated rule 1.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct because he did not act in good faith in seeking an investigation was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, we grant the writ of error as to this disciplinary finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Rule 8.4 (4)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Rule 8.4 provides that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . (4) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice . . . .\u201d The trial court again found that the plaintiff improperly had requested an investigation \u201cto provide some answers for [T].\u201d The specific grounds on which the court relied, however, were: \u201cIn counsel\u2019s motion and in argument before the court, counsel did insinuate wrongdoing by the office of the state\u2019s attorney. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office is not above reproach. However, these baseless claims did call into question the integrity of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. There was significant media attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>given counsel\u2019s claims. This type of conduct by an experienced member of the bar is conduct that \u2018is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the record demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that the plaintiff lacked good faith in asking for an investigation into the circumstances leading to an introduction of state\u2019s exhibit eleven into evidence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the court\u2019s view, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to articulate legally viable grounds, coupled with what the court perceived to be an unprincipled attack on the integrity of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, demonstrated that the plaintiff had abandoned his professional obligations to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Standing by itself, the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff lacked an evidentiary basis for accusing the prosecutor of misconduct cannot be faulted. Part of the plaintiffs original motion reasonably can be read to have implied that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office might have run afoul of ethical and legal norms. The plaintiff never presented a factual basis for a reasonable belief that a government entity had altered the e-mail. Furthermore, when the prosecutor furnished the court an affidavit unequivocally disclaiming any role in the alteration of exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>eleven, the plaintiff immediately should have withdrawn any semblance of a claim under \u00a7 54-47c, and he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The court\u2019s accurate recital of the record, however, attaches no significance to other undisputed facts of record. Although the plaintiff was unable to explain how the altered document that was entered into evidence as state\u2019s exhibit eleven came into the possession of the prosecutor, the record establishes unequivocally that the prosecutor <em>did </em>receive an altered document and <em>did </em>present the altered document in court. Albeit innocently, the prosecutor enabled <em>someone </em>to engage in fraudulent conduct that was prejudicial to our justice system.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The fortuity that a serious prejudice was avoided by T\u2019s conscientious recordkeeping does not negate the seriousness of what transpired in the courtroom on July 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The record, moreover, is replete with statements demonstrating that the plaintiffs request for an inquiiy was not limited to his questioning of the role of the prosecutor in introducing exhibit eleven. Time and again, well in advance of the prosecutor\u2019s submission of his affidavit, the plaintiff stated that he would accept, without question, a statement from the prosecutor disclaiming any role in the alteration of the exhibit.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He acknowledged that \u00a7 54-47c might be inapplicable and implored the court to pursue any other course of inquiry that might be more appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Although the plaintiff was not as articulate an advocate of his position as one might have wished, the record shows that he was understandably taken aback by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>court\u2019s decision to focus exclusively on the unlikelihood of prosecutorial misconduct. That emphasis led the court to attach no significance to a possible inquiry into the role that <em>^.nongovernmental </em>actor must have played in the illegal alteration of the document that the state introduced into evidence as exhibit eleven. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The question before us, then, is whether the record, viewed as a whole, demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the plaintiff did not act in good faith in initially questioning the role of the state\u2019s attorney in the introduction of exhibit eleven into evidence at T\u2019s trial and that this conduct was \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d in violation of rule 8.4 (4). Our review of the record persuades us that the court\u2019s finding cannot be sustained because it fails to attach significance to the totality of the evidence of what transpired in the underlying criminal case. An attorney who, even inartfully, brings the introduction of an altered document to the attention of a court performs a service for the integrity of the judiciary.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, we grant the plaintiffs writ of error with respect to this disciplinary finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Our final inquiry addresses the propriety of the sanctions that the court imposed on the plaintiff. Unpersuaded by the plaintiffs petition not to impose sanctions, the court fined him $100 for each of the four violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct that the court found the plaintiff to have committed. In addition, the court ordered him forthwith to participate in twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>hours of continuing legal education, including a class in legal ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Our decision that the evidence of record did not establish the plaintiffs violation of two of the four Rules of Professional Conduct for which he was sanctioned requires us to set aside $200 of the fines that the trial court required the plaintiff to pay. With respect to the court\u2019s order for attendance at legal education classes, and enforcement of the remaining $200 fine, we remand the case for a further hearing.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The writ of error is granted in part and the case is remanded to the Superior Court with direction to vacate that part of the order in which that court found that the plaintiff violated rules 1.2 and 8.4 and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The writ of error is denied with respect to the court\u2019s findings that the plaintiff violated rules 3.1 and 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In this opinion McLACHLAN, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-5\"> The writ of error was properly filed in our Supreme Court and was transferred by that court to this court.

T\u2019s criminal trial ended when the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on all counts. Thereafter, the plaintiff initiated a motion, claiming the attorney-client privilege protected the contents of the e-mail from disclosure and that violations were inherent in the possession and proffer of the subject document by the state, claiming that there was no waiver of the attorney-client privilege relevant to exhibit eleven at the time of trial and claiming that prior to its admission into evidence, the e-mail was tampered with or fabricated by person or persons unknown in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> In an amendment that took effect January 1, 2007, the phrase \u201cin law and fact\u201d was added to the sentence, following the phrase \u201cunless there is a basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\"> The commentary to rule 3.1 states that attorneys are required to \u201cinform themselves about the facts of their clients\u2019 cases and the applicable law and determine that they can make good faith arguments in support of their clients\u2019 positions.\u201d Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1, commentary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\"> Failure of a defense attorney to object to the introduction of arguably privileged evidence also raises an inference that the attorney did not view the matter as seriously prejudicial at the time of its introduction.

Nevertheless, the effect of requesting the investigatory procedure set forth in \u00a7 54-47c was to accuse a state actor of participating in a criminal act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, by the use of \u00a7 54-47c, as well as citation to the Rules of Professional Conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>coupled with his assorted complaints regarding the conduct of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff clearly, if not explicitly, implied that a member of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had tampered with the evidence. The logical corollary to this accusation is that the state actively attempted to obtain a fraudulent conviction. In other words, the plaintiff, whether intentionally or not, alleged very serious charges of misconduct against the office of the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Second, the plaintiff never was able to provide the court with an evidentiary basis to support the claim that an agent of the government had committed a crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 acknowledge that a comparison of the state\u2019s exhibit eleven and T\u2019s exhibit F reveal that the document had been altered. Moreover, the belief that a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155, which proscribes tampering with evidence, had occurred certainly was plausible. It does not follow, however, that a government agent was responsible for such tampering with evidence, or knowingly allowed such evidence to be introduced during the criminal trial. Although a significant transgression occurred, namely, the alteration of an e-mail that later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>was admitted into evidence, there was no objective basis for the plaintiff to persist in linking or associating this misconduct with the actions of a member of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, or any state actor. Simply put, I am in full agreement with the statement of my colleagues that \u201c[t]he plaintiff never presented a factual basis for a reasonable belief that a government entity had altered the e-mail.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Third, there were inconsistencies between the plaintiffs words and actions. For example, on more than one occasion, the plaintiff expressed his belief in the professional integrity of the prosecutor, assistant state\u2019s attorney David L. Zagaja. Throughout the entire proceeding, however, the plaintiff lobbed accusations of wrongdoing that necessarily implicated both Zagaja and the office of the state\u2019s attorney. Additionally, the plaintiff seemed to acknowledge that if the state would provide an affidavit detailing the manner in which it received the document in question, the need for an investigation would be obviated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Despite receiving such a sworn statement from Zagaja, the plaintiff did not withdraw the request for a \u00a7 54-47c investigation. Even after the court denied the plaintiffs request and found that he had violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, in his November 6, 2003 reply, he continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>suggesting misconduct on the part of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, although the plaintiff had acknowledged that other methods of investigation could have been used, he advanced the procedure set forth in \u00a7 54-47c.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff violated rule 8.4 was premised on the fact that his baseless claims called into question the integrity of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. The court then observed: \u201cFrankly, what caused me more concern\u2014and I can understand how sometimes you might get carried away during a trial. <em>But what caused me more concern in reading your reply that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number><em>was filed appreciably after the incident when the dust has settled\u2014I think in November, from July to November\u2014and still\u2014this is what disturbed me. And I know what disturbed me was the your persistence in these claims when the law was clearly not on your side.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Finally, I share in the concerns set forth by my colleagues regarding the introduction of an altered e-mail into evidence during a court proceeding.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the choice of redress and the manner employed by the plaintiff, by the express language used in \u00a7 54-47c, contained an allegation of criminal wrongdoing by a state actor, most likely a member of state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. Most importantly, the plaintiffs pursuit never yielded, even when it was clear that there was no evidence implicating an agent of the government. The choice of conduct continued despite the opportunity to pursue other options to discover the source of the alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">With these points in mind, I turn my attention to whether the plaintiffs conduct constituted a violation of rule 8.4. \u201c[R]ule 8.4 (4) of the Rules of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Conduct . . . prohibits an attorney from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice .... It is well established that members of the bar- [must] conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the role of courts in the administration of justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Notopoulos </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>277 Conn. 218, 235, 890 A.2d 509, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 823, 127 S. Ct. 157, 166 L. Ed. 2d 39 (2006). \u201cRule [8.4 (4)] overlaps with a large number of the rules in Part 3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, for almost all of the limits upon advocacy specified in those Rules are designed to protect the integrity of the justice system.\u201d 2 G. Hazard &amp; W. Hodes, The Law of Lawyering (3d Ed. 2008 Sup.) \u00a7 65.6, p. 65-11. In other words, rule 8.4 is a \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision stating general grounds for discipline. See 1 Restatement (Third), Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 5, p. 50 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">I further note that this court has rejected the argument that a violation of rule 8.4 (4) requires the element of intent. In <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>72 Conn. App. 203, 210-11, 804 A.2d 1027 (2002), we stated: \u201cJudges no less than lawyers are chargeable for deviations from the codes governing their conduct, even though the application of the canons to particular circumstances may not be readily apparent. <em>... A judge may be sanctioned for a wilful violation of one of the canons of judicial conduct if he intended to engage in the conduct for which he is sanctioned whether or not [he] knows that he violates the rule. . . . That reasoning equally is applicable to lawyers and, therefore, we conclude that the court properly held that rule 8.4 </em>(4) <em>does not have a, scienter requirement. . . . </em>Trial courts that have considered claims of violations of other ethical rules have held that those rules also contain no scienter requirement. See, e.g..... <em>Gersten </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV-96-0565949 (June 10, 1997) (19 Conn. L. Rptr. 554, 555) (construing Rules of Professional Conduct 1.8 [a] and determining that [i]t is not a defense to an ethical violation that the attorney did not act in bad faith or intend to violate the code) .... Although this court is not bound by trial court decisions . . . we agree with their reasoning on the subject and adopt it here.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) See also <em>Ansell v. Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>87 Conn. App. 376, 388, 865 A.2d 1215 (2005) (\u201c[f]urthermore, we have held that rule 8.4 [4] does not contain such a requirement [of intent]\u201d). The focus, therefore, is not whether the plaintiffs subjective motivation<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for calling for a \u00a7 54-47c investigation was improper or done in bad faith, but whether his conduct in persisting with such claims without an underlying evidentiary basis violated rule 8.4 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">A cursory review of the cases in which a violation of rule 8.4 (4) has been found is appropriate. In <em>Notopoulos </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 218, our Supreme Court determined that the statewide grievance committee properly found a violation when an attorney wrote a letter to a member of a probate judge\u2019s staff accusing the judge of extorting money for an alleged \u201ccrony.\u201d In <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 207, the attorney was reprimanded after he was found to have violated rule 8.4 (4) by failing to pay in a timely manner the judgment that had been rendered against him. In <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>227 Conn. 829, 830, 633 A.2d 296 (1993), the Superior Court ordered the one year suspension of an attorney who had refused on several occasions to attend a pretrial conference in a criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>As this case law demonstrates, rule 8.4 (4) casts a wide net over an assortment of attorney misconduct. In my view, the plaintiffs persistent and unfounded allegations of criminal behavior by state actors, as demonstrated by his conduct throughout the proceedings, falls within conduct prohibited by rule 8.4 (4). Like the trial court, I am less concerned with the plaintiffs initial use of \u00a7 54-47c than with his decision to persevere with this unfounded strategy. The plaintiff continued to insinuate that members of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and unnamed state actors had tampered with evidence, despite the lack of a nexus between such individuals and the actual alteration of the e-mail. Despite the plaintiffs contrary belief, mere possession of the e-mail does not equate to the source of the tampering. Accordingly, I believe that the trial court\u2019s finding of a violation of rule 8.4 (4) was proper. I would, therefore, deny the writ of error as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">As a final matter, I now turn to the issue of the propriety of the sanctions against the plaintiff. As I noted at the outset, I am in agreement with the majority that the court properly found violations of rules 3.1 and 3.3. I further agree that the court improperly found a violation of rule 1.2 and would grant the writ of error solely as to that claim. In my view, the monetary sanctions imposed by the court are readily divisible. Accordingly, I would set aside $100 of the fines imposed by the trial court. Finally, I agree with my colleagues that a remand with instructions for the trial court to determine whether the plaintiff should be required to attend a legal education class is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\"> The plaintiff represented a criminal defendant at trial. The defendant in the underlying criminal matter was acquitted. Her identity, therefore, is not disclosed in this opinion. We refer to the acquittee as T. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\"> At the July 11, 2003 hearing, the court granted the plaintiffs request to make some preliminary remarks, at which time he admitted that T, for whom he had been trial counsel in a prior criminal matter, had several alternative recourses to pursue with respect to the manner in which the state obtained the-e-mail in question. \u201cHer recourse is first and foremost, in her opinion and in my opinion, with this court, with Your Honor who presided over the trial of her case. She was not limited to presenting this motion to Your Honor. She has other avenues for different reasons, answers to these questions, including the statewide grievance committee, the office of the chief state\u2019s attorney . . . .\u201d Thus, even at the outset, the plaintiff was aware that options other than the use of General Statutes \u00a7 54-47c could have been used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 54-47b (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\"> The trial court aptly stated that \u201cjw]e must be mindful that the request for an investigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-47c limits our inquiry to the conduct of members of a governmental entity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\"> I note that the plaintiff complained that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office improperly (1) failed to investigate the origin of the document, (2) failed to consider the attorney-client privilege, (3) used the document in an attempt to impeach the character of T, for whom he had been trial counsel in a prior criminal matter, and (4) failed to disclose the document prior to T\u2019s criminal trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\"> The court directly asked the plaintiff if he had a good faith basis to believe that the e-mail was tampered with or altered by anyone in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, the police department or any other governmental entity or agent. The court later asked the plaintiff if he had a good faith basis that a government entity or agent altered the e-mail. After several attempts to avoid that direct question, the plaintiff responded in the affirmative. In my view, this query was not directed at ascertaining the plaintiffs motives or subject ive belief regarding misconduct by a government actor, but whether the plaintiff had an objective basis to make such claims. In other words, the court was attempting to determine whether the plaintiff was in possession of evidence that would support his allegations other than his own subjective belief that a state actor was responsible for altering the e-mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\"> Furthermore, <em>as </em>noted by the msyority, the court concluded that there were \u201cno valid reasons\u201d and \u201cno empirical facts\u201d that would afford the court \u201ca reasonable belief that the assistant state\u2019s attorney [or] any other attorney or member of a governmental agency . . . had knowledge of, or participated in, the purported deletion of the subject five lines from state\u2019s exhibit [eleven].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\"> At one point, the court asked the plaintiff what would happen if the state had received the e-mail in the exact condition that it was offered into evidence. The plaintiff responded: \u201cThat is the answer then, Your Honor. That\u2019s the answer. <em>Then, let the state provide an affidavit to Your Honor that we received it in such a fashion. . . . And then the whole </em>matter\u2014 <em>the whole matter is arguably finished, </em>except for the person who provided a tampered document to the state\u2019s attorney.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\"> In response to the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, the plaintiff submitted a \u201creply to memorandum of decision and motion not to impose sanctions\u201d on November 6,2003, in which he continued with the allegations of wrongdoing by a state actor. He argued that the request for an investigation was filed in good faith on a reasonable belief and that he did not intend to \u201caffront the court or the state\u2019s attorneys.\u201d Nevertheless, he maintained his belief that the document had been altered and that \u201cthis procurement by the state was suspect.\u201d He further insisted that the introduction of the document during the criminal trial \u201coffended the laws and the principles of justice of this state as well as the constitutional rights of [T],\u201d his client at that trial. The plaintiff implicitly challenged the veracity of Zagaja\u2019s affidavit when he stated: \u201cApart from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s affidavit of July 15, 2003, there is no evidence of the origin of the document or how it came into [the former husband\u2019s] possession.\u201d He continued on this path by questioning the state\u2019s representation about the manner in which the state had received the document. The plaintiff indicated that the state\u2019s failure to disclose the document \u201craises reasonable doubts about the state\u2019s intentions.\u201d He suggested that the tactics employed by the state with respect to the document were unfair because they \u201cintentionally precluded any timely challenge to the state\u2019s use of that document.\u201d The plaintiff also suggested that the state\u2019s attorneys were aware of the former husband\u2019s \u201cintense hatred for [T]\u201d and that should have alerted them to a motive and interest in seeing her convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The plaintiff persisted in pursuing an investigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47c. \u201cThe issues surrounding state\u2019s [exhibit eleven] are inextricably linked to government actors who possessed and employed it A determination of whether or not any state agent acted improperly, unethically or criminally in relation to [exhibit eleven] is what [T] sought. Neither [T] nor I accuse any particular person or governmental entity of wrongdoing; she only believes that wrongdoing occurred within the underlying proceedings ... in connection with [exhibit eleven].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\"> As I view the record, the court\u2019s finding of a violation of rule 8.4 (4) was premised on the plaintiffs conduct throughout the course of events and not his \u201cinitially questioning the role of the state\u2019s attorney . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> The record before us does not indicate whether the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office investigated the circumstances of the altered e-mail in an effort to uncover the perpetrator. While it is somewhat understandable that the members of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office were upset with the accusations leveled by the plaintiff, I maintain a hope that an equal, if not greater concern, was that a fraudulent document was introduced, albeit unknowingly, into a court proceeding by a member of that office. I certainly expect that these prosecutors would be more concerned with the submission of false evidence than injury to their professional pride.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Nevertheless, the issue before us is whether there was clear and convincing evidence to support the court\u2019s finding of a violation of rule 8.4 (4). While I do not totally discount the context in which the plaintiff undertook his actions, I believe that we must consider the conduct of the plaintiff separate from the improper and illegal actions of the unidentified person who provided the state with the altered e-mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\"> I note that there is nothing in the record to suggest that the plaintiff acted with animus specifically towards Zagaja or more generally the office of the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
