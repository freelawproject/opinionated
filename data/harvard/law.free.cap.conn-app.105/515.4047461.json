On appeal, both respondents claim that the court improperly (1) found that they had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation, (2) found that the termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children and (3) refused to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor children. The respondent father also claims that (4) the court improperly refused to certify the children\u2019s therapist as an expert. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The court found the following facts. The children involved in this proceeding are the respondent mother\u2019s ninth and tenth children and the respondent father\u2019s fourth and fifth children. None of the respondents\u2019 other children have remained in their care. Both respondents have had substantial dealings with the department of children and families (department) prior to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The respondent mother, bom May 26, 1964, was herself committed to the custody of the petitioner in 1977 at the age of thirteen. She has had ten children who were fathered by eight different men. Her parental rights were terminated with respect to three of her children, two of them were given to a woman who offered herself as a placement resource, and three of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>them axe in the custody of their fathers. The respondent mother lost custody of all of her children due to her issues with substance abuse and depression, her predisposition to involvement in abusive relationships with various men and her neglect and abuse of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On September 17, 1999, the respondent mother gave birth to her ninth child, J. In February, 2000, when J was approximately four months old, both respondents were arrested following a domestic violence incident. Both of them were convicted of disorderly conduct for this incident. On May 11, 2002, the respondent mother had M, her tenth child, with the respondent father. In September, 2003, the department received a referral after the respondent mother was arrested for a motor vehicle violation when she was alleged to have been smoking marijuana while her children were in the car with her. She was convicted of possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In October, 2003, the respondent mother tested positive for illicit substances. The department offered substance abuse evaluations, parent education classes and in-home services to both respondents. The respondents refused in-home services but did attend the parenting class. The respondent father refused the substance abuse evaluation, but the respondent mother participated in a hair test, which was positive for marijuana. She also participated with the Morris Foundation for substance abuse and the McCall Foundation for counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In April, 2004, J\u2019s day care center called the department to report that J had bruising on his lower back and buttocks and that J had reported that the respondent mother had hit him with a belt. In June, 2004, the respondent father came home one day to find that the respondent mother had left and had taken the children with her to Florida. He went to Florida to retrieve them. Soon thereafter, the respondent mother called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>department from Florida and made numerous statements regarding the respondent father\u2019s treatment of her. She stated that she would do anything to stay away from him and to keep the children safe. She also stated that her history with him included substance abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, control and stalking. She also reported that he had opened her mail, did not allow her to have many friends visit and did not permit her to go anywhere. Two days later, the department was contacted by the authorities in Florida, who reported that the police had received reports that the respondent father had threatened the respondent mother and the people she had been living with and that he had slashed the car tires of those people.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In July, 2004, the department received a referral from authorities in Florida regarding J and M. The Florida authorities reported that the respondent mother had returned to Connecticut to attend a court hearing and had left the children in Florida. She was arrested at the court hearing and incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The respondent father was bom on May 24,1957. He has five children with four different women, and he does not have custody of the first three children. He was involved in several abusive relationships prior to meeting the respondent mother. His abuse of his female partners contributed to his failure to retain custody of his children. In addition, he has a thirty year criminal record, including convictions for possession of marijuana, harassment, violation of protective orders, disorderly conduct and violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The respondent father then had J and M with the respondent mother. Approximately two months after the Florida incident, on August 2,2004, orders of temporary custody were issued as to both children by the Superior Court. At this point, the children were in the care of the respondent father. The department, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>with the Watertown police, went to his house to execute the orders of temporary custody, but he refused to answer the door. In response, the police entered the home on their own. The department retrieved the two children, and the respondent father was arrested for interference. A social worker testified that J told her in the car on the way to the foster home that his parents beat each other up when they get angry with one another and that he and his brother were hit when they were bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The respondents eventually reconciled but not without more drama. In September, 2004, the respondent mother was driving while intoxicated and got into an accident with one of the respondent father\u2019s motor vehicles. On that same evening, she threatened to commit suicide and subsequently was taken to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation. Specific steps for reunification were issued by the court, <em>Brunetti, J., </em>on August 2, 2004, and on September 4,2004, by the court, <em>C. Taylor, J. </em>The specific steps required the respondents to do the following: keep all appointments set by or with the department, keep their whereabouts and their children\u2019s whereabouts known to the department, participate in individual and family counseling, undergo substance abuse assessment, submit to random drug testing, secure and maintain adequate housing and income, refrain from substance abuse, avoid any further involvement with the criminal justice system, consistently and timely meet and address the children\u2019s physical, educational, medical and emotional needs, visit the children as often as permitted and conduct themselves appropriately during visits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The respondent mother has complied with some of the steps. She has had no more criminal convictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>has maintained housing with the respondent father, has attended an intensive outpatient program that provided parenting classes and urine and hair sample tests for substance abuse and has visited with the children regularly. Nevertheless, she had positive hair tests until November, 2005, refused to participate in a program for domestic violence services because she claimed there was no violence in her relationship with the respondent father, has been unemployed since the issuance of the steps and still depends on the respondent father for financial support.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The respondent father also has complied with some of the steps. He has maintained stable housing, has engaged in parenting classes and substance abuse treatment, has completed a domestic violence program and has engaged in individual and couples counseling. He did not participate in family counseling, however, and has not been employed consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In part, as a result of the respondents\u2019 failure to comply fully with the court-ordered specific steps, the petitioner filed petitions on May 17, 2005, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 et seq. to terminate the respondents\u2019 parental rights with respect to their children, J and M. The petitioner alleged that the respondents were the parents of children younger than age seven who were neglected or uncared for; they failed, or were unable, to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable period of time, considering the ages and needs of the children, they could assume a responsible position in the children\u2019s lives; and that their parental rights as to another child previously had been terminated pursuant to a petition brought by the petitioner. A neglect petition also was filed on August 2, 2004. On November 30, 2005, the court, <em>C. Taylor, J., </em>consolidated the neglect and termination of parental rights petitions. Both matters were tried before the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Jongbloed, J., </em>on March 6 through 10, May 19 and June 2, 2006. Judge Jongbloed found that the children were neglected, that the parents had failed to achieve rehabilitation and could not do so within a reasonable time period, and that termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children. These appeals followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the legal principles that guide our resolution of the respondents\u2019 claims. \u201cOur standard of review on appeal from a termination of parental rights is whether the challenged findings are clearly erroneous. . . . The determinations reached by the trial court that the evidence is clear and convincing will be disturbed only if [any challenged] finding is not supported by the evidence and [is], in light of the evidence in the whole record, clearly erroneous. ... On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached . . . nor do we retry the case or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, on review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ... A hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. ... In the adjudicatory phase, the trial court determines whether one of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights [under \u00a7 17a-112 (j)] exists by clear and convincing evidence. If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, it proceeds to the dispositional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court determines whether termination is in the best interests of the child. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Ryan R., </em>102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Conn. App. 608, 617-18, 926 A.2d 690, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 923, 924, 933 A.2d 724 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Both respondents argue that the court improperly found that they had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (E).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The respondent mother argues that there is evidence in the record to indicate that there was reason to believe that she could assume a responsible position in the life of her children within a reasonable time. She argues that she has not used illegal drugs since 2004, has participated in parenting classes and will continue to participate in services offered by the department. Therefore, she argues, the court\u2019s finding that she did not have sufficient stability or sobriety to meet the needs of the children was not supported by the record. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The court found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent mother had not achieved a sufficient degree of rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ages and needs of the children, she could assume a responsible position in the lives of the children. Because the record clearly supported the court\u2019s finding, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u201cPersonal rehabilitation . . . refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent . . . [and] requires the trial court to analyze the [parent\u2019s] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. . . . [The statute] requires the court to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation she has achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that at some future date she can assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 628-29, 847 A.2d 883 (2004). The court found that, as of the adjudication date, the respondent mother continued to have a substantial substance abuse problem and continued to be under the respondent father\u2019s control. The court farther found that she had a long history of abusive, dependent relationships that greatly impaired her parenting ability and that her present abusive, dependent relationship continued the same pattern. Lending itself to this matrix is the fact that she had not obtained any employment and was dependent on the respondent father for all of her economic needs, including, but not limited to, food, shelter and transportation. Moreover, the respondent father had surveillance cameras positioned inside and outside of his house, furthering his complete control over her.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The respondent father argues that the court improperly relied heavily on the opinion of J. Leslie Kurt, a psychiatrist, who testified at trial as an expert in adult and forensic psychiatry. Kurt had stated in a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>evaluation that antisocial personality disorder, with which the respondent father had been diagnosed, was generally regarded as an untreatable disorder. The respondent father argued that it was clear error to rely on the opinion of Kurt because she had not met with or evaluated him since 1996. Furthermore, the respondent father claims that the court improperly failed to perceive the different prognosis of Robert Neems, a psychologist, who testified at trial as an expert in clinical and forensic psychology. The respondent father argues that Neems, who had evaluated him in 2005, also had testified that the symptoms of antisocial personality disorder do diminish. Finally, the respondent father argues that he had sought treatment, had gone to parenting classes and had gone to a drug counseling program. Therefore, he asserts, the court\u2019s finding that he had failed to achieve rehabilitation was clearly erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The court found that the respondent father had substance abuse issues after the filing of the petitions for termination of parental rights. In addition, the court found that in the self-assessment, which he completed at the beginning of the domestic violence program in October, 2004, he denied any physical or emotional abuse of a partner in the previous seven years. He also represented that he had not threatened to take the children away, to call the department or to withhold access to the children in that period of time, nor had he damaged any property as a form of intimidation. The court found that he had been completely untruthful. He had threatened to take the children away from the respondent mother, had engaged in acts of violence against her and had damaged property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Additionally, the court found that the respondent father failed to provide his therapist, Judith Tsukroff, with relevant information, thereby preventing his therapist from understanding the situation in its entirety and from getting an accurate view of his difficulties. Finally, the court noted that Kurt had diagnosed him with antisocial personality disorder and had written that the disorder was generally regarded as an untreatable disorder. Although the respondent father tried to claim that his compliance with the specific steps and decreased level of criminal activity demonstrated his rehabilitation, the court found that Kurt rendered other explanations for his improvements. She testified that often, individuals with antisocial personality disorder do not have criminal records. Furthermore, the recent absence of physical violence was not surprising in light of the intense scrutiny by the court and the department. Finally, the respondent father\u2019s fundamental issue of coercive, controlling and aggressive personality style persists despite any recent lack of physical violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The court further found that neither respondent complied fully with all of the requirements set out in the specific steps issued by the court. The respondent mother did not refrain from substance abuse and refused to participate in the domestic violence program. The respondent father did attend required services, but he was not truthful with his providers, thereby diminishing his capacity to benefit from the services. The court also found that the department had been involved with the respondents as early as 2003 and that neither parent had shown any real improvement over that substantial period of time. The court cited the testimony of Neems, who evaluated the respondents between December, 2004, and February, 2005, and who stated that the respondent mother\u2019s history of substance abuse, dependency on poorly chosen partners and irresponsibility regarding her children have had a significant impact on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>her parenting, and \u201cunless she were to remedy them very dramatically, [these factors] would continue to impact her parenting of children.\u201d We conclude that the record amply supports the court\u2019s finding that as of the adjudicatory date, the \u201crespondents had not brought themselves into a position in which they could provide adequate care for the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The court then considered whether events occurring after the adjudicatory date established \u201ca degree of rehabilitation that is sufficient to foresee that the parents may resume a useful role in the child\u2019s life within a reasonable time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Quoting <em>In re Stanley D., </em>61 Conn. App. 224, 230, 763 A.2d 83 (2000). The court noted that both respondents had made some improvements since the adjudicatory date. The respondent mother remained substance free after a positive October, 2005 drug test, and the respondent father had not had any recent arrests. The court found, however, that there were several other factors that led to the conclusion that they had not achieved a sufficient degree of rehabilitation and that such rehabilitation was not foreseeable within a reasonable time. Buttressing this conclusion, the court found that in light of the respondent father\u2019s history, his recent behavior, including cutting a neighbor\u2019s telephone wire, slashing tires and involving the children in an \u201cinterstate tug-of-war,\u201d demonstrated that he was not in a position to parent his children. Furthermore, the court found that he was not economically stable, as he continued to work only seasonally and filed a petition in bankruptcy in October, 2005. As for the respondent mother, the court found that she continued to be dependent on the respondent father for all her needs, had not gained employment and remained under his coercive control. Therefore, although the respondents had made some improvements, the court found that they had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>achieved rehabilitation to the degree that would encourage the belief that they would be in such a position to assume a useful role in their children\u2019s lives within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We agree with the court. \u201c [E] ven if a parent has made successful strides in her ability to manage her life and may have achieved a level of stability within her limitations, such improvements, although commendable, are not dispositive on the issue of whether, within a reasonable period of time, she could assume a responsible position in the life of her children.\u201d <em>In re Alejandro L., </em>91 Conn. App. 248, 260, 881 A.2d 450 (2005). Indeed, as the court pointed out, the issue is not whether the parents have improved their ability to manage their own lives, but whether the parents have gained an ability to care for the specific needs of their children. See <em>In re Mariah S., </em>61 Conn. App. 248, 261, 763 A.2d 71 (2000) (\u201c[t]he critical issue is whether the parent has gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 934, 767 A.2d 104 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In the present case, each of the children has behavioral issues that require medication and therapy. J was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder traits, physical and emotional abuse and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. M was diagnosed with adjustment disorder unspecified, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. He also takes Focalin for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The court found that, despite their efforts, the respondents remain incapable of providing day-to-day care for the children within a reasonable time. Although the respondents have made some improvements in managing their own lives, they have not gained an ability to care for the specific special needs of their children. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>finding that the respondents failed to achieve a sufficient degree of rehabilitation in accordance with \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (E) is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Both respondents claim that the court improperly found that termination of their parental rights was in the best interests of the children. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u201cThe best interests of the child include the child\u2019s interests in sustained growth, development, well-being, and continuity and stability of its environment. ... In the dispositional phase of a termination of parental rights hearing, the trial court must determine whether it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the continuation of the respondent\u2019s parental rights is not in the best interest of the child. In arriving at this decision, the court is mandated to consider and make written findings regarding seven factors delineated in [\u00a7 17a-112 (k)].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>In re Ryan R., </em>supra, 102 Conn. App. 625-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The court thoroughly considered each of the seven criteria in its memorandum of decision before concluding that termination of parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interests. Both respondents argued that a bond of love existed between them and the children. The respondent mother argued that she had consistent visits with her children and always was caring and nurturing during those visits. The respondent father argued that he had dedicated himself seriously to rehabilitation and that the department never really considered reunification as an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The court considered several factors in deciding whether to terminate the parental rights of the respondents, including, among others, the emotional bonds between the children and the respondents, the stability of placement required by the children, the nature of the children\u2019s relationships with their foster parents and with the respondents, and the degree of contact maintained with the respondents. The court found that the department offered many services to the respondents, only some of which they took advantage. The court also found that the respondents complied with some of the specific steps issued by the court but not all of them. Their failure to comply with these court-ordered specific steps was detrimental to the children. For example, the respondent father\u2019s inability to maintain steady employment precluded his supporting his children financially. In addition, the respondent mother\u2019s refusal to participate in a program for domestic violence services put the children at risk for continued living in a coercive, abusive household. Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>court found that the respondents had maintained a regular visiting relationship with the children and that, although they had made some progress recently in terms of remaining substance free and living within the law, they continued to be unable to resume a responsible parental role in their children\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The court focused on the children. The court found that the children needed but lacked permanency, consistency and stability in their lives and noted that their attorney recommended termination of the respondents\u2019 parental rights. The court recognized that although the children did have an attachment to their parents and enjoyed their visits with them, that affection, under the circumstances, would not preclude termination. We agree with the court. Although the children may have had a bond with their parents, \u201c[o]ur courts consistently have held that even when there is a finding of a bond between parent and a child, it still may be in the child\u2019s best interest to terminate parental rights. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 627. The court found that \u201c [d] espite the existence of a bond with parents, termination can nevertheless be in a child\u2019s best interest.\u201d The court found that although both respondents love their children, they are \u201cunable to assume a responsible parental role for the children.\u201d For instance, the respondent mother has chosen to continue her relationship with a violent, controlling individual on whom she is completely dependent. Additionally, the court found that the children had already endured difficulties in their lives, \u201cincluding the trauma of witnessing various domestic violence incidents and living in an environment of coercive control by the respondent father.\u201d Finally, the court found that the respondents \u201cremain unable to provide the day-to-day care these children need within a reasonable time.\u201d The record amply supports the court\u2019s finding that termination was in the best interests of the children. Therefore, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>that it was not clearly erroneous for the court to have found that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate the parental rights of the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Next, the respondents argue that the court improperly refused to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor children. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of the respondents\u2019 claim. On November 30, 2005, prior to trial, the court heard the motions filed by the parties. Counsel for the respondent father made an oral motion, asking the court to appoint a guardian ad litem for the children. The court heard arguments by the parties and denied the request for the appointment of a guardian ad litem. Subsequently, on March 29, 2007, the court articulated on the record the legal reasoning behind its decision. At the motions hearing, the respondent father\u2019s attorney argued for the appointment of a guardian ad litem because J was making statements that he wanted to be with his father and wanted to go home. The court asked the respondent mother\u2019s attorney if she had an opinion on the matter, and she stated that she would join in the motion of the respondent father\u2019s attorney for the reasons he articulated. In response, the attorney representing the petitioner asked the respondent father\u2019s attorney to articulate, given the case law, why a guardian ad litem was necessary. The attorney stated that he believed that the attorney representing the children might not be articulating what the children wanted but, instead, was representing what was in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The attorney representing the children then spoke, indicating that there was no conflict between the best interests of the children and what they had articulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>because their verbalizations were inconsistent. Furthermore, she stated that both children were at a developmental stage that precluded them from truly understanding the issues and even their desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In the articulation of its decision, the court began by citing the relevant statute, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129a (2), which provides in relevant part: \u201c[A] child shall be represented by counsel knowledgeable about representing such children who shall be appointed by the court to represent the child and to act as guardian ad litem for the child. The primary role of any counsel for the child including the counsel who also serves as guardian ad litem, shall be to advocate for the child in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct. When a conflict arises between the child\u2019s wishes or position and that which counsel for the child believes is in the best interest of the child, the court shall appoint another person as guardian ad litem for the child. The guardian ad litem shall speak on behalf of the best interest of the child and is not required to be an attorney-at-law but shall be knowledgeable about the needs and protection of children. ...\u201d The court then cited <em>In re Christina M., </em>280 Conn. 474, 908 A.2d 1073 (2006), for the proposition that \u201cit is necessary to establish a sufficient record for a trial court to inquire as to whether a conflict exists.\u201d The court found that the argument made by the respondent father\u2019s counsel was not persuasive. The court found that the respondent father had failed to show that both children expressed a wish to return to the family home, that the sentiments allegedly expressed by J were knowingly made and that the child was capable of expressing such a sentiment. Furthermore, the court noted, the respondent father\u2019s attorney did not request an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The court also found that the attorney representing the children did not perceive any conflict between her role as an advocate and her role as a guardian ad litem. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Finally, the court found that the children\u2019s attorney was \u201ca venerable practitioner in juvenile matters . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Whether a conflict exists between what is in the child\u2019s best interest and what a child wants is essentially a question of fact for the court. In addition to setting forth sufficient evidence to demonstrate a conflict, the respondents must also demonstrate that the alleged improper failure by the court to appoint a guardian ad litem affected the result of the trial. See <em>In re Brendan C., </em>89 Conn. App. 511, 521, 874 A.2d 826, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 917, 879 A.2d 893, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 910, 882 A.2d 669 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We agree that the respondent father did not provide enough information to enable the court to conclude that a conflict existed between what the children wanted and what their attorney believed was in their best interests. The respondent father\u2019s attorney mentioned only vague statements made by J. He did not request an evidentiary hearing on the issue when the children\u2019s attorney opposed the motion for a guardian ad litem. In <em>In re Christina M., </em>the respondents alleged that there was a conflict because one of the minor children had made representations to the court-appointed psychologist that she wanted to go home with her parents and that her parents took care of her and her sisters. <em>In re Christina M., </em>supra, 280 Conn. 493. In contrast, in the present case, the respondent father did not allege that either of his sons had made any representations to a third party of any kind, including a psychologist or some type of evaluator. In the present case, the respondent father argued that J was making statements that he wanted to be with his father and that he wanted to go home. Counsel\u2019s argument did not provide a sufficient basis for the court to find a conflict between what was in the best interests of the children and what they wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Even if the respondent father had made an offer of proof to support the finding of a conflict, he did not demonstrate that the court\u2019s failure to appoint a guardian ad litem affected the result of the trial. Under the statute, the guardian ad litem must speak on behalf of the best interests of the children, and the court found by clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children. In <em>In re Brendan C., </em>the court concluded that \u201c[h]ad a guardian ad litem been appointed, the guardian ad litem\u2019s duty would have been to advocate the best interest of the child, which was shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the termination of the respondents\u2019 parental rights. The child\u2019s counsel would have been free to advocate exclusively for the child\u2019s legal interests, which she maintains would be the same position she took during the trial. The respondents fail to explain how the addition of a person advocating for the termination of parental rights would change the result of the trial, which was termination.\u201d <em>In re Brendan C., </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 521. Because the respondents failed to explain how the court\u2019s failure to appoint a guardian ad litem would have affected the trial, their claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Last, the respondent father argues that the court improperly refused to acknowledge the children\u2019s therapist as an expert. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this issue. On March 10, 2006, Samantha Littman, a licensed professional counselor, testified regarding her interactions with the children. Littman was the licensed clinician in the safe home where the children were residing at the time of trial. At the time of trial, she had 3000 hours of supervised experience, including 100 hours of experience under direct supervision. In addition, Littman testified that she obtained her counselor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>license on January 30, 2006, a little less than six weeks prior to her testifying at the trial. The focus of her work was facilitating the children\u2019s getting along with one another and with the other children and staff at the safe house. Finally, Liftman was never present throughout an entire visit that the children had with the respondents. Nevertheless, she was able to testify regarding the existence of a \u201cbond\u201d between the children and the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u201c[T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. . . . The court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>88 Conn. App. 393, 398, 870 A.2d 1095 (2005). In order to qualify Liftman as an expert witness in the area of counseling, the respondent father had to demonstrate \u201cthat she had the special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue . . . that [her] skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and [that her] testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The court decided not to certify Liftman as an expert in the field of counseling. The court based its decision on the fact that Liftman was \u201cextremely new to the field.\u201d The court held, however, that it could still consider all of her testimony as a witness who had been able to observe the relevant parties in the case. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In the present case, the witness, Liftman, had been licensed for slightly fewer than six weeks prior to testifying at the trial. Although she had had many hours of supervised experience, she was still very new to the field, and therefore the court was hesitant to qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>her as an expert. The court acted well within its discretion by considering the amount of time she had been certified as a counselor in deciding whether to qualify her as an expert. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Whitten, </em>100 Conn. App. 730, 737, 918 A.2d 1056 (2007) (court considered fact that witness had thirty years experience in field in deciding to qualify witness as expert).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Even if the court had abused its discretion by refusing to qualify Littman as an expert, the respondent father\u2019s claim would be unsuccessful because he has failed to show the harmfulness of the evidentiary ruling. \u201cUnder the current and long-standing state of the law in Connecticut, the burden to prove the harmfulness of an improper evidentiary ruling is borne by the defendant. The defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>260 Conn. 466, 485, 797 A.2d 1101 (2002). The respondent father argued that \u201c[g]iven the importance of Liftman\u2019s testimony about the parent-child bond and the children\u2019s verbalizations about the parent-child relationship, the [c]ourt\u2019s refusal to recognize Ms. Littman as an expert went beyond mere harmless error.\u201d The court, however, held that it would consider her testimony as it related to her having observed the children and the respondents, even though she was not qualified as an expert witness. Moreover, the court recognized the existence of a bond between the children and the respondents but still held that termination was in the best interests of the children. Therefore, the respondent father failed to prove the harmfulness of the alleged improper evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\"> This list is not exhaustive, but it is fairly representative of the steps required by the court.
