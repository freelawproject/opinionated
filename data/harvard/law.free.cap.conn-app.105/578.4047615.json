Christensen, appeals from the judgment of the trial court finding in favor of the defendants, Linda L. Reed, Scott R. Reed and S &amp; P Ventures, LLC (S &amp; P). The plaintiff commenced a two count action against the defendants, seeking to quiet title to a certain right-of-way and seeking a declaratory judgment of an easement by necessity over the defendants\u2019 properties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that he was not entitled to an easement by necessity and (2) required him to have searched the titles of all of the abutting properties. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of the issues on appeal. The plaintiff owns a twenty-five acre parcel of land in Canterbury. The Reeds own property that abuts the plaintiffs parcel of land to the west, and S &amp; P owns property that was carved out of the Reeds\u2019 parcel, which, as a result, borders the Reeds\u2019 property to the west.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 properties have direct access to North Society Road, a highway in Canterbury. The root of the plaintiffs title to the property can be traced back to a deed dated January 15, 1880, from Francis B. Pellet to Thomas Shea. The deed contained a right-of-way, or easement, to access a wood lot retained by the plaintiffs predecessor in title. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>right-of-way was subject to a seasonal limitation from October 1 to April 1 of each year. This right-of-way appears only once in the chain of title of the parties between 1880 and 1984. The plaintiff acquired title to the property in 1984 by way of five quitclaim deeds and a sixth document, which contained an \u201c \u2018assignment of interest\u2019 . . . .\u201d None of the conveyances to the plaintiff contained a habendum clause or other language purporting to convey the right-of-way across the defendants\u2019 properties, despite the fact that without the right-of-way the parcel is landlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">On May 19, 2003, the plaintiff served his complaint, seeking (1) to quiet title to the right-of-way across the defendants\u2019 properties and (2) a declaratory judgment of an easement by necessity over the defendants\u2019 properties. On January 6, 2006, the court found in favor of the defendants on both counts. The court rejected count one of the plaintiffs claim on two grounds. First, the court concluded that the right-of-way had been abandoned because there was clear evidence of physical nonuse of the right-of-way, and it was absent from both the plaintiffs and the defendants\u2019 chains of title in subsequent recorded deeds. Second, the court held that the plaintiffs claim for the right-of-way was barred by the Marketable Record Title Act (act)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because the plaintiffs predecessors in title failed to include the easement in the deeds in the defendants\u2019 chains of title. As to count two of the complaint, the court concluded that the plaintiffs property is landlocked but not entitled to the claimed right-of-way because the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof in establishing an easement by necessity. Specifically, the court stated that \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>not abundantly clear<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> . . . that the plaintiff has any reasonable necessity for the claimed easement <em>over the defendants\u2019 property. </em>The defendants\u2019 property abuts the plaintiffs property to the west, but not to the north, south or east. The evidence does not establish that the plaintiffs property is inaccessible save over the defendants\u2019 lands; therefore, the court cannot find an easement by necessity.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly concluded that he was not entitled to an easement by necessity over the defendants\u2019 properties. This contention is twofold. First, the plaintiff asserts that the court improperly found facts and improperly applied the law as to easements by necessity. Second, the plaintiff contends that the court failed to distinguish between a license and an interest in real estate. We will consider each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"pAFmx\">The plaintiff claims that the court misapplied the law relating to easements by necessity when it concluded that his parcel was landlocked but held that he did not prove that reasonable enjoyment of the land required an easement by necessity. Particularly, the plaintiff argues that the court improperly found that there was no evidence that his parcel was inaccessible by an alternate means. In opposition, the defendants assert that the court properly found that there was no need for an easement by necessity because the plaintiff failed to satisfy his burden of proof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The plaintiffs claim raises a question of law, and, therefore, our review is plenary. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Tomas, </em>66 Conn. App. 146, 153, 783 A.2d 1226 (2001). \u201cThe court\u2019s factual findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole .... We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pender </em>v. <em>Matranga, </em>58 Conn. App. 19, 23, 752 A.2d 77 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cThe requirements for an easement by necessity are rooted in our common law. . . . [A]n easement by necessity -will be imposed where a conveyance by the grantor leaves the grantee with a parcel inaccessible save over the lands of the grantor, or where the grantor retains an adjoining parcel which he can reach only through the lands conveyed to the grantee. . . . [T]o fulfill the element of necessity, the law may be satisfied with less than the absolute need of the party claiming the right of way. The necessity element need only be a reasonable one.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>First Union National Bank </em>v. <em>Eppoliti Realty Co., </em>99 Conn. App. 603, 608, 915 A.2d 338 (2007). \u201cAlthough the requirements for an easement by necessity once included a showing of unity of ownership; <em>Hollywyle Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>[164 Conn. 389, 399, 324 A.2d 247 (1973)]; our Supreme Court has eliminated that requirement.\u201d <em>First Union National Bank </em>v. <em>Eppoliti Realty Co., </em>supra, 608 n.6. Moreover, although it is true that \u201c[a]n easement of necessity may occur when a parcel has become landlocked from outside access such that the owner would have no reasonable means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>of ingress or egress except over lands promised by another and a right-of-way is necessary for the enjoyment of the parcel . . . [t]he inverse also is true; that is, a common-law right-of-way based on necessity expires when the owner of a dominant estate acquires access to a public or private road through another means.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Pender </em>v. <em>Matranga, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he was entitled to the claimed right-of-way because it \u201cis the <em>exclusive manner of access </em>between [his] [property and the public highway known as North Society Road, and represents the <em>only </em>access to [his] [property from any highway.\u201d (Emphasis added.) At trial, the court concluded that the plaintiff had not satisfied his burden of proof as to the right-of-way being the \u201c \u2018exclusive manner of access\u2019 . . . .\u201d Particularly, the court found that the \u201cevidence presented to the court demonstrate[d] that the plaintiff and/or his guests had accessed his property on several occasions by alternate access routes. Additionally, the plaintiffs title searcher never completed a full title search on any of the abut-ters\u2019 properties to the north, south or east of the plaintiffs parcel. . . . [I]t is not abundantly clear to the court that the plaintiff has any reasonable necessity for the claimed easement <em>over the defendants\u2019 property.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The plaintiff challenges this decision claiming that under <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>49 Conn. 71 (1881), and its progeny<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the \u201claw presumes the intent of the common grantor (Francis B. Pellet) was to permit [the] easement to be for all purposes to ensure the \u2018most profitable use, the most beneficial enjoyment\u2019 of [the] easement . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) The plaintiff further contends that because the court found the parcel was landlocked, it should have then concluded that he was entitled to an easement by necessity. Thus, the plaintiff argues that the court misapplied the law in finding that there was no easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Conversely, the defendants argue that because the plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the right-of-way was the \u201cexclusive manner of access\u201d to his property, he had the burden of proving that the claimed right-of-way was the exclusive manner of access and that he failed to do so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In his reply brief, the plaintiff takes issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>with the defendants\u2019 argument concerning exclusivity, claiming that the term exclusive is merely an adjective and has no evidentiary value. The plaintiff asserts that under Connecticut case law there is no authority that requires proof of \u201cexclusivity\u201d for access in an easement by necessity claim. Although this contention may be an accurate characterization of the law, the plaintiff specifically chose to plead exclusivity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the court noted that although the plaintiff had not satisfied his burden of establishing exclusivity of access, he also did not adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he had a reasonable necessity. The court stated that \u201cit is not abundantly clear to the court that the plaintiff has any reasonable necessity for the claimed easement <em>over the defendants\u2019 property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In reaching its conclusion, the court took into account the evidence that on five separate occasions people gained access to the plaintiffs parcel of land by means other than through the defendants\u2019 land. The court also found that \u201cthe plaintiffs title searcher never completed a full title search on any of the abutters\u2019 properties to the north, south or east of the plaintiffs parcel.\u201d The Reeds argue that this was the correct result because \u201cthe plaintiff did not offer any evidence of a title search of the Shea chain of title to the north even though Shea was an abutter to the plaintiffs property and the same name had owned the abutting property for seventy consecutive years. . . . The . . . \u2018surrounding circumstances\u2019 considered by the trial court include [d] the plaintiffs failure to present evidence concerning any rights-of-way over the Shea parcel to the northeast of the plaintiffs land. It is likely that the 1880 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>right-of-way was limited to the winter months to drag wood across the frozen ground and wetlands to the west because the same person (Shea) probably owned the abutting property to the east and did not need an easement for any other purpose.\u201d (Citation omitted.) In reply, the plaintiff claims that the Reeds\u2019 argument is \u201cpure speculation.\u201d Pure speculation or not, the principal elements of an easement by necessity remain the same, which are whether a common grantor left a parcel landlocked and whether there is a reasonable necessity for ingress and egress over the burdened land. See <em>Pender </em>v. <em>Matranga, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 26. If there were other modes of ingress and egress, the plaintiff had the burden to prove, at the least, that the claimed right-of-way was reasonable and that the alternative modes did not exist. Here, even though the plaintiff claimed exclusivity of access, he did not meet even the minimum burden of reasonableness, nor did he demonstrate that there were no alternate reasonable modes of access. Thus, the court correctly concluded that because the plaintiffs title searcher never completed a full search, it was not convinced that the plaintiffs property is \u201cinaccessible save over the defendants\u2019 lands . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the court failed to distinguish between a license and an interest in real property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The plaintiff asserts that the court\u2019s finding that the \u201cevidence does not establish that the plaintiffs property is inaccessible save over the defendants\u2019 lands\u201d indicates that the court misunderstood the law concerning licenses because a license does not convey an interest in land. \u201c[A] license in real property is a mere privilege to act on the land of another, which does not produce an interest in the property . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mulle </em>v. McCauley, 102 Conn. App. 803, 814 n.2, 927 A.2d 921, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 907, 931 A.2d 265 (2007). \u201cGenerally, a license to enter [a] premises is revocable at any time by the licensor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 163, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992). \u201c[A] license must be exercised only in the manner and for the special purpose for which consent was given.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Grossman Shoes, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 229, 237, 440 A.2d 302 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The plaintiff argues that because the court considered the permissive entries onto his land, it misapplied the law concerning easements and licenses. Specifically, the plaintiff points to the evidence that on five different occasions his parcel was accessed by means other than the claimed right-of-way because he sought permission from his neighbors. The plaintiff claims that because he was given permission by his neighbors, which would create a revocable license, this fact does not mean that he had alternate modes of access to his parcel. S &amp; P argues that \u201c[r]egardless of whether the plaintiffs property could be accessed through [a] license or through an interest in real estate, the plaintiff had to prove exclusivity of access to prove the allegations of his complaint.\u201d We agree with S &amp; P. Although the plaintiff might have had a license on those five separate occasions, this does not change the fact that he failed to meet his burden of proof to establish the claimed easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly required him to have searched the titles to all of the abutting properties. The plaintiff argues that because the court found one common grantor for the defendants\u2019 and plaintiff\u2019s properties, requiring a full search of the titles of the owners of abutting property was irrelevant to ascertaining the intent of the common grantor. Furthermore, he claims that the word \u201cexclusive\u201d does not require such a search of the abutting property. S &amp; P disagrees, asserting that the court did not misapply the law because a title search was just \u201cone way that the plaintiff could have met his burden to show that the one easement he sought over the defendants\u2019 property was the only means of access.\u201d S &amp; P correctly asserts that a full title search of all of the abutting properties would have shown whether there were other easements that were not in the plaintiffs chain of title but may have been in one of the abutting owners\u2019 chains of title.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff had the burden to prove that there were no reasonable alternate modes of access, and he failed to satisfy this burden. Thus, the court correctly concluded that he did not satisfy his burden of proof and that the evidence concerning the abutting property would not have satisfied his burden, particularly where one of the abutting properties was owned by a Shea, which was the name of one of the plaintiffs predecessors in title. We agree with the court that such a search would have disclosed the existence or absence of another means of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> The plaintiff is appealing from only the portion of the judgment concerning count two of his complaint, asserting that he is entitled to an easement by necessity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> The court found that the property now owned by the Reeds and S &amp; P was once one parcel of land. Moreover, the plaintiff and the defendants share a common grantor, Francis B. Pellet. \u201cThe language regarding a right-of-way is contained solely in the plaintiff\u2019s chain of title from Pellet to [Thomas] Shea. The defendants\u2019 chains of title, from Francis B. Pellet to Mary S. Chase, dated March 14,1889, at Volume 29, Page 416 of the Canterbury land records, contains no habendum clause or reservation of a right-of-way in the name of the grantor of the servient estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-33b through 47-331. General Statutes \u00a7 47-33c provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person . . . who has an unbroken chain of title to any interest in land for forty years or more, shall be deemed to have a marketable record title to that interest . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\"> We do not conclude that the court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cabundantly clear\u201d indicates that the court employed a higher standard of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\"> On appeal, S &amp; P also asserts alternate grounds for affirmance, claiming that the plaintiff abandoned the easement and that the easement is barred by the act. Because we conclude that the plaintiff failed to satisfy his burden of proof that he was entitled to an easement by necessity, we need not address these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\"> At trial, the plaintiff testified that he and several individuals had accessed his property on five different visits by means other than the claimed right-of-way:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">\u201cQ. [W]hen the historical society went to your property, did they access it through the cart path or through an alternate access?</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\u201cA.

Correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The plaintiff further testified: \u201cI always had to obtain permission to access my lot 6.1 could never go over it freely. ... I could not have accessed lot 6, other than my cart path, had they [his neighbors] refused [access].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\"> The plaintiffs contentions rest on his analysis of Connecticut case law concerning easements by necessity starting with <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>supra, 49 Conn. 71. The plaintiff argues that under the <em>Myers </em>definition of an easement by necessity, all he had to establish was that the \u201cowner of land has a right to the most profitable use, the most beneficial enjoyment thereof . . . .\u201d Moreover, under later decisions, the plaintiff argues citing <em>Hollywyle Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>supra, 164 Conn. 398-99, that this definition was expanded to include a broader definition of necessity, which can be fulfilled by a less than absolute need of the party claiming the right-of-way. Thus, the plaintiff claims that he satisfied his burden of showing that he was entitled to an easement by necessity. The plaintiff, however, did not rely on this case law as the theory under which he commenced the action. Instead, the plaintiff asserted that the claimed right-of-way was the <em>exclusive </em>means of access to his property. Parties cannot raise claims on appeal that are not raised at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\"> Even though S &amp; P stated in its brief that \u201c [i]f the plaintiff had not alleged exclusivity in his complaint, it is not clear whether he could have stated a cause of action for an easement by necessity,\u201d we agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that there was also no evidence to support the plaintiffs claim that he has a reasonable necessity for the claimed easement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> \u201cThe plaintiff is permitted to prove at trial a theory of liability not specifically pleaded if the pleadings give notice of the transactions or occurrences intended to be proved, and the defendant does not demonstrate any prejudice . . . .\u201d 61A Am.
