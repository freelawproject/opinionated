We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 22,2005, after a day of heavy snowfall, the defendant and another man, both armed and masked, broke into the Wethersfield apartment of Lincoln Marshall and assailed him. The defendant and his cohort bound Marshall\u2019s hands and feet and duct taped his face. Marshall was able to see somewhat with his right eye, which was not completely covered by the tape. The assailants beat Marshall, accosted him for money and rummaged through his apartment. They took Marshall\u2019s wallet, which contained $400, and demanded more money. After heating on Marshall\u2019s stove a knife that they found in his kitchen, the men repeatedly burned him with the knife so that he would tell them where he kept his money. They threatened to kill him. Marshall offered to collect money owed to him from a Hartford man named Brian. The assailants forced Marshall outside and into his car. They also placed in Marshall\u2019s car and another car approximately $12,000 worth of property they had removed from the apartment. When the defendant removed his mask, Marshall recognized him as Sticky Nelson, a local man from whom Marshall had purchased a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">After binding Marshall\u2019s ankles again and placing him in the backseat of his car, the defendant and his cohort drove Marshall to Brian\u2019s house to collect the debt, but Brian was not home. They next drove to the defendant\u2019s residence, where they removed from the car items that they had taken from Marshall\u2019s apartment. At this location, another man beat Marshall and threatened to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>him if he did not provide money. Finally, the men drove Marshall to Weaver High School in Hartford, where they untied his hands and left him with his cellular telephone, on which they had dialed 911 for him. They drove away in another vehicle after one of them told Marshall: \u201cIf you come out, we\u2019re going to shoot you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Marshall informed the 911 operator that he was tied up, bleeding and in need of help. He told the operator that he knew one of the assailants, the defendant, and that the assailants were driving a black or dark blue Acura Legend. In response to the call, Officer Matthew Labbe of the Hartford police department arrived at Weaver High School, where he found a very frightened Marshall, ankles bound, in the backseat of his car. Labbe transported Marshall to a hospital, where he was treated for his injuries and later released. Detective Michael Patkoske of the Wethersfield police department led the investigation. On January 26, 2005, Marshall identified the defendant\u2019s photograph in an array shown to him by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The state charged the defendant with two counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) and (B), two counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) and (4), assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), two counts of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1) and (2), larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-134 (a). After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>was sentenced to a term of eighteen years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The defendant first claims that there was insufficient evidence to support finding him guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree with a dangerous instrument because the state failed to prove that he had planned prior to the robbery to use a knife during the robbery. More particularly, the defendant contends that to be guilty of a conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, he would have to have conspired to use the knife before entering Marshall\u2019s premises. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Our standard of review for a sufficiency of evidence claim is well established. \u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because [our Supreme Court] has held that a [trier\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Farnum, </em>275 Conn. 26, 32, 878 A.2d 1095 (2005). \u201cIn conducting our review, we are mindful that the finding of facts, the gauging of witness credibility and the choosing among competing inferences are functions within the exclusive province of the jury, and, therefore, we must afford those determinations great deference.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Conde, </em>67 Conn. App. 474, 490, 787 A.2d 571 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 927, 793 A.2d 251 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or (2) is armed with a deadly weapon; <em>or </em>(3) <em>uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; </em>or (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a). \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction under \u00a7 53a-48 (a), the state needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that a defendant intended that conduct constituting a crime be performed [and] (2) that he agreed with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>96 Conn. App. 533, 541, 901 A.2d 687, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>cert. denied, 280 Conn. 912, 908 A.2d 540 (2006). \u201c[T]he existence of a formal agreement between the conspirators need not be proved . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Rather, \u201c[a] conspiracy can be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>66 Conn. App. 724, 740, 785 A.2d 1209 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In this case, Marshall testified that the defendant and his cohort heated a knife and, as they demanded money, used it to bum Marshall on his nose, forehead, stomach and back. The fact that the assailants found the knife in the apartment fails to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s lack of intent to participate in this course of action. As long as the defendant had time to reflect and to deliberate on his actions, he can be held culpable for the requisite specific intent to commit a crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>161 Conn. 219, 222, 286 A.2d 304 (1971). From Marshall\u2019s testimony and other corroborating evidence, including Patkoske\u2019s testimony that a kitchen knife was found near Marshall\u2019s couch, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant conspired to use the knife during and in furtherance of the robbery. \u201cIt is only in rare instances that conspiracy may be established by proof of an express agreement to unite to accomplish an unlawful purpose. The combination or confederation may be proved by circumstantial evidence, that is, by proof of the separate acts of the individuals accused and by proof of circumstances from which the illegal confederation may be inferred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra, 66 Conn. App. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The evidence in this case manifests the defendant\u2019s complicity in robbery with a dangerous instrument. We therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>support a verdict of guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly admitted the recording of the 911 call, which includes Marshall\u2019s description of his injuries, as well as his identification of the defendant, under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Pursuant to \u00a7 8-3 (2) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, a spontaneous utterance is \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant alleges that Marshall\u2019s 911 statements should not have been admitted as a spontaneous utterance because (1) Marshall did not have an opportunity to observe the events leading to the statements he made to the 911 operator and (2) Marshall was not under the stress of circumstances required for the spontaneous utterance exception when he made the statements at issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The defendant claims that Marshall\u2019s 911 call should not have been admitted as a spontaneous utterance hearsay exception because Marshall did not have an opportunity to observe the events leading to the spontaneous utterance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>because Marshall\u2019s eyes were covered with duct tape, Marshall could not have observed the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>255 Conn. 113, 127, 763 A.2d 1 (2000). \u201cThe excited utterance exception [to the hearsay rule] is well established. Hearsay statements, otherwise inadmissible, may be admitted into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein when (1) the declaration follows a startling occurrence, (2) the declaration refers to that occurrence, (3) the declarant observed the occurrence, and (4) the declaration is made under circumstances that negate the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by the declarant. . . . Whether an utterance is spontaneous and made under circumstances that would preclude contrivance and misrepresentation is a preliminary question of fact to be decided by the trial judge. . . . The trial court has broad discretion in making that factual determination, which will not be disturbed on appeal absent an unreasonable exercise of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 41-42, 770 A.2d 908 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u201cConnecticut first recognized the spontaneous utterance exception in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Haritos, </em>100 Conn. 476, 124 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>A. 44 (1924). Our Supreme Court explained: This general principle is based on the experience that, under certain external circumstances of physical shock, a stress of nervous excitement may be produced ... by the external shock. Since this utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses, and during the brief period when considerations of self-interest could not have been brought fully to bear by reasoned reflection, the utterance may be taken as particularly trustworthy, . . . and thus as expressing the real tenor of the speaker\u2019s belief as to the facts just observed by him; and may therefore be received as testimony to those facts. . . . When the declaration follows some startling occurrence and is made with reference to it by one having an opportunity to observe the matter of which he speaks, and in such close connection to the event and under such circumstances as to negative the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication and to indicate that it was a spontaneous utterance growing out of the nervous excitement and mental and physical condition of the declarant, it is reasonably probable that it is trustworthy. The spontaneity of the utterance is the guaranty of its trustworthiness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>98 Conn. App. 288, 295, 908 A.2d 1097, cert. granted on other grounds, 280 Conn. 950, 912 A.2d 484 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The test of whether a declarant sufficiently observed the subject of his spontaneous utterance is \u201cwhether the evidence supports a finding that the declarant had an opportunity to observe the matters described in his or her statement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Westberry, </em>68 Conn. App. 622, 631, 792 A.2d 154, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 792 A.2d 519 (2002). In this case, the state presented evidence that Marshall not only observed but also experienced the events in question. Marshall testified that his vision was not completely obscured by the duct tape, that he recognized the defendant to be a man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>known as \u201cSticky\u201d and that he recognized landmarks and streets out of the back car window. Marshall also testified that he heard the defendant\u2019s cohort refer to the defendant as \u201cSticky.\u201d Having heard this evidence, the jury was free to afford it \u201cwhatever weight it deemed appropriate in its deliberations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Westberry, </em>supra, 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Because the evidence supports the fact that Marshall had an opportunity to observe the matter of which he spoke, the defendant\u2019s claim that Marshall did not observe the events leading to the statements he made during the 911 call must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The defendant additionally submits that Marshall\u2019s 911 call should not have been admitted as a spontaneous utterance because Marshall\u2019s statements to the 911 operator were not made under stress sufficient to negate the opportunity for fabrication. More particularly, the defendant asserts that even if Marshall was under stress when he began the 911 call, he was calmer and capable of deliberating by the time he identified the defendant to the operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">We reiterate that \u201c[w]hether an utterance is spontaneous ... is a preliminary question of fact to be decided by the trial judge [and that] [t]he trial court has broad discretion in making that factual determination, which will not be disturbed on appeal absent an unreasonable exercise of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>280 Conn. 361, 374, 908 A.2d 506 (2006). \u201cThe requirement that a spontaneous utterance be made under such circumstances as to [negate] the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by the declarant . . . does not preclude the admission of statements made after a startling occurrence as long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>as the statement is made under the stress of that occurrence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cMoreover, <em>that </em>a statement is made in response to a question does not preclude its admission as a spontaneous utterance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In this case, the defendant\u2019s contention that Marshall\u2019s 911 call should not have been admitted as a spontaneous utterance because Marshall was not under sufficient stress when he identified the defendant is unpersuasive. \u201c[T]he application of the [spontaneous utterance] exception entails a uniquely fact bound inquiry. The overarching consideration is whether the declarant made the statement before he or she had the opportunity to undertake a reasoned reflection of the event described therein.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Westberry, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">It is clear that Marshall, who had been robbed, burned, beaten, threatened with murder, forcibly removed from his apartment, tied up, driven around for an extended period of time and abandoned in wintry conditions, experienced grave stress during his entire conversation with the 911 operator. \u201cI\u2019m still tied up,\u201d he told the operator. \u201c[T]hey burned and cut me. . . . [The blood] is all over my face and my head right now. Please send help.\u201d He exclaimed, \u201cOh, God,\u201d several times. Even after identifying the defendant as one of his kidnappers, Marshall was distressed enough to get out of the car in freezing conditions, his feet bound, so that the responding police officer would be able to find him. \u201cPlease get back in your car,\u201d urged the operator. \u201cThe weather is not in [any] condition for you to walk anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, Marshall\u2019s statements during the 911 call were made under circumstances sufficiently stressful, indeed painful, to negate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by Marshall. \u201cThe principle [justifying the spontaneous utterance hearsay exception] rests upon the common experience that utterances made under such circumstances are void of self-interest and are in the same category as exclamations of pain.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Haritos, </em>supra, 100 Conn. 484-85. Considering the infliction of injuries that Marshall experienced during the robbery, as well as the apparent pain and fear that he felt during the telephone call, we find unavailing the defendant\u2019s allegation that Marshall\u2019s statements to the 911 operator were not made under stress sufficient to negate the opportunity for fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Marshall\u2019s statement to the 911 operator as a spontaneous utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court should not have permitted the jury to hear the recording of the 911 call because it was prejudicial and because it improperly accredited witness testimony. The defendant specifically argues that due to the emotional nature of the tape of the 911 call and the fact that it was introduced during the state\u2019s direct examination of Marshall, the tape served to bolster Marshall\u2019s testimony with prior consistent statements in violation of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brisco, </em>84 Conn. 120, 132, 852 A.2d 746, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 944, 861 A.2d 1178 (2004). \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>trial court, because of its intimate familiarity with the case, is in the best position to weigh the relative merits and dangers of any proffered evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>32 Conn. App. 773, 782, 631 A.2d 333 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>44 Conn. App. 307, 689 A.2d 494, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 924, 692 A.2d 819 (1997), this court determined that a trial court\u2019s decision to permit a jury to hear a 911 call was proper because the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence. \u201cWe have previously outlined four situations where prejudice to the defendant could outweigh the probative value of evidence. These are: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it. . . . We have also noted, however, that ultimately, [a] trial court has broad discretion in determining whether the probative value of proffered evidence is outweighed by the prejudice that is likely to result from its admission. . . . We will not overturn its decision absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201cBecause of the inherent difficulties in weighing these considerations against the need for relevant evidence, the resolution of this determination has been traditionally entrusted to the trial court. . . . Eveiy reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling, and reversal will ensue only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>appears to have been done. . . . Prejudice is not measured by the significance of the evidence which is relevant but by the impact of that which is extraneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s admission of the recording of the 911 call served to accredit Marshall\u2019s testimony is without merit. The court explained to counsel that the purpose of admitting the 911 call pertained to its relevance: \u201c[T]he evidence offered is relevant in that the exhibit tends to establish that a violent crime had occurred. The crying and upset that is heard on the tape is relevant to the defendant\u2019s intent to cause serious physical injury. The jury could find that the witness was upset due to the infliction of injury. The jury could further find [that] physical force was used and further verif[y] how long the witness was in the car, [which is] relevant, obviously, to the counts of kidnapping. The length of time is also relevant to this witness\u2019 identification of the defendant, how long a look he was able to get. It also verifies the fact that at one point in time, the individual in the car with him, [in] the BMW, was referred to as \u2018Sticky.\u2019 It further establishes, obviously, the violent nature of the attack. The defendant herein [was] charged with robbery first degree, assault [in the] first degree and kidnapping. Obviously, that evidence is relevant with respect to those counts. The court therefore finds that the probative value of this proffered evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Nowhere in its charge to the jury did the court suggest that the 911 call accredited or supported Marshall\u2019s testimony. Rather, the court instructed the jury that \u201cany conduct or statement of a witness which you find consistent with any other conduct or statement of that witness you may also consider in weighing the credibility of that witness.\u201d Such credibility determinations factor into jury determinations about the relevance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>testimonial evidence. Moreover, the court explained that it found the 911 call relevant in establishing that a crime had occurred. \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue . . . [E]vidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the conclusion [for which it is offered], even to a slight degree. ... So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 549, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Suckley, </em>26 Conn. App. 65, 72, 597 A.2d 1285, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 901, 600 A.2d 1028 (1991), in support of his claim that the court\u2019s admission of the 911 call violated the Connecticut rules of evidence. The facts of this case, however, unlike the facts of <em>Suckley, </em>do not require the application of \u00a7 6-11 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides in relevant part that \u201cthe credibility of a witness may not be supported by evidence of a prior consistent statement made by the witness.\u201d See C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 6.27.2, p. 440 (discussing prohibition of \u201c[e]vidence accrediting or supporting a witness\u2019s honesty or integrity [before] the witness\u2019s credibility has first been attacked\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Suckley, </em>we concluded that the court\u2019s admission of a photograph unrelated to the charges was improper because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the court admitted the photograph to bolster a witness\u2019 credibility rather than for its relevance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Suckley, </em>supra, 72. In this case, the reverse is true: the court permitted the jury to hear the 911 call, which related to the charges, for its relevance and not to bolster witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Because the recording tended to support the fact that a robbery had occurred, the court acted within its discretion in admitting it. \u201cAll that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>265 Conn. 669, 680, 830 A.2d 193 (2003). The 911 recording was not unfairly prejudicial; although the jury may have detected suffering and fear in Marshall\u2019s voice, we cannot conclude that the recording unduly aroused the jury\u2019s emotions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>91 Conn. App. 112, 122-23, 881 A.2d 371, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 909, 886 A.2d 423 (2005). With or without the aid of a tape, a reasonable person would assume a person in Marshall\u2019s position to be distressed. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The tape also was not cumulative because it presented new material. \u201c[I]f evidence presents new matter, it is obviously not cumulative with evidence previously received.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 122. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>this court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a 911 recording because \u201c[t]he prosecutor questioned [the witness] about the events leading to the call, then played the recording and questioned her about the events following the call.\u201d Id., 123. Similarly, in this case, the recording of the 911 call presented matters not covered by Marshall\u2019s testimony, such as the fact that Marshall was disoriented, the fact that Marshall was bleeding profusely and the nature of Labbe\u2019s rescue of Marshall.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the jury to hear the recording of the 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the court improperly charged the jury that it could use out-of-court statements to accredit witness testimony. Specifically, the defendant alleges that the court\u2019s instruction that the jury could consider witness testimony consistent with prior statements by the same witness allowed the jury to accredit the statements Marshall made during the 911 call in violation of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The defendant did not preserve his claim at trial but seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We conclude, however, that this claim is not reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because the claimed instructional error is evidentiary in nature and is not of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u201cEvidentiary claims do not merit review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 239-40], because they are not of constitutional magnitude. [R]obing garden variety claims [of an evidentiary nature] in the majestic garb of constitutional claims does not make such claims constitutional in nature. . . . Putting a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim will no more change its essential nature than calling a bull a cow will change its gender.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cromety, </em>102 Conn. App. 425, 431, 925 A.2d 1133, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 912, 931 A.2d 932 (2007). We decline to review the defendant\u2019s fourth claim, as it fails under the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the prosecutor improperly commented on the 911 call during final argument to the jury. The defendant alleges that the prosecutor aroused the passions of the jury by describing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Marshall\u2019s ordeal as an \u201cunimaginable horror\u201d and that he vouched for the veracity of Marshall\u2019s statements by reminding the jury that Marshall identified the defendant during the 911 call. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Our Supreme Court has established an analytical framework for reviewing cases involving alleged prose-cutorial impropriety<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to which no objection was raised at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 849 A. 2d 626 (2004). \u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. ... As we have indicated, our determination of whether any improper conduct by the state\u2019s attorney violated the defendant\u2019s fair trial rights is predicated on the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987)], with due consideration of whether that [impropriety] was objected to at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 361-62, 897 A.2d 569 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u201c[P]rosecutorial [impropriety] of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments. ... In determining whether such [impropriety] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>has occurred, the reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Moreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case. . . . This heightened duty derives from . . . the special role played by the state\u2019s attorney in a criminal trial. He is not only an officer of the court . . . but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [is] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Camacho, </em>282 Conn. 328, 367-68, 924 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 956, 128 S. Ct. 388, 169 L. Ed. 2d 273 (2007). \u201cIf the accused be guilty, he should [nonetheless] be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury ha[s] no right to consider.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Skakel, 276 Conn. 633, 745-46, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">It is well established that \u201ca prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the evidence in the record. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony, which is not the subject of proper closing argument. ... A prosecutor may invite the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; however, he or she may not invite sheer speculation unconnected to evidence. . . . Moreover, when a prosecutor suggests a fact not in evidence, there is a risk that the jury may conclude that he or she has independent knowledge of facts that could not be presented to the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 400, 832 A.2d 14 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s specific allegations of prosecutorial impropriety during closing argument, noting that defense counsel raised no objection to the state\u2019s rebuttal arguments. Although that fact is by no means dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal, we nevertheless consider it in reviewing the merits of an unpreserved claim of prosecutorial impropriety. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 769 n.107.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u201cAs a general matter, a prosecutor may use any evidence properly admitted at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Camacho, </em>supra, 282 Conn. 377. In <em>Camacho, </em>our Supreme Court held a prosecutor\u2019s use of a 911 recording during closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>argument to be proper. Id., 378. \u201c[T]he prosecution, with its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is not to be denied the right to prove every essential element of the crime by the most convincing evidence it is able to produce.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">During his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor in this case made the following statements: \u201cI would submit to you [that] when you listen to this tape, you\u2019re not listening to someone who\u2019s reflecting. What you\u2019re listening to is a terrified, terribly emotional man who has just gone through an unimaginable horror. And he does identify [the defendant] on that tape, and he does so twice.\u201d As we have noted, the recording of the 911 call was admitted as a full exhibit. Accordingly, it fell within the rule as previously explained under our case law that \u201c[a]n exhibit offered and received as a full exhibit is in the case for all purposes.\u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn. 518, 525, 457 A.2d 656 (1983). Furthermore, these allegedly improper statements were consistent with the purposes the court cited for admitting the tape into evidence, namely, to establish that a robbery had been committed, that injuries had been inflicted on Marshall and that he had spent a considerable amount of time with the defendant he identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">It is significant that the comments the defendant now complains of were made during the state\u2019s rebuttal argument. We have held that where \u201c[i]t is clear that the prosecutor merely was marshaling the evidence for the fact finder to consider when assessing the credibility of the witnesses . . . the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not improper.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>John M., </em>87 Conn. App. 301, 313, 865 A.2d 450, cert. granted on other grounds, 273 Conn. 916, 871 A.2d 372 (2005). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the prosecutor\u2019s statements did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>improperly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions but, rather, marshaled the evidence to rebut defense counsel\u2019s argument that Marshall reflected and deliberated before he spoke to the 911 operator. The prosecutor also did not vouch for the veracity of Marshall\u2019s statements. Rather, he countered the allegation made during defense counsel\u2019s final argument that Marshall told the 911 operator that he could not identify his attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Because we do not find it reasonably likely that the prosecutor\u2019s comments confused the jury or prejudiced the defendant in this case, we conclude that the commentary at issue did not rise to the level of prosecutorial impropriety. \u201cA prosecutor ... is permitted to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the [fact finder] might draw therefrom . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 313. In this case, the prosecutor merely urged the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the facts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>supra, 276 Conn. 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Having rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the 911 recording during closing argument constituted prosecutorial impropriety, we need not reach the issue of whether prosecutorial impropriety deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or (2) is armed with a deadly weapon; or (3) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\"> The court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cIn this [ninth] count, [the state] must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, that when he made such agreement with another person, the defendant had the specific intent to wrongfully take property from Marshall and \u201cto permanently deprive him of his property or to permanently appropriate it to himself or to a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>person by the use of physical force, and he further intended that during the robbery he or another person would use a dangerous instrument; to wit, a knife.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> The defendant additionally claims that the court improperly ruled that the 911 tape was admissible as a nontestimonial statement. Even if Marshall\u2019s statements were testimonial, as the defendant suggests, their admission would not be barred by the confrontation clause, which \u201cdoes not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 60 n.9, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). Because Marshall testified at trial and was cross-examined by the defendant, we need not address the issue of whether the statements he made during the 911 call were testimonial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> The tape of the 911 call was admitted as a full exhibit and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u201c[911 Operator]: . . .
