Co., </em>147 Conn. 305, 305, 160 A.2d 484 (1960). We share that sentiment in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">This foreclosure action returns to our court a second time. See <em>Wells Fargo Bank of Minnesota, N.A. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>98 Conn. App. 72, 909 A.2d 526 (2006). The defendant Herbert C. Morgan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following a judgment of foreclosure by sale, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying both his motion to open and set aside the May 9, 2005 orders accepting the report of the committee of sale and his \u201cmotion for revocation of committee deed and restoration of title.\u201d He claims that the court abused its discretion by (1) denying his motion for revocation and restoration and (2) confirming the sale. Because the record before us is inadequate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>we decline review and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On November 3, 2004, the plaintiff, Wells Fargo Bank of Minnesota, N.A., Trustee, commenced a mortgage foreclosure action against the defendant on the subject property located in Danbury. After the defendant was defaulted for failing to appear in a timely manner, the court on January 10, 2005, issued an order rendering a judgment of foreclosure by sale. The court set a sale date of March 5, 2005, ordered the appointment of a committee to make the sale and issued further orders in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 49-25. On March 5, 2005, the committee held an auction to sell the subject property. Upon conclusion of the auction, the committee executed a bond for deed with the successful bidder and collected the deposit requirement from this purchaser in the form of a bank check in the amount of $25,500. The committee then deposited the bank check with the Danbury Superior Court. On May 9, 2005, the court entered an order that, inter alia, approved the committee sale. The court also entered an order requiring the defendant to vacate the subject property on or before the date set by the committee for the closing of title and to deliver possession to the purchaser at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">On May 31, 2005, the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment and set aside the orders of May 9, 2005. On June 3, 2005, prior to any court action on the defendant\u2019s motion, the committee conducted a closing on the subject property. On June 14, 2005, the parties appeared for a hearing on the motion to open, at the conclusion of which the court concluded that \u201cthe motion to open the judgment and set aside the orders of May 9 is denied. The court . . . doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction because the sale was approved prior to the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>of the motion.\u201d From that judgment, the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">On appeal, the precise question before the court was a jurisdictional one. Specifically, we defined the issue presented as \u201cwhether the court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the defendant\u2019s motion to open and set aside the court\u2019s orders of May 9, 2005, approving the foreclosure sale of the subject property, because the motion was filed after the approval of the sale.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank of Minnesota, N.A. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 77. We concluded that \u201cthe proceedings to enforce the court\u2019s May 9, 2005 orders were automatically stayed when the defendant filed his motion to open and set aside on May 31, 2005, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 63-1 and 61-11.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank of Minnesota, N.A. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 77-78. As a result, we held that \u201cthe court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the defendant\u2019s motion to open and set aside the court\u2019s May 9, 2005 orders . . . .\u201d Id., 84. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Thereafter, the parties returned to the trial court to argue the merits of the defendant\u2019s May 31,2005 motion to open. In addition, the defendant filed a \u201cmotion for revocation of committee deed and restoration of title.\u201d It stated: \u201cConsistent with the appellate decision released on October 17, 2006, [the] defendant objects to [the] plaintiffs motion to compel dated November 8, 2006 and moves to vacate confirmation of the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>and revoke the committee deed filed on the Danbury land records which deed the decision renders a legal nullity, in order that title be restored in the defendant so that he may be able to proceed to refinance the subject mortgage and exercise his right of redemption according to the [G]eneral [Statutes.\u201d He did not provide an accompanying memorandum of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The court held a hearing on December 11, 2006, during which it heard testimony. At the conclusion thereof, the court issued an order denying the defendant\u2019s motions to open the judgment and to revoke the committee deed. The order further provided that \u201c[t]he committee shall reexecute a new original committee deed to be filed on the land records\u201d and that \u201cthe committee\u2019s motion for possession dated March 7, 2005 ... is granted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion for reargument and clarification, which the court denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the denial of his motion to open. Rather, he claims that the court abused its discretion by confirming the sale and by denying his motion for revocation and restoration. The record before us is inadequate to review those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide this court with an adequate record for review. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-10. Without an adequate record, we are left to speculation and conjecture; <em>Gelormino </em>v. <em>Liberman, </em>36 Conn. App. 153, 154, 649 A.2d 259, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 946, 653 A.2d 826 (1994); which \u201chave no place in appellate review.\u201d <em>Narumanchi </em>v. <em>DeStefano, </em>89 Conn. App. 807, 815, 875 A.2d 71 (2005). The record in the present case does not contain a written memorandum of decision or a signed transcript of an oral decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>by the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Despite that infirmity, the defendant did not attempt to obtain a statement of the court\u2019s reasoning pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendant did not request an articulation of the court\u2019s judgment, as permitted by Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. \u201c[A]n articulation is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification. ... An articulation may be necessary where the trial court fails completely to state any basis for its decision ... or where the basis, although stated, is unclear. . . . The purpose of an articulation is to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fantasia </em>v. <em>Milford Fastening Systems, </em>86 Conn. App. 270, 283, 860 A.2d 779 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 919, 866 A.2d 1286 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The defendant has failed to meet his burden of providing this court with an adequate record for review. He has provided us with neither a memorandum of decision nor an articulation from the trial court providing the legal and factual bases of its decision. Without a sufficient record, we cannot engage in meaningful review of the court\u2019s decision. See <em>Bebry </em>v. <em>Zanauskas, </em>81 Conn. App. 586, 594, 841 A.2d 282 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-9\"> Although several subsequent encumbrancers also were named as defendants in this action, they are not parties to this appeal. We therefore refer to Morgan as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\"> Leaving no doubt as to the basis for reversal, this court stated: \u201cBecause the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion [to open] was based exclusively on jurisdictional grounds . . . our reversal is strictly limited to that claim. Whether the defendant\u2019s motion is without merit is a question for the trial court to decide on remand.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank of Minnesota, N.A. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 78 n.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b884-8\"> The court also approved the committee\u2019s updated affidavit of fees and awarded the plaintiff $500 in additional attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\"> The defendant did not file a complete transcript of the December 11, 2006 hearing with this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f the trial judge fails to file a memorandum of decision or sign a transcript of the oral decision . . . the appellant may file with the appellate clerk a notice that the decision has not been filed in compliance with subsection (a). . . Section 64-1 (b) establishes the procedure to be followed by an appellant in the event that the trial court fails to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a). <em>Chase, Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 608, 710 A.2d 190 (1998). An appellant who fails to utilize this procedure fails to ensure an adequate record for review. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
