The testatrix, who was a widow, in the year 1864, had in her possession, and belonging to her, four trunks filled with wearing, apparel, household linen, blankets and bedding, containing also -a piece of plate, some plated ware, gold headed canes, opera glasses, chessmen and some ornaments of trilling value. She also had in her possession, and belonging to her, a tin box containing some articles of jewelry, including some articles belonging to a deceased parent, a watch and eyeglass. At the same time she owned a leather traveling valise and its contents, then deposited with a friend. It contained jewelry belonging to herself, as well as personal ornaments belonging to her deceased husband in his life time. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>then, owned no other trunks containing wearing apparel, household linen or stuffs, silver or jewelry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">In the same year she executed an instrument admitted to probate by the proper officer, as her last will and t\u00e9stament. In it, among other things, she bequeaths to the plaintiff, her sister, \u201call her wearing apparel, household linen or stuff, and jewelry not\u201d thereinafter specifically bequeathed, which \u201c was <em>then </em>contained in eight trunks, together with the said trunks,\u201d as her separate estate, and in case of her death before the testatrix, she gives the same to two children of her sister\u2019s husband. She next bequeaths therein a silver tea set to. one of such children. After several general devises and legacies, she bequeaths thereby one half part of all her residuary estate to a friend, and the other half to the same two children of her sister\u2019s husband, with a bequest over in case of their decease or incompetency, to the same friend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">The testatrix, until the time of her death, remained in possession of the four trunks, with the tin box before mentioned, and their contents, and continued to own the valise, so deposited for safekeeping, with its contents, and did' not own any other trunk, containing any wearing apparel, household linen and stuffs, silver or jewelry.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-7\"><em>B. D. Silliman, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-8\"><em>Albert Matthews, </em>for. the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A0-\">Robertson, Ch. <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Al6\">The contest in this case is respecting the contents of the valise in the hands of a third party at the time of the death of the testatrix, which the residuary legatees claim under the general residuary bequest. I do not perceive any-great difficulty in the construction of the specific bequest. It is contended that the words \u201c which is now contained in eight trunks, together with said trunks,\" are not mere words of description, but limit the general term \u201call.\u201d There can be no doubt that if the testatrix had had articles of the kind described, in eight trunks, besides others of the same kind, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>specific legatee could only have taken those in 'such trunks ; but in this case she did not have any jewelry in a trunk, unless the valise be one ; and she had some in that. The bequest as to jewelry, must therefore fail, unless the contents of such valise pass thereby. The bequest must be construed so as to take effect upon something, if possible, consistently with.legal rules of construction. When the whole of a description does not correspond with any existing subject, but a part does, the residue of it beyond such part may be disregarded as erroneous and surplusage. In the present case the words are \u201c all my wearing apparel, &amp;c.\u201d and not \u201call of my wearing apparel, &amp;c.\u201d which would admit of some . further description with a , relative. pronoun referring to and limiting it. As it \"stands, the first part of the sentence is capable of being construed by itself, is applicable to an existing subject; while the subsequent words which defeat the whole bequest as to jewelry, being inapplicable to any existing subject, may be disregarded, without altering the sense, and should be so to prevent such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Evidence was given on the trial -to show that some of the articles of jewelry contained in the valise did not belong to the testatrix, but to her husband or his executors. If so, of course she could not bequeath them, but that would not prevent the bequest from taking effect upon what was hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the articles of jewelry belonging to the testatrix contained -in the valise deposited with Mr. Martin, with costs to be paid out of the estate. Findings of fact may be prepared by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and submitted to me according to this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
