The passage by the common council of the city of New York, in the year 1855, of a resolution which permitted the plaintiffs (a company formed under the general act of 1848, <em>Sess. laws </em>W. <em>Y. </em>1848, <em>p. </em>48, authorizing the formation of gas light companies,) to lay main gas pipes|in a certain designated district in such city; upon condition of forthwith laying them, and of supplying thereby within, two years, gas to be used by the corporate authorities of such city, or private consumers, but reserving the right of revoking such permission for cause, together with the acceptance by the plaintiff of such permission, with all its conditions and reservations, constituted a valid and binding contract on the part of the plaintiffs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-9\">2. The obligation incurred by gas companies formed under such act, to perform all conditions, and observe all restrictions annexed by municipal authorities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>their consent, under such act, for laying gas pipes within the limits of their jurisdiction, when the former accepted such consent, formed a consideration for a contract by such municipal authorities, and the authority to impose such conditions and restrictions, on the grant of such consent coupled with the duty of such municipal authorities to light streets and highways, operated as a grant to them of power to make a contract for the discharge of such duty.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-5\">3. By their acceptance of such consent, the plaintiffs, who were a company formed under such act, were bound, under the penalty of having their license revoked, to supply gas to be used by the defendants, as directed by their ordinances, until such license should be revoked.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-6\">4. The defendants were not rendered liable to the plaintiff for a higher price for gas furnished and lamps lit, than that fixed by a written agreement between them, for furnishing such gas and lighting such lamps for one year, by a mere notice from the plaintiffs that they would in future charge such higher price, when by such contract the defendants were entitled to lay mains in all the streets of a designated district, to which the plaintiffs were required to attach lateral pipes, so as to light public lamps; and where the former had, from time to time, ordered lamps to be placed by the latter at certain places, furnished them, and caused them to be put up and lighted under the direction of one of their officers, (the superintendent of lamps and gas;) but had only paid monthly for six years, the price fixed in such written contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-7\">6. Such written contract did not annul the previous contract made by the passage of the resolution by the defendants, and its acceptance by the plaintiffs, but was merely auxiliary to it, in fixing the compensation, and after its termination the price was left to be ascertained by the value of the gas consumed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-8\">6. After the expiration of the time fixed in such written contract, the prior general contract remained in force, binding the defendants to pay for all gas consumed under their direction, according to its reasonable value, notwithstanding it was not founded on sealed proposals, pursuant to public notice, or . given to the lowest bidder. An advertisement for such sealed proposals was not necessary where there was but one gas company in the district proposed to be lighted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-9\">7. The notice of charging a higher price than that specified in the written contract, not having been assented to, or acted upon by the defendants, could not bind them. Being liable nnder an existing contract only for the reasonable value of the gas consumed, the defendants could not be deemed to have acquiesced in any other standard of compensation from their mere silence; but having received, accepted and consumed the gas supplied to the public lamps by the plaintiffs, at their request, they are liable therefor on a <em>quantum meruit.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-10\">8.

The act authorizes the companies, formed under it to lay conductors for conducting gas through the streets of the city, with the consent of the municipal authorities, and \u201c under such reasonable regulations as they may prescribe/' In April, 1855, the defendants gave their consent to the plaintiffs to lay conductors in the streets, &amp;c. lying north of 79th street. The resolution giving consent contained a provision, as a condition for granting it, that the plaintiffs should proceed immediately to lay their mains in the district, and supply within two years, thereafter, gas to be used <em>by the corporate authorities, </em>or private consumers. The defendants reserved the right to revoke their permission to lay conductors, at any time. By resolutions of the common council, street lamps were placed in the streets, and connected with the gas mains of the plaintiffs. These lamps were erected from time to time by the defendants, to insure the lighting of the public streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-12\">On the 9th of July, 1858, an agreement <em>for one year </em>was. duly made between the plaintiffs and defendants, for lighting the public lamps. By the contract, the city had the right, from time to time, to order the mains of the plaintiffs to be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tended in and along all the streets, &amp;c. within the district, and the plaintiffs were required to attach their pipes to and prepare for lighting the public lamps ordered to be placed in said streets and furnished for that purpose by the city. The price fixed by the contract for furnishing gas was twenty-eight dollars and eighty cents, for each lamp, per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">No written contract has been made between the parties since, but the defendants have, from time to time, ordered' street lamps to be placed by the plaintiffs in different parts of their <em>district) </em>have furnished the lamps ; paid for their erection ; have caused the lamps to be lighted, and have paid for the gas consumed therein, at the rate specified in the written agreement. These payments were made monthly, or as bills were rendered therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">By ordinances of the corporation, the superintendent of lamps and gas is required to take charge of the lighting of public lamps and to place in the public streets all lamps directed by a resolution of the common council. There is no other gaslight' company in the said district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">The legislature has, from year to year, since 1855, authorized the defendants to raise an amount of money necessary for lighting the streets with gas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">The public lamps erected by the corporation have been lighted under the direction of the superintendent of lamps and gas. In the spring of 1864, authority was given by the legislature to the defendants to raise, by taxation, the money required for lighting, &amp;c. the streets, &amp;c. In the estimate furnished by the defendants to the legislature, the expense of lighting the plaintiffs\u2019 district was included. The money authorized to be raised was raised and appropriated by ordinance of the common council, for the above purpose.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-9\">On the 22d of August,' 1864, the plaintiffs notified the defendants, in writing, that on and after the first of September, 1864, they would charge the defendants at the rate of fifty dollars per annum for each street lamp lighted by them. No action has been taken by the defendants on the subject matter of the notice.- During the month of September, the street lamps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>were lighted by the \"plaintiffs under the previous resolutions and ordinances of the defendants, and by the direction of the superintendent of lamps and gas. The gas consumed in the street lamps,- in September, was 2,884,155-cubic feet,-and was worth the sum of $13,037.50, which is at the rate of $50 per annum for each lamp. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-4\">Since- September, the defendants have passed a resolution for lighting Eighth Avenue from 84th to 125th streets with gas ; and have notified the plaintiffs that the lamps would be lighted from the gas of the plaintiffs, in the same manner as the other street lamps. \u2022 . \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">Payment for the gas consumed in September, was duly demanded and refused.

Laws, C. N. Y. p. </em>214,) were fully confirmed by the act of 1732. <em>(Id. p. </em>250.) -An act, passed in 1830, relative to the administration of city affairs, did not affect -any question in. this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">\u2022 Section 23d of a statute passed in 1849, to amend such charter, requiring all the contracts of such corporation - to be made by heads of departments, <em>(Val.

Under that act- the plaintiffs became incorporated as stated in their charter,- among other things, \u201c for the purpose of manufacturing and supplying gas for lighting the streets, and the public and private buildings, &amp;c. in that part of the city above Seventy-ninth street.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">The act of 1849, creating departments in \u25a0 the city government, <em>(Val.

The duty of lighting the streets of the city being by law imposed upon the defendants, they are bound to pay the expense attending the discharge of that duty. <em>(Val. Laws, C. N. Y. p. </em>273, \u00a7 23. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York </em>v. <em>Furze, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>612. <em>Hutson </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>5 <em>Seld. </em>168.) The plaintiffs, by their charter, have authority from the legislature to manufacture and furnish gas to the defendants for lighting the streets in the district occupied by them. <em>(Ses</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>sion Laws of </em>1848, <em>p. </em>51, \u00a7 18.) In the discharge bf the duty imposed upon the defendants they have consumed gas of the plaintiffs worth $13,037.50, and proper demands have been made upon the comptroller for payment. And the defendants, by authority of the legislature in 1864, have received and now hold money enough to pay the amount claimed, raised expressly for the purpose of such payment, and appropriated by the common council therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-4\">II. Ho written agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants was necessary. The facts presented in the ease create a contract to pay for the gas consumed what the same was reasonably worth. The doctrine that corporations can be bound by implied contracts, to be deduced by inference from corporate acts, without either a vote or deed in writing, is established in this country with great clearness and solidity of argument. It cannot now be disputed. (3 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>291. <em>Bank of Columbia </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>299. <em>Bank of U. S. </em>v. <em>Dandridge, </em>12 <em>Wheat. </em>74. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Washington Ins. Co., </em>4 <em>Cowen, </em>645. <em>American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em>9 <em>Paige, </em>496. <em>Magell </em>v. <em>Kauffman, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>317. <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Van Vechten, </em>19 <em>John. </em>60.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">III. The plaintiffs, by the terms of the resolution of April 25, 1855, and by their charter, became bound to supply gas to be used by the corporate authorities as well as by private consumers, and if so, a reciprocal obligation arose on the part of the defendants to pay the value of the gas consumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">1. By the agreement made in July, 1858, continuing in force for one year, the value for that year was fixed at a certain rate for each lamp, and a pro rata price was to be paid for each additional hour. After the expiration of that agreement either party was at liberty, at any time, to refuse to be bound by the price therein named, and the measure of compensation for gas consumed after such refusal must necessarily be the actual value of the gas consumed. The notice of August, 1864, terminated any obligation on the part of the plaintiffs to be bound by such price after the first of September, 1864, and the reason assigned therein is abundantly suEcient to justify it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>2. If the rate named in that notice had been more than the gas was worth, a question might have arisen, which it is unnecessary now to consider, for it is conceded that the gas consumed was worth the rate specified in the notice and the amount claimed in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">IY. The defendants are liable to pay for gas consumed by . them, although not under a contract founded upon sealed bids and proposals, made under section 38 of the act of 1857, cited <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">1. That section only provides, <em>First. </em>That whenever a contract is \u201c made or let by authority of the common council,\u201d <em>(i. e. </em>whenever the common council shall direct a contract to be made or let,) such contract shall be made or let by the appropriate head of department, without further action on the part of the common council, and in the manner prescribed by their ordinances ; and <em>Secondly, </em>that whenever <em>\u201c </em>work is necessary to be done to complete or perfect a particular job, or any supply is necessary for a particular purpose, which work is to be xmdertaken, or supply furnished for the corporation, and the several parts of said work or supply shall together involve the expenditure of more than $250, the same shall be by contract,\u201d unless ordered otherwise, and all such contracts shall be given to the lowest bidder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">2. The claim here made evidently comes within neither clause of this section. As to it the general liability of the defendant to pay for what has been used by it or by its authority is unrestricted. The first clause was intended to apply to matters forming the subject of assessment. <em>(Sec Laws of </em>1861, <em>ch. </em>308, <em>p. </em>702.) The second clause has reference to a work undertaken and abandoned, and to laying in supplies of those articles which may be bought in quantity, such as coal, stationery, furniture, books, and the like. It is evident from the provisions of the whole section that it relates only to such matters as can properly be the subject of general competition, and can safely be awarded to the lowest bidder. When extended to matters not properly the subjects of competition, it ceases to accomplish its object, and defeats the intention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>legislature. <em>(See the People </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>17 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>584, <em>per Comstock, J. And The Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>The Mayor &amp;c. of New York, 4 Bosw. </em>89, <em>per Hoffman, J.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\">3. The provisions of section 38 are inconsistent, and without reference to the conduct of city affairs, unintelligible. The section must be interpreted by considering what it was intended to accomplish, what to prevent, and by regarding the circumstances of the case to which it is to be applied. As interfering in some degree with the rights of the corporation vested in it by its ancient charters, it must be limited to those things clearly intended to be affected by its provisions. ( <em>Val. Laws C. N. Y. p. </em>240, \u00a7 40.) Certainly that for which compensation is claimed in this case is not reached by it. \u25a0 This claim is neither for work done, nor supplies furnished, within the meaning- of the act. Under no circumstances would the manufacture and conducting of, gas to street lamps be a subject for general competition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">4. The act of 1848 is in conflict with the idea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">5. Too great outlay is required in preparing, for the manufacture of gas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-7\">6. The opening of streets for laying gas pipes by every one would be both impracticable and impossible. The legislature has recognized this, both in the act of 1848, already cited, and by their action in the tax levy of 1864, providing means to pay this very indebtedn\u00e9ss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-8\">Y. A statute should not be construed to work a public mischief. The construction claimed by the defendants would work a greater mischief than any the statute was intended to prevent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lambier, 5 Denio, </em>9.). The streets cannot be lighted except by using the gas of the plaintiffs. To plunge the streets into darkness would work irreparable injury to the whole city above 79th street. Such, could not have been the intention of the legislature, acting when the same state of facts existed. And yet the lamps cannot continue to be lighted unless the gas consumed is paid for. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-9\">1. The intention of the legislature is to be gathered from other acts in <em>pari materia, </em>as well as from the act itself. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Sometimes it is to be collected from the cause or necessity of the statute, and sometimes from other circumstances, and whenever it can be discovered it ought to be followed with reason and discretion in the construction, although such construction seems contrary to the letter of the statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Utica Insurance Co., </em>15 <em>John. </em>358.) A thing within the letter of the statute, is not within the .statute unless it be within the intention of the makers. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>3 <em>Cowen, </em>89. <em>James </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>2 <em>Seld. </em>9. <em>People </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>15 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>532. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Younger, </em>5 <em>T. R. </em>449. <em>Margate Pier Co. </em>v. <em>Hannam, </em>3 <em>B. &amp; A. </em>266. <em>Reniger </em>v. <em>Foggasa, Plowd. </em>18.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">3. If the intention of the legislature was to secure work or supplies to the defendants at the lowest rates, by competition, it is evident that the act of 1857 was not intended to apply to the lighting the streets with gas, unless the common council should so direct. At that time the whole city was as it now is, divided into districts, each occupied by a single gas company, and neither having pipes laid in the district of the other. The act of 1861, <em>(Val. Laws C. N. Y. </em>480,) applies to all contracts made under section 38. If, therefore, the lighting of the1 streets in either district is offered to the lowest bidder, the company occupying such district may name its own price, perhaps ten times the value of the gas consumed, without any risk of competition or unlawful combination, and the contract therefor must be at once and absolutely awarded to such company, irrespective of value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">3. In this case all the plaintiffs ask is what the gas actually consumed by the defendants is really worth. No injustice is done the defendants. No demand is made for profits. A simple <em>quantum meruit </em>is all that is sought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">YI. The lamps in question were lighted under the superintendence of one of the defendants\u2019 officers, the superintendent of lamps and gas. His acts in the premises were within the scope of his duties, under the charter of 1857, (\u00a7 23.) If, then, the gas had been so consumed, without the consent of the plaintiffs, they could, in a suit against the city, have recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>therefor what it was worth. They are certainly not in a worse position, under the facts set forth in this case, for the plaintiffs, hy the aot of 1848, and the consent of the city given thereunder, are prohibited from refusing gas to the city, for the purpose of lighting these lamps. Such manifest injustice will not be done by a judicial tribunal, without more explicit legislation to compel such a result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-4\">VII. The claim for the U. S. revenue tax is made in accordance with the law 'of the United States imposing the tax. <em>(Act of June </em>30, 1864, \u00a7 94.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-5\"><em>W. F. Allen, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">I. The question intended to be submitted is, as to the amount to which the plaintiff is entitled for the supply of gas to the public lamps north of Seventy-ninth street, for the month of September, 1864. To entitle the plaintiff to a judgment for the amount claimed, a valid contract for the payment of the sum claimed must be established, either express or implied. It is not pretended that any express contract for the payment of $50 per lamp exists, but circumstances are relied upon as raising an implied promise to pay that sum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">II. It is not contended that in the absence of any restriction or limitation of the corporate powers, or legislative restraint upon the officers and agents of a corporation, contracts may not he implied against corporations as against natural persons. But whenever the organic law of the corporation or the statutes of the state prescribe the mode and manner in which contracts shall be made, and prohibit and declare void all contracts not made in pursuance of the requirements of law, only such contracts are valid as comply with such statutes, and no claim for services, materials, or other thing furnished, except under a contract so made, will give a cause of action against the corporation. <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>2 <em>Bosw. </em>173. <em>S. C., affirmed </em>20 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>312. <em>Appleby </em>v. <em>the same, </em>15 <em>How. </em>428. <em>McSpedon </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>7 <em>Bosw. </em>601.) Ho ratification or confirmation of the contract hy any or all the corporate an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>thorities, or acceptance of benefits under it, will bind the corporation, if the statute has not been complied with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">III. The charter of the city of New York and the several acts amending the same are public acts. Every citizen is presumed to know them, and is chargeable .with knowledge of every provision affecting his dealings with the city. If the subject matter of the contract is within a provision of law, the individual must see that the forms of law are apparently complied with. The subject matter of this claim is the supply of gas, amounting to more than $250 in the aggregate, and more than $250 for a single night. \u2018The plaintiff had, on the 9th July, 1858, entered into a contract, which was duly (that is, after a compliance with the requirement of law) made for the supply of gas to the city. There was then, in this case, actual notice and knowledge of the provisions of law relating to contracts tor supplies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">IV. The \u201c street department\u201d have the cognizance of lighting the streets, wharves, &amp;c. and \u201c a bureau of lamps and gas\u201d is created within that department, and the duties of the chief of that bureau are prescribed by ordinance. <em>(Amended Charter </em>of 1857, \u00a7 23. <em>Revised Ordinances of </em>1859, <em>ch. </em>4, <em>art. </em>1, \u00a72, <em>p. </em>79. <em>Id. art. </em>9, \u00a7 2, <em>p. </em>99.) The supply of gas or other materials for lighting the streets, is within the province of the street department, and contracts for such supply are to be made by the street commissioner. <em>(Amended Charter of </em>1857, \u00a7 38. <em>Valentine\u2019s Laws, p. </em>278.) The common council could not directly, or indirectly, contract for the supply, nor by any act of theirs lay the foundation of an implied promise to pay for lighting the streets, except as they might direct and control the street commissioner. <em>(Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>4 <em>Bosw. </em>80.) Notice to the \u201c corporation,\u201d that is, notice to the <em>\u201c </em>mayor, aldermen and commonalty,\u201d (how served or to whom given does not appear,) was not notice to the head of the <em>\u201c </em>street department,\u201d who was charged by law with the supervision of lighting the streets. Notice to the common council, and their omission to take \u201c final action\u201d upon the subject, could not raise an implied assumpsit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>against the city, as the subject was not, any more than providing a pier for the deposit of offal was, within their province.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-4\">Y. The supply of gas for the lamps within the district mentioned, is within the provisions of the 38th section of the amended charter of 1857, amd could \u25a0 only be furnished upon contract made as prescribed in that section. <em>(Valentine\u2019s Laws, p. </em>278.) 1. It was a <em>\u201c </em>supply needful for a particular purpose.\u201d 2. It involved the expenditure of more than $250. 3. It was . a supply within the \u201c cognizance\u201d -of the street department. - <em>(See also Revised Ordinances of </em>1859, <em>ch; 4, art. </em>2, \u00a7 3, <em>p. </em>80, <em>of printed copy.) 4. </em>It was not a contract, or requisition for service requiring skill or science, so as to bring it within the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>(17 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>184,) and the reasoning of J udge Comstock in that case. 5. It did not relate to the acquisition of a particular property for a special purpose, in the selection of which the judgment and discretion of the city officials would be called into action, as in the selection of a site for a market, so as to bring it within the reasoning of J udge Hoffman, in <em>The Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., </em>(4 <em>Bosw. </em>80.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">The statute does not relate to and include all work and all supplies, the contract for which is to be made by the head of an executive department. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>21 <em>How. </em>1. <em>McSpedon </em>v. <em>Same, </em>7 <em>Bosw. </em>601.) It is no answer that there was but one gas company within the district. The streets might have been lighted with oil or other suitable material, and notice might have been given for bids for gas, oil, kerosene-or other suitable material; or other gas companies might be organized and licensed by the city to lay pipes and conductors over the same territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-7\">YI. The contract of 9th July, 1858, was in substance and effect renewed from year to year. The street commissioner having once advertised for bids, and duly made a contract with the plaintiff for a single year, and for a yearly compensation, which the plaintiff was willing to treat as a continuing contract from year to year, exercised his discretion in the matter, and instead of formally advertising when there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>no change in the price of any article with which the streets could he lighted, or any change in the circumstances authorizing the presumption that a contract more advantageous to the city could be made, assented to the yearly renewal of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-5\">It was as if notice for bids had been published annually, and the plaintiff had made the lowest bid and a new contract had been duly made. Each party regarded and treated the old contract as in force, and as renewed from year to year. Each party observed all its forms, and without doubt either party could have maintained an action for a violation of any of its provisions. A liberal interpretation of the statute, and for the purpose of upholding the contract and saving the city officials from the pains and penalties denounced against a violation of the laws, (see amended Charter of 1857, section 40), would authorize such informal renewal. But it would not authorize a renewal at an increased price ; that is, the making of a new contract. The plaintiff having received pay for the annual supply for the several years since 1858, cannot now object that there was no valid contract under which the gas was supplied. It has been acted upon as a valid contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-6\">\u2022VII. If the last proposition is not true, then there has been no valid contract for the supply of gas since the 9th of July, 1859, and all the payments, made have been without authority of law, and the plaintiffs have no legal claim even for the original contract price, or any sum whatever. <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>2 <em>Bosw. </em>173. 20 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>312, <em>S. C. Appleby </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. </em>15 <em>How. Pr. </em>428.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-7\">But the right to the contract price is not disputed. The claim is that there is no valid contract, express or implied, to pay an increased price.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">VIII. The contract, as originally made, was for a year, and when renewed or acted upon as a renewed contract, it was continued in force for a year, and as an annual contract, and became obligatory upon each party for the entire year. Neither party could, during the year, rescind it. It was like a lease of a house or hiring of service for a year, at an annual rent, or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>compensation by the year. A continued occupation by the tenant, with the permission of the landlord, or a continuation of the service with the assent of the employer beyond the year, would work a renewal of the lease or hiring for a second entire year, and not for a part of the term, and to be- terminated at the option of either party. See opinion of court, as to effect of a receipt from tenant holding over,' in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>(12 <em>John. </em>182;) <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Prindle, </em>(23 <em>Wend. </em>616;) <em>Chitty on Cont. </em>20; <em>Evertson </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>(2 <em>Wend. 507;) </em>Ch<em>itty on Cont. </em>323.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-4\">IX. The contract, then, as renewed, or continued in force from year to year, expired on the 9th of July, 1864, and the plaintiff having, with the acquiescence of the street commissioner and the chief of the bureau of lamps and gas, continued to furnish the city with gas for nearly two months, receiving pay therefor under the contract, the contract was legally renewed for the year, which will expire on the 9th of July, 1865, and neither party is at liberty to terminate or vary the same without the consent of the other, before that time. The plaintiff cannot therefore claim the increased price.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">X. Even had the contract been between individuals, the notice served on the 22d of August, of an intention to claim an increased price, would have been <em>unavailing; </em>the party served would not have been bound to take any notice of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\">XI. But in the case of the defendants, it was entirely insufficient and without significance. It could not lay the foundation of an implied promise to pay the increased price demanded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">1. There was a valid contract for the supply of gas to the 9th of July, 1865, and the city authorities were under no obligation to consider a proposition to vary its terms, and cannot by silence be deemed to have acquiesced in any change.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-8\">2. The statute prescribes the mode and manner of making contracts for the furnishing supplies exceeding in amount two hundred and fifty dollars, and names the officers by whom they shall be made. The plaintiffs well knew this, not only as every citizen knows the law, but as having been a party to a contract duly made under the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>3. There can be no such thing as an implied promise in the case. The common council were not capable of promising expressly, and cannot, therefore, by any act, lay the foundation for an implied promise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">4. The remedy of the plaintiff Vas to cut off the gas, and refuse to furnish until another contract was duly made, if they were not bound for the year by the contract of 1858, and not to furnish gas contrary to law, and without law, and then claim on a <em>quantum valebat. </em>To uphold this claim would be to condemn city officials for a violation of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-6\"><em>Anderson, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-7\">I. The defendants, to sustain the view that they cannot be held liable upon an implied contract, have cited the cases of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>(2 <em>Bosw. </em>173; S. <em>C. </em>20 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>312;) <em>McSpedon </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>(7 <em>Bosw. </em>601;) <em>Appleby </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>(15 <em>How. </em>428.) In answer to which we say :</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-8\">1. They all arose- under the act of 1853, differing <em>materially </em>from the act of 1857, and were repealed by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-9\">2. The work done, and supplies furnished, forming the subject of litigation in those cases, came exactly within the admitted signification of those words as used in the act of 1853.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-10\">There is no existing provision, in either the organic law of the corporation, or the statutes of the state, declaring void all contracts not made in compliance with section 38. High authority, as well as the plainest rules of interpretation of statutes, show that this case is not within the terms of section 38. Unlimited power to make contracts having been given to the corporation in its original charter, the absence of any provision in the act of 1857, declaring contracts not made pursuant to section 38 void, leaves that section merely directory, and the corporation unshorn of the corporate powers granted by its original charter. If the legislature had intended otherwise, the statute should have contained words declaring that no contracts should be entered into in any other manner <em>; </em>or that where the provisions of the act were not complied with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>contracts should he void. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Greene, 6 Man. &amp; Gran. </em>872.) In the case just cited, a paving, lighting, watching, and cleansing act empowered commissioners to enter into any contracts for the performance of any of the works by the act authorized to be done, or for any other of the purposes of the act, provided that no contract should be made for a longer term than three years, and before any such contract should be, entered into, ten days public notice, at least, was required to be given. All such contracts were to specify the several works to be done, and the prices to be paid for the same, to be signed by any three of such commissioners; and copies to be entered in a book to be kept for the purpose. It was therein held, that the proviso applied to the duration of the contract only, and the subsequent provisions were not essential, but directory, &amp;c. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>The Mayor of New York, N. Y. Transcript, Feb. </em>13, 1861, <em>City of Lowell </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>8 <em>Met. </em>180. <em>Striker </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>7 <em>Hill, </em>9. <em>Matter of Mohawk and Hudson R. R.

The defendants\u2019 counsel, conceding liability to pay for the gas consumed, urged, that because the \"agreement of 1858 was for a year, and the plaintiffs afterwards accepted payment for certain gas consumed at the rate specified in such agreement, both parties were bound by all the provisions of the expired contract for the entire year, and so on from year to year. He cited cases of holding over of a tenant, after the expiration of his term, with the consent of the landlord. The law of landlord and tenant will hardly be applied by the court to the case, nor do the cases cited by counsel sustain his proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-6\">If the agreement of 1858 had been for twenty years, and the plaintiffs had permitted the defendants to consume gas for two months after the expiration of such contract, and accepted payment for such gas at the rate named in the expired contract, would counsel contend that both parties were bound for twenty years longer P The rule is correctly stated under the second point. ,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVY\">This submission is for the purpose of determining the liability of the defendants to pay for gas furnished by the plaintiffs to the public lamps in the month of September, 1864. The written contract between the parties expired by its limitation in July, 1859. No agreement has since been made, and it is contended by the defendants none can be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The Harlem Graslight Company was incorporated in 1855, under the general incorporating act, passed in 1848, <em>(Session Laws </em>1848, <em>p. </em>48,) \u201cfor the purpose of manufacturing and supplying gas <em>for lighting the streets </em>and the public and private buildings,\u201d in that part of the city north of Seventy-ninth street. At that time, no other gas company had obtained permission from the common council to lay conductors for conducting gas in any of the streets north of Seventy-ninth street, nor were any conductors laid therein. Companies organized under the general law are authorized to lay conductors only with the consent of the municipal authorities, which consent may be given \u201c <em>under such reasonable regulations as they may prescribe.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The permission granted to this company by the common ' council was contained in a resolution passed in 1855. It gave the consent of the corporate authorities \u201c in consideration of the following articles (among others) being faithfully complied with,\u201d namely; that the company should furnish a supply of gas to all persons who might desire the same ; that it should proceed immediately * * * to lay mains in the district embraced in the grant, and within two years supply gas <em>to be used by the corporate authorities </em>or private consumers. The common council reserved the right to revoke the permission, upon proof of the failure of the company to comply with the conditions therein expressed, or with any resolution or ordinance which might be thereafter adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The charter gave the defendants power to light the public streets, and confided its exercise to the street department. Hence it became the <em>duty </em>of the corporation to provide the necessary means for that purpose. <em>(Hutson </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>9 <em>N. Y. </em>Rep. 163.) The permission given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>was accepted <em>by the gas company </em>with all its conditions <em>and </em>reservations, and thereby became a valid subsisting <em>contract </em>on their part. <em>(Attorney General </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>12 <em>N. Y. Leg. Obs. </em>17. <em>People </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>17 <em>John. 195. Benson </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>10 <em>Barb. </em>223. <em>McLaren </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>1 <em>Paige, </em>102.) The obligations imposed by this contract were, that the gas company would supply gas to the corporate authorities for the purpose of lighting the public streets, at such times and in such places, within their district, as the common council might from time to time prescribe ; and that they would also comply with any resolution or ordinance which might be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><em>Two </em>parties are required in the formation of a contract. It must be supported by a sufficient consideration, and must be mutually binding. By the adoption of the resolution of permission, upon the consideration therein expressed, and with the reservations and conditions therein contained, and its acceptance by the plaintiffs, the defendants became a party to the contract. Their authority to .engage in it was derived as well from their general duty to light the streets as from the general incorporating act before referred to, which in express terms empowered them to prescribe such <em>\u201c reasonable regulations \u201d </em>as they might deem proper. Such authority to give its consent, and to impose such restrictions and conditions as would furnish a consideration for the valuable privilege given, was a <em>grant of power </em>to the defendants to make a contract with the plaintiffs for a supply of gas to the public lamps. Putting, therefore, these transactions of the corporation and the gas company together, they furnish all the essential ingredients of a complete contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Ho statute that I am acquainted with prescribed any <em>form </em>of contracts, and it was not even necessary that they should be in writing. In <em>Bonesteel v. The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>(22 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>168,) it was held that the bid by the contractor and its acceptance by the corporation constituted the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">It cannot be doubted, I think, that as the parties stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>upon the adoption and acceptance of the resolution, the plaintiffs were bound (under a liability to have the license revoked for a failure to comply) to supply gas to be used by the corporate authorities, as directed by any ordinance of! the common council.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The contract being mutual, it imposed a corresponding obligation on the defendants'to allow conductors to be laid in the public streets, and, by implication, a promise to pay a reasonable price for the gas furnished. The latter is upon the familiar principle that where a person buys an article without stipulating for the price, he is presumed to have undertaken to pay its market value. In the absence, therefore, of any stipulation in the contract fixing the price or compensation for the gas to be furnished, and the contract being otherwise complete and within the scope of the authority of the parties, the law will supply a promise to pay its reasonable value.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The permisssion to lay conductors was unlimited in dura- . tion, but could be annulled by failure to comply with the conditions contained in the resolution. Until annulled, the plaintiffs are bound to supply gas wherever required by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The contract of July, 1858, merely fixed the price of gas furnished to street lamps <em>for one </em>year, and does not annul the previous agreement. It was auxiliary to it. When it expired by its limitation, the price was left to be ascertained by the value of the commodity at the time of its consumption. By the charter of 1849, <em>(Sess. Laws </em>1849, <em>p. </em>278,) the department of streets and lamps had cognizance of procuring the necessary supplies for, and lighting the public streets. In this department there was a bureau, the chief officer of which was called the \u201c superintendent of lamps and gas.\u201d It is admitted in the case before us that since the organization of the plaintiffs' company the lamps have been lighted within the plaintiffs\u2019 district, under the direction and superintendence of that officer, whose duty it was to superintend the carrying into effect the ordinances of the common council, in respect to lighting the public streets, and to discharge the duty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>defendants in that respect. Although a delegated power to an officer to superintend does not. necessarily clothe him with authority to bind the city by contract in respect to the functions of his office, yet I apprehend that his acts, as the authorized agent of the corporation, in directing the lighting of the public lamps in pursuance of general or particular ordinances, are binding, as being within the immediate scope of his authority, and merely in. the discharge of a duty resting on the corporation, and as carrying into effect the contract with the plaintiffs to supply gas where required. It appears that since the permission granted to the plaintiffs, the common council have, from time to time, adopted ordinances directing the plaintiffs to lay conductors in various streets not before lighted; and such streets have been supplied with gas by the plaintiffs under the original resolution of permission, and by direction of the defendants\u2019 superintendent. Ho new contract was made ; but both parties recognized the existing contract as being in force. The corporation asserted its right to require the plaintiffs to supply gas under the resolution of April, 1855, and the plaintiffs admitted the obligation to furnish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">It further appears that the corporation has annually represented to the legislature that a certain amount of money would be required for lighting, &amp;c. the public streets, and the legislature has been asked to authorize the sum to be raised by tax ; and in 1864 the sum of $430,247 was authorized to be so raised. These several applications to, and acts of the legislature extending from the organization of the plaintiffs\u2019 company to the present time, a period of ten years, are recognitions by the corporation of their obligation to pay, and ratifications by the legislature of the power of the corporation to light the streets, and necessarily, of their power to contract therefor, and may be regarded in the light of enabling acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In concluding this view of the question, I cannot see any reason for holding that there has not been, at all times, a subsisting legal contract by the corporation with the plaintiffs ; a contract authorized by law, complete in all essential parts, and of binding force and effect; under which the corporation may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>be compelled to pay the reasonable value of all gas furnished to it by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">But it is contended by the defendants that all contracts, to be binding upon the corporation, must be made in the manner prescribed by the charter, which requires that all work to be done, or supplies to be furnished for the corporation, shall be by contract, founded on sealed bids or proposals made in compliance with public notice, and shall be given to the lowest bidder. <em>(Charters </em>o/1849 <em>and </em>1857.) If the claim of the plaintiffs rested upon a contract required to be made in pursuance of the foregoing provision, it cannot be sustained. Hone of those provisions were complied with, and the contract would therefore be void. <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>20 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>312. <em>Bonesteel </em>v. <em>The Same, ubi sup.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In the view, however, which I have taken of the question, the provisions of the charter relative to the formation of contracts has no application whatever. The general act of 1848, for the incorporation of gas companies, has not been repealed by any of the charters of the defendants, or otherwise; and the power it conferred upon the municipal authority, to contract in the form adopted, with the plaintiffs, is unchanged by any subsequent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In the interpretation of a statute, a thing not within the spirit or intent is not within the letter, <em>(James </em>v. <em>Potter, 2 Seld. </em>9,) and when the intent is ascertained, it will prevail over, and give construction to the words used.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The object of the provision in the charters referred to, was to open to general competition all work and supplies needed by the public authorities. Bids or proposals are required to be invited by public notice, and contracts must he awarded, to the lowest bidder. It is not perhaps too much to say that in every species of work or supplies which can be <em>competed </em>for, it is the duty of the corporation to invite proposals, and to give the contract to the lowest bidder. But where there is no <em>possibility </em>of competition, and in respect to whose manufacture one company has the complete monopoly, it seems to me that the provisions of the charter cannot be deemed to apply, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and therefore impose no duty. The law must have a reasonable construction. If the object in a given case fails of accomplishment, the law construed by its intention must also fail. To advertise for proposals for a supply of gas in a district exclusively occupied by one gas company, would be a practical <em>absurdity. </em>It would enable that company to propose for the supply at a price much beyond the fair value ; and its single bid, (under the charter of 1861,) would entitle it to the contract at the price named, thus defeating the end designed, to secure the city from favoritism and jobbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">It is not necessary to deny that illuminating gas comes under the denomination of <em>supplies;, </em>but the word in its application to the subject of contracts must be restricted in its signification and meaning to supplies which are, or may be the subject of a general competition, and which can be furnished by more than one person or company. Any other meaning given to the word would impute to the legislature the design of scheming with contractors to defraud the corporation, rather than an intention to protect its public treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In <em>The People </em>v. Flagg, (17 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>584,) a city surveyor, under a resolution of the common council, had prepared maps of wharves and piers belonging to the corporation. Upon a mandamus to the comptroller to compel him to pay, Judge Comstock says : <em>\u201c </em>The language of this provision is somewhat broad, but I am quite well satisfied that it does not include the services of the particular kind now in question. In a large sense, the term \u201c work\u201d may include all labor, whether mental or <em>corporeal; </em>but it has a more restricted sense, which may confine it to the various kinds of manual labor which may properly be the subject of general competition, and can safely be awarded to the lowest bidder.\u201d The' case went off on other grounds, and the language quoted from the opinion was not adopted by the court, and was repudiated by one of the judges, but expressly upon the ground that the work could have been competed for. Nevertheless, the case sustains the proposition that the restrictive power of the corporation .to contract must be confined within the spirit and intent of the law, is not uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>versal in its application, and, although directory as regards subjects within its purview, does not deprive the corporation of power to contract in other ways, in respect to matters not embraced within the restrictive clause. The corporation, irrespective of its charter, has general power to contract. The restriction is modal merely. <em>(Peterson </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>17 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>449.) Judge Hoffman, in <em>The Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>(4 <em>Bosw. </em>89,) says., there must be a class of cases in which the very object of the exercise of a municipal power would indicate the inapplicability of the provision; as where the whole object would be defeated if the corporation was compelled to advertise and give the contract to the lowest bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In the exercise of all governmental powers, the officers of the government must be clothed, necessarily, with some discretion; statutes intended to weaken or destroy such discretion must be regarded as in derogation of a natural right, and should not be extended beyond the plain intent. Hence any interference with vested rights and powers must be restricted to subjects intended to be affected, and not enlarged to cover cases not within the object to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Enough,'I think, has been said to show that the corporation, in obedience to its duty to light the streets, is not compelled to advertise for proposals for a supply of gas. There could be no competition, and but one bid. It is true, the obligation to light the streets does not necessarily require the use of gas. Oil lamps could be employed. But the right to use gas is clearly within the discretion of the corporation, and their contract with the plaintiffs requires that they shall use it, and it would be a breach of faith, as well as of contract, to use any other commodity.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Although it may not be regarded as an open question in this court, I am, nevertheless, of the opinion that the plaintiffs having, by the request of the defendants, supplied gas to the public lamps, which had been received, accepted and consumed by them, the.plaintiffs are entitled to recover upon a <em>quantum meruit. </em>It is a general principle, that when a void or voidable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>contract has been fully executed, and its benefits have been received and accepted, the law will imply a promise to pay a reasonable compensation; this principle, in its application to persons and private corporations, is undoubted. <em>(Feeter </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>11 <em>Wend. </em>477. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>N. Y. Central Railroad Co., </em>22 <em>Barb. </em>239.) And I can discover no reason for not applying it to a public or municipal body. The case of <em>McSpedon </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>(7 <em>Bosw. </em>601,) I know holds the other way; and if this case turned on that point, I should be bound by that decision. In that case, the common council directed, by resolution, the printing of Yalentine\u2019s Manual, and the court said there should have been sealed bids invited by public notice, and held there was no contract, and no recovery could be had upon a <em>quantum meruit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Contracts, which are <em>ultra vires, </em>cannot be made at all by a corporation; therefore none can be implied. But when the power is clear, and the omission is something merely modal, neither a natural person nor an artificial body can be allowed to accept the benefit and escape the liability. <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>The City of Buffalo, </em>(2 <em>Denio, </em>110,) and <em>Halstead </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>&amp;c. <em>of New York, </em>(3 <em>Comst. </em>430.) were cases of contracts, <em>ultra vires. </em>There being no original power to contract, no subsequent act of acceptance or ratification could imply a promise. I do not understand any of the cases, with the exception of <em>McSpedon </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>as going any further. In <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>The Mayor, supra, </em>Judge Denio says : <em>\u201c </em>That when the public functionaries omit to observe designated forms, no subsequent act] of recognition can supply a defect in these respects.\u201d But the right to recover on a <em>quantum meruit </em>was not involved, and the case was decided upon another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">With the exception, therefore, of the case in this court, I think the question may be regarded as an open one, and I think the weight of reason, as well as authority, (as I will presently show,) is opposed to the doctrine of that case. Parties dealing fairly and honestly with a corporation, in the belief that the officials and agents are faithful in the discharge of duty, ought not to be deprived of a reasonable compensation by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>any dereliction of such, officers. No wrong can be done to the corporation or those they represent. The same end, in effect, is attained as would be rendered by giving public notice; for it is presumed that no proposal below a fair and reasonable price would be made, and such is the only measure of a recovery upon a <em>quantum meruit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The English cases are uniform on this subject. In <em>Clark </em>v. <em>The Guardians of the Cuchfield Union, </em>(1 <em>Low. &amp; M. </em>81,) Wightman, J., says : <em>\u201c </em>Whenever the purposes for which a corporation is created renders it necessary that work should be done or goods supplied to carry such purposes into effect, and orders are given at a board regularly constituted, and having general authority to make contracts for work or goods necessary for the purpose for which the corporation was created, and the work is done or goods are supplied and accepted by the corporation, and the whole consideration for payment is executed, the corporation cannot keep the goods, or the benefit, and refuse to pay on the ground that though the members of the corporation, who ordered the goods or work done, were competent to make a contract and bind the rest, the formality of a deed, or of affixing a seal, is wanting, and therefore that no action lies, as they were not competent to make a parol contract, and may avail themsleves of their own disability.\u201d And in <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>St. Neot\u2019s Union, </em>(8 <em>Q. B. </em>810,) where the action was for gates furnished for the workhouse of the Union, the court says : \u201cWe think the defendants cannot take the objection that the contract was by parol, inasmuch as the work in question, after it was done and completed, was adopted by them for purposes connected with the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\"><em>Mills </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>(11 <em>Wis. R. </em>470,) involved the effect of a subsequent ratification by a municipal corporation, in rendering valid acts which were previously unauthorized. Paine, J. says : <em>\u201c </em>If the city adopts it, and receives the benefit of it, it is as much bound as if they had authorized it in the first instance <em>; </em>every thing was done necessary to authorize the issuing of the bonds, except the publication of the charter, all the parties supposing it to be in force. If, after it was in force, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the city received the proceeds, and appropriated them to its own use, and recognized the validity of the bonds, we could not well imagine a case more fit for the application of this rule.\u201d I also refer to the case of <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>City of Perth Amboy, </em>(1 <em>Dutch. </em>297,) and to <em>Messenger </em>v. <em>City of Buffalo, </em>(21 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The notice given by the plaintiffs in August, 1864, of a change of price, does not, it seems to me, affect this question. It was not agreed to, or acted upon by the defendants. Under the existing contract they are liable only for the reasonable value of the gas consumed ; they cannot be deemed, by their silence to have acquiesced in any other measure of compensation. It is, however, unimportant, inasmuch as it is admitted that the reasonable value of the gas is the same as stated in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for $13,037.50, the amount claimed for gas consumed, and $721.03 government tax, with interest upon these sums from the time of the demand, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b134-6\">Moncrief, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APB\">The learned counsel for the defendants concedes that in the absence of any restriction or limitation of the corporate powers, or legislative restraint upon the officers or agents of a corporation, contracts may be implied against corporations as against natural persons. It will be borne in mind that the claim made by the plaintiffs does not arise upon an allegation that a contract has been entered into with the defendants which might or might not conform to the provisions of the statute \u25a0; and it must he assumed that each party to the controversy has acted in perfect good faith, and without intent to evade the requirements of the law, relative to the manner and form in which the defendants must contract for supplies to be furnished for the corporation. Every c\u00e1se to which we have been referred, as an authority against this claim, arose out of contract. In <em>Appleby </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>(15 <em>How Pr. </em>428,) the contract was made with the <em>highest </em>and not the <em>lowest bidder, </em>and contrary to an express provision of law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>therefore held to he illegal and void. In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>(2 <em>Bosw. </em>173,) the ground of claim set forth in the complaint is simply a <em>special contract </em>made with the defendants, duly performed by the plaintiff, and his work accepted ; and the court say, at page 179: \u201cIt is obvious to observe that there are no issues in this action to raise the question, upon the consideration of which the referee has decided in favor of the plaintiff, viz. that the plaintiff, having done the work, was entitled to receive what the work performed in making such rock excavation was reasonably worth ; and that the defendants have legal power to pay for work on the basis of a <em>quantum meruit, </em>though it was done without contract, or under an illegal and void contract.\u201d <em>McSpedon, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>(7 <em>Bosw. </em>601,) was for work done, &amp;c. under a contract-made with the clerk of the common council. In each of these cases, in which a contract was sought to be enforced, it was held that the contract, not being in compliance with the law, was illegal and void, and the conclusion was inevitable, that if the work, &amp;c. was done, delivered, and accepted under an illegal contract, no implied .obligation of the defendants to pay the just value thereof could be invoked, for the reason that such implication must proceed out of, and issue, from that which never had a legal existence. The contract being annihilated for inherent vice, cannot be restored in another form to effectuate the same purpose for the contractor violating the law: \u201c <em>Ex nihilo nihil Jit.\u201d </em>The plaintiffs, in good faith, against their wish, have had their property taken from them by the defendants, and the same has been consumed for public purposes <em>; </em>the defendants continue to use such property, and assert that they have no legal right to do so, except under contract, as especially provided by law, and are therefore not legally bound to pay what they admit it is reasonably and justly worth. This proposition seems to me to shock the moral sense, and to be at variance with all principles of justice, and should not be affirmed, unless upon some authority directly in point. I can find no such authority. This case, upon the facts as presented to us, would seem to be anomalous.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The defendants ought not to be allowed to say : \u201cWe are not permitted to make a parol contract, and we avail ourselves of our own disability.\u201d It is said, in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>&amp;c. <em>of Swansea, </em>(5 <em>Q. B. </em>547,) that if a municipal corporation has wrongfully got possession of the money of a stranger, or the money of one of its own members, the law raises an implied promise from the corporate body to refund the amount, just the same as in the ordinary case of a receipt of money by a private individual, which the latter has no right in conscience or equity to retain. \u201cIf the corporation have helped themselves to another man\u2019s money, it would be absurd to say that they must bind themselves under seal to return it.\u201d The defendants here have helped themselves to the property of the plaintiffs, and have consumed it for public purposes, so that the thing taken cannot be returned to the plaintiffs. It seems to me there can be no doubt of the liability of the defendants to restore to the plaintiffs the value of the property thus taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The plaintiffs are not actors in violating or attempting to avoid any law ; they have made no contract, oral or written, which can be questioned or denounced as illegal; it is not claimed by them that the defendants are liable by virtue of a contract made with them ; the plaintiffs simply say to the defendants : \u201c Having taken and consumed our property, the law should require that you shall make' us compensation by paying what it is worth.\u201d <em>(See </em>1 <em>Atk. </em>196, <em>ex parte Meymot. Hecker </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. </em>28 <em>How. Pr. </em>211. <em>And see Bissell </em>v. <em>The Mich. South. and N. I. R. R. Co., </em>22 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">While it is true, as a general rule, that a corporation cannot, by its own act, enlarge its capacities, powers, or rights, and when it attempts to make contracts, must be held to a strict compliance with the statutory requirement's, and persons seeking to enforce such contracts must establish that the law has been satisfied by being made, &amp;c. in the prescribed form, it does not, in my opinion, necessarily follow that it may not <em>incur liabilities </em>for which it must respond. In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>(17 N. <em>Y. Rep. </em>584,) it was argued by an able member of the court, in a matter <em>quasi ex contractu, </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>corporation were liable for services requiring scientific knowledge, without a contract. In <em>The Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Company </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>(4 <em>Bosw. </em>80,) .the action was for <em>use and oocupation </em>of a pier, upon an implied <em>assumpsit </em>to pay what its use was reasonably worth. So, too, it is not doubted corporations can be held liable in cases where property is used for sudden or special occasions or , great emergencies, as where. gunpowder might be appropriated to stay extensive conflagration, by blowing up buildings, under the direction of the Mayor and other officials. Assuming, therefore, that the gas consumed in lighting the streets of the city, under the criticism of this court in the <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp;c. v. The Mayor (supra,) </em>can properly be termed a \u201c supply,\u201d I am of the opinion that the defendants, having appropriated it to public uses, under the circumstances of this case, are liable.to pay to the plaintiff's what it was reasonably worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">I concur with my brother Monell, that judgment should be directed to be entered against the defendants for the sum claimed and agreed upon, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b137-6\">Robertson, J. (dissenting.)</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">The first question which.this case presents is whether the corporation of the city of Hew York can bind themselves to pay for gas furnished to public lamps in said city by a contract made in any other mode than according to the first section of the statute of 1861, \u201c relative to contracts,\u201d by such corporation, <em>(Laws </em>of 1861, <em>ch. 308, Val. Comp. C. N. Y. </em>480,) and the thirty-eighth section of that of 1857, amendatory of the charter of such city. <em>(Laws of </em>1857, <em>ch. </em>446, <em>Val. Comp. </em>278.) In regard. to a prior statute to the same effect, <em>(Laws of </em>1863, <em>ch. 217, </em>\u00a7 12,, <em>Val. Comp. 266,) </em>this court has twice decided at general term, <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>The Mayor of New York, 2 Bosw. </em>173; <em>S. C., </em>20 <em>N. Y. Rep. 312</em>; <em>McSpedon </em>v. <em>Same, 7 Bosw. </em>608,) that in reference to work to be done, or supplies furnished, they could not do . so. But for the authority of these cases I should have been inclined to think such corporation c\u00f3uld so bind themselves. In the first place, long before either of these statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u2022were passed, such corporation were authorized to make contracts ; that was done by a far earlier charter ; and it is settled that a new law giving rights similar to those previously existing, but in a modified form, is not to be construed as excluding the exercise of such rights in such prior form, without express words or unavoidable implication to that effect; <em>(Fairchild </em>v. <em>Gwynne, </em>14 <em>Abb. </em>121. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>20 <em>How. Pr. </em>289.) In the next place, the statute of 1857 (\u00a7 40) provides a sanction for its requirements by punishing criminally the officers who violate them ; and it would be an absurdity and oppressive to punish them for an act not only void, but necessarily carrying with it the evidence of its invalidity for all purposes. '</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The title of the act of 1861 intimates that its purpose was rather to control officers in making <em>contracts, </em>than to restrict the power of the corporation to make them. The contracts, also, to be made by such corporation, are not mere private ones for their own private advantage; they are the discharge of a public duty for the public benefit; and rather than have the public suffer for the want of that which it was the object of such contract to accomplish, forms, although prescribed by statute, if not indispensable to such purpose, may be disregarded as not of the- essence of such contract. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Green, </em>6 <em>Man. &amp; Gr. </em>872.) For a similar reason a disregard of statutory formalities does not vitiate an election either of public officers, <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>8 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>67; <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>17 <em>id. </em>276,) provided the will of the actual voters at such election is not thereby defeated, or the officers of private corporations. <em>(Matter of Mohawk and Hudson R. R. Co., </em>19 <em>Wend. </em>135. <em>Matter of Chenango County Mut. Ins. Co., Id. </em>635.) It would be a greater injury to have the city of Hew York in darkness at night by reason of a failure by the city corporation to observe the statutory forms in making a contract for lighting it, than to make such a contract binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The statutes of 1857 or 1861 do not expressly exclude all other forms of' contracting, except that prescribed ; which is necessary to create a prohibition; and they require a security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to be given for the performance of every contract, to be approved by the comptroller, before it is binding; neither of which acts is to be done by the corporation, or forms a limitation of their mode of making contracts. The exposure of every contract to offers by advertisement was for the benefit of the corporation, not of the bidders. A mandamus will not lie at the instance of the lowest bidder, <em>\u201c </em>who has given adequate security.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 <em>Abb. </em>33. <em>People ex rel. Beldon </em>v. <em>Contracting Board, Court of Appeals, Feb. </em>1865.) So that a contract under the statutes of 1857 and 1861 does not become complete and binding merely by force of the advertisement for offers and a bid ; otherwise there would be no necessity for having them signed by the heads of departments, in the name of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">These considerations were overlooked in the the two cases already cited, decided in this court <em>y </em>possibly they might have given a different direction to the decision, if they had been presented ; but as <em>they </em>stand unreversed, I feel bound to yield to their authority. To whatever criticism the first of those cases <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c.) </em>may be subjected, as authority for the doctrine that the city corporation can only contract for supplies and work pursuant to the statutes of 1857 and 1861, upon the ground that in it no cause of action founded upon an implied contract was alleged in the complaint, and no evidence was given on the trial before the referee of the worth of the services of the plaintiff, the second of such cases <em>(McSpedon </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c.) </em>is entirely free from it. In that case such a cause of action was alleged, evidence was furnished of the value of the services, the point was distinctly made by the counsel for the plaintiff, and passed upon by the court in its opinion. This court in giving its opinion, even in the first case, by holding that no cause of action could arise for work done, where a contract had been attempted to be made in a form forbidden by law in relation to it, fixed the kind of illegality attached to it; it not only considered it as being incapable of being enforced in the form in which it was made, but also in the light of a violation of a prohibitory statute, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>those forbidding acts as against, public, policy, <em>(Bissell </em>v. <em>Mich. S. and N. Ind. R. R. Co., </em>22 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>297 <em>to </em>305, <em>per Selden, J.) </em>so that acts done under them could confer no rights. Such a view necessarily excludes a right. to recover upon, a <em>quantum meruit </em>for the services which had been rendered under a contract made in a. form forbidden by statute. The greater part of the opinion of the court in that case was devoted to examining whether the plaintiff could recover upon an implied, contract if the special contract were illegal, as had been held by the referee. In the course of that examination' the power of such corporation to make such implied contracts was fully discussed. But in the second of those cases (at the hearing of which, the learned judge who delivered the opinion1 in the first case, sat upon the bench, without, expressing- any change of views) this court expressly held the decision in the prior case to be decisive of- the question \u25a0 of the want of power to make such contracts for supplies and work in any other than the statutory mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The language employed by the learned judge who delivered the opinion-of the court, in the first case, was quite strong and emphatic. He considered \u201c the answer\u201d to the question, whether the defendants were liable to the plaintiff -upon as <em>quantum meruit, </em>because the work had been performed and was accepted, \u201c inevitable and too obvious to allow of extended discussion;\u201d if \u201c answered affirmatively, * * officers and agents through whom alone the corporation could act, might disregard the statute, and in practice repeal it.\u201d It was to <em>\u201c </em>the mind of the court the prominent objection to the plaintiff's case, and laying out of view every other objection * * it seemed to them fatal to it.\u201d He founded such conclusions upon the principle that where- a statute has defined the mode of making a contract, no other could be adopted, citing therefor a remark in the case of <em>The Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>(5 <em>Barb. </em>649,) and holding that persons dealing with such corporation were bound to know the restrictions upon its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In the second of such cases, in which, as I have stated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>same question was fairly and technically presented by the pleadings, it was again considered by the court. The learned judge who delivered its opinion, declared in, if possible, still more decided language, that such city corporation could <em>\u201c </em>make no contract' or-promise, express\" or implied, except in-the manner and with all the formalities prescribed by the statute. Ho promise or engagement, or act of acceptance or ratification, by the officers or agents-of a corporation thus incapacitated, could render it liable or give to any one-a cause, of action \"against it.\u201d Adding, that a <em>\u201c </em>different doctrine would render void all attempts at legal restraint upon the conduct or acts of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">It is true that in neither of such cases was the question directly discussed, whether the - statute under consideration, (1853,) from which the statute of 1857, in that respect, was copied, was absolutely \u25a0 restrictive on the power of the city corporation to: make contracts, or only directory, and guarded by penal laws against officers who should violate or evade it. It was perhaps assumed that it was the former ; but whether this court was then right or wrong in that view, I do not consider that it is now at liberty to disregard such solemn and reiterated decisions, whether well or ill founded, or accompanied by the reasoning on which it was founded, or not.. The fact that other grounds were given in the first case for the. decision would not impair the authority of the second, sustained as it is by the necessity for such: decision therein, and by its own reasoning as well as that of such first cas\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">That view \u00f3f the law would be decisive of this case, if furnishing gas for the public lamps be supplies furnished, within the meaning of the statutes of 1857 and 1861, to be contracted for by a proposal and bids, and a contract therefor is not excepted therefrom. But it is contended that some obligation was imposed upon the corporation to consume and pay for the gas of such company, and some correlative right vested in the latter-to furnish such gas, leaving the-value to be subsequently and . otherwise determined ; and that such obligation and right arose from the formation of the Harlem Gaslight Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pany <em>under the general law for </em>forming such companies. <em>(Laws of </em>1848, <em>ch. </em>37, \u00a7 18 ; 3 <em>Stat. at Large, by </em>Edmonds, 849,) the imposition on the <em>city </em>corporation, or the department of streets and lamps, by the charter of the former, or the amendments thereto of 1849, creating the latter, <em>(Val. Comp. </em>260,) and those of 1857, <em>(ut supra,) </em>of the duty of lighting the city, and the license by the common council of such city to such company to lay main pipes to conduct gas for lighting lamps through a certain portion of such city, pursuant to the eleventh section of such general act; and that the provisions of the statute of 1857 and 1861, in regard to contracts before referred to, were not applicable to the mere determination of the value of the gas so to be consumed. The fact that the lowest price for all kinds of supplies necessary for the discharge of the duties of the city government is the main, if not almost the sole, object aimed at by the restrictions on the mode of making contracts prescribed by such statute, would be \u00e1 complete answer to any supposed efficacy in dispensing with such restrictions, attributable to such an indefinite obligation or <em>right; </em>and the supply of that ingredient would be essential to make such an obligation so definite a contract as to be capable of being enforced in a court of law. But I have been unable to bring myself to the conclusion, that the mere imposition of a duty upon a municipal corporation to light public streets, accompanied by the grant of a power to it to license the laying of gas pipes in such streets by gas companies created under a general act of incorporation ; and the actual creation of a company under such act, and a license granted to it by such corporation to lay such pipes in a particular part of the city, either created any obligation by the latter to give to the former the exclusive privilege of furnishing gas to light that part of the city, or relieved such corporation from the duty of making such contract in the mode in which they would have been bound to make it, if the gas company had been a private individual, and the license to lay pipes had been granted by some other person or body. Such city corporation might, it is true, virtually create a monopoly by refusing to license another company to lay gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>pipes as a competitor to the first; but it is clear it could not have the right to do so merely to prevent competition. Any abuse of its discretion in that respect, which is a public trust, if it could not be corrected by the courts, might be by the legislature. And although it may be a matter of mere form to advertise for bids, if all other licenses were refused, because but one bid could be \"given, and that by the existing company, the publicity of the advertisement and bids might at least operate to call the attention of the public to their character. The members of the corporation might also, at least, determine whether an exorbitant demand should be complied with; for I cannot construe the statute of 1861, any more than that of 1857, as creating a contract <em>ipso facto </em>in favor of the lowest bidder, without the possibility of escape therefrom by the municipal authorities. A contract, at all events, so made, would be determinate. Any corrective for the greed of a company or the negligence or corruption of a municipal corporation might be left to the legislature. At all events, no court being at liberty to hold that a statutory form may be dispensed with because rendered in its opinion useless, the remedy is with that same body.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">I do not perceive the analogy of the cases of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>(17 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>584,) <em>The Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>(4 <em>Bosw. </em>89,) or <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>(21 <em>How. </em>1,) to a case like the present, where the monopoly or exclusive advantages of the company are the result of the joint action or omission of it and the municipal corporation. The first of such cases was for work done; and was put upon the sole ground of the individual and peculiar skill of the party employed as a professional man, which would characterize his services, and could not be imparted to or employed or possessed by any other ; the second, upon the peculiar merits of a piece of land as a building site for a market; and the third, upon the ground of the suddenness of the occasion for the services to be rendered, and the impossibility of ascertaining beforehand their duration. There could certainly be no such peculiar quality in the gas to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>furnished hy the company for lighting purposes, as to make it essential that its manufacture alone should he used. Ho peculiar mode of lighting the streets is imposed upon such municipal corporation as a duty ; and the latter; after ascertaining, without any advertisement for bids, that the only company in1 existence could not or would not' furnish .the gas at a reasonable price, are not debarred from adopting other methods of lighting the streets, in case a new company should not be formed. The duty was imposed before the company was created, and the regulation of its performance must be carried on without regard to the existence of\" the latter, unless directly required bylaw to be contracted with for its performance. \"</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">Another argument in favor of the company is drawn from a supposed irreparable- injury, in case -a contract for furnishing gas f\u00f3r lighting the Streets in the district which it \u2019supplies, is not entered into with it.' If that be so, it clearly has the monopoly, and may dictate its own terms. The legislature, however, could not have intended to give it such power, at least so far as the first cited acts were concerned, or they \u2019would have done so in -express terms. Hone of their -acts ar\u00e9 t\u00f3 be-construed as intended to produce that result, unless as an inevitable consequence. Remedies for want of light or substitutes for gas, however inadequate to take its place entirely, may always be provided. It is an alarming power t\u00f3 be possessed by any one, to be able to prescribe on what terms an indispensable article shall be supplied, in consequence of their monopoly \u00f3f it. If they really possess it, a contract would be unnecessary; they only n\u00e9ed prescribe the terms in order to become entitled to them; I' do not, therefore!, think the argument <em>ab incorivenienti </em>sufficiently strong to take the case out of the statutes of 1857 and 1861. \u25a0 \u25a0 '</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">It can hardly be necessary to discuss the question whether gas is a <em>supply, </em>within the meaning of the statute. It must be equally so with any other illuminating, fluid, although gaseous in form and flowing \"through pipes, instead of being carried in vessels and measured by a meter instead of a vessel of liquid measure. I can find, therefore, no reason for exempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ing the gas company in this case from being subjected to the statute of 1857 as to making a contract in the mode therein prescribed, if that is inevitable in all cases of supplies furnished. But even if it were otherwise, it would be difficult to establish, from the facts admitted in tins case, any contract by:the city corporation with the company, since such contract must be made either directly by the former or by agents \u25a0 lawfully authorized to make the same, of neither of which is there sufficient evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">With the exception of public lamps on the Eighth avenue, between Eighty-fourth and One Hundred and Twenty-fifth streets, which were ordered to be lighted since September last, no direct action was taken by the common council' of the city since their first contract of July, 1860, requiring lamps supplied by the company with gas under it to be continued to be so supplied. The materials for any agreement for that purpose, as detailed in the case submitted, consist of the ordering and furnishing by such common council, of lamps placed within the districts lighted by the company; and paying for their erection and for the gas consumed therein,'until the month of September last, at' a\" rate-fixed by a -Written contract, which expired in July, 1860. During that month the public lamps in such district were lighted with gas furnished by the company, under the superintendence' and by the' direction of the superintendent of gas and lamps, during the parts of the day designated by the street commissioner. In August last, notice was given by the company of an intention to raise the price of such gas, after the 1st of September following, to that now claimed by them. I have not been able to satisfy myself that the connection of the lamps erected by the common council with the gas pipes of the company, and the payment by the former of bills for furnishing of such lamps with gas down to September, 1864, and the furnishing of such gas by the company, and lighting of such lamps subsequently, under the direction of such superintendent, would together create a direct contract by the city corporation with such company, to pay for the gas consumed during such month of September, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>rate mentioned in such notice, although admitted to be its reasonable value. Such first contract might possibly, upon the principles applicable to leases of houses or hiring of servants, or an established custom, be assumed t\u00f3 be continued on the same terms. <em>(Jackson </em>v. McLeod, 12 <em>John. </em>182. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Prindle, </em>23 <em>Wend. </em>616. <em>Evertson </em>v. <em>Sawyer, 2 id. </em>507. <em>Chitty on Cont. </em>20, 323.) But unless the goods furnished at the enhanced rate were actually received by the party to whom they were furnished, or their agents duly authorized for the purpose, after notice of such price, such party would not be bound for that price. In no case would previous express or implied contracts to pay at a different price bind the city corporation to pay at such enhanced price, and they may therefore be discarded as evidence of a contract at the latter price for September^ 1864.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The corporation of the city of New York cannot be said to have actually accepted and consumed the article in question, unless by authorizing its receipt and consumption by others. Although charged with the performance of public duties, and representing the public in their discharge, they are not so identical with that public, who enjoy the benefit of the consumption of the gas, and may thus be said to have received it, as to become liable by such receipt. For the benefit so received there is no mode of reaching such public by an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">If, therefore, the gas was not to be considered as furnished under an implied contract at the same price as before, or any express or implied direct assent of such corporation to a new price, the superintendent of lamps derived no new power to bind the corporation for such price from any previous consumption of gas without a contract, and payment of a \u25a0 less price, since all the power he had was derived from the recent statutes altering the city charter. He was not an agent of the corporation as an artificial person or body corporate ; but only of that portion of the public who might inhabit, and be liable to taxation in, the county of New York, pursuant to authority delegated to him by statute. <em>(Darlington </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>31 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>164.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>By the amendments of the city charter in 1857, (<em>Val. Comp. </em>268,) th\u00e9 legislative power only of the body politic known as \u201cThe mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of Mew York,\" was vested in a common council, an elective body, (\u00a7 2 ;) its executive power in a mayor, also elected by the people, and executive departments, (\u00a7 16,) composed of various officers, some of whom were elected, (\u00a7 19,) and some appointed, (Id.;) such executive department have various duties assigned to them, (\u00a7\u00a7 22 to 29,) and their heads are to be appointed by the mayor, with the consent of the board of aldermen, (\u00a7 19 ;) in several departments, (including the street department, (\u00a7 23,) bureaux are created, (\u00a7\u00a7 22, 23 to 28,) whose chiefs are to be appointed by the head of the department; (\u00a7 21,) the power of creating other bureaux besides those specially named, is delegated to the common council of such city, as well as that of assigning to them and to the departments and bureaux thereby created, duties not inconsistent with that act, (\u00a7 28.) Such statutes also directed the duties of such bureaux and departments to be performed according to the laws, charter, and ordinances of such city <em>(Id.) </em>Among such executive departments is \u201c the street department,\" to have cognizance, among other things, of \u201c lighting streets, roads, places, and avenues.\" A bureau in such department is called that \u201c of lamps and gas,\u201d and its chief officer \u201c superintendent of lamps and gas,\u201d \u2022 (\u00a7 23.) The common council of such city, in their legislative capacity, discharged the duty devolved on them by such statute, of assigning to various departments, including the street department and its various bureaux (including that of \u201c lamps and gas,\u201d) various duties in regard to the matters placed under their cognizance by such statute, bypassing various ordinances in relation thereto. Such ordinances were revised and repassed in the year 1859, and the duties and powers of the street department and bureau of lamps and gas are to be found in the first, second, and ninth articles of the fourth chapter of that collection. By them, such department was to have cognizance of the same matters as was prescribed in the twenty-third section of such statute, as well as doing and furnishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>all necessary work, repairs, and supplies, not provided for. in other departments. (P. <em>79, </em>\u00a7 1.) The chief officer of it,: (street commissioner,) was to have general charge and direction of all matters intrusted to it.' (P. 80, \u00a7 3.) He is required to make all contracts for \u201c work, material, or supplies/\u2019 relating to any of the matters under the ^cognizance of his department. <em>(Icl: </em>\u00a7 5.) But all expenditure over a certain sum ($250) is forbidden to be made for any work or supplies within such cognizance, <em>unless authorized by the common council. \u25a0 (Id. </em>\u00a7 6.) The bureau of lamps and gas1 is also thereby charged with the duty of superintending the <em>lighting </em>of the public streets, and the constructing of, and procuring necessary supplies and fixtures for public lamps. (P. 98, \u00a7 77.) The head of it (superintendent) is required to take charge of,, and superintend\" the lighting of such lamps, <em>(p. </em>99, \u00a7 80 ;) to report to the street commissioner \" violations -of contracts \u25a0 for supplying the city with gas for such lighting, <em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 82,): and to be under the control of such commissioner generally, in all matters connected with his bureau. (P. 100, \u00a7 87.) The statute of 1857 also forbade the incurring of any expense by- any- department or officer, whether ordered by the common council'or not, without' a previous appropriation to cover it. .</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">It seems to be settled by the recent cases of <em>Darlington </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>in the Court of Appeals, <em>supra, </em>that the corporation of the city of New York is in no sense a private one, except- so far as it can take, hold, or transfer property, and then only as the: representative of the; state; of course, with the sam\u00e9 rights and liabilities in relation thereto as other owners. <em>(Brower </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. </em>3 <em>Barb. </em>254. <em>Lacour </em>v. <em>Same, </em>3 <em>Duer, </em>406.) Its \u201cboards \u2018of aldermen and councilmen and <em>other </em>Officers \u201d are, in the prevailing opinion in that c\u00e1se, declared to' be-' \u201cas truly public officers as the boards of supervisors and sheriffs'and clerks of counties'.\u201d The devolution upon the street commissioner and chief of the bureau of lamps and gas of the duties prescribed in the statute of 1857, or ordinances made ini pursuance thereof, rendered\" them also, as to such duties, quasi civil and public officer's, and not mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>servants of the corporation. (Martin <em>v. The Mayor of Brooklyn, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>545.) .. How far by such devolution the corporation was relieved from any liability, by indictment or action, for the non-performance of such duties, may be still an open question. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. of Brooklyn, ubi sup. Weet </em>v. <em>Trustees of Brooklyn, </em>16 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>161.) Such powers may be concurrent, and. the exercise of them by either may relieve the other from all liability for non-performance. At all events, the discharge of such duties by the proper officer would not be, in any case, so far the result of his being an agent of such corporation, as to confer on him, as such, additional powers, not expressly granted, although their exercise might be necessary for the performance of such duty. In other words, the duty of superintending the lighting of public lamps would not carry with it the right of making contracts binding such corporation for furnishing an illuminating fluid.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The <em>\u201c </em>procuring all necessary supplies \u201d for public lamps by the superintendent of lamps and gas in section seventy-seven of the fourth chapter of the corporation ordinances did not refer to gas, as is evident by reference to the fifth, sixth, and eightieth sections of the same chapter. The first of those sections requires contracts for any supplies to be made by the street commissioner ; the second forbids any expenditure for supplies unless authorized by the common council, or the expense does not exceed two hundred and fifty dollars <em>; </em>and.the, third requires the superintendent to keep such supplies in a place to be prescribed by a street commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Whether, therefore, the superintendent of lamps and gas was a public officer, whose power and. duties were limited by statute, or was an agent of the corporation whose authority was limited by such ordinances, he was not authorized to make any contract for furnishing gas, and any supposed consumption by him of that furnished by the Harlem company, by the lighting of burners of lamps through which it flowed, could not be an acceptance by the city corporation. The resolution of the common council passed after the month of September, 1864, for lighting lamps- in the Eighth avenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>from the gas of the company in the. same manner as the other street lamps in such district, could not be construed into a ratification of the previous \u2022 consumption of gas in lamps so previously lighted during that month. And there was no such other evidence of such ratification as to bring this case within those of <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>(17 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>449,) and <em>The People </em>v. <em>Flagg, (Id. </em>584,) where the contracts of agents, or their fruits, were directly adopted or received by the corporation, with full knowledge of the nature of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">I think, therefore, judgment should be given for the defendants, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">J udgment for the plaintiffs. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
