Root, </em>18 <em>id. 22. Johnson </em>v. <em>Parmely, </em>17 <em>id. </em>129.) The language used in the Code, (as under the Revised Laws and Revised Statutes,) is broad enough to cover all actions, and yet it has uniformly, and scarcely with an exception, been held that references are proper only in actions founded on <em>contract, </em>and never in actions <em>ex delicto. </em>(<em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Desfosse, </em>7 <em>Bosw. </em>678.) <em>;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">This action is brought against the defendants to recover the value of property lost to the plaintiff by the negligence and carelessness of the defendants, as \u25a0 common carriers. Such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>action does not proceed upon an allegation of the non-performance of a contract, but for a breach of duty, and is not. referable. (7 <em>Hill, </em>182, 581. 4 <em>How. Pr. </em>286. 19 <em>Wend. </em>239. 3 <em>id. </em>167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The motion to refer must be denied, with $10 costs, to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
