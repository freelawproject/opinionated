In his opening, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel may properly, and usually does, state such facts only as he desires to impress upon the minds of the jurors. To hold him, in his address, to the exactness and certainty of a pleading, would, in many cases, be to impose upon him a duty which it would be exceedingly inconvenient, if not impossible, for him to perform orally. Indeed, I see no reason why he may not state to the jury, or refrain from stating, just so much of the case as his judgment dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I do not mean to say that a fatal admission made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his opening may not entitle the defendant thereupon to a judgment dismissing the complaint, without the formality of taking evidence which must necessarily be useless. This motion, however, is not based upon such an admission, but merely on the ground that the counsel has not stated in' his opening sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. It must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
