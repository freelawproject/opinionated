A motion was made to set aside this order, and it was denied. A motion was subsequently made, to reduce the amount of bail, and it was refused ; the plaintiff having consented to reduce the amount of bail to the sum of $2500. The defendant appealed from the order denying his motions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b710-11\"><em>N.

To make one a partner he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>not only share in the profits, but share in them as principal. <em>(Loomis v. Marshall, </em>12 <em>Conn. R. </em>77. <em>Burckle </em>v. <em>Eckart, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>337. 3 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>34. <em>Poirer et al. v. Fisher, </em>8 <em>Bosw. </em>258.) The defendant had no interest in the goods ; after the sale of the goods his compensation for services was fixed by the agreement to pay him a certain portion of the net profits arising from such sale. The cases are numerous in which similar arrangements have been made, and it was held that there was no partnership. <em>(See Collyer on Partnership, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 23,25,26,27,28, 32, 33, <em>and cases cited in the notes.) </em>It is stated to be the general rule that a joint undertaking among two or more persons who are to participate in the profit and <em>loss </em>resulting from it, constitutes a partnership. <em>(Sage </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>2 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>417. <em>Chase v. Barrett, </em>4 <em>Paige, </em>148.) The defendant, by his agreement, was not liable for any losses. The only sense in which he can be said to participate in losses is by the reduction of the amount which he may receive by reason of losses by depreciation of stock, bad debts, &amp;c. &amp;c. being deducted from the gross profits prior to his compensation being ascertained. If the losses should exhaust the gross profits, his labor and services would be rendered without receiving pecuniary reward therefor, but the losses would be borne solely by the plaintiff, who, under the agreement, could not require the defendant to contribute for any portion thereof. (4 <em>Sandf. </em>311. 5 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>186. 5 <em>Denio, </em>68. 25 <em>Barb. </em>13.) The action being one in which an order of arrest can issue as of course, (in which after judgment finding an indebtedness arising out of fiduciary relations between the parties, an execution against the person can issue irrespective of an order having previously been granted,) it is not proper to try the case upon the merits upon application to set aside the order of arrest. It ist by no means clear upon the case as presented, that a verdict for a larger amount may not be rendered against the defendant than that in which he has been holden to bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The orders were correct, and must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
