J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjL\">The charge of adultery, sought to be set up in the answer, may be a good subject for a separate action. It is not a counter-claim, because it does not arise out of the transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, nor is- it connected with the subject of the action. (Code, \u00a7 150. <em>Diddell </em>v. Diddell, 3 <em>Abb. </em>167.) Nor is it a defense, because not connected with the acts of cruelty charged in the complaint. The kinds of relief asked for, are entirely different, so that they cannot be joined in one action, <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, &amp; John. Ch. </em>163; <em>McIntosh </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>12 <em>How. Pr. </em>289,) and the entire incongruity of the causes of action would prevent their being tried in one action. <em>(McNamara </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>9 <em>Abb. </em>18.) And it has been so held, in one case. <em>(Burdell </em>v. <em>Burdell, </em>2 <em>Barb. </em>473. <em>S. C. </em>3 <em>How. Pr. </em>216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">It is not necessary to notice other objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">Motion denied, with $7 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
