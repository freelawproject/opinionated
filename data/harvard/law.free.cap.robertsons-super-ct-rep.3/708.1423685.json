It was said by a very learned judge, upon directing a new undertaking in a larger sum than that given to the sheriff, that <em>\u201c </em>an unscrupulous plaintiff may take personal property of any value, however large, by giving an undertaking in any sum, however small.\u201d This is not satisfactory reasoning. The defendant can sustain no injury by the averment of a lesser sum than the real value of the property claimed, as the Code provides that he may retake it, (\u00a7 211,) and the plaintiff cannot assert or obtain judgment for a greater sum ; so that, in fact, the defendant would be the gainer by the error, or attempted wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">It was held in <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>(3 <em>Code Rep. </em>89,) that the only remedy for the defendant was an action against the sheriff, where sham security was taken. The defect, if it be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>one, of a want of stamp upon the undertaking, can he cured upon exception to it. <em>(Note to Smith, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>McFall, </em>18 <em>Wend. </em>521, 523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The affidavit described the property with sufficient certainty to enable the sheriff to take it; if the affidavit did not do so, he might have refused to execute the requisition. <em>(Dewitt </em>v. <em>Morris, &amp;c. </em>13 <em>Wend. </em>496.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The motion must he denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
