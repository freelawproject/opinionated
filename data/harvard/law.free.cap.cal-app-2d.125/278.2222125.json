Defendant does not question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s implied finding of defendant\u2019s negligence, but contends plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence <em>as a matter of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><em>2. </em>Did the court err in refusing to inform the jury after its retirement that plaintiff\u2019s deposition, or a portion of it, could be read? If so, was such error prejudicial?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">For over two and a half years plaintiff had been a policeman of the city of Berkeley, engaged in parking meter maintenance. He drove a three-wheeled motorcycle and at the time of the accident was engaged in checking parking meters. Defendant maintained two sets of interurban tracks along West Shattuck Avenue. Under agreement with the city, defendant was required to pave and keep in repair the portion of the street occupied by the tracks and for 2 feet on each side thereof. In the intersection of West Shattuck Avenue and Addison Street there is a \u201ccrossover\u201d and a switchbox which is partly covered by wooden planking and partly by metal plate. Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was based upon the alleged careless and negligent maintenance of the street by defendant in the area immediately adjacent to defendant\u2019s tracks \u201cin that they permitted a large hole or depression to remain, and exist for a long period of time, in said street adjacent to said tracks.\u201d The evidence showed that the pavement was in a defective condition, that pieces were broken out and some of the pavement raised above and some below the level of the tracks. Plaintiff testified that there were several holes there. Plaintiff was familiar with the crossing, having gone over it at least twice a day during his employment by the city, and knew of its defective condition for that length of time. On this day, having cheeked the meters on one side of Shattuck, he was required to go to the other side to check the meters there. This required him to cross defendant\u2019s tracks at the intersection. He was proceeding at 5 to 7 miles per hour, in low gear, was in the act of shifting to second gear, had turned his head slightly to look for traffic when \u201cthere was a terrific snap in my neck . . .,\u201d the motorcycle \u201ctook a sharp jolt,\u201d he heard the switchbox cover clanking and had no further recollection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>until he was at the west curb of Shattuek 10 to 15 feet from the intersection. Plaintiff\u2019s neck injury was serious. Defendant contended at the trial, in addition to contending plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, that the pavement was not defective as claimed, and that the accident happened at a gap in the switchbox cover concerning which there was no complaint of negligent maintenance. As the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s implied adverse findings on the two latter subjects is not challenged, it is unnecessary to detail defendant\u2019s evidence in regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">1. <em>Contributory Negligence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The contention that plaintiff, as a matter of law, was contributorily negligent, is based upon plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he knew for more than two and a half years the condition of the pavement where the accident occurred, and that he steered his motorcycle into the place where the condition existed. This contention overlooks the fact that plaintiff\u2019s duties required him to cross at this intersection, that the testimony shows that the pavement adjacent to the tracks against the entire width of Addison Street was in the same condition, and he had no choice except to cross the rough pavement; that in spite of this condition plaintiff had never theretofore experienced any bumps or difficulty in crossing; that he was in the process of making a left-hand turn and looking for traffic, thereby momentarily and necessarily taking his eyes from the pavement, and that he did not deliberately ride into any particular hole or depression. While the evidence might have supported a finding of contributory negligence, it did not compel it. Whether plaintiff, under all the circumstances of the ease, was guilty of contributory negligence because of his knowledge of the conditions at the intersection, was a question of fact and not of law. We cannot say that the evidence of contributory negligence meets the test required to prove it as a matter of law.  This test is stated in <em>Severin </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 331, 333-334 [231 P.2d 134], quoting from <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Hobbie, </em>25 Cal.2d 814, 818 [155 P.2d 826] : \u201c \u2018The rule has been stated in various ways in a legion of eases, that contributory negligence is not established as a matter of law unless the only reasonable hypothesis is that such negligence exists; that reasonable or sensible men could have drawn that conclusion and none other; that where there are different inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>that may be drawn, one for and one against, the one against will be followed; and that before it can be held as a matter of law that contributory negligence exists, the evidence must point unerringly to that conclusion. (Citing many cases.) \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">2. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Deposition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In impeachment of plaintiff, defendant used a portion of the deposition taken of plaintiff by defendant, reading that portion into evidence. Thereafter defendant offered the whole deposition, and suggested a stipulation that any part of it might later be read to the jury. Plaintiff refused to stipulate that any portion could be read other than that which had already been read. Defendant then stated he would later ask permission to read it into evidence. The deposition was admitted. In argument defendant read to the jury portions of the deposition, apparently additional to those theretofore read. The entire deposition was not read. The jury retired to deliberate at 2:16 p. m. At 3:04 in chambers, the judge informed counsel that the jury had requested a certain exhibit and \u201cto see the deposition\u201d and that he intended to send in all the exhibits but not the deposition. All parties agreed and now agree that it would be improper to give the jury the deposition. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 612, prohibits it.) Defendant immediately requested that the jury be told that it could have reread the portions already read, if it so desired. Plaintiff objected on the ground that the jury had not asked to have them read. The court refused to instruct the jury as requested. At 3:50 p. m. the judge informed counsel that the jury had asked the bailiff to convey a message to the judge \u201cthat they considered the deposition the important thing.\u201d Defendant again requested that the jury be informed of its right to return to the courtroom and have read to it such portion of the deposition as had been read into evidence, at least. Plaintiff then objected to such an instruction and stated that if any of the deposition was to be read the whole should be read but objected to any reading whatever as the jury had not asked for a reading. Considerable discussion by court and counsel ensued, defendant insisting that the jury be informed of its right to have, if not the whole deposition, the portion already read, again read. Plaintiff insisted that no instruction be given the jury but that if any of the deposition were read the whole should be read. The court then denied defendant\u2019s request. Thereupon defendant further requested that the jury be returned to the courtroom and asked by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>just what it wanted from the deposition. \u201cIt is just like having only one section of the testimony read.\u201d Plaintiff stated: \u201cThat would follow my point, that if the jury should hear the deposition, they should hear the entire deposition with the exception of the objections.\u201d Defendant then stated that the jury was entitled to be told of its right to have the whole of the deposition read, less any objectionable matter. Plaintiff again objected to any instruction being given. Thereupon the court instructed the bailiff to inform the jury that the law prohibits the taking of a deposition to the jury room. In its original instructions to the jury the court did not inform the jury of its right to return to court for testimony and instructions, which right is provided in section 614, Code of Civil Procedure. At 4:40 p. m. the jury returned to the courtroom with a 10 to 2 verdict in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">It is clear from the action of the jury that it wanted to know something that was in the deposition, and that it did not know how to get the information. It first asked for the deposition itself. On being informed that it could not be taken to the jury room the jury informed the judge that in its mind it considered the deposition \u201cthe important thing.\u201d This message obviously would not have been sent if the jury did not feel it needed at least some portion of the deposition to clear up confusion over some part of its contents. It was the duty of the judge to have the jury brought into the courtroom, to ascertain what the jury wanted from the deposition, \u2018or, at the very least, to inform it that it had a right to have at least a portion of the deposition read. If on returning to the courtroom the jury asked for more than it was entitled to have read, the judge could, of course, limit it to that to which it was entitled. But to refuse to inform it of its rights in this respect, when the judge was, in effect, informed that the jury was in difficulty in some way about the deposition, clearly prevented a fair trial, unless the matters in the deposition were inconsequential. While the jury\u2019s action did not constitute in so many words a request for a reading of some portion of the transcript, such action can reasonably be interpreted only as such a request, and as held in <em>Kerner </em>v. <em>Surface Transportation Corp., </em>266 App.Div. 356 [42 N.Y.S. 2d 296], a court\u2019s refusal to comply with the jury\u2019s request in this respect constitutes error. <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Helms Bakeries, </em>43 Cal.App.2d 587 [111 P.2d 431], upon which plaintiff relies, is not in point. There the reviewing court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the trial judge had instructed the jury that if it wanted any portions of the instructions reread at any time, to so inform the bailiff, and that no request therefor in any form had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In his brief plaintiff stated that shortly prior to the trial, the members of this jury together with all other members of the panel were given general instructions including an instruction embodying the contents of section 612, Code of Civil Procedure, and on oral argument offered to augment the record to show that fact. We denied the request primarily because such fact would make the court\u2019s refusal here no less error. This brings us to the question of the effect of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Concerning the condition of the street at the scene of the accident plaintiff testified that there were \u201cPieces broken out, some of it raised above the level of the track, some below, very rough.\u201d \u201c. . . it had just been chewed up, broken out, and it was a drop of, oh, I\u2019d say three to four inches . . . from below the level of the rail.\u201d \u201cSome of the pavement was missing that chunks had broken out.\u201d \u201c. . . there was no pavement there. That is, it had been broken out . . . pieces of pavement ground up, chewed up.\u201d His motorcycle \u201cbounced\u2014I mean, dropped down in that depression in the pavement between the two tracks.\u201d He \u201creceived a jolt as . . . [he] came to the rail . . . The east rail of the crossover.\u201d The difference between the level of the rail and the pavement was \u201cI\u2019d say three inches.\u201d He testified when asked if the hole there (meaning where he felt the jolt) was-any deeper than any place else, that there were several along the track that were just as bad; that they were not holes one could number, nor was it just one hole, \u201cjust uneven, down and up.\u201d Nothing there was flush with the track. He may have told the referee of the Industrial Accident Commission at a hearing that he was crossing \u201cthe switch at the location of the switchbox. \u2019 \u2019 In his deposition he stated that the pavement was broken out and soft above the level of the rail at least 2 inches and soft below and where the pavement was gone \u201cit is a pretty deep hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">He testified that the front wheel of the motorcycle was \u201cwrenched,\u201d \u201cJerked. A violent twist.\u201d In his deposition when asked if that wheel turned at all he said \u201cno.\u201d There he also stated that the motorcycle got \u201cplenty of bounce\u201d and stated that he -evidently then lost control of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The above matters are the only ones in the deposition which</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>were read to the jury. It is conceded that some other portion or portions were read by defendant in argument. For this reason and because defendant claims that the jury was entitled to have the whole deposition, less objectionable matter, read to it if it so desired (a matter which we deem it unnecessary to determine) we have studied the entire deposition. Neither in the foregoing extracts from the deposition nor in any other part of it do we find any substantial contradiction with plaintiff\u2019s testimony at the trial nor anything affecting his credibility. Nor do we find anything which in any reasonable probability would have caused any of the jurors to vote differently than they did. We are forced to the conclusion that the error has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (See Const., art. VI, \u00a7 4\u00bd.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Peters, P.
