Accordingly in California such a license should be viewed as a property right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Section 7 also provides that \u201cEach license issued under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>this act \u2022 . . may be transferred by or to ... a receiver of the estate of a licensee, or an assignee for the benefit of creditors of a licensee with the consent of the assignor.\u201d Respondent argues that, \u201cThe words, \u2018a receiver of the estate of a licensee,\u2019 are reasonably to be interpreted to include a receiver appointed by a court to enforce a judgment or to do any of the other things which a receiver may do pursuant to law in the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u201cSection 7.2 provides the procedure under which a liquor license may be transferred. In the third paragraph, entitled \u2018Applicability of the Section,\u2019 it states that the provisions of the section relative to giving notice of transfer and to the establishment of an escrow for transfer need not he complied with by \u2018an executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, <em>receiver or other person </em>acting in the legal or proper discharge of official duty.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) It is the contention of respondent that by including this provision in Section 7.2 the Legislature has clearly disclosed its intention that a receiver may be appointed to sell a liquor license and apply the proceeds for the satisfaction of a money judgment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">It appears from the record that appellant had no property or interest of value other than the liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The fact that the approval and consent of the Board of Equalization is necessary is beside the issue so far as respondent\u2019s efforts to collect the judgment is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">It is common knowledge that liquor licenses are bought and sold in the open market notwithstanding the necessity of the board\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">It appears that the order appointing a receiver to take possession of and to sell the liquor license to satisfy the judgment is a valid order. It is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
