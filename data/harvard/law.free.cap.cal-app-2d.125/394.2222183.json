B. S. Steel and Forge, a corporation, the question is whether or not the evidence supports the implied finding that Alameda County is not a county in which the defendant corporation may be sued upon the causes of action stated in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">\u201cA corporation . . . may be sued in the county where the contract is made or is to be performed, or where the obligation or liability arises, or the breach occurs; or in the county where the principal place of business of such corporation is situated . . .\u201d (Const., art. XII, S 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">It appears from the defendant corporation\u2019s affidavit that Los Angeles is the county \u201cwhere the principal place of business of such corporation is situated\u201d and that the only other defendant (Fred Riley, an individual) resides in Los Angeles County. Hence, Los Angeles is a proper county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>in which to sue the corporate defendant. But that does not prevent Alameda from being a proper county; e.g., as the county \u201cwhere the contract is made or is to be performed, or where the obligation or liability arises, or the breach occurs.\u201d On this issue the defendant has produced no evidence. Its supporting affidavit is totally silent in that regard. So, we turn to the complaint which also was in evidence at the hearing of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The complaint is in two counts: One, for anticipatory breach of an express oral contract; two, a common count for the value of services rendered, clearly referring to the same transaction as does the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In Count One we find the statement that the parties \u201centered into\u201d the contract \u201cin the City of Alameda, County of Alameda.\u201d That proves that Alameda is the county \u201cwhere the contract is [was] made,\u201d hence a county in which the plaintiffs have the right to sue the defendant corporation upon the cause of action stated in the first count. Defendant does not question this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In Count Two we find the statement that \u201cin the City of Alameda, County of Alameda, State of California, defendants became indebted\u201d to plaintiffs for services rendered, proof that Alameda is the county \u201cwhere the obligation or liability arises [arose]\u201d and as such a proper county for suit upon the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Defendant questions this line of reasoning. It says the expression \u201cbecame indebted\u201d is but a conclusion and without evidentiary value, especially in an unverified complaint such as here involved; that this leaves uncontradieted that portion of the first count of the complaint which states that the plaintiffs\u2019 services were \u201cin operations to raise and salvage a certain barge sunken off Point Orient, California\u201d; the court takes judicial notice of the fact that Point Orient is in Contra Costa County; the place of performance determined the place of \u201cbecoming indebted\u201d; hence, there is no showing that Alameda is a proper county under section 16 of article XII of the Constitution. There are several fallacies in this line of reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Defendant concedes that the complaint went into evidence without \u2022 objection. That makes competent as evidence the statements which it contains, whether verified or unverified, whether in the form of statements of fact or expressions of opinion, and whether within the knowledge of the pleader or hearsay as to him, <em>(Pacific Bal Industries </em>v. <em>Northern </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>Timber, Inc., </em>118 Cal.App.2d 815, 822-823, 827 [259 P.2d 465].)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Hence the statement that the defendants became indebted in Alameda County is evidence that the obligation arose in that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Inferentially, it may well be tantamount to saying that the services were performed in Alameda County upon the theory that in such a case the indebtedness is deemed incurred at the place where the services are rendered. Even if that be so there is still no conflict with the evidence as to the place of performance furnished by the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Count Two states that the services in suit \u201cconsisted of preparing and keeping available to defendants for salvaging operations plaintiffs\u2019 vessel the \u2018Ann L.\u2019; of keeping available for defendants\u2019 use the personal services of plaintiffs; and of the operation of said vessel for said purpose of salvaging operations on August 14, 1952. \u2019 \u2019 Count One describes these services with greater particularity, stating that the substance of the contract was that \u201cplaintiffs should and would prepare, make available and hold in readiness for defendants\u2019 use, plaintiffs\u2019 said vessel; that plaintiffs should and would keep their services available for the operation of said vessel; that plaintiffs should and would operate said vessel in operations to raise and salvage a certain barge sunken off Point Orient, California; that plaintiffs should and would purchase the food and fuel necessary in said operations; and further that plaintiffs should and would prepare said food for said operations when said vessel was to be in actual use therein; that in all of the aforementioned activities, plaintiffs should and would submit to said defendants control, direction and supervision.\u201d The only <em>place </em>here mentioned is Point Orient, judicially cognizable as a place in Contra Costa County, not Alameda County. The reasonable inference, of course, is that the actual work of salvaging the barge was to have been performed in Contra Costa County. There is no necessary inference that any of the preparatory work was to be performed at Point Orient, or at any other place in Contra Costa County,\u2014such as the work of preparing plaintiffs\u2019 vessel and holding it in readiness for defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>use, the purchase of necessary food and fuel, and other preparatory work and stand-by services. Those services conceivably could have been performed in Alameda County. Significantly, too, it appears from Count One that the actual work of salvaging the barge was not performed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs tendered but defendants refused performance. Defendants \"are now conducting the salvage operations contemplated in said contract but notwithstanding the terms thereof and said defendants\u2019 reaffirmations thereof, said defendants have used and are now using the vessel or vessels and services of one or more persons other than plaintiffs.\u201d Thus, for ought that appears in Count One, nearly all, perhaps all, of the services upon which Count Two is based may have been rendered in Alameda County. In short, it appears from the second count that the defendants became indebted in Alameda County, a statement not contradicted by any other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We are mindful of the principle that it is the function of the trial court, not that of the reviewing court, to resolve conflicts in the evidence, but here <em>the evidence shows without conflict </em>that the express contract pleaded in the first count was \"made\u201d in Alameda County and that the indebtedness pleaded in the second count \"arose\u201d in Alameda County. Also, when, as here, a corporate defendant moves for a change of venue, it bears the burden of showing that the action has not been brought in a county authorized by section 16 of article XII of the Constitution. <em>(Chase </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Coast R. Co., </em>83 Cal. 468 [23 P. 532]; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Policy Holders Life Ins. Assn., </em>131 Cal.App. 339 [21 P.2d 443]; <em>Konig </em>v. <em>Associated Almond Growers, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 360, 363-365 [99 P.2d 678]; <em>Swartz </em>v. <em>California Olive Growers\u2019 etc. Corp., </em>56 Cal.App.2d 168 [133 P.2d 20]; <em>G. W. McNear, Inc. </em>v. <em>Geophysical Service, Inc., </em>90 Cal.App.2d 662 [203 P.2d 550]; <em>Pacific Bal Industries </em>v. <em>Northern Timber, Inc., supra, </em>118 Cal. App.2d 815, 826 [259 P.2d 465]; 25 Cal.Jur. 909-910, Venue, \u00a7 42.) Here the corporate defendant has shown merely that the action was not brought in the county of its principal place of business and has failed to controvert in any way the evidence, furnished by the complaint, that the action was brought in a proper county.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider other points urged by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\"><em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore Dev. Co., </em>22 Cal.App. 167 [133 P. 978], cited by defendant, is not in point. The expression there involved was an allegation in a common count that \"defendant <em>was indebted </em>in Mono County,\u201d which \"manifestly is quite different from an allegation that <em>defendant became indebted\u201d </em>(p. 173) and was in conflict with certain statements of fact in that count of the complaint which specifically alleged the facts of the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
