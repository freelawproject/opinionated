Elliott, P.C. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) sustained the plaintiffs objections to certain questions posed by the defendant during cross-examination, (2) permitted evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s income to be admitted into evidence, (3) awarded excessive attorney\u2019s fees for the prosecution of the collection action and (4) accepted the affidavit of the plaintiffs counsel as to attorney\u2019s fees, which did not include contemporaneous time records. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Following a trial to the court, the court found the following facts. On November 13,1995, the Connecticut state dental commission (commission) summarily suspended the defendant\u2019s license to practice dentistry because a young female patient complained that the defendant had stalked and harassed her. The patient alleged that the defendant, under the guise of needing to talk with her about her dental care, obtained the address of the patient\u2019s employer in Washington, D.C., from the patient\u2019s mother. The patient also alleged that the defendant went to her place of employment in an attempt to meet her socially. At the time the patient made her complaint, the defendant\u2019s license was in a probationary status. Four or five other patients had also complained to the commission about the defendant and his license had been suspended once previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On November 17, 1995, the defendant met with Robert M. Elliott, an attorney and principal of the firm, to obtain legal representation. The defendant represented to Elliott that he was losing $30,000 a month due to the suspension and that he wanted Elliott to take all steps necessary to restore his license. In the years immediately prior to the 1995 suspension, the defendant earned approximately $200,000 to $400,000 per year from his dental practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">During their first meeting, the defendant signed a retainer agreement, which provided, in part, that the plaintiff\u2019s fee would be based on the amount of time spent and listed the hourly rates of the plaintiffs employees. The agreement also provided: \u201cBalances on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>your account are due and payable upon receipt of your statement. Interest will accrue on any outstanding balances after thirty days at ten percent per annum. Should you fail to pay your balances, you will be responsible for all costs of collection, including sheriffs fees and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The defendant knew and agreed that Elliott, the other attorneys and the paralegals in the firm would work on his case. Because the loss of his license prevented the defendant from earning a living, Elliott gave the defendant\u2019s case priority over other legal matters and assigned various aspects of the case to employees of the firm. The plaintiff was successful in having the defendant\u2019s dental license reinstated, but the defendant failed to pay the plaintiff in accordance with the retainer agreement. The plaintiff, therefore, commenced this collection action.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The trial court concluded that the work done by the firm was reasonable and necessary and that the result obtained was \u201calmost miraculous\u201d because the defendant\u2019s license to practice dentistry was reinstated on January 5, 1996, approximately six weeks after it was suspended. The trial court awarded the firm $13,637.33 for services rendered before the commission, $2275.73 in interest and $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees for the collection action, plus costs. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Three of the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal are of an evidentiary nature. \u201cIt is well settled that [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 497, 590 A.2d 901 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 659, 491 A.2d 345 (1985). [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>every reasonable presumption </em>in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a <em>manifest abuse of discretion. . . . State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 789, 699 A.2d 91 (1997). Moveover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Paige </em>v. <em>St. Andrew\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corp., </em>247 Conn. 24, 37, 718 A.2d 425 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly sustained the plaintiffs objections to the defendant\u2019s cross-examining members of the firm with respect to the reasonableness of the services rendered and the fees charged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The portions of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination relevant to our analysis follow.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Okay.

If this was a case attacking Attorney Elliott\u2019s competency and the manner in which he handled these hearings, perhaps this would be relevant. As I take it, it\u2019s not.

I thought I made it clear, whether or not, ultimately, certain legal pathways are successful, when one\u2019s client is in the situation Dr. Stuart was in, and the fact that certain things are brought and are unsuccessful is not necessarily not deserving of compensation, and my feeling is I probably would have done the same thing they did, so if that doesn\u2019t convince you not to pursue this avenue I hope it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: And that\u2019s a memo from you to Mr. Elliott regarding that phone call with Mr. Oaken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">\u201c[Witness]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: I offer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: I\u2019d inquire for what purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: To substantiate through documentary evidence the testimony that just came in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">\u201cThe Court: But what\u2019s the relevance of that testimony?

Okay? That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been trying to prove here, and a claim by another attorney for a referral fee which shows some motive or basis for my Ghent\u2019s position that he was overcharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll sustain the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201c[B]efore a party is entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. . . . When determining that issue in a civil case, the standard to be used is whether the erroneous ruling would likely affect the result. . . . Any testimony in a case that tends of itself or in connection with other testimony to influence the result on a fact in issue is material. If the testimony would tend to affect the verdict of the jury, it meets the test of materiality.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>215 Conn. 148, 153, 575 A.2d 206 (1990). The testimony that the defendant attempted to put into evidence as cited above is not material because, as the trial court correctly noted, it is not relevant to the plaintiffs claim for legal fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">\u201cIn the context of a civil case, our Supreme Court, in accepting a common law right to cross-examination, stated \u2018 [t]he right of cross-examination is not a privilege but [is] an absolute right and if one is deprived of a complete cross-examination he has a right to have the direct testimony stricken.\u2019 . . . This . . . does not, however, permit the defendant to present evidence that is irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">\u201c[In] . . . matters pertaining to control over cross-examination, a considerable latitude of discretion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>allowed. . . . The determination of whether a matter is relevant or collateral, and the scope and extent of cross-examination of a witness, generally rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Close, Jensen &amp; Miller </em>v. <em>Lomangino, </em>51 Conn. App. 576, 580-82, 722 A. 2d 1224, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 905, 731 A. 2d 306 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We dealt with this question of relevancy in our very recent decision in <em>Close, Jensen &amp; Miller, </em>saying that \u201c[t]o analyze the defendants\u2019 claim, we look to the allegations of the complaint. Very simply, it is a collection action. The plaintiff was required to allege and prove that it was engaged to provide services for the defendants, that the services were provided, the amount of time it took to provide the services, and the amount and reasonableness of its fees and other expenses it incurred on behalf of the defendants.\u201d Id., 583-84. Therefore, the tack taken by the defendant to question, on cross-examination, the firm\u2019s strategy is simply not relevant to the fact that services were provided and the desired result obtained. As the trial court noted, the firm\u2019s competency and the manner in which it handled the matter was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">First, the question concerning Selig, the defendant\u2019s psychiatrist, and whether he was crucial to the reinstatement of the defendant\u2019s license is not relevant to whether the firm provided legal services and should be paid its fee. Furthermore, there was evidence that Selig did not appear at the hearing or, any time before the defendant\u2019s license was reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The second question concerning the refusal by the trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>to grant an injunction to restore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the defendant\u2019s license because the defendant had not exhausted his administrative remedy, again, is not relevant to the question of services rendered and fees owed. As the trial court in this case noted, although not all efforts taken by an attorney on behalf of a client may produce the ultimate result, that is not a reason to deny the attorney his fee for reasonable efforts made. The trial court also noted that, given the defendant\u2019s objective, it, too, may have employed a variety of strategies to obtain the result desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The third question concerned whether the plaintiff ever filed a motion for stay. The question second-guesses the strategies employed by the plaintiff to achieve the defendant\u2019s goal of getting back his dental license. The question is not relevant because the issue before the trial court was not whether the plaintiff handled the matter in a competent way, but payment of the attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The last question regarding Oaken and a referral fee is also irrelevant because the plaintiff did not bill the defendant for any communication it had with Oaken and did not pay Oaken a referral fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the plaintiffs objections to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly permitted the plaintiff to put into evidence the defendant\u2019s income for the years prior and subsequent to the time that it rendered legal services. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">A portion of the plaintiffs cross-examination of the defendant is relevant to our resolution of this claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: How much do you earn a year from the practice of dentistry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Objection; relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Your Honor, I think it\u2019s directly relevant to the value of the services on an applied-contract basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: No, it\u2019s quantum meruit. It\u2019s for services rendered, not what his benefit is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: I believe that the rules specifically state that the result is one aspect of how you determine a reasonable fee, Your Honor, and I could direct the court to <em>[Khan </em>v. <em>Arrindell, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV-95-0378302 (August 13, 1997) (3 Conn. Ops. 964)] where they have a fairly good discussion of the rules of professional conduct as being appropriate in this consideration. It\u2019s at 3 Connecticut Opinions 964. I can leave this with the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: It specifically deals with fees customarily charged for similar<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> service and the results obtained, as well as the court\u2019s ability to take and exercise its own discretion in determining fees allowable because courts have a general knowledge of what is reasonable for services stated and described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: The result is that they got his license back, not\u2014it is not relevant how much money he makes once they accomplish that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: I think it\u2019s directly relevant. Without his license he could not earn any money from dentistry. I\u2019m not asking him how much he makes from another part of his livelihood, if he has related businesses or anything else, but what does he earn through that license. I think it\u2019s directly to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: I would offer this . . . . I don\u2019t have a copy. If I could have a copy made. Dr. Stuart, how much do you make a year practicing dentistry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Well, time period, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: The two years prior to your suspension in November of 1995 and the last twelve months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Relevance as to the last twelve months, Your Honor. Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll allow it. They\u2019re both relevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The defendant\u2019s income, both prior and subsequent to the suspension of his license, was relevant to the value of the services rendered, especially here where the defendant challenged, in part, the amount of time the attorneys in the firm spent working on the file. When the defendant approached Elliott, he represented to him that without his license he was losing $30,000 a month in income. The defendant\u2019s livelihood depended on the license. The amount of income the defendant received under the auspices of his license goes to his motivation in wanting his license restored expeditiously and explains why Elliott made the case a priority and directed all members of the firm to work on it. The trial court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">The defendant\u2019s third and fourth claims are interrelated. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly awarded $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees for the prosecution of the collection action, which, he claims, is clearly excessive and, further, that the trial court accepted an affidavit from trial counsel that did not include contemporaneous time records. We disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>that the fees were excessive and that the trial court improperly accepted trial counsel\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">During the trial, the court heard testimony that Elliott was familiar with the rules of professional conduct concerning the reasonableness of legal fees; see rule 1.5 (a) (4) of the Rules of Professional Conduct;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the hourly fee for his services was $50 to $60 less than the rate charged by attorneys in the area for trial work. The amount of attorney\u2019s fees charged in the collection action was $18,040.54 for the plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and $10,175 for trial counsel, who billed at the rate of $250 per hour. The total bill was $28,215.54. The trial court awarded the plaintiff $15,000, more than half of the fees requested. The defendant objects to the trial court\u2019s award of legal fees because the affidavit of the plaintiffs trial counsel claimed fees based on 40.7 hours, but itemized fees for only 24.75 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u201cTime spent is but one factor in determining the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s fee. Although the better practice is for an attorney ... to maintain time records, the failure to do so does not prelude the court from determining and awarding an attorney\u2019s fee. Indeed, as we . . . stated: Courts have a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>knowledge of what would be a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for services which are fairly stated and described. <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 680, 443 A.2d 486 (1982). [C]ourts may rely on their general knowledge of what has occurred at the proceedings before them to supply evidence in support of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. . . . The court [is] in a position to evaluate the complexity of the issues presented and the skill with which counsel had dealt with these issues. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Kirshner, </em>225 Conn. 185, 201, 621 A.2d 1326 (1993).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Gorby, </em>237 Conn. 12, 24, 675 A.2d 449 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Although the defendant asks us to consider holdings from courts in other jurisdictions, <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>801 F.2d 570 (2d Cir. 1986), <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Little, </em>118 F.R.D. 304 (D. Conn. 1988), and <em>Orshan </em>v. <em>Macchiarola, </em>629 F. Sup. 1014 (E.D.N.Y. 1986), we decline that invitation in light of the rule of the <em>Andrews </em>court. The affidavits submitted to the trial court show work done by the plaintiffs trial counsel over a period of seven months that required reviewing numerous documents, attending depositions, making telephone calls and preparing for and conducting trial. The trial court is deemed knowledgeable as to the fees charged by attorneys in the area for the nature of the work provided. Our review of the evidence before the trial court discloses that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> Rule 1.5 (a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides: \u201cA lawyer\u2019s fee shall be reasonable.

This claim was never raised before the trial court or in the defendant\u2019s brief on appeal. Parties may not raise issues for the first time during oral argument. Therefore, we will not consider the claim. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Ellington, </em>33 Conn. App. 270, 278-79 n.12, 635 A.2d 830 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
