The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial because (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>evidence was insufficient to support his convictions of rioting in a correctional institution, assault in the first degree and assault in the second degree, (2) the state improperly charged him as both a principal and an accessory to the first degree assault and the court improperly instructed the jury that he could be convicted as both, (3) the state committed prosecutorial misconduct, (4) the trial court improperly deprived him of his right to have the trier of fact decide factual issues by holding that there were dangerous instruments at or near dormitory 4B on the date of the incident, (5) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the second degree assault charge, (6) his conviction of assault in the first degree of John Bratz, another inmate, under both subdivisions (1) and (4) of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) were multiple punishments for the same offense and violated his right against double jeopardy under the United States and the Connecticut constitutions, and (7) the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a list of inmates inside dormitory 4B after the riot. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In July, 1994, the defendant was housed in building four, dormitory B (dorm 4B) of the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution in Enfield. Building four is one of six buildings considered minimum to medium security and, like all six buildings, is divided into an A side and a B side. Each side has bathrooms, a dayroom, a telephone area, windows and two entrances. Each side houses approximately eighty-five inmates. The inmates have access to an outside area where they can interact freely.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">On July 12, 1994, at approximately 5:45 p.m., two opposing groups of inmates lined up in the outside area and began attacking each other with makeshift weapons. Initially, the inmates were attacking only opposing gang members; however, the attacks spread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>to nongang members on the basis of where they were from and whether they were homosexuals. Most of the inmates wore cloth masks or T-shirts covering their faces. Correction officers in dorm 4 locked the outside doors. Shortly thereafter, inmates started to smash the windows and climb inside in search of other inmates. The officers from dorm 4 and an inmate locked themselves in a bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The defendant was outside at the start of the riot. Shortly thereafter, the defendant and others broke the windows and climbed into dorm 4B through the broken windows. The defendant was seen carrying various makeshift weapons. He was also seen pointing out to other inmates those who were either homosexual or not from Hartford. The defendant and about six other inmates were seen near Richard Mann in the back of the dorm where Mann was stabbed to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The defendant pointed out to one inmate, who was known as Hammer, another inmate, Kenneth Henton, as being from Bridgeport. Hammer hit Henton on the head with apipe and Henton was knocked unconscious. The correction officers in the bathroom heard the inmates beating up Henton. When the correction officers left the bathroom, they saw Henton lying on the floor in a pool of blood. Henton initially was placed in the medical unit at the correction facility and he was later transferred to the hospital. Henton regained consciousness in the hospital. He had four missing teeth, two stab wounds in his thumb and had been stabbed in his eye and ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The defendant and a group of inmates surrounded another inmate, John Bratz, and began attacking him. During the attack, the defendant hit Bratz with what appeared to be a metal vacuum cleaner pipe. During the attack, Bratz sustained multiple stab wounds to his arm, his teeth were knocked loose and his head was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>split open. He also had wounds to his head, shoulders and upper body. He lost a considerable amount of blood. Bratz was carried to the medical unit and lost consciousness several times due to the pain. Bratz went into shock and was admitted to a hospital where he underwent surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">During the incident, approximately 300 inmates were armed. Small fires blazed and doors and windows were damaged and broken. The approximately fifty correction officers were unarmed and outnumbered and focused their efforts on retrieving staff from the dorms until reinforcements from the state police and correctional emergency response team arrived. Order was not restored in the facility until after 11 p.m. Other facts will be discussed where relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of rioting in a correctional institution, assault in the first degree and assault in the second degree. \u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 435, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 670, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1125, 119 S. Ct. 911, 142 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\u201cAs we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>[trier of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal. . . . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

Co., </em>40 Conn.

In fact, he did not provide this court with any legal analysis of this issue. Accordingly, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The defendant next claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (4)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u00a7 53a-8<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against Bratz. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">It should be noted that, in this case, the defendant was charged with assault against Bratz as an accessory, and, therefore, the state did not need to prove that the defendant actually caused serious physical injury to Bratz. It is enough for the state to prove that the defendant, acting with the intent to cause serious injury to Bratz, solicited, requested, commanded, importuned or intentionally aided another person to cause serious physical injury to Bratz by means of a dangerous weapon. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 and 53a-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The defendant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he caused the injury to Bratz. Specifically, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>argues that there was no evidence introduced that he caused the injury to Bratz. The defendant further argues that, with regard to his culpability as an accessory, there was insufficient evidence that he intended to aid the principal and that he intended to commit the offense charged as required by the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The state introduced the following evidence. The defendant was seen carrying various makeshift weapons during the incident on July 12, 1994. The defendant was seen pointing out to other inmates those who were either homosexual or not from Hartford. He also was seen in the back of dorm 4B near Mann when Mann was stabbed to death. The defendant pointed out to an inmate known as Hammer that another inmate, Henton, was from Bridgeport, and shortly thereafter Hammer hit Henton in the head with a pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The defendant was one of a group of inmates who surrounded and attacked Bratz. Bratz was stabbed and hit with various makeshift weapons. The defendant participated in the attack by hitting Bratz with a pipe from a vacuum cleaner hose.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\u201cIt is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven. . . . The jury may draw reasonable inferences based on other inferences drawn from the evidence presented. . . . Our review is a fact based inquiry limited to determining whether the inferences drawn by the jury are so unreasonable as to be unjustifiable. . . . We note that the probative force of the evidence is not diminished because it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial evidence rather than direct evidence. ... It has been repeatedly stated that there is no legal distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence so far as probative force is concerned. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rozmyslowicz, </em>52 Conn. App. 149, 152-53, 726 A.2d 142 (1999). On the basis of the evidence and the logical inferences that could be drawn therefrom, a jury reasonably could conclude that the defendant acted with the mental state required to be convicted as an accessory to the assault against Bratz.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The defendant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he caused the injury to Bratz by means of a dangerous instrument. Specifically, the defendant argues that there was no evidence that he used a dangerous instrument because the only description provided was a \u201cvague description of a vacuum hose.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A dangerous instrument \u201cmeans any instrument, article or substance which, under the circumstances in which it is used or attempted or threatened to be used, is <em>capable of causing </em>death or serious physical injury . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (7). \u201c[A] dangerous instrument may be an ordinary object not designed to cause death or serious physical injury . . . [E]ach case must be individually examined to determine whether, under the circumstances in which the object is used or threatened to be used, it has the potential for causing serious physical injury.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>29 Conn. App. 679, 682, 617 A.2d 916 (1992), cert. denied, 225 Conn. 902, 621 A.2d 285 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The state introduced the following evidence. During the July 12,1994 incident, Bratz was stabbed under the armpit with a screwdriver. Bratz testified that he \u201cgot stabbed all through the arm,\u201d had his \u201chead split open\u201d and that the defendant hit him with an aluminum pipe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>from a vacuum cleaner hose. He also testified that he was stabbed with an ice pick. Another inmate, Maurice Washington, testified that he observed Bratz being attacked with \u201ctwo by fours, canes, scissors . . . [and] TV antennas.\u201d We note that \u201c[i]t is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven. . . .

App. 152. We conclude that it was reasonable and justifiable for the jury to conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the metal vacuum cleaner pipe, the screwdriver, the ice pick, the two by fours, the canes, the scissors, or the TV antennae were capable of causing death or serious physical injury and were, therefore, dangerous instruments.'<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The defendant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that there was \u201cserious physical injury\u201d to Bratz. Specifically, the defendant argues that without \u201cevidence through medical personnel at the medical unit of the [correctional institution], Johnson Memorial Hospital or Somers Hospital to indicate a diagnosis or prognosis of the nature, extent and/or type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>of injuries on the body of John Bratz\u201d the jury would need to resort to improper speculation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Serious physical injury \u201cmeans physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4). The state introduced the following evidence. Bratz testified to the following facts. He was stabbed under the armpit with a screwdriver and \u201cgot stabbed all through the arm\u201d and had his \u201chead split open\u201d and had his \u201cteeth knocked loose.\u201d He was hospitalized for \u201ca long, long time with this. Had to leave it open and everything else. They had to put tubes all up inside here. I went through hell.\u201d He received twenty-one stab wounds to his arm and the stab wounds went \u201cthrough the muscle and everything like that.\u201d He indicated that the defendant participated in the attack by hitting him with an aluminum pipe from a vacuum cleaner hose.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">He stated that, when he was carried out of dorm 4B, he passed out from the pain and every time they moved his body he would \u201cwake up and pass out, wake up and pass out because the pain was so bad.\u201d He testified that he \u201cgot knocked out. They said I died seven times coming off the compound . . . They hit me with the plungers. I was on Channel 3 news going up the thing with a white towel around me, but the towel was pure red with blood.\u201d He testified that he was \u201cgoing into shock\u201d and was taken by ambulance to Johnson Memorial Hospital where surgery was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">We note that \u201c[i]t is the right and the duty of the [trier of fact] to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence. ... In considering the evidence introduced in a case, [triers of fact] are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . nor are they expected to lay aside matters of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>knowledge or their own observations and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>46 Conn.

On the basis of the evidence and the logical inferences that could be drawn therefrom, a jury reasonably could conclude Bratz sustained serious physical injury. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of assault in the first degree against Bratz.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The defendant next claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 53a-8<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against Henton.

Specifically, the defendant argues that the testimony that the defendant pointed to Henton and stated, \u201cHe\u2019s from Bridgeport,\u201d in the presence of an inmate known as Hammer is not sufficient to show that the defendant ordered Hammer to assault Henton. The defendant further argues that this testimony is insufficient to prove that the defendant intended to aid the principal and that he intended to commit the offense charged as required by the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The state introduced the following evidence. The defendant was seen carrying various makeshift weapons during the incident on July 12,1994. The defendant was seen pointing out to other inmates those inmates who were either homosexual or not from Hartford. He also was seen in the back of dorm 4B near Mann when Mann was stabbed to death. The defendant was one of a group of inmates who surrounded and attacked Bratz. Bratz was stabbed and hit with various makeshift weapons including a pipe from a vacuum cleaner hose wielded by the defendant. Additionally, the defendant pointed out to Hammer that another inmate, Henton, was from Bridgeport and, shortly thereafter, Hammer hit Henton in the head with a pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">As we indic\u00e1ted, \u201c[i]t is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven. . . .

On the basis of the evidence and the logical inferences that could be drawn therefrom, a jury reasonably could conclude that the defendant acted with the mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>state required to be convicted as an accessory to the assault against Henton.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The defendant next argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that there was \u201cserious physical injury\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to Henton. Specifically, the defendant argues that without \u201cevidence through medical personnel at the medical unit of the [correctional institution] or Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center to indicate the nature, extent and/or type of injuries on the body of Kenneth Henton\u201d the jury would need to resort to improper speculation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The state introduced the following evidence. The defendant indicated to Hammer that Henton was from Bridgeport. Shortly thereafter, Hammer hit Henton in the head with a pipe and Henton saw a flash. The next thing Henton remembered was waking up in a hospital. Henton testified that he had four teeth knocked out, that his \u201ccheekbone area from around to the side of my head [was still] numb\u201d at the time of trial, that he had two stab wounds in his thumb and he \u201cgot stabbed in the eye\u201d and he \u201cgot stabbed in the ear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">On the basis of the evidence and the logical inferences that could be drawn therefrom, a jury reasonably could conclude that there was a serious physical injury to Henton. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty as an accessary to assault in the second degree against Henton.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The defendant next claims that the state improperly charged him as both a principal and an accessory to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the first degree assault against Bratz and, therefore, there was insufficient notice of the charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The defendant never raised this issue at trial and seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 232, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant has failed to show that the alleged violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be informed of the \u201cnature and cause of the charges against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>him with sufficient precision to enable him to meet them at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 381, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). The state has satisfied this constitutional mandate when its pleadings \u201cinformed the defendant of the charge [s] against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, and were definite enough to enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cIn order to establish a violation of the right to fair notice, a defendant must show not only that the information was insufficient, but also that he was in fact prejudiced in his defense on the merits and that a substantial injustice was done because of the lack of specificity in the pleadings. . . . Such a showing amounting to a deprivation of his constitutional right to adequate notice of the charges against him is not made, however, merely by establishing that the presentation of his . . . defense may be more burdensome and difficult.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. App. 777, 789, 664 A.2d 291, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 918, 665 A.2d 610 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1084, 116 S. Ct. 799, 133 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The defendant argued that the charge in the information was \u201cvague and confusing.\u201d The defendant, however, never argues that he was prejudiced or that substantial injustice was done. While the defendant cites to <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>214 Conn. 657, 674-75, 574 A.2d 164 (1990), he does not provide analysis as to how this case supports his claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mozell, </em>37 Conn. App. 574, 580-81, 657 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 910, 660 A.2d 355 (1995) (issue inadequately briefed when defendant cited two cases without analysis or attempt to analogize and failed to address factors used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>to determine whether defendant\u2019s right to speedy trial was violated). We conclude, therefore, that the defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced in his defense on the merits and that a substantial injustice was done.

The double jeopardy clause is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. . . . This constitutional guarantee prohibits not only multiple trials for the same offense, but also multiple punishments for the same offense in a single trial. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 289-90, 579 A.2d 84 (1990). [T]he role of the constitutional guarantee [against double jeopardy] is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense. . . . The issue, though essentially constitutional, becomes one of statutory construction. . . . Id., 290. Double jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>. . .

App. 1, 18-19, 717 A.2d 775, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 927, 719 A.2d 1171 (1998). In this case, although the crimes arise out of the same act, each of the offenses requires proof of a fact which the other does not. A person is guilty of assault in the first degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) when \u201c[w]ith intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person <em>... by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) A person is guilty of assault in the first degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (4) when \u201cwith intent to cause serious physicial injury to another person and <em>while aided by two or more other persons actually present, </em>he causes such injury to such person or to a third person . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We conclude that, under the test articulated in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 284 U.S. 304, the offenses of assault in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (4) are two separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. We note that \u201cthe <em>Blockburger </em>test is not a conclusive presumption of law . . . but is a rule of statutory construction, and . . . should not be controlling where, for example, there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>19 Conn. App. 245, 251, 562 A.2d 539 (1989). In this case, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>defendant did not provide this court with any legal analysis of the legislative intent that these two subdivisions should be treated as one offense for double jeopardy purposes and, therefore, failed to rebut the presumption established in <em>Blockburger </em>that he was convicted of two crimes warranting two separate punishments. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>49 Conn. App. 409, 420, 716 A.2d 897, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 904, 720 A.2d 516 (1998). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s conviction under both subdivisions (1) and (4) of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) does not violate his right against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The defendant finally claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a list of inmates inside dorm 4B after the riot. Specifically, the defendant argues that the list of inmates is hearsay and is, therefore, inadmissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\u201cOur standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the [party raising the challenge] of substantial prejudice or injustice. ... In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. . . . We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>46 Conn. App. 620, 630-31, 700 A.2d 81, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 938, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this issue. Correction Officer Timothy McIntosh testified that order was restored to the correction facility at approximately 11:15 p.m. McIntosh testified that, after order was restored, orders were given to the correctional staff to make a list of the name, identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>number and bed location of every inmate within the fence line of the correctional facility and that the list included dorm 4B. McIntosh testified that the census information was recorded at the same time it was taken and was sent over to the control center. McIntosh testified that he provided the state with a copy of the census. He further testified that the document marked for identification as exhibit 13 was a fair and accurate copy of the census document. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the exhibit arguing that there was no foundation laid as to the regular course of business. After questioning the witness, the court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and the document was admitted as a full exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 803, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). The trial court admitted the census of inmates under the business records exception to the rule against hearsay over the defendant\u2019s objection. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-180.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-180 permits hearsay evidence to be admitted if (1) [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>writing was made in the regular course of business, (2) it was the regular course of the business to make such a writing, and (3) the writing was made at the time of the transaction or occurrence or within a reasonable time thereof. <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>31 Conn. App. 660, 665, 626 A.2d 817 (1993). To qualify a document as a business record, the party offering it must present a witness who testifies that these three requirements have been met. <em>State </em>v. Lawler, 30 Conn. App. 827, 831-32, 622 A.2d 1040 (1993). The trial court has discretion to determine whether the statute is satisfied and appellate courts must construe the statute liberally when reviewing abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra [665]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>supra [832]. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A. </em>v. <em>Reckert, </em>33 Conn. App. 702, 709-10, 638 A.2d 44 (1994). . . . <em>Shadhali, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hintlian, </em>[41 Conn. App. 225, 227-28, 675 A.2d 3, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 926, 677 A.2d 948 (1996)]. [T]he essential hallmark of admissibility under \u00a7 52-180 is the trustworthiness of the document; <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>179 Conn. 349, 358-59, 426 A.2d 305 (1979) .... <em>Jefferson Garden Associates </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>202 Conn. 128, 141, 520 A.2d 173 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Berkeley Federal Bank &amp; Trust, FSB </em>v. <em>Ogalin, </em>48 Conn. App. 205, 208-209, 708 A.2d 620, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 933, 711 A.2d 726 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We conclude that McIntosh\u2019s testimony satisfied all three requirements of the business record exception to the rule against hearsay. McIntosh testified that the officers are trained to take a census of the inmates present in the dormitories after riots have ended. He testified that it is the regular course of the institution to take such a census and that the census was taken in the regular course of institution business. He further testified that the list of inmate names was transcribed contemporaneously with the census and that the list was reported to the control center. He further testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>that the document marked as exhibit thirteen was a fair and accurate copy of the original census list.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he witness was not sure of who took the census and was not present during the census, therefore there [were] no guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness essential to other evidence admitted under the traditional hearsay exception.\u201d Section 52-180, however, \u201cexpressly provides that the proponent of the business record need not produce that person who made the record or show that the person is unavailable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 160, 570 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1990). McIntosh believed that the census was taken by Officer James Hensley. McIntosh\u2019s testimony indicates that the purpose of the census was to determine the whereabouts of the inmates and that the correctional facility relied on the census for that purpose. We conclude, therefore, that the document was sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted under \u00a7 52-180. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the census into evidence pursuant to the business records exception to the rule against hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-179b (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of rioting at a correctional institution when he incites, instigates, organizes, connives at, causes, aids, abets, assists or takes part in any disorder, disturbance, strike, riot or other organized disobedience to the rules and regulations of such institution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument ... or (4) with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person and while aided by two or more other persons actually present, he causes such injury to such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a) provides: \u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> As we noted previously, because the defendant was charged as an accessory to the assault in the first degree against Bratz, the state was required to prove only that the defendant, acting with the intent to cause serious injury to Bratz, solicited, requested, commanded, importuned or intentionally aided <em>another person to cause serious physical injury to Bratz by means of a dangerous \u2018weapon. </em>In fact, it was not necessary for the state to prove that the defendant used a dangerous weapon as long as one of the other participants caused serious physical injury to Bratz by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b615-12\"> See footnote 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\"> For the definition of \"serious physical injury,\u201d see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4), as discussed in part I B 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he state charged count three in a mixture of theories that was, at least, vague and confusing.\u201d We note, ironically, that the defendant\u2019s argument on this issue is based on a hodgepodge of theories including that the instruction was confusing, the evidence is insufficient, the charge was vague and confusing, the charge went well beyond the scope of liability permitted by statute and there is insufficient notice of the charges. The defendant\u2019s argument was vague and confusing and only the insufficient notice of the charges claim cites to any case law.
