Shiffrin, the commissioner of consumer protection (commissioner), served an investigative demand on the defendant I.V. Services of America, Inc., pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOd (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from an order of the trial court denying its motion for a protective order in response to the investigative demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied its motion for a protective order because it (1) did not apply properly the pharmacist-customer privilege of General Statutes \u00a7 20-626, (2) failed to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the privacy rights of AIDS and HIV positive patients as required by General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583 and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>236 Conn. 845, 675 A.2d 835 (1996), and (3) violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the order of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">On August 28, 1996, the commissioner, pursuant to \u00a7 42-1 lOd (c), served an investigative demand on the defendant, a pharmacy in the state of Connecticut. The demand was issued in connection with an investigation into allegations that the defendant had violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110aet. seq., by billing consumers for medical equipment and services after representing to them that their insurance companies would be billed and by unfairly and deceptively inflating prices on prescription medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The demand required, inter aha, that the defendant produce the identity of its customers and the billing records of customers from whom the defendant had attempted to collect money. The defendant answered some of the commissioner\u2019s interrogatories, but refused to answer interrogatories seven and eight and document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>request two.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner subsequently filed a motion for an order requiring compliance. The defendant then filed a motion for a protective order. The trial court heard oral argument on the motions and allowed the parties to submit supplemental briefs. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and issued the following order: \u201cI.V. Services of America, Inc., shall comply with and provide answers to Interrogatories 7 and 8 of the Civil Investigative Demand issued by [the commissioner] . . . pursuant to the confidentiality agreement drafted by [the commissioner] and appended to its second supplemental memorandum dated March 17, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201cHowever, should any documents [the defendant] is required to disclose pursuant to Request for Production Number 2 contain specific references to a person\u2019s physical or mental condition, such references may be redacted prior to such documents being produced.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The defendant first claims that it was not required to disclose the information requested in the civil investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>gative demand because (1) it was privileged information under General Statutes \u00a7 20-626 (a) and (2) the commissioner was not entitled to the information under the exceptions found in \u00a7 20-626 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The defendant claims first that \u00a7 20-626 (a), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o pharmacist . . . shall reveal any records or information,\u201d bars the commissioner from obtaining the information requested under the demand. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We first note that there is no general pharmacist-customer privilege recognized in Connecticut. The only privilege is that provided for by \u00a7 20-626 (a), which is limited to \u201crecords or information concerning the <em>nature of pharmaceutical services rendered </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Determining whether the requested information falls within the protections of a statute is a matter of statutory construction, which presents a question of law requiring plenary review. <em>Lopiano </em>v. Lopiano, 247 Conn. 356, 363, 752 A.2d 1000 (1998). \u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that when the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous they should be given full effect. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. Jones, 51 Conn. App. 126, 137, 721 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>A.2d 903 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 958, 723 A.2d 814 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The plain language of \u00a7 20-626 reveals that the legislature intended to protect information concerning the nature of a customer\u2019s treatment, i.e., what symptoms certain drugs were meant to combat, what drugs were prescribed, how often drugs were prescribed and by which physician. There is no indication from the unambiguous language that the billing practices of the defendant fall within the penumbra of the phrase \u201cthe nature of pharmaceutical services rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The commissioner clearly sought to avoid infringing on any customers\u2019 confidentiality. Rather, the commissioner sought only the information relating to the defendant\u2019s alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices. Furthermore, the trial court allowed the defendant to redact any information that might disclose a customer\u2019s physical or mental condition. We are not persuaded that the information sought in the investigative demand is protected under \u00a7 20-626.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Even if we assume that the information requested was protected by \u00a7 20-626 (a), the defendant claims that the commissioner is not entitled to the information requested in the demand pursuant to the exceptions in \u00a7 20-626 (b). The defendant claims that (1) \u00a7 20-626 (b) is permissive and not mandatory and (2) the commissioner is not entitled to the requested discovery because the commissioner is not a \u201cgovernmental agency with statutory authority to review or obtain such information\u201d under \u00a7 20-626 (b) (5) and the commissioner\u2019s civil investigative demand is not equivalent to a subpoena. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The defendant claims that, because \u00a7 20-626 (b) provides that \u201ca pharmacist or pharmacy <em>may </em>provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>pharmacy records or information\u201d (emphasis added), it is not required to comply with the commissioner\u2019s investigative demand. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">This issue also involves statutory construction warranting plenary review. <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Lopiano, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 363. \u201c[Our Supreme Court has] consistently held that \u2018may\u2019 is directory rather than mandatory. . . . The word \u2018may,\u2019 unless the context in which it is employed requires otherwise, ordinarily does not connote a command. Rather, the word generally imports permissive conduct and the conferral of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 349, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996). While the legislature used both \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d in the same section, connoting that it was aware of the different meanings given the two words, the defendant\u2019s interpretation cannot be adopted. The defendant\u2019s argument fails to consider that \u00a7 20-626 (b) (6) permits a pharmacy to disclose information when such information is sought pursuant to a subpoena. \u201cA subpoena is a method for compelling the attendance of a witness [or documents] . . . .\u201d <em>Commissioner of Welfare </em>v. <em>Rynecki, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 560, 565, 426 A.2d 1329 (1980). When refusing to answer a subpoena, a witness or party can be subjected to judicial sanctions. It is unlikely that the legislature would have used the terms may and subpoena in \u00a7 20-626 (b) to give a party faced with a subpoena the option of not answering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The legislature\u2019s enactment of subsection (b) shows that it never intended the privilege of subsection (a) to be absolute. Subsection (b) clearly shows that the legislature envisioned situations where the disclosure of pharmaceutical information would be permitted. The propose of the word may appears to be to protect a pharmacy from civil liability when it does disclose confidential information in those excepted circumstances of \u00a7 20-626 (b). We cannot accept the defendant\u2019s view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>that, because the legislature used the word shall in subsection (a) to mandate nondisclosure of certain information and the word may in subsection (b) to allow disclosure in certain limited situations, the defendant need not disclose in those situations if it feels so inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The defendant claims next that the commissioner of consumer protection is not a \u201cgovernmental agency with statutory authority to review or obtain such information\u201d under \u00a7 20-626 (b) (5). The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Section 42-1 lOd provides the authority for the commissioner to review the defendant\u2019s records if the commissioner suspects that the defendant is utilizing an unfair or deceptive trade practice. At oral argument, the defendant attempted to distinguish the commissioner from the commission of pharmacy. The defendant\u2019s claim that the commissioner of consumer protection is not responsible for the regulation of pharmacies lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Our review of chapter 400j of the General Statutes, the pharmacy statutes, clearly shows that the legislature intended both agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical industry in this state. In fact, \u201c[t]he Commissioner of Consumer Protection shall exercise general supervision over the operations of the Commission of Pharmacy pursuant to sections 20-570 to 20-625, inclusive.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-574. The commissioner has the statutory authority to review the defendant\u2019s billing records.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The defendant next claims that the commissioner\u2019s issuance of a civil investigative demand is not equivalent to the issuance of a subpoena under \u00a7 20-626 (b) (6). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The defendant\u2019s position is contrary to the statutory language of CUTPA. \u201cIt is the intention of the legislature that this chapter be remedial and be so construed.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (d). \u201c[B]ecause CUTPA is a self-avowed \u2018remedial\u2019 measure ... it is construed liberally in an effort to effectuate its public policy goals.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Associated Investment Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Williams Associates IV, </em>230 Conn. 148, 158, 645 A.2d 505 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 42-110k uses the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d when discussing subpoenas and investigative demands and the commissioner\u2019s enforcement powers. The use of \u201cor\u201d by the legislature clearly indicates that the commissioner has a choice of discovery tools available to him. Because CUTPA must be given a liberal interpretation, the fact that the commissioner issues an investigative demand instead of a subpoena cannot be held against him. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly held that the investigative demand was adequate under \u00a7 20-626 (b) (6). Therefore, assuming that the information requested by the commissioner is protected by \u00a7 20-626, we conclude that the commissioner has the right to review the defendant\u2019s billing records under either subdivision (5) or (6) of \u00a7 20-626 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The defendant next claims that the privacy rights accorded to patients, specifically those who are HIV positive and those who have AIDS, would be violated by disclosing the information requested in the investigative demand. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 19a-583 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person who obtains confidential HIV-related information may disclose or be compelled to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>such information . . . .\u201d Our Supreme Court thoroughly discussed the policy behind the AIDS nondisclosure statute in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u201cThe AIDS statute was designed and intended to combat the AIDS epidemic, beginning with protecting confidentiality. ... As one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, Representative Benjamin N. DeZinno, Jr., explained, the bill was intended to \u2018protect the confidentiality of data related to AIDS . . . .\u2019He explained that in order to \u2018wipe out or hope to wipe [out] this horrible epidemic disease in our lifetime . . . [w]e have to start with protecting the confidentiality . . . [b]ecause people will not step forward for testing and treatment of AIDS unless they know that a positive result will not become public information. I think that\u2019s very important. Now, unfortunately, there is widespread discrimination against the AIDS victim, and many people would rather [forgo] treatment, than risk being stigmatized.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 852. \u201c[T]he drafters of this legislation \u2018crafted the bill very carefully to give protection while also enabling those who care for people with AIDS and HIV infection to have access to information needed for the patient\u2019s care.\u2019 Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Health, Pt. 3, 1989 Sess., p. 767.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u201cThe legislature\u2019s concern for discrimination against people with AIDS is well founded. In a 1993 poll, 35.7 percent of the respondents said they were \u2018afraid\u2019 of people with AIDS, 27.7 percent were \u2018disgusted\u2019 and 27.1 percent were \u2018angry.\u2019 . . . More than one in five Americans . . . would avoid an office job if they had to work with a man with AIDS, and nearly one half . . . would avoid a neighborhood grocery store if the owner had AIDS.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 858 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The defendant claims that, because certain drugs are connected with the treatment of conditions that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>secondary to AIDS, disclosure of the billing information would violate the statute. The trial court order addressed just that concern by allowing the defendant to redact certain information: \u201c[S]hould any documents [the defendant] is required to disclose pursuant to Request for Production Number 2 contain specific references to a person\u2019s physical or mental condition, such references may be redacted prior to such documents being produced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We are cognizant of the legislature\u2019s concerns and are sensitive to the social ills that fall upon AIDS and HIV positive patients. Because the trial court\u2019s order allowed for redaction, our decision affirming that order will not broaden the scope of nonconfidential information. Nor will this conclusion cause the purpose of \u00a7 19a-583 to be eroded by case law. The trial court\u2019s order adequately protects the confidentiality rights of AIDS and HIV positive patients under \u00a7 19a-583.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that its due process rights under the state and federal constitutions were violated because the commissioner lacked probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>cause to issue the civil investigative demand. Because the defendant did not provide an adequate record we decline to review this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u201cIt is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review as provided in Section 61-10.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We have frequently declined to review cases where an adequate record for review is lacking. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 609, 710 A.2d 190 (1998). \u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the defendant\u2019s claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 608-609.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In the present case, while both parties briefed the issue of whether the commissioner was required to have probable cause to issue the investigative demand, the issue was not addressed in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision. The defendant failed to file a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. Because we have not been provided with the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue, we cannot reach the issue of whether the defendant was denied its right to due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The order of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOd provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) For the purposes of this chapter the commissioner shall have the power to order an investigation and examination to be made. In addition to other powers conferred upon the commissioner by this chapter, the commissioner or his authorized representatives may issue subpoenas to any person involved in any matter under investigation and examination, administer an oath or affirmation to any person, and conduct hearings in aid of any investigation or examination, provided none of the powers conferred by this chapter shall be used for the purpose of compelling any natural person to furnish testimony or evidence which might tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u201c(b) Said commissioner or his authorized representatives shall have the right to . . . (4) subpoena documentary material relating to such investigation; and (5) have access to, for the purpose of examination, documentary material and the right to copy such documentary material of any person being investigated or proceeded against. The commissioner or his authorized representatives shall have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary material relating to any matter under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u201c(c) In addition to other powers conferred upon the commissioner, said commissioner may execute in writing and cause to be served by certified mail an investigative demand upon any person suspected of using, having used or about to use any method, act or practice declared by section 42-110b to be unlawful or upon any person from whom said commissioner wants assurance that section 42-110b has not, is not or will not be violated. Such investigative demand shall contain a description of the method, act or practice under investigation, provide a reasonable time for compliance, and require such person to furnish under oath or otherwise, as may be specified in said demand, a report, in writing setting forth relevant facts or circumstances together with documentary material. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> The defendant argues in its brief that the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for protective order is a final judgment from which it can properly appeal. The commissioner does not contest that there is a final judgment. \u201cAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). We conclude that the order requiring the defendant to comply with the agency\u2019s demand terminated an independent proceeding to obtain information and, therefore, is an appealable final judgment. See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Cuomo, </em>230 Conn. 1, 644 A.2d 333 (1994); see also <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 461 A.2d 938 (1983) (Supreme Court reviewed commissioner\u2019s appeal taken from trial court\u2019s dismissal of petition requiring defendant to comply with investigative demand pursuant to \u00a7 42-110d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> Interrogatory seven states: \u201cFor the period January 1, 1990 through the date of your response to the interrogatory, provide a listing of names and addresses of all customers to whom you have sold any products or services.

If a patient or a patient\u2019s agent gives oral consent to release records or information, the pharmacist shall promptly record, in writing or in electronic data base form, the oral consent by listing the patient\u2019s name, the name of the patient\u2019s agent, if applicable, the date and the nature of the records or information released.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\u201c(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a pharmacist or pharmacy may provide pharmacy records or information to the following . . .

Because General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) requires the commissioner to make available its public documents to those who want to examine them, the defendant claims that there is no way for the commissioner to guarantee the customers\u2019 privacy. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 1-19 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in [section] . . . 1-19 . . . shall be construed to require disclosure of ... (2) personnel or medical files <em>and similar files </em>the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we have noted, the trial court appropriately allowed the defendant to redact any information regarding a customer\u2019s physical or mental condition. Given the trial court\u2019s redaction order, it is clear that any information that the defendant possesses pertaining to one of its customers\u2019 physical or mental condition is not discoverable under \u00a7\u00a7 42-110d (f) or 1-19 (b) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\"> We note, however, that \u00a7 42-1 lOd does not require the commissioner to have probable cause to believe that a party is engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices. The statutory language is clear and unambiguous. The commissioner may issue an investigative demand on \u201cany person suspected of using, having used or about to use any method, act or practice declared by section 42-110b to be unlawful . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-llOd (c). \u201cIf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words actually used because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hutchinson </em>v. Andover, 49 Conn. App. 781, 785, 715 A.2d 831 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">The legislature has used the phrase \u201cprobable cause\u201d in many different statutes. The legislature, therefore, is presumed to be aware of its meaning. Because the legislature did not use \u201cprobable cause\u201d and, instead, chose \u201csuspected,\u201d it is apparent that the legislature did not intend to require the commissioner to have probable cause before issuing a civil investigative demand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
