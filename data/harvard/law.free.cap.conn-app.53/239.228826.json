See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>38 Conn. App. 99, 100, 659 A.2d 195, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 100 (1995); see also <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s petition was predicated on a factual review of the petitioner\u2019s claim and a determination that the petitioner failed to rebut the strong presumption that \u201ccounsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance . . . .\u201d <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 193, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The habeas court found that the petitioner failed to produce evidence to support his claim that trial counsel failed to investigate the case properly prior to trial. The habeas court found that there was \u201cno evidence to support [the petitioner\u2019s] claim that [trial counsel] was inadequately prepared or that the conduct was inadequate.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record clearly supports the trial court\u2019s conclusions as to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">We conclude that the habeas court had before it sufficient evidence to find as it did and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> The trial court did not address the petitioner\u2019s claim that counsel was burdened by a conflict of interest, and the petitioner did not request an articulation. Because the record is inadequate, we decline to review this claim. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
