On appeal, the petitioner claims that the second habeas court improperly (1) denied his petition for certification to appeal and (2) denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We affirm the judgment of the second habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">The second habeas court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record disclose the following facts and procedural history. The petitioner was arrested in a Bridgeport drug sweep with five other individuals on September 6, 1990, for possession of marijuana and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>cocaine in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner, as well as two other individuals, David Rochester and Verly Gordon, also arrested in the sweep, hired attorney William Browne to represent them. After the petitioner\u2019s trial began, the petitioner changed his plea to guilty when the state investigated his alibi defense and discovered that it was fabricated. On September 3, 1991, the petitioner was sentenced to twelve years in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied Browne\u2019s petition for a new trial. In a direct appeal brought by attorney Earl Williams, this court affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction. See <em>State </em>v. Whyte, 31 Conn. App. 904, 623 A.2d 1074 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On November 30, 1994, the petitioner filed a revised amended petition (first petition) for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming, inter alia, that his confinement was unlawful because Browne had rendered ineffective assistance at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. The first habeas court, <em>Sferrazza, J., </em>denied the first petition by way of a decision dated July 24, 1995. The petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>then appealed from the decision of the first habeas court, and this court dismissed his appeal in a per curiam decision. <em>Whyte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>44 Conn. App. 815, 690 A.2d 1391 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On January 13, 1997, the petitioner filed a revised amended second petition (second petition) for a writ of habeas coipus that alleged that his confinement was illegal because he had been denied effective assistance of counsel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at his criminal trial because, inter alia, Browne had represented the petitioner and the two codefendants, Gordon and Rochester, in the same criminal matter at the same time, and also because he had been denied effective assistance of counsel in his first habeas petition by attorney Ronald K. Bellenot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a trial on the petitioner\u2019s claims was held on February 18 and 25, 1997, the second habeas court, <em>Grogins, J., </em>denied the petitioner\u2019s second petition by its July 7, 1997 memorandum of decision. The second habeas court found that the petitioner had failed to produce evidence of an actual conflict of interest as to his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and also as to his claim of ineffective assistance of his first habeas counsel. On July 11,1997, the court, <em>Grogins, J., </em>denied the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, giving rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The petitioner claims that the second habeas court improperly denied his petition for certification to appeal. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the second habeas court abused its discretion in denying certification because the petitioner presented issues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner and that the issues warrant further consideration. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201c \u2018Faced with a habeas court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification to appeal, a petitioner can obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus only by satisfying the two-pronged test enunciated by our Supreme Court in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 640 A.2d 601 (1994), and adopted in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). First, he must demonstrate that the denial of his petition for certification constituted an abuse of discretion. Id. Second, if the petitioner can show an abuse of discretion, he must then prove that the decision of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits. Id.\u2019 \u201d <em>Petaway </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>49 Conn. App. 75, 77, 712 A.2d 992 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . <em>[Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 616], quoting <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, 498 </em>U.S. 430, 432, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991). . . . <em>Tatem </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>39 Conn. App. 813, 816, 667 A.2d 1295 (1995), cert. denied, 236 Conn. 904, 670 A.2d 1305 (1996) .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reddick </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>51 Conn. App. 474, 477, 722 A.2d 286 (1999). In addition, we have stated that \u201c[a]s our courts have applied <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>498 U.S. 430,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the mere allegation of a violation of a constitutional right is insufficient to meet the initial hurdle of proving an abuse of discretion when the habeas corpus court has denied certification to appeal.\u201d <em>Petaway </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Initially, we observe that the second habeas court reviewed at some length what occurred in the first habeas trial before Judge Sferrazza. Judge Sferrazza held that the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea at trial waived any ineffective assistance claim as to Browne\u2019s representation during preparation for or during the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and this was agreed to by both counsel at the first habeas trial. The second habeas court, therefore, properly did not address those issues. It also pointed out that the first habeas court had analyzed the petitioner\u2019s claim that Browne had provided ineffective assistance with reference to the petitioner\u2019s decision to change his plea to guilty. In doing so, the first habeas court found that the petitioner had failed to prove the prejudice component of the two-pronged <em>Strickland</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test as interpreted by our Supreme Court. See <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 151, 662 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>A.2d 718 (1995). The first habeas court also rejected the petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim made against Browne with reference to his failure to object to the state\u2019s recommendation for the maximum prison sentence, specifically finding that the petitioner had not sustained his burden of proving that but for Browne\u2019s allegedly substandard performance there was a reasonable probability that he would have received a lighter sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s appeal. <em>Whyte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 815.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In the second habeas proceeding, the respondent, invoking Practice Book \u00a7 529H (3), now \u00a7 23-29 (3), argued that the court should dismiss the allegations of the petition made against Browne. Section 23-29 provides in relevant part that the court may, either upon motion or sua sponte, \u201cdismiss the petition, or any count thereof, if it determines that... (3) the petition presents the same ground as a prior petition previously denied and fails to state new facts or proffer new evidence not reasonably available at the time of the prior petition . . . .\u201d The trial court not only acknowledged the necessity of deciding the applicability of this rule, but also cited a number of cases to underline its comment that \u201cthere may be some question as to whether conflict of interest is the same ground as ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this context, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>quoted <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>180 Conn. 153, 165, 429 A.2d 841 (1980), where our Supreme Court followed the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1963). The <em>Sanders </em>court stated: \u201cShould doubts arise in particular cases as to whether two grounds [of successive habeas corpus petitions] are different or the same, they should be resolved in favor of the applicant.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 16; <em>Tirado </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>24 Conn. App. 152, 158, 586 A.2d 625 (1991). Furthermore, as the second habeas court recognized, a \u201csecond habeas petition [can be] inextricably interwoven with the merits of the original judgment by challenging the very fabric of the conviction that led to the confinement.\u201d <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 834, 843, 613 A.2d 818 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The second habeas court addressed the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the first count of the petition directed to Browne\u2019s ineffective assistance, which was intermixed with his conflict of interest claim against Browne. We conclude that the second habeas court properly resolved the motion to dismiss against the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has established the proof requirements where a habeas corpus petitioner claims ineffective assistance of counsel because of a claimed conflict of interest. Where, however, the defendant claims that his counsel was burdened by an actual conflict of interest . . . the defendant need not establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>actual prejudice. . . . Where there is an actual conflict of interest, prejudice is presumed because counsel [has] breachfed] the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties. Moreover, it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests. ... In a case of a claimed conflict of interest, therefore, in order to establish a violation of the sixth amendment the defendant has a two-pronged task. He must establish (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. . . . <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 132-33, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\u201cOn appellate review, the historical facts found by the habeas court may not be disturbed unless they were clearly erroneous .... Id., 131. When, as in this case, those facts are essential to a determination of whether the petitioner\u2019s sixth amendment rights have been violated, we are presented with a mixed question of law and fact requiring plenary review. See id.; <em>Mclver </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>28 Conn. App. 195, 203, 612 A.2d 103, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 906, 615 A.2d 1048 (1992). . . . <em>Blakeney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>47 Conn. App. 568, 583-84, 706 A.2d 989, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 913, 713 A.2d 830 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>51 Conn. App. 638, 643-44, 724 A.2d 1130, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 907, 731 A.2d 309 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u201cBecause there are often many potential conflicts between private counsel in multi-defendant trials, \u2018[i]n order to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment, a defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u2019 <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1980). An actual conflict of interest occurs if \u2018the defendants\u2019 interests diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action such that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the attorney finds himself in the untenable position of serving two clients with incompatible needs.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pungitore, </em>910 F.2d [1084, 1141 (3d Cir. 1990) (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gambino, </em>864 F.2d 1064, 1070 (3d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 906, 109 S. Ct. 3215, 106 L. Ed. 2d 566 (1989)) [cert. denied sub nom. <em>Scarfo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>500 U.S. 915, 111 S. Ct. 2009, 114 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1991)].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pungitore, </em>965 F. Sup. 666, 679 (E.D. Pa. 1997).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In the present matter, the petitioner alleges that he was \u201centitled to the \u2018undivided loyalty\u2019 of the attorney, particularly in that the attorney must be able to exercise independent professional judgment on behalf of the client.\u201d The petitioner properly argues that \u201cConnecticut has recognized this principle in noting that a client is entitled to the \u2018undivided loyalty of the one upon whom he looks as his advocate and his champion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>161 Conn. 337, 345-46 [288 A.2d 58 (1971), aff'd, 406 U.S. 250, 92 S. Ct. 1551, 32 L. Ed. 2d 45] (1972). In the petitioner\u2019s brief, he apparently argues that because trial counsel failed to withdraw from representing the petitioner because of the multiple representation, trial counsel breached the duty of loyalty and independent professional judgment to which the petitioner was entitled.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, the petitioner argues that the habeas court improperly denied him the opportunity to put on testimony from the codefendants on the issue of the original trial counsel\u2019s multiple representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The record reveals, however, that the petitioner knew that the two codefendants were also represented by Browne and that he did not request counsel to withdraw from representation in view of the multiple representation. Furthermore, the record reveals that contrary to what the petitioner represented to the second habeas court, his plea of guilty did not result in the codefen-dants\u2019 receiving lesser sentences.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The record does not reveal the contents of the petitioner\u2019s presentence investigation report or whether the codefendants initially presented false alibi defenses as the petitioner did.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The question addressed by the second habeas court, and the issue this court finds dispositive, is whether an actual conflict of interest existed. The petitioner represented to the second habeas court that his code-fendants were prepared to testify that the petitioner was not involved in the drug operation. The petitioner admitted on cross-examination that neither codefen-dant had implicated him in his statement to the police or in his testimony. The petitioner also argued to the court that Gordon testified for the sole purpose of rebutting Bellenot\u2019s testimony. In doing so, the petitioner argued that if the matter went to trial, both codefen-dants would testify on the petitioner\u2019s behalf as alibi witnesses. Even if this court was inclined to accept the petitioner\u2019s claims as to what the codefendants would testify if the case went to trial, the petitioner cannot show that Browne represented conflicting interests between the three defendants or adduced evidence or advanced arguments on behalf of either of the two codefendants that injured the petitioner\u2019s interests. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Since both codefendants would testify, according to the petitioner, that the petitioner was with them and not involved with the ongoing drug operation, none of the defendants nor their attorney was in a situation where he would have had to choose between self-incrimination and testifying in favor of a codefendants\u2019 innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We have had occasion to \u201cpoint out the caution from the United States Supreme Court that the <em>possibility </em>of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction. In order to demonstrate a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, a defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. . . . <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>[supra, 446 U.S. 350]. To demonstrate an actual conflict of interest, the petitioner must be able to point to <em>specific instances </em>in the record which suggest an impairment or compromise of his interests for the benefit of another party. . . . <em>Danner v. United States, </em>820 F.2d 1166, 1169 (11th Cir. 1987), cert. 484 U.S. 1012, 108 S. Ct. 713, 98 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1988). <em>Blakeney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 584-85.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 51 Conn. App. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The petitioner has not demonstrated an abuse of discretion on his claimed sixth amendment violation predicated on an actual conflict of interest. As we have pointed out, the second habeas court, fol 1 o wing <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 165-66, accorded the petitioner the benefit of the doubt and analyzed his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the context of the alleged actual conflict of interest argument of the petitioner. The petitioner has not demonstrated that an actual conflict of interest constitutionally impaired him so as to persuade us that the second habeas court improperly resolved this claim. Browne not only did not represent conflicting interests, but there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>showing of an actual conflict of interest adversely affecting Browne\u2019s performance. See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 133. The mere allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel because of multiple representation is not sufficient to establish an abuse of discretion where, as here, the petitioner must show actual conflict. There is a significant distinction between alleging and proving an abuse of discretion. \u201cAs our courts have applied <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 430, the mere allegation of a violation of a constitutional right is insufficient to meet the initial hurdle of proving an abuse of discretion when the habeas court has denied certification to appeal.\u201d <em>Petaway </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-7\"> Rochester and Gordon also pleaded guilty while represented by Browne. The transcript from the petitioner\u2019s trial and sentencing was an exhibit at his first habeas trial.

While its close examination of these two issues does not alter our analysis, it does allow us fairly to decide the petitioner\u2019s appeal as to the propriety of the second habeas court\u2019s denial of certification and, specifically, as to abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> Our Supreme Court has defined conflict of interest as when \u201cone defendant stands to gain significantly by counsel adducing probative evidence in or advancing plausible arguments that are damaging to the cause of a codefendant whom counsel is also representing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Festo </em>v. <em>Luckart, </em>191 Conn. 622, 631, 469 A.2d 1181 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> The petitioner\u2019s brief stated: \u201cIn the case at hand trial counsel\u2019s withdrawal from representing the petitioner/appellant breached the duty of loyalty and independent decision making that the petitioner was entitled to have in his representation.\u201d We note, however, that trial counsel did not withdraw from representing the petitioner and that the petitioner most likely meant to refer to trial counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to withdraw.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> The petitioner contends in his brief that \u201chis codefendants received better plea bargains <em>subsequent </em>to his having pleaded guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The petitioner erroneously claims that by his pleading guilty first as directed by trial counsel there was a conflicting interest as to the codefendants because trial counsel could use that guilty plea in the codefendants\u2019 favor. The petitioner, however, was not the first to enter a guilty plea. See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
