She also claims that the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy was violated when she was separately sentenced for the offenses of promoting prostitution of a minor and risk of injury to a child. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Before her twelfth birthday, the defendant\u2019s daughter, M, lived with the defendant and the defendant\u2019s boyfriend in Meriden. In 1992 and 1993, when M was ten and eleven years of age, Richard Tomczuk, a friend of the defendant, would visit almost daily. Sometimes when M was with Tomczuk and the defendant in Tomczuk\u2019s car, she observed the defendant performing fellatio on Tomczuk in exchange for $20. M also saw Tomczuk touch the defendant\u2019s vaginal area and breasts on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">During this same time period, another man, Dominic Tortorella, came to the defendant\u2019s house frequently and had sexual relations with the defendant. When leaving, Tortorella would ask M for a kiss. The defendant would urge M to kiss Tortorella, saying that she needed the money and that she would beat M if she refused. Reluctantly, M would allow Tortorella to kiss her. Tort-orella would put his tongue in M\u2019s mouth, causing M to want to vomit. Tortorella would then pay the defendant. This happened on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">During this same time period, the defendant would send M out to ask people for money to buy cigarettes. She would also tell M to \u201cgo out there and sell your body,\u201d saying it was \u201ceasy.\u201d Sometimes M would be awakened in the night and sent out. M did not want to go, but complied. While out, M would prostitute herself with men. M gave all the money she received straight to the defendant. If M failed to comply with the defendant\u2019s demands, the defendant would beat M, slapping and kicking her. This happened quite often. The defendant once blackened M\u2019s eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">At the time of trial, M was fourteen years of age, diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and in a wheelchair. Additional facts are set forth as they become relevant in our analysis of the defendant\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The defendant first claims that she was denied her right to a fair trial because the prosecution presented unsubstantiated testimony concerning her prior drug use. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">During the direct examination of M, when asked about the defendant\u2019s performing oral sex on Tomczuk, M stated that the defendant was paid afterwards. The state then asked M what the money was used for, and M replied, \u201cfor drugs.\u201d The defendant objected to the question as leading and asked that the answer be stricken. The trial court overruled the objection. The state then asked if M knew what kinds of drugs, and M replied, \u201cheroin or cocaine.\u201d The trial court disallowed further questions on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Later, in response to questions about the defendant\u2019s sexual relations with men, M stated that such relations occurred while the defendant\u2019s boyfriend was in the apartment, and that he knew all the men. When the state asked if \u201cthey all [did] drugs together, too,\u201d M answered that they did. The defendant objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. The defendant did not move to strike the answer and the state did not pursue the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Thereafter, during M\u2019s cross-examination, when M was asked about going out to perform acts of prostitution for money, defense counsel asked what would she do with the money. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">\u201cA. Give it back to, give it to my mom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">\u201cQ. You give it to your mom and she wants to buy some cigarettes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-12\">\u201cA. No, she wanted to buy drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-13\">\u201cQ. To buy drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">To all other questions asked of M that referenced the defendant\u2019s drug use, objections were sustained and no answers were given. In instances where M mentioned drugs in a nonresponsive manner to a question, the trial court struck the answers and cautioned the jury to \u201cplease disregard [them].\u201d Although the state argued that drugs provided a motive for the defendant\u2019s behavior, the trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objections and ordered stricken any testimony by other state\u2019s witnesses who mentioned the defendant\u2019s drug use, none of which were in direct response to a question by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In response to a reference by another witness to the defendant\u2019s drug use, the trial court advised the jury to \u201cdisregard the response\u201d and that it was \u201cnot part of this case.\u201d The state did not mention the defendant\u2019s drug use in its closing argument. During its charge to the jury, the trial court reminded the jurors that it had told them several times to disregard answers and that they should not consider stricken testimony. We presume that the trial court\u2019s instructions are followed. <em>State v. Reddick, </em>224 Conn. 445, 454, 619 A.2d 453 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The defendant argues, however, that the questions asked by the state, which were not answered, as well as the answers given by the various witnesses that were stricken, show the state\u2019s attempt to inject extraneous and highly prejudicial matters into the case. The defendant claims that such an attempt by the prosecutor to \u201celicit testimony as to [the] defendant\u2019s drug use in the presence of the jury\u201d implicates her constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The state argues, and the defendant concedes, that the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct was unpreserved. The defendant seeks review under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plain error review \u201c \u2018is reserved for those truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 241, 710 A.2d 732 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">It is axiomatic that questions are not evidence. We are also aware that answers that are stricken are to be disregarded by the jury and are also not considered as evidence. Nevertheless, we note that the record is clear that the jury did have before it testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s drug use given in response to questions by the state as well as by the defendant. Those references to the defendant\u2019s drug use were not so inherently prejudicial, however, that they deprived the defendant of a fair trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant further failed to show that, if evidence of drug use was improperly admitted, it more likely than not affected the verdict'.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Additionally, we must reject the defendant\u2019s specific claim of prosecutorial misconduct as well. \u201cIt is well settled . . . that a defendant may not prevail under . . . the plain error doctrine unless the prosecutorial impropriety was so pervasive or egregious as to constitute an infringement of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 564, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998). The defendant has failed to prove that, in the context of the trial as a whole, the state engaged in a pattern of repeated and blatantly egregious misconduct so pervasive that it denied her a fair trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>and due process. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 246, 645 A.2d 999 (1994). Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that she was denied a fair trial by the state\u2019s purported presentation of testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s prior drug use. The defendant\u2019s claim is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The defendant next claims that the constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy preclude separate sentences on the first and third counts of the information, specifically, promoting prostitution of a person less than sixteen years old and risk of injury to a child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Each count charged that the defendant offered M, a child under the age of sixteen, for prostitution on various dates in 1992 and 1993. The defendant received a sentence of eighteen year's, execution suspended after fourteen years, followed by five years of probation on the first count. On the third count, she received seven years, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution prohibits multiple punishment for the same offense in a single trial, as well as multiple trials for the same offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>50 Conn. App. 1, 17-18, 717 A.2d 775, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 927, 719 A.2d 1171 (1998). The double jeopardy clause is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lon-ergan, </em>213 Conn. 74, 78, 566 A.2d 677 (1989), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2586, 110 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\u201cDouble jeopardy analysis in the context of a single trial is a two-step process. First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 290-91, 579 A.2d 84 (1990). In this case, the state concedes, and we agree, that the crimes charged arise out of the same act; the question is whether they are the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\u201c[T]he test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires the proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). We look to the language of the statutes, the information and the bill of particulars, but not the evidence presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 291. This test is not a conclusive presumption of law but, rather, is a rule of statutory construction and should not be controlling where there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>42 Conn. App. 264, 269, 679 A.2d 407 (1996), appeal dismissed, 243 Conn. 248, 701 A.2d 1057 (1997). \u201cThe determinative question is whether the legislature intended the offenses to be separate.\u201d Id. We recognize that a substantial overlap in the proof required does not necessarily make the two offenses the same legislatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Because the defendant has not shown a clear legislative intent to the contrary,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <em>Blockburger </em>test is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>trolling. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>231 Conn. 545, 563, 651 A.2d 1264 (1995). We conclude that the two crimes charged are not the same offense and that there was no double jeopardy violation when the defendant was sentenced for violations of both \u00a7\u00a7 53a-86 and 53-21. Count three of the charging document, i.e, risk of injury to a child, imposes criminal liability for doing any act \u201clikely to impair the health or morals of any . . . child [under the age of sixteen] . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53-21. Count one of the charging document, charging promoting prostitution, imposes criminal liability when one \u201cknowingly ... (2) advances or profits from prostitution of a person less than sixteen years old.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a~86.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">An act of promoting prostitution does not necessarily constitute a violation of the statute that prohibits risk of injuiy to a child, and vice versa. Promoting prostitution requires a specific intent; the actor must \u201cknowingly advance<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or profit from prostitution of a person less than sixteen years old.\u201d Risk of injury to a child, as charged, i.e., that the defendant \u201cdid commit certain acts likely to impair the morals\u201d of M, requires no such mental element. Similarly, while risk of injury requires that the defendant commit an act \u201clikely to impair the morals\u201d of a child, promoting prostitution does not. Because each statute requires proof of a fact or facts that the other does not, they are not the same offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>under <em>Blockburger </em>and, therefore, there is no double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-86 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of promoting prostitution in the first degree when he knowingly: (1) Advances prostitution by compelling a person by force or intimidation to engage in prostitution, or profits from coercive conduct by another; or (2) advances or profits from prostitution of a person less than sixteen years old.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d Section 53-21 was not amended during the period relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-9\"> During oral argument, the defendant acknowledged that evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s use of drugs might have actually been beneficial to the defendant in that it allowed the jury to assign a reason for the defendant\u2019s actions, i.e., drug dependency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> This claim was not raised before the trial court. Nevertheless, double jeopardy claims arising in the context of a single trial that are raised for the first time on appeal are reviewable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 705, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>45 Conn. App. 369, 384 n.17, 696 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 904, 701 A.2d 335 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> In fact, the origins and purposes of the two offenses are different. The clear purpose of the risk of injury statute is to \u201cprotect the well-being of children.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>40 Conn. App. 1, 7, 669 A.2d 582 (1995), aff'd, 240 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Conn. 766, 695 A.2d 525 (1997). The primary purpose of the promotion of prostitution offense is to prevent acts or solicitations of prostitution, with victimization of children as one of the factors affecting the degree of penalty. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-86. It is clear that, the legislature intended and authorized cumulative punishments for violations of these two statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b657-12\"> One advances prostitution when one \u201cknowingly causes or aids a person to commit or engage in prostitution, procures or solicits patrons for prostitution, provides persons or premises for prostitution purposes, operates or assists in the operation of a house of prostitution or a prostitution enterprise, or engages in any other conduct designated to institute, aid or facilitate an act or enterprise of prostitution.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-85 (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
