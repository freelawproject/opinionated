The trial court conducted a full hearing and concluded that no fraud had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-17\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court should have made different factual findings and reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>different conclusions based on the credibility of the witnesses. In effect, we are being asked to substitute our judgment, as to the credibility of the witnesses, for the judgment of the trial court. It is axiomatic that we cannot do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\">The denial of the motion to open the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
