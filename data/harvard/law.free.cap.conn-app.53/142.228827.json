On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment and granted injunctive relief restraining the defendant from collecting property taxes on flowage rights that were assessed for the tax years 1987 through 1993. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The following facts are not in dispute. On May 18, 1995, the plaintiff purchased flowage rights located in the town of Ellington. The flowage rights allow the plaintiff to raise and lower a body of water known as Crystal Lake to a fixed level by the operation of a dam that the plaintiff operates located downstream in the town of Stafford. The dam is owned by the plaintiff and is not operated by water power. The plaintiff is not the fee owner of the land that the flowage rights encumber, but holds instead an easement on the land. From October 1, 1987, through October 1, 1996, the defendant assessed and levied taxes on those flowage rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">On July 17, 1995, the plaintiff brought this action, consisting of three counts, to challenge the assessment of taxes on the flowage rights for the 1994 tax year. In count one, the plaintiff alleged excessive valuation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>count two, the plaintiff alleged excessive valuation and also alleged that the flowage rights are not taxable in the town of Ellington under General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In count three, the plaintiff claimed a wrongful taking of property in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 48-6 (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 48-12<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. On February 12, 1997, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on counts one and two. On April 3,1997, the defendant moved for summary judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>counts one, two and three, and opposed the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on counts one and two. On May 16, 1997, the plaintiff amended its complaint to include the 1995 and 1996 tax year's. The plaintiff also added a fourth count, challenging the assessment of tax from October 1, 1987, through October 1, 1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On June 20, 1997, the trial court, by written memorandum,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> determined on the first and second counts that the plaintiff was the owner of nontaxable flowage rights and granted its motion for summary judgment, ordering injunctive relief. As to count three, the trial court determined that there was no taking of the plaintiffs property pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 48-6 and 48-12 and granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment and injunctive relief on the fourth count of the amended complaint. At the hearing on the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, the defendant relied on its special defense that the plaintiff did not appeal the assessment within the one year limitation period prescribed in \u00a7 12-119. On August 18, 1997, the trial court, by oral decision, granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and ordered injunctive relief in favor of the plaintiff with respect to count four. The court ordered the assessments removed from the tax lists for the years 1987 through 1993. Referring to its prior decision on counts one and two that the plaintiff was an owner of nontaxable flowage rights, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 12-119, in particular the one year statute of limitations, was not applicable to the plaintiff because it did not apply to the owners or lessees of flowage rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The defendant does not challenge the determination that the flowage rights are nontaxable. Instead, the defendant claims that the plaintiff did not properly challenge the tax assessments pursuant to \u00a7 12-119. The defendant argues that because the plaintiff did not appeal from the assessment of taxes on the flowage rights in a timely manner, the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment and granted injunctive relief in favor of the plaintiff. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>233 Conn. 732, 744-45, 660 A.2d 810 (1995). \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rosario </em>v. <em>Hasak, </em>50 Conn. App. 632, 637, 718 A.2d 505 (1998). \u201cThe test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>General Accident Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Powers, Bolles, Houlihan &amp; Hartline, Inc., </em>50 Conn. App. 701, 707, 719 A.2d 77 (1998), cert. granted on other grounds, 247 Conn. 954, 723 A.2d 810 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u201cOn appeal, [w]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Avon Meadow Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut, </em>50 Conn. App. 688, 693, 719 A.2d 66, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 946, 723 A.2d 320 (1998). Because the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff as a matter of law, our review is plenary and \u201cwe must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court.\u201d <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 689, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988). \u201cOn appeal, however, the burden is on the opposing party to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the movant\u2019s summary judgment motion was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>2830 Whitney Avenue Corp. </em>v. <em>Heritage Canal Development Associates, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 563, 567, 636 A.2d 1377 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">We are satisfied that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the defendant makes no claim to the contrary. In its affidavit, the plaintiff asserts that it is the owner of the flowage rights and that it is not the fee owner of the land over which the water flowed. The defendant, in its affidavit, asserts only that it has assessed taxes on the plaintiffs interest, but does not assert that the plaintiff is the fee owner of land. Furthermore, the trial court, with regard to counts one and two, found that the plaintiff is the owner of flowage rights only. The defendant contends on appeal that \u00a7 12-119 bars the plaintiffs claim because it was not brought \u201cwithin one year from the date as of which the property was last evaluated for the purposes of taxation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-119. The plaintiff argues that the trial court properly determined that \u00a7 12-119 applies only to the owners of land, and, therefore, the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and its one year statute of limitations does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Section 12-119 provides owners and lessees of property with a remedy to challenge a municipality\u2019s wrongful assessment of tax. <em>Wilson </em>v. Kelley, 224 Conn. 110, 118-19, 617 A.2d 433 (1992). Section 12-119 \u201cembraces situations where a tax has been laid on property not taxable in the municipality where it is situated . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 119.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The pertinent question, therefore, is whether the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cproperty\u201d includes the plaintiffs flowage rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In the present case, the assessed interest consists of the plaintiffs flowage rights. \u201cThe right of flowage is, after all, only an easement.\u201d <em>Great Hill Lake, Inc. </em>v. <em>Caswell, </em>126 Conn. 364, 367, 11 A.2d 396 (1940). Therefore, the plaintiff is the owner of an easement that \u201cmerely authorizes the flooding, by an owner of a riparian dominant tenement, of land of the servient tenement which he does not himself own and therefore would otherwise have no right to overflow.\u201d <em>Gager </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>146 Conn. 288, 295, 150 A.2d 302 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs principal contention that \u00a7 12-119 pertains only to owners of land and, therefore, does not apply to the owner of an easement. It is clear that \u00a7 12-119 is the correct procedure for an aggrieved taxpayer to challenge the improper assessment of an easement. See <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>165 Conn. 211, 213 n.1, 332 A.2d 83 (1973); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>101 Conn. 383, 389, 126 A. 1 (1924). In <em>Hartford Electric </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Light Co., </em>our Supreme Court allowed a \u00a7 12-119 claim challenging the taxability of an easement that allowed the plaintiff to erect and maintain electrical power lines. In response to the defendant\u2019s abandoned claim that the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain the action under \u00a7 12-119, the court stated that the statute is \u201cdecidedly the correct procedure for an aggrieved taxpayer to invoke where the questioned assessment is claimed to be illegal.\u201d <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>supra, 213 n.1. Furthermore, in <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>our Supreme Court allowed a \u00a7 12-119 action to challenge the assessment of tax on an easement that was employed by the plaintiff to transport electricity over land via electric cables. In discussing the applicability of \u00a7 12-119, the court stated that the statute is to be \u201capplied to any existing, unpaid tax . . . .\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>supra, 390. In light of the above cases, it is clear that the remedy provided by \u00a7 12-119 is not limited to owners of land, but is also the remedy prescribed for taxpayers to challenge the illegal assessment of an easement. The plaintiffs right of flowage is an easement; therefore, \u00a7 12-119 is the statutory remedy for challenging the assessment of the plaintiffs flowage rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Because \u00a7 12-119 is the proper remedy for the owners of flowage rights to challenge an illegal tax assessment, the one year limitation period applies. The statute requires that claims be brought \u201cwithin one year from the date as of which the property was last evaluated for purposes of taxation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-119. In the present case, the plaintiff did not challenge the defendant\u2019s assessment of the flowage rights from 1987 through 1993 until May 16,1997, well after the one year limitation period had expired. Because this action was not brought within the one year statutoiy period, the plaintiff is precluded from bringing this present action under \u00a7 12-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Absent the remedy of \u00a7 12-119, a taxpayer may, in certain situations, assert the statute\u2019s underlying common-law action of assumpsit. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>200 Conn. 697, 710, 513 A.2d 77 (1986); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>supra, 101 Conn. 391-92. It is well settled that \u00a7 12-119 codified the then existing common-law right and remedy of assumpsit that allowed a taxpayer to challenge an illegally assessed tax. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 123; <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>supra, 710; <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>167 Conn. 509, 513, 356 A.2d 144 (1975); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>supra, 391-92. Section 12-119 expressly provides that its remedy is \u201cin addition to the other remedies provided by law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-119. The term \u201cother remedies\u201d refers not only to the alternative procedure of General Statutes \u00a7 12-lll,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but also to the common-law remedy of assumpsit. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>supra, 710; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>supra, 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In the present case, however, the plaintiff is precluded from bringing an action under the common-law writ of assumpsit. In <em>Norwich, </em>our Supreme Court held that a taxpayer may not bring an action of assumpsit in an attempt to circumvent the time restraints of \u00a7 12-119 if it would undermine the puipose of the statute. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 711. In <em>Norwich, </em>the plaintiff brought an assumpsit action to challenge the defendant\u2019s assessment of certain property well after the one year limitation period provided by \u00a7 12-119. After noting that \u00a7 12-119 was the proper remedy for the plaintiff to challenge the assessment, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Supreme Court stated that \u201cwhere a statute has established a procedure to redress a particular wrong a person must follow the specified remedy and may not institute a proceeding that might have been permissible in the absence of such a statutory procedure.\u201d Id., 708. The purpose of the one year limitation is to promote the prompt resolution of assessment disputes; id., 712; and \u201cto prevent delays in the ultimate determination of the amounts a municipality can collect as taxes.\u201d <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>130 Conn. 699, 702, 37 A.2d 237 (1944). In the present case, allowing the plaintiff to bring an assumpsit action would undermine the purpose of \u00a7 12-119 because it would prolong the resolution of an assessment dispute and would delay a municipality\u2019s determination of expected tax proceeds. Because the plaintiff failed to comply with the statutory remedy, it cannot now bring an action under the common-law claim of assumpsit and circumvent the purpose or the one year limitation of \u00a7 12-119. <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>supra, 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The plaintiff was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it failed to bring the claim within the prescribed time period of \u00a7 12-119. The trial court, therefore, improperly granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on count four. In view of our determination that summary judgment was improper in this case, the issuance of an injunction ordering the removal of the tax assessments from 1987 through 1993 was improper because there is no basis for relief in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to deny the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to count four and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-117a provides in relevant part that \u201cany person, including any lessee of real property whose lease has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>recorded as provided in section 47-19 and who is bound under the terms of his lease to pay real property taxes, claiming to be aggrieved by the action of the board of tax review in any town or city with respect to the assessment list for the assessment year commencing October 1, 1989, October 1, 1990, October 1, 1991, October 1, 1992, October 1, 1993, or October 1, 1994, may, within two months from the time of such action, make application, in the nature of an appeal therefrom, to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated, which shall be accompanied by a citation to such town or city to appear before said court. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-119 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen it is claimed that a tax has been laid on property not taxable in the town or city in whose tax list such property was set . . . the owner thereof or any lessee thereof whose lease has been recorded as provided in section 47-19 and who is bound under the terms of his lease to pay real property taxes, prior to the payment of such tax, may, in addition to the other remedies provided by law, make application for relief to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated.
