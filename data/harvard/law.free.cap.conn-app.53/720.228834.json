We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim was five years old at the time of the incident in August, 1996, and six years old at the time of trial. He lived with his parents and brother. Both of the victim\u2019s parents worked, and his maternal aunt, Grizelda Ramos, baby-sat for him and his younger brother. When Grizelda Ramos obtained employment, it was agreed that her husband, the defendant, would baby-sit for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The defendant had baby-sat for the victim for approximately one week before the incident in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>occurred. The victim testified that, on August 28, 1996, the defendant asked him to go into the bathroom with the defendant and not to tell his mother. The defendant shut the bathroom door without locking it. The defendant then told the victim to remove his shorts. The defendant also removed his own pants. The victim told the defendant that he wanted lunch, and the defendant said, \u201cWanna eat this, my penis?\u201d At that point, in the victim\u2019s words, \u201c[the defendant] put his penis in my butt.\u201d At that time, the victim was lying down on the outside of the bathtub and the defendant was standing behind him. When the victim told the defendant that it hurt, the latter said he would do it softly.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Later that day, the victim\u2019s father came and got the victim and his brother and took them home. The victim did not tell his father what had happened. That same day, the victim told his mother about the incident as she was driving him to his grandmother\u2019s house. The victim\u2019s grandmother testified that she examined the victim\u2019s rectum that day and noticed nothing but she advised her daughter to take him to a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The victim\u2019s grandfather, who testified for the defense, stated that on August 28, 1996, the victim and his mother came to his house. The victim told his grandfather that he wanted to tell him something. He then proceeded to tell him about the incident. The grandfather told his wife what the victim had told him. The grandmother then took the victim into a bedroom and examined him. The grandfather said that the victim\u2019s mother first heard about the incident when the victim\u2019s grandmother examined the victim. The victim\u2019s mother then started to cry and yell. After the victim\u2019s grandmother examined him, she and her husband went to the defendant\u2019s home and confronted him with the victim\u2019s allegations. At that time, the defendant called the victim\u2019s mother, who was still at her parents\u2019 home, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>told her if she did not believe him to take the victim to the emergency room and check it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Two days later, the victim was examined by Peter McLaughlin, a physician, who found no evidence of tearing, redness, rawness, bruises or contusions. The victim tested negative for sexually transmitted diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The defendant testified that in August, 1996, he was taking care of the victim and his brother for a short time. He denied the victim\u2019s allegations and said he never went into the bathroom with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">To be convicted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a person had sexual intercourse with a person who was under the age of thirteen and that the perpetrator was more than two years older than the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) defines sexual intercourse as \u201cvaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Its meaning is limited to persons not married to each other. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse or fellatio and does not require emission of semen. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">To be convicted of the crime of risk of injury to a child under \u00a7 53-21 (2), it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a person had contact with an intimate part of a child under the age of sixteen or who subjects a child under sixteen years of age to contact with the intimate parts of such person, in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The core issue in this matter is whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the defendant guilty of risk of injury to a child. The defendant claims that, since the jury found that the defendant did not have sexual intercourse with the victim, he could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>have been found guilty of having contact with an intimate part of the victim because the sexual assault acquittal meant that the jury rejected the evidence needed to convict him of risk of injury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>242 Conn. 485, 489, 698 A.2d 898 (1997). \u201cOn appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty. Id., 490.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kondracki, </em>51 Conn. App. 338, 342, 721 A.2d 567 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\u201cWe are guided by the well established principle that \u2018[t]he trier of fact may accept or reject the testimony of any witness.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>38 Conn. App. 731, 744, 663 A.2d 1078 (1995), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 921, 676 A.2d 1376 [cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1044, 117 S. Ct. 617, 136 L. Ed. 2d 541] (1996). It is the trier of fact\u2019s \u2018exclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>30 Conn. App. 232, 239, 619 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 915, 623 A.2d 1025 (1993). We give deference to the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom that support the trial court\u2019s determination of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>46 Conn. App. 684, 690, 700 A.2d 119 (1997).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kondracki, </em>supra, 51 Conn. App. 342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201cput his penis in my butt,\u201d if believed by the jury, could prove the crime of risk of injury to a child. For purposes of risk of injury, the jury did not need to determine that there was any anal penetration. Mere contact between the defendant\u2019s penis and the victim\u2019s anus or buttocks would have sufficed. The jury reasonably could have found that while the victim\u2019s testimony did not establish that penetration occurred, it was sufficient to establish that the requisite contact occurred. Because the evidence in this case reasonably supports the inference of such contact, we conclude that trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who . . .
