The dispositive issue on appeal is whether, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant should have allocated to the plaintiffs community spouse resource allowance (resource allowance) certain spousal resources that generated only capital gains at the time that the plaintiffs husband was institutionalized. Such allocation would allow the plaintiff to generate her minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance (minimum needs allowance).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>The defendant claims that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>court improperly determined that the resources in question were income producing within the meaning of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C). We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that those resources generated income. As an alternative ground for affirming the decision of the trial court, the plaintiff claims that the defendant should have authorized the conversion of the resources into income producing resources and allocated to her resource allowance an amount of the converted resources sufficient to enable her to generate her minimum needs allowance. We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that, pursuant to \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), the defendant should have authorized a conversion of the resources and allocated to the resource allowance an amount of the converted resources sufficient to enable the plaintiff to generate her minimum needs allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Prior to a recitation of the facts and procedural history of this appeal, it is necessary to provide a brief overview of the relevant federal medicaid laws and corresponding state regulations. Our Supreme Court has referred to this statutory scheme as a \u201c \u2018Serbonian bog.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>237 Conn. 550, 554, 680 A.2d 113 (1996); see <em>Friedman </em>v.

Ct. 1681, 52 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1977). \u201cThe medicaid program, established in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq., is a joint federal-state venture providing financial assistance to persons whose income and resources are inadequate to meet the costs of necessary medical care. . . . States participate voluntarily in the medicaid program, but participating states must develop a plan, approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>secretary of health and human services, containing reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance .... Connecticut has elected to participate in the medicaid program and has assigned to the department [of social services] the task of administering the program. General Statutes [\u00a7 17b-260]. . . .

Pub. L. No. 100-360,102 Stat. 683 (1988), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5. \u201cThe objective of the MCCA was to protect married couples when one spouse is institutionalized in a nursing home, so that the spouse who continues to reside in the community is not impoverished and has sufficient income and resources to live independently.

Prior to 1988, Medicaid eligibility rules required couples to deplete their combined resources before the institutionalized spouse<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was eligible for benefits, often leaving the community spouse<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> financially vulnerable. The MCCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>attempted to strike a balance between preventing impoverishment of the community spouse by excluding minimum amounts of resources and income for that spouse from eligibility considerations, and preventing a financially solvent institutionalized spouse from receiving Medicaid benefits by ensuring that income was not completely transferred to the community spouse.\u201d <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Dept. of Human Services, </em>145 F.3d 793, 798 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 964, 119 S.

On November 17, 1994, the plaintiffs husband began a period of continuous institutionalization at Hill Haven Nursing Home in Windsor. The plaintiff remained in the couple\u2019s home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>On December 30,1994, the plaintiff filed an application on behalf of her husband for medicaid benefits. The defendant determined that, as of November 17, 1994, the date of institutionalization, the couple\u2019s resources totaled $188,032.11. The defendant allocated $74,820 in resources to the plaintiffs resource allowance and transferred the remainder to the plaintiffs husband. The defendant denied the plaintiffs husband\u2019s medicaid application because his resources exceeded the eligibility limit of $1600. See Uniform Policy Manual (1993) \u00a7 4005.10 (A) (2) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The plaintiff timely requested an administrative hearing because she was dissatisfied with the defendant\u2019s assessment of the spousal resources and the denial of her husband\u2019s application. After an administrative hearing, the hearing officer determined that the plaintiffs minimum needs allowance was $1809.75 and that the plaintiff received gross monthly income of $418.25. The hearing officer found that the plaintiffs monthly income of $418.25 was insufficient to provide her minimum needs allowance of $1809.75. In an effort to help the plaintiff reach her minimum needs allowance, the hearing officer transferred to the plaintiffs resource allowance $28,363.26 in income producing resources from her husband\u2019s resources of $113,212.11. As a result, the plaintiffs adjusted resource allowance totaled $103,183.26 and her husband retained resources of $84,848.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Relying on Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration, State Medicaid Agency Regional Bulletin No. 93-21, dated March 17,1993 (Medicaid Bulletin No. 93-21), the hearing officer concluded that she could not allocate any portion of the $84,848.85 in resources to the plaintiffs resource allowance because those resources did not generate income at the time the plaintiffs husband was institutionalized. \u201cThe statutory provision for revising the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>community spouse resource allowance is set out in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C)\u201d; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Dept. of Human Services, </em>supra, 145 F.3d 798; and Medicaid Bulletin No. 93-21 clarified the scope of a hearing officer\u2019s authority to adjust the resource allowance pursuant to \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C). The record demonstrates, and neither party disputes, that the $84,848.85 in resources, which are the focus of this appeal, generated only capital gains at the time the plaintiffs husband was institutionalized. The hearing officer also affirmed the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs husband\u2019s application because his resources exceeded the medicaid eligibility limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff timely filed an administrative appeal with the trial court. The plaintiff claimed that because the resources in question generated income, the hearing officer should have allocated them to her resource allowance. Relying on definitions of income in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq., and dictionaries, the court concluded that \u201csuch capital gains are considered income to the owner in every other context and by every other governmental agency. They are moneys currently generated by the assets in question and available to the owners of those assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The court remanded the case for a new hearing and ordered that the defendant must consider the resources in question to be resources that potentially could be allocated to the plaintiffs resource allowance. The defendant filed this appeal from a final judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether the death of the plaintiff during the pendency of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>appeal has rendered the appeal moot. After examining the record and the briefs of both parties, it appeared to us that the issue of whether the appeal was moot was fairly suggested. Although neither the defendant nor the plaintiff briefed this issue, we afforded both parties an opportunity at oral argument to address the issue. Although both the plaintiff and the defendant claim that the appeal is not moot, because the question of mootness implicates our subject matter jurisdiction; <em>Stamford Hospital </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>236 Conn. 646, 652-53, 674 A.2d 821 (1996); we must consider the issue. We conclude that this appeal is not moot because we can grant practical relief to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cMootness deprives this court of subject matter jurisdiction. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot. . . . [I]t is not the province of the appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... If no practical relief can be afforded to the parties, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>ALCA Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury Housing Authority, </em>49 Conn. App. 78, 80-81, 713 A.2d 886 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Additional facts are necessary for a proper discussion of this issue. At oral argument, the defendant claimed that this appeal is not moot because there is practical relief that this court can grant it. \u201cThe test for determining mootness of an appeal is whether there is an any practical relief this court can grant the appellant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 81. Specifically, the defendant claims that this appeal is not moot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>because our resolution of the issue raised on appeal will also necessarily determine whether the medicaid system, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (34),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or the plaintiffs estate is responsible for certain medical expenses incurred by the plaintiffs husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In its appeal to this court, the defendant challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the $84,848.85 in resources generated income and, therefore, could potentially be allocated to the plaintiffs resource allowance. The defendant\u2019s calculation of the plaintiffs resource allowance directly influenced its determination of her husband\u2019s eligibility for medicaid benefits. \u201cThe resource allowance is protected from the institutionalized applicant\u2019s health care obligations and does not count against the applicant\u2019s financial eligibility.\u201d <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 149. \u201cBecause this increase in the resource allowance results from a transfer of resources from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse, the value of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s resources is brought closer to the [medicaid] eligibility level.\u201d Id., 149-50. Accordingly, in resolving the issue on appeal, we will also necessarily determine whether the hearing officer improperly affirmed the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs husband\u2019s medicaid application.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In her appeals to the hearing officer and to the trial court, the plaintiff not only challenged the calculation of her resource allowance, but also the denial of her husband\u2019s medicaid application. The hearing officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>refused to allocate any portion of the $84,848.85 in resources to the plaintiffs resource allowance because it did not generate income and, therefore, she attributed those resources to the plaintiffs husband. As a result, the hearing officer affirmed the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs husband\u2019s application because his resources exceeded the eligibility limit of $1600.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The trial court reversed the decision of the hearing officer and remanded the case for a new hearing, concluding that the resources in question generated income. On remand, if the hearing officer determines that at least $83,248.86 of the $84,848.85 in resources should have been transferred to the plaintiffs resource allowance, then the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs husband\u2019s application was improper because, as a result of that transfer, his resources would have fallen below the eligibility limit of $1600. As a result, medicaid could assume liability for certain medical expenses incurred by the plaintiffs husband. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (34); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.914 (a). If we conclude, however, that the hearing officer properly refused to allocate the resources to the plaintiffs resource allowance, then we will necessarily conclude that the hearing officer properly affirmed the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs husband\u2019s application because his resources exceeded the eligibility limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Because our resolution of the issue raised on appeal will necessarily determine whether the medicaid system or the plaintiffs estate is responsible for certain medical expenses incurred by the plaintiffs husband, we conclude that this appeal is not moot because there is practical relief that we can grant to the parties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly determined that $84,848.85 in spousal resources constituted income producing resources within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) and asks us to affirm the decision of the hearing officer. Specifically, the defendant contends that, pursuant to the definition of income under the Supplemental Security Income Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq., and accompanying federal regulations, resources that generate only capital gains are not income producing. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.1102 and 416.1103. The plaintiff claims that, pursuant to the definition of income in dictionaries and the internal revenue code, the resources in question generated income. Although we agree with the defendant, we find it unnecessary to look beyond the text of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) and its purpose to reach our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201cJudicial review of an agency decision is limited. . . . [ W] e must decide, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion. . . . Even as to questions of law, [t]he court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Although the words \u201cincome producing\u201d do not appear in the text of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), neither party challenges the conclusion of the Department of Health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>and Human Services that if a hearing officer determines, pursuant to \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), that it is necessary to allocate additional resources to the resource allowance, such resources must produce income. See Medicaid Bulletin No. 93-21.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we assume, without deciding, that when a resource allowance must be adjusted to provide the community spouse with a minimum needs allowance in accordance with \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), federal law requires that the resources that will be transferred must generate income. Instead, the plaintiff and defendant offer different interpretations of \u201cincome producing.\u201d The defendant claims that the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation was proper, whereas the plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s interpretation was correct. Because the words \u201cincome producing\u201d do not appear in the text of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>look for interpretive guidance to the language of the statute and its purpose. See <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 309-310, 592 A.2d 953 (1991). We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the resources in question generated income. Our conclusion is predicated on the language of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) and the legislative purpose underlying this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Section 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) provides that if either spouse \u201cestablishes that the community spouse resource allowance ... is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance under subsection (f) (2) of this section, <em>an amount adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs </em>allowance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C). The minimum needs allowance represents the minimum amount of income a community spouse needs to meet her basic needs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (d) (3); <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Waldman, </em>959 F. Sup. 222, 231 (D. N.J. 1997) (minimum needs allowance is \u201can amount designed to ensure that the community spouse has an income . . . above the official poverty line\u201d). We conclude that since the purpose of the transfer of resources is to provide sufficient income to meet the monthly maintenance needs of the community spouse, the resources that are transferrable must be resources that will provide a regular stream of income to the community spouse. Resources that would generate moneys for the community spouse only upon their sale do not serve the purpose of the statute and do not qualify as income producing resources that would be transferrable to the community spouse under \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C). Transferring to the plaintiffs resource allowance resources that generate only capital gains would not provide her with any additional monthly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>income that she could use to meet her minimum monthly maintenance needs. Accordingly, resources that generate only capital gains cannot be considered income producing under \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Because we conclude that the text of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) and its purpose collectively establish that the resources in question did not generate income in the sense that the term is used in the statute, we find it unnecessary to look for interpretive guidance to the Supplemental Security Income Act and the internal revenue code.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The plaintiff claims, in what constitutes an alternative ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s order, that even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>if the resources in question did not generate income, she should have been afforded an opportunity to convert these resources into income producing resources. The plaintiff asks us to determine whether, pursuant to \u00a7 1396r~5 (e) (2) (C), the defendant should have authorized a conversion of these resources into income producing resources and allocated to the resource allowance an amount of the converted resources sufficient to enable her to generate her minimum needs allowance. We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that, pursuant \u00a7 1396-5 (e) (2) (C), the defendant should have authorized a conversion of the resources and allocated to the resource allowance an amount of the converted resources sufficient to enable the plaintiff to generate her minimum needs allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Additional facts are necessary to a resolution of this issue. The hearing officer\u2019s decision attached significance to the <em>form </em>in which these resources existed on the date the plaintiffs husband was institutionalized. The hearing officer denied the plaintiffs request to allocate these resources to her resource allowance because \u201cthey were not income producing <em>at the time of the spousal assessment, </em>i.e., as of the date of the [plaintiffs] husband\u2019s institutionalization (November 17, 1994).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The hearing officer determined that spousal resources that generated only capital gains on the date of institutionalization could not later be converted into income producing resources and, if warranted under \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), allocated to the resource allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In her appeal to the trial court, the plaintiff claimed that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was improper because, on May 11, 1995,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> she notified the hearing officer that she had converted the resources in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>into resources that generated income. In its memorandum of law in opposition to the administrative appeal, the defendant responded: \u201cThe plaintiff also contends that the fair hearing officer erred in basing her decision on the state of the O\u2019Callaghans\u2019 finances as they existed on November 17,1994, the date on which [the plaintiffs husband] became institutionalized, and by not considering the reconfiguration of the O\u2019Callaghans\u2019 assets from growth-producing to interest-bearing investments, which was carried out after the hearing. Those assertions do not have merit. Both federal and state law explicitly require that the financial assessment for medicaid eligibility be done as of the date of the applicant\u2019s institutionalization. Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 1507.05; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (c) (1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On the basis of its conclusion that the resources in question generated income, the trial court remanded the case to the defendant with the order that the defendant must consider the resources in question to be resources that potentially could be allocated to the plaintiffs resource allowance. The trial court did not reach the plaintiffs conversion claim. The plaintiffs conversion claim constitutes an alternative ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s order that the defendant must consider the resources in question to be resources that potentially could be allocated to the plaintiffs resource allowance. Although the plaintiff did not file a preliminary statement of issues alleging that this claim constitutes an alternative ground for affirmance; see Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (1); we will consider it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Neither Medicaid Bulletin No. 93-21 nor \u00a7 P-1570.30 of the Uniform Policy Manual specifically addresses the propriety of a conversion of spousal resources under the present circumstances. \u201cAlthough courts ordinarily defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of statutory text, where, as in this case, the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . that construction constitutes a question of law for which deference is not warranted.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We conclude that after the hearing officer transferred all available income producing spousal resources to the plaintiffs resource allowance and determined that the income generated by the adjusted resource allowance was insufficient to generate the plaintiffs minimum needs allowance and that additional spousal resources that did not produce income were available, \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) required the hearing officer to authorize a conversion of the additional resources into income producing resources and to allocate to the resource allowance an amount of the converted resources sufficient to enable the plaintiff to generate her minimum needs allowance.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Our decision is predicated on a careful consideration of the text of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), its purpose, the legislative history of the MCCA and the relationship between \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) and \u00a7 1396r-5 (c) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We begin with the words of the statute. Section 1396r~ 5 (e) (2) (C) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>such spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance ... is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance ... an amount adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C). \u201cThe legislature is quite aware of how to use language when it wants to express its intent to qualify or limit the operation of a statute\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>43 Conn. App. 801, 825, 687 A.2d 1279 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 908, 689 A.2d 472 (1997); and there is nothing in the text of this statute that indicates that the legislature prohibited the defendant from authorizing a conversion of the resources in question and allocating an appropriate amount to the resource allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Second, our inteipretation effectuates the legislature\u2019s stated puipose. The plain text of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) provides that, if the resource allowance does not generate sufficient income to provide the community spouse her full minimum needs allowance, the hearing officer \u201cshall\u201d adjust the resource allowance to enable the community spouse to generate her minimum needs allowance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C). Converting the resources in question into income producing resources and transferring an appropriate amount to the plaintiffs resource allowance would have provided her with additional income that she could have used to meet her minimum monthly maintenance needs, whereas the hearing officer\u2019s inteipretation frustrates the purpose of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) because it prohibits the conversion of those resources despite the determination that the resource allowance does not generate sufficient income to enable the community spouse to meet her minimum needs. \u201cA statute . . . should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>be interpreted to thwart its purpose.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 508, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Third, our interpretation does not, as the defendant claims, undermine an important objective of the MCCA. Section 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) was enacted as part of the MCCA. The legislative history of the MCCA establishes that Congress sought to end the pauperization of community spouses \u201cby assuring that the community spouse has a sufficient\u2014but, not excessive\u2014amount of income and resources available to her while her spouse is in a nursing home.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 100-105 (II), 100th Cong., 2d Sess. at 65 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 857, 888. The defendant claims that our conclusion will provide the plaintiff with an excessive amount of resources. The defendant\u2019s argument fails because it ignores that \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) places a ceiling on the amount of resources a hearing officer can transfer to the resource allowance. Section 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) limits the transfer of resources to \u201can amount adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Fourth, the text of \u00a7 1396r~5 (c) (1) (A)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> does not, as the defendant claims, preclude the conversion of the resources in question. Nor does it prohibit a hearing officer from allocating an appropriate amount of the converted resources to the resource allowance for the purpose of enabling a community spouse to generate her minimum needs allowance. Instead, \u00a7 1396r-5 (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(1) (A) mandates only that the defendant must calculate the total value of a couple\u2019s resources as of the date of the medicaid applicant\u2019s institutionalization and compute an appropriate spousal share. This method of calculating a couple\u2019s resources is commonly referred to as the \u201csnap shot.\u201d L. Torch, \u201cSpousal Impoverishment or Enrichment? An Assessment of Asset and Income Transfers by Medicaid Applicants,\u201d 4 Elder L. J. 459, 471 n.68 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Fifth, our interpretation of \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) does not frustrate the purpose of \u00a7 1396r-5 (c) (1) (A). A congressional report suggests that Congress selected the date of a medicaid applicant\u2019s institutionalization as the date of assessment to promote fairness and consistency by ensuring that a couple will receive the same financial assessment regardless of whether they apply for medicaid immediately after one spouse becomes institutionalized, or whether they wait until they have redistributed or spent down a portion of their assets before they apply for medicaid. See H.R. Rep. No. 100-105 (II), 100th Cong., 2d Sess. at 65 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 857, 901. Converting the resources in question and transferring an appropriate amount to the resource allowance will not affect the date on which the defendant assesses the value of the couple\u2019s resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Finally, we reject the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation because it produces an unreasonable result. \u201cThe unreasonableness of the result obtained by the acceptance of one possible alternative interpretation of [a statute] is a reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would provide a result that is reasonable.\u201d <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 151-52, 480 A.2d 519 (1984). If we adopted the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation, the determination of whether spousal resources could be transferred to the resource allowance would turn on the form in which these resources existed on the date of institutionalization. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Under the hearing officer\u2019s approach, the plaintiff would have been entitled to an appropriate amount of the resources in question if, at the date of her husband\u2019s institutionalization, they had generated income or dividends; however, because these resources generated capital gains, the hearing officer concluded that they could not be allocated to the resource allowance. Our interpretation avoids this unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">We therefore, on the alternate ground presented, affirm the judgment of the trial court remanding the case to the commissioner for anew hearing. On remand, the hearing officer must determine what amount of the resources in question, which the record establishes have already been converted into income producing resources, should have been transferred to the plaintiffs resource allowance for the purpose of enabling her to generate her minimum needs allowance, and whether, as a result of that transfer, the defendant improperly denied the medicaid application of the plaintiffs husband. If the hearing officer determines that the defendant improperly denied the application, the hearing officer must determine to what extent the defendant may be responsible for the husband\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\"> Although the plaintiff, Ann O\u2019Callaghan, is deceased, we refer to her as the plaintiff in this opinion. By an order dated October 15, 1997, we granted the motion of Sheila O\u2019Callaghan Lamo, executrix of the plaintiffs estate, to be substituted as party plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\"> Section 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) of title 42 of the United States Code provides: \u201cRevision of community spouse resource allowance</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u201cIf either such spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance (in relation to the amount of income generated by such an allowance) is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance under subsection (f) (2) of this section, an amount adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> In the present case, we are called on to determine only whether the defendant, in adjusting the plaintiffs resource allowance pursuant to \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C), properly determined that the spousal resources in question could not be allocated to the resource allowance. In adjusting the plaintiffs resource allowance, the defendant looked to the resources of the plaintiffs husband. The issue of whether the defendant, in adjusting the resource allowance, should have looked first to the income or to the resources of the plaintiff s husband is not properly before us. Therefore, we express no opinion concerning whether the defendant should have utilized a \u201cresource first,\u201d \u201cincome first,\u201d or hybrid methodology.

This bulletin provides in relevant part: \u201cSeveral states have inquired whether a State hearing officer can increase the protected resource amount (PRA), a component of the community spouse resource allowance, under the authority of [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5] (e) (2) (C). The purpose would be to bring the community spouse\u2019s income closer to the amount of the community spouse monthly income allowance in the post-eligibility period. . . . Section [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5] (e) (2) (C) provides that, if either spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance is inadequate to raise the community spouse\u2019s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, an amount adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance shall be substituted. However, you must consider the community spouse\u2019s other income in determining how much more income would need to be generated from <em>income-producing resources </em>to bring his/her income up to the monthly maintenance needs allowance. <em>Inherent in this concept is that resources used to fulfill an increased PRA under this provision must be income-producing. </em>Otherwise, the transfer would not serve to increase the income of the community spouse.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Additionally, that portion of the Uniform Policy Manual that outlines the procedure for ac[justing the resource allowance requires that spousal resources transferred to the resource allowance must be income producing.

In Ford, the plaintiff, a community spouse, requested an administrative hearing pursuant to \u00a7 1396r-5 (e) (2) (C) to increase her resource allowance so that she could meet her minimum needs allowance. Id., 28. After a hearing, the \u201cadministrative law judge increased the [resource allowance] to an amount sufficient, if invested in bank accounts and certificates of deposit, to generate enough additional monthly income to reach [her minimum needs allowance of] $1,500.\u201d Id. Because the plaintiff already received $1165.92 in monthly income, she was \u201centitled to sufficient resources to generate an additional $334.08 per month.\u201d Id. On administrative review, the state department of human services determined that \u201cinstead of looking at the investment of resources necessary to generate sufficient interest income [to help the plaintiff generate her minimum needs allowance], the agency should look at the resources necessary to purchase a single-premium life annuity that would furnish monthly payments to the community spouse in an amount sufficient to bring the spouse\u2019s income up to the [minimum needs allowance of] $1,500.\u201d Id., 29. Although the department did not require the plaintiff to purchase an annuity, it based its calculation of her resource allowance on what amount of spousal resources must be liquidated in order to purchase an annuity that would generate sufficient monthly income to enable her to meet her minimum needs allowance. Id. The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the department\u2019s use of an \u201cannuity-method\u201d for adjusting the resource allowance. Id., 31-32. Although the court in Ford did not decide the question presently before us, its decision demonstrates that, in this context, income-producing resources constitute those resources that generate income that a community spouse can use to meet her minimum monthly maintenance needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> The hearing officer rendered her decision on June 9, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\"> \u201cAlthough an appellee should comply with Practice Book \u00a7 [63-4 (a) (1)] when seeking judgment on alternative grounds, this court is authorized to rely upon alternative grounds supported by the record to sustain a judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Scalzo </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>224 Conn. 124, 125 n.2, 617 A.2d 440 (1992); <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 292, 524 A.2d 629 (1987).
