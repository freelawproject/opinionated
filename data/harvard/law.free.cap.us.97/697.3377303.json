In 1875, the State of Tennessee enacted a railroad tax law, the eleventh section of which provided that a railroad company accepting that section as a special amendment to its charter, and paying annually to the State one and one-half per cent on its gross receipts, should be exempt from other provisions of the act, and that such payment should be in full of all taxation. A company, whose charter, granted in 1846, exempted from taxation its capital stock for ever, and its road, fixtures, &amp;c., for a specific period, which expired March 28, 1877, accepted the provisions of that section, and paid, for 1876 and 1876, the required percentage. That section having been declared by the Supreme Court of the State to be unconstitutional, it was repealed by an amendment, passed in 1877, which required such companies as had accepted and complied with its provisions to be assessed anew under the other sections of the act of 1875, credit to be given for sums paid by them, and any excess to be refunded. In a suit by the company to restrain the assessment and collection of the tax, \u2014 <em>Held, </em>that the Constitution of 1870, as coustrued by the highest judicial authority in the State, required all property to be uniformly taxed; and hence the legislature could not, in 1875, bind the State not to tax the company otherwise than as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>section provides, upon the surrender by the company of its charter ex eruptions.

Such stock exists only nominally. The property it represents is the tangible reality. Burrough, Taxation, 142. If the charters were silent on the subject, and the general laws of the State controlled, a tax could not be assessed upon the stock and upon such property, whether the latter consisted of real estate, rolling-stock, the road-bed, or the fixtures therewith connected, as double taxation would be thereby imposed. It therefore necessarily follows that the perpetual exemption of the stock from taxation extends to such property. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>5 Gill (Md.), 236; <em>Baltimore </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>6 id. 294; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cumberland &amp; Pennsylvania </em>Railroad, 40 Md. 51; <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Mayor of Nashville, </em>7 Heisk.

Reid, 13 Wall. 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b718-5\">To give full effect to the entire charter, the specifically enumerated property which is exempt but for a limited period must be confined to such as was purchased or constructed with money, not constituting a part of the fund, subscribed by the corporators, but borrowed pursuant to the power which the charter conferred upon the companies. Otherwise, we must ignore the cardinal rule of construction, which requires that the different provisions of a statute should, if possible, be reconciled, so as to make the whole consistent and harmonious. The court below rendered nugatory and unmeaning the positive and unequivocal provision in regard to the capital stock, by holding that the property which it represents was rightfully subject to taxation after the expiration of that period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b718-6\">The capital stock of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad Company and of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company is $10,633,325. The bonded debt, secured by mortgages, which was incurred in procuring the means to complete the construction of their roads and to purchase other property appurtenant thereto, is $16,295,677.05. By giving to each clause its full meaning, the works and property of the respective companies to the latter amount would be taxable after that period; but so much of them as was paid for out of the capital stock would be perpetually exempt. Any other interpretation practically nullifies the first clause of the section, by depriving the capital stock of the immunity thereby conferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b718-7\">The Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company has also a further provision, relieving it from any taxation which \u201c would reduce dividends below eight per cent.\u201d It has not for years declared dividends, and its condition will not justify it in doing so. The State claims the right, nevertheless, to subject the property to taxation. The cases -in this court are conclusive against the right. <em>Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad Co. </em>v.

The Memphis and Charleston Eailroad Company, by accepting it, entered with the State into a contract, which is binding, unless it infringes some constitutional limitation upon the legislative power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b719-5\">It is submitted \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b719-6\">1.

By the section, the State purchased from the company its surrender of the exemptions, and thus secured an immediate annual revenue of one and one-half per cent upon its gross earnings, by stipulating that that percentage should be the measure of taxation for the ensuing ten years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b719-8\">3. An adequate consideration having been thus paid, the case falls within the rule announced in <em>State Bank of Ohio </em>v. Knoop, 16 How. 169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b719-9\">4. The constitutional provision respecting equality and uniformity of taxation does not apply to property wholly exempt from taxation, as this confessedly was, then and for years afterward. Even if no such exemption existed, the legislature could, under the existing Constitution, make a valid contract with the company for a fixed percentage on its gross earnings, in commutation for all taxes on its property for a specific period. Burrough, Taxation, 137; <em>Illinois Central Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>McLean </em>County, 17 Ill. 291; <em>Hansacker </em>v.

The Supreme Court declared the section to be unconstitutional, after the company had in good faith accepted its terms, and paid for two years the stipulated consideration. The company claims that its acceptance created a contract, the obligation of which was impaired by subsequent legislation. A Federal question thus arises; and, in determining the points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>which it involves, this court is not, in regard to any of them, bound by the decision of the State court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b720-3\">If, however, the section is held to be not authorized by the Constitution of 1870, the question as to the exemption under the original charters will remain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b720-4\">The Knoxville and Charleston Railroad Company had, for the purpose of making and using her road, all the rights and privileges granted to the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. Company by its original charter, which provided for an exemption of its capital stock for ever, and of its road and property for twenty years from the completion of the road. The road is not yet completed. <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Pegues </em>(16 Wall. 244) is almost identical with this case. It was there held that the grant of the rights and privileges to one company which were possessed by another carried with it the exemption from taxation which the latter enjoyed. So in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(93 U. S. 217), Mr. Justice Field says, \u201c Immunity of particular property from taxation is a privilege which may sometimes be transferred under that designation, as held in <em>Humphrey </em>v. Pegues, 16 Wall. 244. All that we now decide is, that such immunity is not itself a franchise of a railroad corporation, which passes as such, without other description, to a purchaser of its property.\u201d p. 224. The only question then under consideration was, whether by a sale of the property and franchises of a railroad company under a decree of foreclosure, or under an execution sued out upon a money judgment rendered against it, an immunity from taxation conferred by the charter \"would accompany the property when transferred to the purchaser. The court decided that it would not, as it was a \u201c personal privilege of the company, and not transferable.\u201d The soundness of the rule in <em>Humphrey </em>v. Pegues, as to what passes when the \u201c rights and privileges \u201d which one company possesses are granted to another by a legislative enactment, was not doubted, nor has it been in any subsequent case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b720-5\">Lexicographers define \u201cprivilege\u201d to be an exemption or immunity from some general burden; a peculiar advantage or benefit.

THE MEMPHIS AND CHARLESTON RAILROAD COMPANY.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">1. As to the extent of the exemption contained in the original charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Under this branch of the case the company claims that the exemption of the capital stock from taxation is equivalent to an exemption of the property purchased with or represented by the capital, and there are undoubtedly many cases to be found in this and other courts where it has been held that an exemption of the capital stock of a corporation from taxation was equivalent to an exemption of the property into which the capital had been converted. But in all these cases we think it will be found that the question turned upon the effect to be given the term \u201c capital,\u201d or \u201c capital stock,\u201d as used in the particular charter under consideration, and that when the property has been exempted by reason of the exemption of the capital, it has been because, taking the whole charter together, it was apparent that the legislature so intended. Thus the capital stock of a bank usually consists of money paid in to be used in banking, and an exemption of such capital stock from taxation must almost necessarily mean an exemption of the securities into which the money has been converted in the regular course of a banking business. And in general, an exemption of capital stock, without more, may, with great propriety, be considered, under ordinary circumstances, as exempting that which, in the legitimate operations of the corporation, comes to represent the capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">But in this case, while the capital stock is for ever exempt, the \u201croad, with all its fixtures and appurtenances, including workshops, warehouses, and vehicles of transportation,\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>exempt for only twenty years after the completion of the road. Clearly, under such circumstances, it could not have been understood that the enumerated property was to represent the capital for the purposes of taxation. Exemptions are never to be presumed. On the contrary, the presumptions are always against them. The exemption of the property for twenty years only is equivalent to an express power to tax after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">It is said, however, that both provisions of the statute can stand, \u2014 that which exempts the capital and that which taxes the tangible property, \u2014 if the part of the property which represents the capital is exempted, and that which represents the bonded debt is taxed 5 but we certainly have no clear manifestation of any such intention by the legislature. It is as distinctly stated that the road and <em>all </em>its fixtures, &amp;c., are to be taxed as that the capital is to be exempt. While the company had power to borrow money on mortgage, it is very clear from the provisions of the charter it was expected the road might be completed with capital alone. Sect. 17, in which the power to mortgage is given, is as follows: \u201c The ' said company may at any time increase its capital stock to a sum sufficient to complete the road and stock it with every thing necessary to give it full operation and effect, either by opening books for new stock, or by selling such new stock, or by borrowing money on the credit of the company and on mortgage of its charter and works; and the manner in which the same shall be done, in either case, shall be prescribed by the stockholders at a general meeting. . . .\u201d Under these circumstances, it cannot for a moment be doubted that if the legislature had supposed a different rule of taxation was to be applied if the road was built with borrowed money, from what should be if it was built from stock, some mention would have been made of it, and some means provided for determining what was exempt as representing stock, and what taxable as representing debt. Then again, suppose the debt paid off, either by the issue of new stock or the earnings of the road, would the property then be exempt as capital, or taxable because? originally built with borrowed money ?</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Without pursuing this subject further, it is sufficient to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>that we are clearly of the opinion that the road, with all its fixtures, &amp;c., was taxable under the original charter after March 28, 1877, and that, whatever else was exempted as capital stock, this was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">2. As to the \u00bfSect of the acceptance of the eleventh section of the act of 1875, and the payment of taxes thereunder for the years 1875 and 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The claim on the part of the company is, that by the acceptance of this section as an amendment to its charter, a valid contract was entered into between the State and the corporation, regulating the taxation of the company until the year 1885. It is said that the release by the company of the perpetual exemption of its capital stock, and of the exemption of its property until 1877, which were granted by the original charter, was a sufficient consideration for an agreement, on the part of the State, not to tax the company otherwise than according to the accepted eleventh section for ten years, and that a law which provides for taxation in a different manner impairs the obligation of that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The decision of the Supreme Court of the State declaring this section to be invalid, so far as it relates to companies not claiming to be exempt from taxation under their charters, because it does not conform to the constitutional requirement of uniformity, is binding upon us as a construction of a State statute by the highest court of the State. While we are not bound by the decision in the present case, that the section is also invalid as to this company after the expiration of the time to which the exemption of its property was limited by its charter <em>(Jefferson Branch Bank </em>v. Skelly, 1 Black, 436; <em>Bridge Proprietors </em>v. <em>Hoboken </em>Company, 1 Wall. 116), the decision ought not to be overruled, unless it is clearly wrong. The delicate power' which we have, under the Constitution of the United States, over the judgments of the State courts, ought always to be used with the greatest caution, There should be no reversal of such judgments, unless the error is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The Constitution of Tennessee adopted in 1870 requires that all property shall be taxed. After that Constitution went into effect, no valid contract could be made with a corporation for an exemption from taxation. So the courts of Tennessee have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>held, and in so doing have established a rule of decision for us. The property of this company was only exempt by its charter until March 28, 1877. The Constitution did not and could not interfere with this exemption so long as it lasted. This the Supreme Court of the State decided. To that extent the claim of the company was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">If nothing had been done until the charter exemption expired, it is clear that, under the construction which the courts of the State have given the Constitution, no contract for the taxation of the company according to the provisions of the eleventh section of the act of 1875 could have been sustained. The only question, therefore, which remains, is, whether in 1875 the legislature could contract for the surrender of the remaining'charter exemptions by binding the State not to tax the company for ten years in any other manner than that provided for in sect. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The Constitution has subjected all property in the State to the burden of uniform taxation according to its value. \u2022 So the courts of the State have decided. The legislature has no power to contract for relief from this burden. It could not do it for a money consideration, and if not for that, clearly not for any other. This is one of . the disabilities under which the people of the State have placed their government. But for it taxes might have been commuted or they might have been withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">There is no doubt of the power of the legislature to contract with the company for a surrender of its charter exemptions in a way that did not involve a release' from the constitutional mode of taxation after the charter exemption had expired. Such a release is, however, as we think, prohibited by the Constitution, as construed by the highest judicial authority in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">This disposes of the case so far as the Memphis and Charleston company is concerned. It is not contended that the act of 1875, as amended in 1877, transcends the power of taxation allowed by the charter after the exemption of the road and its appurtenances has expired, unless they are protected by the exemption of the capital stock. The Supreme Court of the State enjoined all taxation prior to March 28, 1877, and decreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that the money paid under the provisions of the eleventh, section of the act of 1875 should be allowed as a credit upon the taxes of 1877 and 1878, and the excess, if any, refunded with interest. This, as we think, is all the company can require.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">n. THE MOBILE AND OHIO RAILROAD COMPANY.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">As to this company, the court decided that it was exempt from taxation under its charter until April 22, 1886, and enjoined-the assessment and collection of taxes under the laws of 1875 and 1877 until that date. The further provision of the charter in respect to taxation so as to reduce dividends below eight per cent was not passed upon below, and was not involved in the decision as made. For this reason it cannot be considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">m. THE KNOXVILLE AND CHARLESTON RAILROAD COMPANY.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The court below decided that this company did not by its charter become entitled to the privilege of exemption from taxation, which was granted to the Nashville and Chattanooga Company. If this be so, then the judgment was clearly right,, and no other question need be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The Knoxville and Charleston Company, for the purpose of making and using its road, was invested with all the powers, rights, and privileges of the Nashville and Chattanooga Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">In <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Pegues </em>(16 Wall. 244), we held that the grant to one company of \u201c all the powers, rights, and privileges \u201d of another, carried with it an exemption from taxation; but in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(93 U. S. 217), that such an exemption did not pass by sale of the franchises of a railroad company. In the last case, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court, said, \u201c The franchises of a railroad corporation are rights or privileges which are essential to the operations of the corporation, and without which its road and works would be of little value ; such as the franchise to run cars, to take tolls, to appropriate earth and gravel for the bed of its road, or water for its engines, and the like. They are positive rights and privileges, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the possession of which the road of the company could not be successfully worked. Immunity from taxation is not one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\">This seems to us conclusive of the present case. The grant here was not of all the rights and privileges of the Nashville and Chattanooga Company, but of such as were necessary for the purpose of making and using the road, or, in other words, the franchises of the company which do not include immunity from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">On the whole, we find no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
