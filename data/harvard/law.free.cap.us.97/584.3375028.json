Elgee, deceased, wbo was one of tbe sureties on tbe official bond of Thomas Barrett, collector of tbe customs for the district of New Orleans, in tbe State of Louisiana. It was before tbis court at its October Term, 1873, when tbe judgment of tbe Circuit Court was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaussen, </em>19 Wall. 198. Tbe mandate was filed in tbe court below, Jan. 27, 1875. Tbe bond sued on bears date July 6, 1844, and is conditioned as follows: \u201c Now, therefore, if tbe said Thomas Barrett has truly and faithfully executed and discharged, and shall continue truly and faithfully to execute and discharge, all tbe duties of tbe said office, according to law, then tbe above obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>tion to be void and of none effect; otherwise, it shall abide and remain in full force and virtue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">The United States claimed that the various adjustments of Barrett\u2019s accounts by the accounting officers of the Treasury, from July 25, 1844, to Oct. 12, 1845, showed a balance due by him of $41,376.64, and that his failure to account for and pay over that amount, received by him in his official capacity, constituted a breach of the condition of his bond.

[\u201c That if the bond sued on was ever executed, delivered, and took effect, which is not admitted, then defendant avers that said bond, after its execution, was rendered void and null, so far as said decedent was concerned, for this, that subsequent to its date and during the period of the term of office of Thomas Barrett, as collector of the port of New Orleans, the United States imposed on and exacted of him the performance of duties and the assumption of responsibilities in regard to the receipt, custody, and disbursement of the moneys received in his said capacity as collector aforesaid, different and variant from those duties and responsibilities in that regard legally incumbent upon him as collector aforesaid, at the date of said bond, under the law then existing and in force; that during his said term of office said Barrett was dispensed by the United States from his duty and obligation of paying certain moneys, received by him in his said capacity, to the United States, in the mode required by law, and in lieu thereof was required by the United States to expend and disburse, and under its orders he did actually expend and disburse, during his said official term, a large portion of said moneys, by payments made to collectors and surveyors of other collection districts, and to various other officers of the government; that said Barrett was required by the United States to expend and disburse, and he did, in accordance with its orders, expend and disburse, during his said official term, a large portion of said moneys for the construction of the new marine hospital, and for the maintenance and supply of existing, hospitals and light-houses, and of vessels'of the revenue and naval service, and for other purposes entirely beyond the scope of his duties as collector aforesaid, and as fixed and defined by law; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that said Barrett was required by the United States, in his said capacity as collector aforesaid, to receive and disburse, and did actually during his said official term receive and disburse, under its said requirements, large sums of money Avhich he was not required by law to receive and disburse in his said capacity \u00bfs collector; \u2014 all of which appears by the account filed by the plaintiff herein. And defendant charges that the duties and risks and responsibilities of said Barrett as collector aforesaid,, without the consent of said decedent, were varied, enlarged, and changed by the United States, subsequent to the date of said bond and during his official term, whereby the liability of said decedent as surety on said bond, if ever it existed, was avoided and discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-5\">3. \u201c That the said Thomas Barrett departed this life about the year 1846, in New Orleans, having a large real and personal estate, consisting in property and assets, more than sufficient to pay the amount of plaintiff\u2019s demand; that if the United States had a A'alid claim against said Barrett, it had the right of priority of payment on such property and assets, which it neglected to enforce, and lost; that upon said bond are signatures Avhich purport to be those of Frangois Delery, Sylvain Peyroux, Lucien Hermann, M. B-. Cantrelle; that all of said parties are dead; that each died leaving a large and valuable estate, more than enough to pay the amount claimed in this suit; that if the United States had a valid claim against said Barrett and said Frangois Delery, Sylvain Peyroux, Lucien Hermann, and M. B. Cantrelle, it had the right of priority of payment of said demand out of each and all of said estates, Avhich it neglected to enforce, and lost, Avhereby the lia,bilityr of said J. K.

Tbe defendant\u2019s testator was a surety in tbe bond; but that is an immaterial fact in tbe case, for nothing is plainer than the rule that a surety in a bond is liable to the same extent to which his principal is liable, by force of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A general denial having been interposed to the plaintiff\u2019s petition, the defendant added two special pleas, which, upon motion, the Circuit Court ordered to be stricken out, and this order is now assigned as error. An. examination of the pleas, stricken out, however, satisfies us that they were plainly impertinent. They aver nothing that constitutes either a total or even a partial defence. The second alleges, in effect, laches on the part of the government, in failing to assert its claim against other sureties in the bond, whereby, it is averred, the liability of defendant\u2019s testator, if it ever existed, was discharged. But laches of the officers or agents of the government is confessedly no bar to the assertion of its rights. This is admitted by the plaintiff in error, and it has not been contended in argument, as it could not have been successfully, that delay or neglect in prosecuting its claims against the co-sureties of the defendant\u2019s testator is any bar to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The first special plea<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires a more minute examination. It was, in effect, that the obligation of the bond had been discharged, not directly, but because the principal obligor had been required to perform, and had performed, duties additional to those which pertained by law to his office when the bond was made. It does not aver that the additional duties changed the character of the office, or increased the responsibility of the collector for the money received by him as collector of customs. How, then, the requisition of duties not inconsistent with accounting for and paying over money received by him as collector of customs can operate to release his bond is quite incomprehensible. If it be conceded, as it may be, that the addition of duties different in their nature from those which belonged to the office when the official bond was given will not impose upon an obligor in the bond, as such, additional responsibilities, it is undoubtedly true that such an addition of new duties does not render void the bond of the officer as a security for the performance of the duties at first assumed. It will still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>remain a security for what it was originally given to secure. And it is noticeable that most of the allegations in the plea of extra-official expenditures and disbursements required of the collector (for example, payments to other collectors and sur-. veyors of other collection districts, payments to other government officers, payments for the construction of a new marine hospital, and for the maintenance and supply of existing hospitals and light-houses and vessels of the revenue and naval service), are averments of conduct and requirements which the collector was under legal obligations to observe and obey when the bond in suit was made. The act of Congress of March 2, 1799, c. 2, sect. 21 (1 Stat. 644), made it the duty of collectors to \u201c pay to the order of the officer who shall be authorized to direct the payment thereof, the whole of the moneys which they may respectively receive \u201d by virtue of the act. All payments and disbursements of money received by the collector in his official capacity, if made as charged in the plea, by direction of the government, were, therefore, strictly within, the range of his official duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The remaining reason given by the plea in support of the averment that the bond had been avoided is, that the collector was, during his official term, required to receive and disburse-large sums of money which the law did not require him to receive and disburse as collector, as appeared by the official accounts filed by the plaintiff in the suit. But how that fact, if it was a fact, could operate, even in favor of a surety, to release him from the obligation of the official bond, we find ourselves unable to perceive. Such an effect has not been claimed in the argument for the plaintiff in error. It is doubtless true that neither the surety nor his principal is responsible, by virtue of the bond, for money which the collector received, not as collector, \u2014 money which his office did- hot require him to receive or disburse; but this suit was brought to enforce no such responsibility. The surety may not be liable for a failure of his principal to account for such money; yet if he is not, it does not follow that he is not bound by his bond to respond for his principal\u2019s default to account for money received in his official character. Requiring a person who is a collector of customs to receive a sum of money and apply it in discharge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>some liability of tbe government entirely outside of his ordinary employment, for example, to pay debentures, may impose a new duty upon him, but it leaves his office, as collector, untouched and his accountability in it unimpaired. This is quite consistent with the doctrine which we admit, that if, after an official bond has been signed, the nature of the office be changed by law, the bond ceases to be obligatory. In such a case the office is no longer the same, within the meaning of the bond.. <em>Converse </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 21 How. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">It follows from these considerations that neither of the special pleas set up any thing which amounted to a defence to the action. The facts averred exhibited no discharge of the defendant\u2019s testator from the obligation of the bond, nor did they tend to show that he was not responsible for the collector\u2019s neglect to account for and pay over whatever money he had received as collector. There was no error, therefore, in striking out the pleas as impertinent, and in refusing to receive evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Holding this opinion, we are not called upon to inquire whether the money received and disbursed by the collector, \u201c as appearing by the official accounts filed by the plaintiff in' the suit,\u201d was all money which it was his duty to receive and disburse as collector. And we are not to be understood as assenting to the claim that some part of it was not. On this subject see <em>Broome </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>15 How. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The next assignment of error requiring attention is, that the court refused to charge the jury, if they found from the evidence the \u2019 Secretary of the Treasury required the collector to use the money received by him in the redemption of treasury notes, that such requirement was an important and material change of the duties, functions, and employment of the collector as required by law, and discharged the sureties in his official bond from all liability for his subsequent official misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Enough has already been said to show that such a charge should not have been given. By the act of 1799, to which we have referred, it was made the official duty of the collector to pay the public money in his hands to the order, or according to the direction of the officer authorized to direct the payment thereof. Payment of treasury notes, therefore, in pursuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of tbe order of tbe Secretary, was directly in tbe line of tbe collector\u2019s duty as sucb an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The same remarks are applicable to the refusal of tbe court to affirm tbe second point proposed by tbe defendant as instruction to tbe jury. It would bave .been error bad sucb instruction been given. While it may be true that no law specifically imposed upon the collector tbe duty of making disbursements for any marine hospital, or for tbe ligbt-bouses or revenue-cutters, it is not true that sucb duties \u201c were extra-official as to tbe office of collector,\u201d if tbe payments were ordered by tbe Secretary of tbe Treasury; for tbe collector was bound to pay to bis order, as we have seen. Nor could tbe court bave affirmed that money furnished to tbe collector from tbe treasury of tbe United States, or from sources other than tbe proper receipts and collections, must be shown by the plaintiff to bave been necessary to cover tbe disbursements proper to tbe office of tbe collector, or that it was furnished for that purpose. As tbe law was when tbe bond was executed, tbe government was authorized to furnish money to collectors for certain purposes, on their requisition. But apart from this, when tbe proposition was submitted to the court, tbe treasury transcript was in evidence. By law it made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, and tbe burden of proof, instead of being upon the plaintiff, was on tbe defendant to disprove it. Besides,- it was proven by tbe transcript, and by tbe accounts furnished to tbe department by the collector, that tbe money be bad received from other sources than collection of customs bad all been expended in the payment of debentures, with tbe sanction of tbe Treasury Department. To this there was no contradictory evidence. The point proposed by the defendant was, therefore, wholly inapplicable to tbe case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Tbe remaining assignment is that tbe court refused to affirm tbe third point in tbe words in which it was proposed. But tbe court did affirm it in substance, and even more broadly than it was presented. Tbe court charged tbe jury, \u201c that, in order to recover tbe balance brought down in tbe present action, it is incumbent on tbe government to prove, to tbe satisfaction of tbe jury, that tbe said balance brought down resulted from the failure of tbe said Barrett (tbe collector) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>account for the funds which came into his hands as collector, and within the scope of his official duties in that office, and his failure to perform his duty in respect to such funds, and not from his failure to account for funds received from the treasury for the extra-judicial purposes, and his failure to perform his duty in respect to such funds.\u201d This was an unqualified direction, not dependent upon what the jury might believe to be proved by the evidence. It was, therefore, more than. the defendant asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The case requires nothing further. The plaintiff has recovered a judgment for the sum which the principal obligor in the bond admitted to be due from him as collector. The judgment includes nothing except an unpaid balance of duties collected, and we discover no error in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> <em>Supra, </em>p. 585.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
