An act of the legislature of Massachusetts, passed Feb. 1, 1828, to incorporate the Boston Beer Company, \u201c for the purpose of manufacturing malt liquors in all their varieties,\u201d declared that the company should have all the powers and privileges, and be subject to all the duties and requirements, contained in an act passed March 3,1809, entitled \u201c An Act defining the general powers and duties of manufacturing corporations,\u201d and the several acts in addition thereto. Said act of 1809 had this clause: <em>\u201cProvided cdways, </em>that the legislature may from time to time, upon due notice to any corporation, make further provisions and regulations for the management of the business of the corporation and for the government thereof, or wholly to repeal any act or part thereof, establishing any corporation, as shall be deemed expedient.\u201d In 1829, an act repealing that of 1809, and all acts in addition thereto, and reserving similar power, was passed. Under the prohibitory liquor law of 1869, certain malt liquors belonging to the company were seized as it was transporting them to its place of business in said State, with intent there to sell them, and they were declared forfeited. <em>Held, </em>1. That the provisions of the act of 1809, touching the power reserved by the legislature, having been adopted in the charter, were a part of the contract between the State and the company, rendering the latter subject to the exercise of that power. 2. That the contract so contained in the charter was not affected by the \u2022 repeal of that act, nor was its obligation impaired by the prohibitory liquor law of 1869.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-7\">2. The company, under it's charter, has no greater right to manufacture or sell malt liquors than individuals possess, nor is it exempt from any legislative control therein to w'hich they are subject.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-9\">3. All rights are held subject to the police power of a State; and, if the public safety or the public morals require the discontinuance of any manufacture or traffic, the legislature may provide for its discontinuance, notwithstanding individuals or corporations may thereby suffer inconvenience.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-11\"><em>4. </em>As the police power of a State extends to the protection of the lives, health, and property of her citizens, the maintenance of good order, and the preservation of the public morals, the legislature cannot, by any contract, devest itself of the power to provide for these objects.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-13\">5. While the court does not assert that property actually in existence, and in which the right of the owner has become vested when a law was passed, may, under its provisions, be taken for the public good without due compensation, nor lay down any rule at variance with its decisions in regard to the paramount authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States, relating to the regulation of commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, or otherwise, it reaffirms its decision in <em>Barlemeyer </em>v. <em>Iowa </em>(18 Wall. 129), that, as a measure of police regulation, a State law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not repugnant to any clause of that Constitution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b40-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>6. It appearing from the record that the point, that the prohibitory liquor law of 1809 impaired the obligation of the contract contained in the charter of the company, was made on the trial of the case, and decided adversely to the company, and was afterwards carried, by bill of exceptions, to the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, where the rulings of the lower court were affirmed, this court has jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-3\">Error to the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\">This was a proceeding in the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, for the forfeiture of certain malt liquors, belonging to the Boston Beer Company, and which had been seized as it was transporting them to its place of business in said countjr; with intent there to sell them in violation of an act of the legislature of Massachusetts, passed June 19, 1869, c. 415, commonly known as the Prohibitory Liquor Law. The company claimed that, under its charter, granted in 1828, it had the right to manufacture and sell said liquors; and that said law impaired the obligation of the contract contained in that charter, and was void, so far as the liquors in question were concerned. The court refused to charge the jury to that effect, and a verdict was found against the claimant. The rulings of the Superior Court having been affirmed' by the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth, the company brought the case here. The statutes of Massachusetts bearing on the case are referred to in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-5\"><em>Mr. IT. W.

(Mass.) 53), be \u201c.the power vested in the legislature by the Constitution to make, ordain, and establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes, and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not repugnant to the Constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of the Commonwealth and the subjects of the sam\u00e9,\u201d the taxing power is clearly of that character. If the legislature may, as the adjudged cases affirm, grant an immunity from taxation, and thus part with that power, why may it not with any other? It cannot, in the pretended exercise of the police power, violate, without a breach of the Constitution, the provisions of an existing charter, nor, under the guise of regulating, take from a corporation any of its essential chartered rights and privileges. Cooley, Const. Lim. 576, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-7\">The company does not invoke the aid of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, but submits that the statute of 1869, under which the liquor was seized and condemned, impairs the obligation of the contract contained in its charter, and is therefore unconstitutional and void.

The State may, therefore, in the exercise of her police power, subject the company to the same restraints in the use of its property as may be imposed upon natural persons. <em>Bartemeyer v.

Justice Bradley</author>\n<p id=\"A0l\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The question raised in this case is, whether the charter of the plaintiff, which was granted in 1828, contains any contract the obligation of which was impaired by the prohibitory liquor law of Massachusetts, passed in 1869, as applied to the liquor in question in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Some question is made by the defendant in error whether the point was properly raised in the State courts, so as to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the subject of decision-by the highest court of the State. It is contended that, although it was raised by plea, in the municipal court, yet, that plea being demurred to, and the demurrer being sustained, the defence was abandoned, and the only issue on which the parties went to trial was the general denial of the truth of the complaint. But whatever may be the correct course of proceeding in the practice of courts of Massachusetts, \u2014 a matter which it is not our province to investigate, \u2014 it is apparent from the record that the very point now sought to be argued was made on the trial of the cause in the Superior Court, and was passed upon, and made decisive of the controversy, and was afterwards carried by bill of exceptions to the Supreme Judicial Court, and was decided there adverse to the plaintiff in error on the very ground on which it seeks a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The Supreme Court, in its rescript, expressly decides as follows: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u201c Exceptions overruled for the reasons following: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u201cThe act of 1869, c. 415, does not impair the obligations of the contract contained in the charter of the claimant, so far as it relates to the sale of malt liquors, but is binding on the claimant to the same extent as on individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u201cThe act is in the nature of a police regulation in regard to the sale of a certain article of property, and is applicable to the sale of such property by individuals and corporations, even where the charter of the corporation cannot be altered or repealed by the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The judgment of the Superior Criminal Court was entered in conformity to this rescript, declaring the liquors forfeited to the Commonwealth, and that a warrant issue for the disposal of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">This is sufficient for our jurisdiction, and we are bound to consider the question which is thus raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">As before stated, the charter of the plaintiff in error was granted in 1828, by an act of the legislature passed on the 1st of February in that year, entitled \u201c An Act to incorporate the Boston Beer Company.\u201d This act consisted of two sections. By the first, it was enacted that certain persons (named), their successors and assigns, \u201c be, and they hereby are, made a corporation, by the name of The Boston Beer Company, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>purpose of manufacturing malt liquors in all tlieir varieties, in the city of Boston, and for that purpose shall have all the powers and privileges, and be subject to all the duties and requirements, contained in an act passed on the third day of March, A.D. 1809, entitled \u2018 An Act defining the general powers and duties of manufacturing corporations,\u2019 and the several acts in addition thereto.\u201d The second section gave the company power to hold \u2022 such real and personal property to certain amounts, as might be found necessary and convenient for carrying on the manufacture of malt liquors in the city of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The general manufacturing act of 1809, referred to in the charter, had this clause, as a proviso of the seventh section thereof: \u201c <em>Provided </em>always, that the legislature may from time to time, upon due notice to any corporation, make further provisions and regulations for the management of the business of the corporation and for the government thereof, or wholly to repeal any act or part thereof, establishing any7 corporation, as shall be deemed expedient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">A substitute for this act was passed in 1829, which repealed thfe act of 1809 and all acts in addition thereto, with this qualification: \u201c But this repeal shall not affect the existing rights of any7 person, or the existing or future liabilities of any corporation, or any7- members of any7 corporation now established, until such corporation shall have adopted this act, and complied with the provisions herein contained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">It thus appears that the charter of the company7, by adopting the jorovisions of the act of 1809, became subject to a reserved power of the legislature to make further provisions and regulations for the management of the business \u2022 of the corporation and for the government thereof, or wholly7 to repeal the act, or any7 part thereof, establishing the corporation. This reservation of the power was a part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">But it is contended by the company7 that the repeal of the act of 1809 by the act of 1829 was a revocation or surrender of this reserved power.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">We cannot so regard it. The charter of the company adopted the provisions of the act of 1809, as a portion of itself; and those provisions remained a part of the charter, notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>standing the subsequent repeal of the act. The act of 1829 reserved a similar power to amend or repeal that act, at the pleasure of the -legislature, and declared that all corporations established under it should cease and expire at the same time, when the act should be repealed. It can hardly be supposed that the legislature, when it reserved such plenary powers over the corporations to be organized under the new act, intended to relinquish all its powers over the corporations organized under or subject to the provisions of the former act. The qualificar tion of the repeal of the act of 1809, before referred to, seems to be intended not only to continue the existence of the corporations subject to it in the enjoyment of all their privileges, but subject to all their liabilities, of which the reserved legislative control was one.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">If this view is correct, the- legislature of Massachusetts had reserved complete power to pass any law it saw fit, which might affect the powers of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">But there is another question in the case, which, as it seems to us, is equally decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The plaintiff in error was incorporated \u201c for the purpose of manufacturing malt liquors in.all their varieties,\u201d it is true; and the right to manufacture, undoubtedly, as the plaintiff\u2019s counsel contends, included the incidental right to dispose of the liquors manufactured. But although this right or capacity was thus granted in th\u00e9 most unqualified form, it cannot be construed as conferring any greater or more sacred right than any citizen had to manufacture malt liquor; nor as exempting the corporation from any control therein, to which a citizen would be subject, if the interests of the community should require it. If the-public safety or the public morals require the discontinuance of any manufacture' or traffic, the hand of' the legislature cannot be stayed from providing for its discontinuance, by any incidental inconvenience which individuals or corporations may suffer. . All rights are held subject to the police power of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We do not mean to say that property actually in existence, and in which the right of the owner has become vested, may be taken for the public good without due compensation. But Ave infer that the liquor in this case, as in the case of <em>Barte</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>meyer </em>v. <em>Iowa </em>(18 Wall. 129), was not in existence when the liquor law of Massachusetts was passed. Had the plaintiff in error relied on the existence of the property prior to the law, it behooved it to show that fact. But no such fact is shown, and no such point is taken. The plaintiff in error boldly takes the ground that,-being a corporation, it has a right, by contract, to' manufacture and sell beer for ever, notwithstanding and in spite of any exigencies which may occur, in the morals or the health of the community, requiring such manufacture to cease. We do not so understand the rights of the plaintiff. The legislature had no power to confer any such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Whatever differences of opinion may exist as to the extent and boundaries of the police power, and however difficult it may be to render a satisfactory definition of it, there seems to be no doubt that it does extend to the protection of the lives, health, and property of the citizens, and to the preservation of good order and the public morals. The legislature cannot, by any contract, divest itself of the power to provide for these objects. They belong emphatically to that class of objects which demand the application of the maxim, <em>salus populi suprema lex ; </em>and they are to be attained and provided for by such appropriate means as the legislative discretion may devise. That discretion can no more be bargained away than the power itself. <em>Boyd </em>v. Alabama, 94 U. S. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Since we have already held, in the case of <em>Bartemeyer </em>v. Iowa, that as a measure of police regulation, looking to the preservation of public morals, a State law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not repugnant to any clause of the Constitution of the United States, we see nothing in the. present case that can afford any sufficient ground for disturbing the decision of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Of course, we do not mean to lay down any rule at variance with what this court has decided with regard to the paramount authority of the Constitution and laws of the United. States, relating to the regulation of commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, or otherwise. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>12 Wheat. 419: <em>License Cases, </em>5 How. 504; <em>Passenger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Cases, </em>7 id. 283; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Mayor of New York, </em>92 U.
