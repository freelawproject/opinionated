If at any time there should be a deficiency of cargo for government or other account, freight will be taken, if procurable, from other parties, and a due share of any freight so carried will be credited to the State. In a business such as that now sought to be inaugurated, it is manifestly impossible to provide for all contingencies which may arise: all I can at present do is to indicate the chief aims, objects, and conditions.

The government will pay their share of the costs and outfit of such steamers by cotton-warrants (Manchester issue), at par, and the working expenses of such steamers will be paid by the respective owners, in their due proportion; that is, one-fourth of the working expenses will be paid by the government of North Carolina, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>three-fourths hy the other owners; and if from any sufficient cause it should be deemed prudent to sell any of the steamers, the net proceeds of such sale, or any money earned, in the shape of freight, will be duly credited in like proportion. Under this contract the \u201cHansa\u201d and the \u201cDon,\u201d both most excellent boats, now running between Wilmington and the islands, will, on next arriving at the islands, be made over to the Stale, in the proportion of one-fourth interest in each; and these steamers will be charged, \u00a320,000 sterling for the \u201c Hansa,\u201d and \u00a320,000 sterling for the \u201c Don,\u201d this being the estimated total cost price of each at the islands, and considerably under the. estimated value. Another screw-steamer, similar to the \u201c Ceres,\u201d will be ready for sea in about four weeks, and in about two month's the. fourth will be despatched. By this arrangement, the chief objects sought to be obtained are,\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">\u201c \u2018 <em>First, </em>To supply railway iron and rolling-stock, and such other articles as may be needed by the State, at a moderate rate of freight, and in regular quantities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">\u201c \u2018 Second, To run out regularly a quantity of. cotton for the State, to enable it to benefit from the very high prices ruling here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">\u201c \u2018 Third, To reduce the risk of capture as much as possible by dividing the interest of the government over four or more steamers. In order to secure the greater economy, and the more efficient working facilities, the working management of the steamers will rest in the hands of Alexander Collie &amp; Co., who, as representing the larger proportion, will appoint the captains and officers; but no important steps, such as disposing of any of the steamers, or replacing any of them, or adding to their number, will be undertaken without the full knowledge and consent of Mr. White, the special commissioner here. Under this arrangement, the parties interested will have the benefit of a well-trained and experienced staff of men, at all points, and the government of the State, on its part, will give all the aid in its power to the efficient working of the business now. inaugurated. It will give all the aid it can do to get transportation of cotton from the interior when required, and it will guarantee the undertaking from any restrictions or impediments being thrown in the way of full cargoes being obtained for each steamer of cotton or other produce with the least possible delay. The inward carrying-power of the steamer from the islands will be at the service of the State, at the rate of \u00a35 per ton, payable at the islands, for railway iron and rolling-stock (one-fourth of which will be duly credited to the State as its interest), and arrangements will be made immediately to lay down one thousand tons of railway iron at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>islands for this purpose. For fine goods, the rate will be \u00a330 per ton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">\u201c1 The government of the State will be the owners of outward cargo to the extent of one-fourth. Their cargoes will be purchased by the agents of Alexander Collie &amp; Co., subject to the inspection, of the government of the State, who will be debited for one-fourth of the amount, and on safe arrival in England one-fourth of the proceeds will be duly credited to the State. The commission chargeable on this business will be the usual one of two .and a half\u2019 per cent on purchases and realizing, and five per cent on ships\u2019 disbursements, in addition to the usual brokerage, and such charges as incurred at the islands for transshipment and storing. The government will of course have the option of putting on board their own shares of the cotton; but for many reasons this is hardly desirable. If they do so, however, the buying commission of two and a half per cent will be avoided. In eases when Alexander Collie &amp; Co. come under cash advances for account of the State (in place of putting the cotton-warrants in the market), Alexander Collie <em>&amp; </em>Co. will be entitled to a further commission of two and a half per cent for the amount of such advance, \u2014 interest at the rate of five per cent to be charged, and the same rate to be allowed when there is cash in hand.

Those only who unlawfully gave \u201c aid or comfort to the rebellion \u201d were intended to be affected with a disability to recover the proceeds of their captured property. The only question here is as to the legal character and quality of the claimant\u2019s acts. This court cannot attribute criminality or\u2019 illegality to an act where the law imputes none <em>(The Louis, </em>2 Dod. 249; <em>The Antelope, </em>10 Wheat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>66); and it would be a monstrous conclusion, that he is to suffer the loss of his property for acts which, in judgment of law, are neither criminal nor illegal. The acts of Collie were not offences against the law of nations, nor crimes or offences nder the municipal law of the United States. The United States had no international right to punish him, or affect him with the actual or potential forfeiture, or appropriation, of this property, on account of any thing he did during the hostilities. His acts involved, under the public law, only a certain fixed penalty; and the United States, without transcending their power under the law of nations, and an infraction of their international obligations to him and his sovereign, could not, directly or indirectly, annex to them any other penal consequences whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">IV.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-6\">In development of the foregoing propositions, we submit the following: \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-7\">1. Collie is a native-born British subject. Throughout the hostilities, he was' domiciled in his own country. His international <em>status </em>was that of a neutral. His cotton, warehoused .on land, in Savannah, in December, 1864, was <em>de jure </em>and <em>de facto </em>neutral property. In respect to this cotton, he was not an enemy, <em>de jure </em>or <em>de </em>facto, in any sense known to publicists. If captured at sea, independently of breach of blockade, it could not have been confiscated, in a prize court, as actually or constructively the property of an enemy of the United States. <em>The Venus, </em>8 Cranch, 253; Twiss, Law of Nations, War, 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-8\">2. The act of March 12, 1863, is to be so interpreted and applied, as far as its language admits, as not to be inconsistent with the comity of nations, or the established rules of international law, as understood in this country. All general terms must be narrowed in construction so as to harmonize the statute with the public law. <em>The Charming Betsy, </em>2 Cranch, 64; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>id. 358; <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Seeman, </em>1 id. 1; Maxwell on Statutes, 122; <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Keyn, </em>Law Rep. 2 Ex. D. 63, 85, 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-9\">3. The subjects of neutral States were entitled, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>public law, to stand, with respect to their captured property, upon the same footing, at least, with the inhabitants of the hostile territory, who, in judgment of law, were public enemies of the United States. <em>The Prize Cases, </em>2 Black, 687; <em>Mrs. Alexander's Cotton, </em>2 Wall. 419. It was not competent, therefore, for the United States, while providing for the restoration of the captured property of the latter, to appropriate like property of the former. \u2022 Such discrimination would be a breach of. the comity of nations, and a violation of the established principles of international law. The act of March 12, 1868, must be so construed, if possible, as to avoid such a result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-5\">4. By the operation of that statute, and the proclamations of pardon and amnesty, as they have been given effect by this court, the United States have restored, or provided for the restoration of, the proceeds of the captured property of their enemies, rebel-enemies, and traitors in the late civil war. If, therefore, this court should finally declare that the United States have, in effect, discriminated, by this legislation, against the subjects or citizens of friendly foreign States, whose property fell under the operation of the Captured Property Act, it would be for their governments to enforce their rights by international reclamation against the United States. Rutherford\u2019s Institutes, vol. ii. bk. 2, c. 9, sect. 19 ; Wheaton\u2019s Life of Pinkney, pp. 193, 372; 2 Phill. Int. Law, 4 <em>et seq.; Lamar </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>92 U. S. 187.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">5. The modern public law discountenances and condemns as barbarous the capture and appropriation, as booty of war, of private commercial property, warehoused on land, in territory, like the city of Savannah in December, 1864, in the firm and safe occupation, control, and government of the. invading belligerent. 1 Kent, Com. 92; Twiss, Law of Nations, War, sects. 64, 65; Mr. Dana\u2019s note on Distinction between Enemy\u2019s Property at Sea and on Land, Wheaton, p. 451, also p. <em>439; </em>Bluntschli, Le Droit International Codif., sect. 656; Ortolan, Diplomatic de la Mer, liv. iii. c. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-7\">6. This court has said that Congress recognized in this statute the enlightened maxims of the modern public law in regard to the immunity of private property on land from capture as booty of war, and that these captures were made, not for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>booty, but to cripple the enemy. <em>United States </em>v. Padelford, 9 Wall. 531; <em>United States </em>v. Klein, 13 id. 128; <em>Haycraft </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 22 id. 81. The statute, in this view, has been expressly held to be a remedial statute, \u201crequiring such a. liberal construction as will give effect to the beneficent.intention of Congress.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Padelford, supra. </em>It must' receive, therefore, in every case, such an equitable interpretation as will prevent a failure of the remedy. 1 Kent, Com. 465.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">7. This court cannot now decide that the capture worked a confiscation of this property, and divested absolutely the title 'and interest of the owner, without overruling all it has ever said in regard to this species of property. The solemn and explicit language of the court is, \u201c that the title to the proceeds of property which came to the possession of the government by capture, with the exceptions already noticed, was in no case divested out of the original owner.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klein, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">8. The <em>status </em>of this species of property was absolutely determined by the will of Congress, as expressed in the act of March 12,1863. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>8 Cranch, 110. And \u00a1the adjudicated law of this court is, that the proceeds of property taken into the' custody of public officers, under that act, were impressed with a trust in favor of the former owners, and that the remedy provided for their recovery was granted, therefore, not as a matter of favor, but in performance of a duty devolving upon the government. Upon all sound principles of interpretation, therefore, the most liberal construction must be placed upon the grant of the remedy of which the words of the statute are susceptible. Vattel, bk. 2, c. 17, sect. 307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-7\">9. The manifest policy and purpose of the statute were to impose a disability to reclaim and recover the proceeds of this species of property upon those only who committed the municipal offence of treason, or of giving aid or comfort to the rebellion, as defined by the statutes of the United States. The distinction meant to be made was between those whom the rules of international law classed as enemies; and those only who violate their allegiance were intended to be affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>with the statutory disability. <em>Mrs. Alexander\u2019s </em>Cotton, 2 Wall. 404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">10. The words of the third section of the act of 1863, under consideration, are words of technical signification in the jurisprudence of the United States, and import the political crime of treason as known to the criminal law of the country. 2 Burr\u2019s Trial, 401; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Greathouse et </em>al., 4 Sawyer, 472; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>5 Wheat. 76; <em>United States </em>v. Palmer, 3 id. 610; <em>Carlisle, v. United States, </em>16 Wall. 147. The claimant never committed this or any other criminal offence against the United States'. He never, therefore, gave \u201c aid or comfort to the reb\u00e9llion,\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">11. This court, in a long line of solemn adjudications, has, in effeet, declared that the interpretation we place upon these words is the true' one, and that those only who were amenable to the laws of the United States prescribing punishment for treason and for giving aid and comfort to the rebellion, and violated those laws, are to be deemed affected by this statutory penal disability. The court has construed the statute as a penal fulmination against those who were guilty of participation in the treason of the rebellion. The disability has been adjudged to be directly annexed to the offence of giving aid and comfort to the rebellion, and as a penalty for that offence; otherwise it could never have been held removable by pardon, so as to give the pardoned claimant a standing in the Court of Claims. <em>Mrs. Alexander\u2019s Cotton, United States </em>v. <em>Padelford, United States </em>v. <em>Klein, Carlisle </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Armstrong </em>v. <em>United States, </em>13 Wall. 154; <em>Pargoud </em>v. <em>United States, </em>id. 156.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">12. Upon no other view, as applied to the subjects of foreign States, is the statute conformable to the principles of international law, the rules of natural justice, or the general doctrines of the municipal jurisprudence of the United States and other civilized nations. The United States had no international right to subject citizens of foreign States, not amenable to their jurisdiction, to the treatment received by their domestic criminals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Y. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-5\">If it shall be held that the claimant has been excluded from the benefits of the act of March 12, 1868, by reason or on account of his acts during the war, such exclusion can be regarded in no other light than as a punishment for such acts; and thus constitutes them, however wrongfully, offences ^against the United States. It was competent for the President to relieve him from such, punishment, and he did so by his proclamation of general amnesty of Dec. 25,1868. 15 Stat. 712.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-6\">The power of the President to pardon is coextensive with that of Congress to punish, and includes as well the remission of penalties and forfeitures, as the removal of disabilities annexed to the commission of offences against the United States. <em>United States </em>v. Wilson, 7 Pet. 150; <em>Ex parte Wells, </em>18 How. 307.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-7\"><em>Mr. Attorney-General Eevens </em>and <em>Mr. Assistant-Attorney-General Smith, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-8\">I.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-9\">While conceding the recognition of belligerent rights as belonging to both parties during .the late civil war, we do not overlook the important qualification that the United States did not, by recognition of the insurgents as belligerents, abridge any of its sovereign powers, but merely waived their assertion .as to .persons engaged in rebellion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-10\">Because of this state of belligerency, the United States possessed the right of capture.

It applied to such property as this was, from its very nature and situation, irrespective of ownership. Had its nature been different, the United States possessed the right to treat it as enemy property, if it belonged to an alien who, by the gift of money and guns to its foes, and by entering into partnership with them, had constituted himself, in fact, an enemy also; so that he could no longer rightfully claim to be considered as a neutral, even though his country were so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-9\">The capture and retention of the property by the United States was justified on the triple ground of its ownership, its nature, and the character of the transactions in it. <em>Miller </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>United States, </em>11 Wall. 311, 312; <em>The Prize Cases, </em>2 Black, 674; <em>Kennett </em>v.

It is equally beyond doubt that, during the war, cotton, found within the Confederate territory, though the private property of non-combatants, was a legitimate subject of capture by the national forces. We have many times so decided, and always without dissent. <em>Mrs. Alexander's Cotton, </em>2 Wall. 404; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Padelford, </em>9 id. 531; <em>Sprott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>20 id. 459; <em>Haycraft </em>v. <em>United States, </em>22 id. 81; <em>Lamar </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>92 U. S. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The authority for the capture was not derived from any particular act of Congress, but from the character of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>erty, \u2014 it being \u201c potentially an auxiliary \u201d of tbe enemy, and constituting a means by which they hoped and expected to perpetuate their power. As was well said by the late Chief Justice in Mrs. Alexander\u2019s case <em>Qsupra), </em>where, this question first arose: \u201cBeing enemies\u2019 property, the cotton was liable to capture and confiscation by the adverse party. It is true that this rule, as to property on land, has received very important qualifications from usage, from reasonings of enlightened publicists, and from judicial decisions. It may now be regarded as substantially restricted \u2018to special cases, dictated by the necessary operation of the war,\u2019 and as excluding, in general, \u2018 the seizure of the private property of pacific persons for the sake of gain.\u2019 The commanding general may determine in what special cases its more stringent application is required by military emergencies; while considerations of public policy and positive provisions of law, and the general spirit of legislation, must indicate the cases in which its application may be properly denied to the property of non-combatant enemies. In the case before us, the capture seems to have been justified by the peculiar character of the property, and by legislation. It is well known that cotton has constituted the chief reliance of tbe rebels for means to purchase the munitions of war in Europe. It is a matter of history that, rather than permit it to come into the possession of the national troops, the rebel government has everywhere devoted it, however owned, to destruction. The value of that destroyed at New Orleans, just before its capture, has been estimated at $80,000,000. . . . The rebels regard it as one of their main sinews of war; and no principle of equity or just policy required, when the national occupation was itself precarious, that it should be spared from capture, and allowed to remain, in case of the withdrawal of the Union troops, an element of strength to the rebellion.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">No better evidence can be found of the value of cotton as an element of strength to the insurgents than is contained in this record. It there appears that the \u201c chief requirement \u201d of the Confederate government from abroad was warlike supplies, and that an outward cargo of cotton of one-fourth the carrying capacity of a vessel would pay for a full inward cargo of muni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>tions of war, and leave a \u201c very large surplus \u201d to the credit of that government.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">As war is necessarily a trial of strength between the belligerents, the ultimate object of each, in every movement, must be to lessen the strength of his adversary, or add to his own. As a rule, whatever is necessary to accomplish this end is lawful ; and, as between the belligerents, each determines for himself what is necessary. If, in so doing, he offends against the accepted laws of nations, he must answer in his political capacity to other nations for the wrong he does. If he oversteps the bounds which limit the power of belligerents in legitimate warfare, as understood by civilized nations, other nations may join his enemy, and enter the conflict against him. If, in the course of his operations, he improperly interferes with the person or property of a non-combatant subject of a neutral power, that power may redress the wrongs of its subject. But an aggrieved enemy must look alone for his. indemnity to the terms upon which he agrees to close the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">All property within enemy territory is in law enemy property, just as all persons in the same territory are enemies. A neutral, owning property within the enemy\u2019s lines, holds it as enemy property, subject to the laws of war; and, if it is hostile property, subject to capture. It has never been doubted that arms and munitions of war, however owned, may be seized by the conquering belligerent upon conquered territory. The reason is that, if left, they may, upon a reverse of the fortunes of war, help to strengthen the adversary. To cripple him, therefore, they may be captured, if necessary; and whether necessary. or not, must be determined by the commanding general, unless restrained by the orders of his government, which alone is his superior. The same rule applies to all hostile property.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The rightful capture of movable property on land transfers the title to the government of the captor as soon as the capture is complete, and it is complete when reduced to \u201cfirm possession.\u201d There is no necessity for judicial condemnation. In this respect, captures on land differ from those at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The government of the United States, in passing the Abandoned and Captured Property Act, availed itself of its just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>rights as a belligerent, and at the same time recognized to the fullest extent its duties under the enlightened principles of modern warfare. The capture of cotton, and certain other products peculiar to the soil of the Confederacy, had become one of the actual necessities of the war. In no other way could the resources of the enemy be so effectually crippled. In fact, as was said in <em>Lamar </em>v. <em>Browne (supra), </em>\u201c It is not too much ,to say that the life of the Confederacy depended as much upon its. cotton as it did upon its men.\u201d \u201c It [cotton] was the foundation upon which the hopes of the rebellion were built.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Under such circumstances, it might have been destroyed, if necessary, as it often was by the insurgents; but as the destruction of property should always be avoided, if possible, Congress provided for its capture, preservation, and sale. In this way, while kept out of the Confederate treasury, it was saved for the purposes of trade and commerce. By this means, the national government acted with double power upon the strength of the enemy: first, by depriving them of the means of supplying the demand for their products; and, second, by lessening the demand. It was to avoid this last effect of the capture that the insurgents preferred to destroy property rather than permit it to fall into the hands of the national forces. .</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">While all residents within the Confederate territory were in law enemies, some were in fact friends. In the indiscriminate seizure of private property, it seemed to Congress that friends might sometimes suffer. Therefore, to save them, it was provided that property, when captured, should be sold, and the proceeds paid into the treasury of the United States. That being done, any person claiming to have been the owner might, at any time within two years after the close of the rebellion, bring suit in the Court of Claims for the proceeds; and on proof \u201c of his ownership of said property, of his right to the proceeds thereof, and that he has (had) never given aid or comfort to the present rebellion,\u201d \u201c receive the residue of such proceeds, after the deduction of any purchase-money which may have been paid, together with the expense of transportation and sale of said property, and any other lawful expenses attending the disposition thereof.\u201d 12 Stat. 820. As to all persons within the privileges of the act, the proceeds were held in trust, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>as to all others the title of the United States as captor was absolute. Whoever could bring himself within the terms of the trust might sue the United States and recover, but no one else.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">It has been decided that this right of suit was given to the subjects of Great Britain, whose property had been taken, as well as to citizens of the United States. <em>United States </em>v. O'Keefe, 11 Wall. 178; <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 16 id. 147. The present claimant was a British subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">There can be no doubt that the words \u201c aid or comfort \u201d are used in this statute in the same sense they are in the clause of the Constitution defining treason (art. 3, sect. 3), that is to say, in their hostile sense. The acts of aid and comfort which will defeat a suit must be of the same general character with those necessary to convict of treason, where the offence consists in giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States. But there may be aid and comfort without treason; for \u201c'treason is a breach of allegiance, and can be committed by him only who owes allegiance, either perpetual or temporary.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 96. The benefits of the statute are withheld not for treason only, but for giving aid and comfort as well. A claimant to be excluded need not have been a traitor : it is sufficient if he has done that which would have made him a traitor if he had owed allegiance to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">This, we think, was the manifest intention of Congress. It must be remembered that the statute was passed March 12, 1863, in the dark hours of the national cause. The \u201cFlorida\u201d and the \u201cAlabama,\u201d built in Great Britain, were then in the midst of their successful cruises against the'commerce of the United States. Nassau, in the island of New Providence, was the principal port of entry of the insurgents for blockade-running purposes, and aid and comfort from those who could not be guilty of treason were being sent in every conceivable form into the Confederacy through 'every port not sealed against approach by an absolutely effective blockade. The great object of all was to secure the enormous profits to be realized by an exchange of the \u201c chief requirement \u201d of the enemy for their great staple, cotton. For this, all risks of capture and confiscar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tion were assumed, and the arm of the rebellion upheld. That it was the intention of Congress to permit foreign owners of cotton thus acquired to sue tbe United States for its proceeds, when captured, cannot for a moment be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">A non-resident alien need not expose himself or his property to the dangers of a foreign war. He may trade with both belligerents or with either. By so doing he commits no crime. His acts are lawful in the sense that they are not prohibited.. So long as he confines his trade to property not hostile or con traband, and violates no blockade, he is secure both in his person and his property. If he is neutral in fact as well as in name, he runs no risk. But so soon as he steps outside of actual neutrality, and adds materially to the warlike strength of one belligerent, he makes himself correspondingly the enemy of the other. To the extent of his acts of hostility and their legitimate consequences, he submits himself to the risk of the war into whose presence he voluntarily comes. If he breaks a blockade or engages in contraband trade, he subjects himself to the chances of the capture and confiscation of his offending property. If he thrusts himself inside the enemies\u2019 lines, and for the sake of gain acquires title to hostile property, he must take care that it is not lost to him by the fortune of war. While he may not have committed a crime for which he can be personally punished, his offending property may be treated by the adverse belligerent as enemy property. He has the legal right to carry, to sell, and to buy; but the conquering belligerent bas a corresponding right to capture and condemn. He enters into a race of diligence with his adversary, and takes tbe chances of success. Tbe rights of the two are in law equal. The one may hold if he can, and the other seize.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Collie, having been a non-resident alien, was not a traitor; but in his foreign home he seems to have done as much as any one private person could do to aid and assist the insurgents in their struggle for supremacy. Tbe case shows that, as early as October, 1863, he entered into a contract of copartnership with the government of the State of North Carolina, tbe sole object of which was to provide the \u201c country \u201d with its \u201c chief requirement \u201d from abroad of warlike supplies, \u201c with regularity, expedition, and economy,\u201d and to assist in running out regularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>through the blockade \u201c a quantity of cotton for the State, to enable it to benefit from the very high prices ruling \u201d in Great Britain. During the previous year, he was largely engaged in running the blockade, and supplying the government of the Confederacy with all kinds of munitions of war. He also acted as the agent of the State of North Carolina for the sale in England of its \u201c obligations for the delivery of cotton at the port of Wilmington, or other ports in possession of the Confederate States,\u201d sometimes guaranteeing payment. In the following year, he entered into a contract with the government of the Confederate States, to cause to be purchased, and delivered through the blockade, quartermaster\u2019s stores and ordnance and medical stores of the value of &lt;\u00a3200,000, for which he was to be paid, on arrival \u201c in the Confederacy,\u201d in cotton at sixpence sterling per pound, adding fifty per cent to the English invoice. For this he was granted special privileges. His cotton was to be shipped \u201c free from any charge or restrictions whatever beyond the . . . existing export tax of one-eighth of a cent per pound,\u201d and no steamers were to have priority over his in that service. His \u201c agents, with the necessary staff for attending to his business, are (were) to be allowed the privilege of residing in the Confederacy free from liability to conscription, and every facility is (was) to be allowed them for effectually carrying out the terms of this (the) agreement.\u201d During the same year, he sent through the blockade and presented to the government of North Carolina \u201ca new kind of gun, reported to be peculiarly destructive,\u201d which he asked the authorities at Wilmington to accept (using his language) \u201cas a 1 substitute\u2019 for some of our people, who but for our business would have been doing business in another capacity.\u201d This gun was afterwards used by the Confederate authorities, as it was clearly intended by him to be, to. aid the entry of blockade-runners into the port of Wilmington by repelling the pursuing vessels of the United States. At another time he sent two Whitworth guns through the blockade, as a gift from himself, which were accepted by the government and used in its service.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Had these things been done by a citizen of the United States, he would have been guilty of treason; and, had they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>been done by the government of which Collie was a subject, it could justly be charged with having been an ally of the enemy. Clearly, Collie was in league with the Confederate government; and, as was said by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>Ex parte Bollman </em>and <em>Ex parte Swartwout </em>(4 Cranch, 75), \u201cAll those who perform any part, however minute, or however remote from the scene of action, and who are actually leagued in general conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors.\u201d In East\u2019s. Pleas of the Crown, the same principle is thus stated: \u201c Every species of aid or comfort, in the words of the act, which, when given to a rebel within the realm, would make the subject guilty of levying war, if given to an enemy, whether within or without the realm, would make the party guilty of adhering to the king\u2019s enemies.\u201d 1 East, P. C. 78. And Mr. Justice Foster, in his Discourse on Treason, says: \u201c Furnishing rebels or enemies with money, arms, or ammunition, or other necessaries, will <em>prima facie </em>make a man a traitor.\u201d Foster\u2019s Crown Law, 217. Mr. Justice Field, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Greathouse </em>(4 Sawyer, 472), states the same doctrine in this language: \u201c Wherever overt acts are committed, which in their natural consequence, if successful, would encourage and advance the interests of the rebellion, in judgment of law aid and comfort are given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">If, then, Collie had owed allegiance to the United States, it is clear that, aside from all questions of pardon and amnesty, he would have been excluded from the privileges of the statute under which he claims. His acts were hostile acts, and, as has already been seen, the same rule of exclusion applies to him as an alien, that would if he had been a citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">This brings us to inquire as to the effect of the proclamation of pardon and amnesty issued by the President Dec'. 25, 1868. 15 Stat. 711. By that proclamation, there was granted to every person, within the scope of the pardoning power of the President, who directly or indirectly participated in the rebellion, \u201c full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason against the United States, or of adhering to their enemies dur ing the late civil war, with restoration of all rights, privileges, and immunities, under the Constitution and the laws . . . made in pursuance thereof.\u201d This was done to \u201c secure per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>manent peace, order, and prosperity throughout the land, and to renew and fully restore confidence and fraternal feeling among the whole people, and their i-espect for and attachment to the national government, designed by its patriotic founders for the general good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The President has the constitutional \u201cpower to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\u201d Art. 2, sect. 2. The pardon is of the offence, and, as between the offender and the offended government, shuts out from sight the offending act. But if there is no offence against the laws of the United States, there can be no pardon by the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">This court has decided, in reference to the Abandoned and Captured Property Act, that a pardon relieves the owner of captured property from the necessity of proving he did not give aid and comfort to the rebellion, because the pardon is equivalent to actual proof of his unbroken loyalty. The language of the late Chief Justice, speaking for the court, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Padelford </em>(supra), is, \u201c The law makes the proof of pardon a complete substitute for proof that he gave no aid or comfort to the rebellion.\u201d This is now the settled rule of decision here, and is not to be disturbed. As the United States were, during the wax, both belligerent and sovereign, they could act in either capacity, and with all the powers of both. A part of their citizens, assuming that their allegiance to their States was superior to that which they owed the United States, rebelled. The nation, as a nation, protested against this assumption, and the two contending parties appealed to arms. The result was in favor of the United States. In a spirit of conciliation, the nation has pardoned those who, owing it allegiance, have made war upon *it, and closed the eyes of the government to their offending acts. It was a bounty extended to them for their return to allegiance. Collie, though by reason of his hostile acts an enemy, was not a traitor. He was no offender, in a criminal sense. He had committed no crime against the laws of the United States or the laws of nations, and consequently he was not, and could not be, included in the pardon granted by the President in his proclamation. His offending acts, therefore, have not been shut out, and he and his representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tives remain subject to all his original disabilities under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Property captured during the war was not taken by way of punishment for the treason of the owner, any more than the life of a soldier slain in battle rvas taken to punish him. He was killed because engaged in war, and exposed to its dangers. So property was captured because it had become involved in the war, and its removal from the \u2022 enemy was necessary in. order to lessen tlieir warlike power. It was not taken because of its ownership, but because of its character. But for the provisions of the Abandoned and Captured Property Act, the title to and the proceeds of all captured property would have passed absolutely to the United States. By that act, however, the privilege of suing for the proceeds in the treasury was granted to such owners as could show they had not given aid or comfort to the rebellion. This was a reward for loyalty, not a punishment for disloyalty. Collie has been deprived of no right he ever had. Neither he nor any one similarty situated has ever been permitted to sue the United States in their own courts upon such a claim. What he asks is not a restoration to a right which he once had, and by his misconduct has lost, but the grant of a privilege which those who have never given aid or comfort to the rebellion, or who, owing allegiance to the United States, have been pai'doned for their offence of disloyalty, now possess. He labors under no disability in respect to any right he ever had. What he wants is the grant of a new right.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">If his property was captured by the United States, under circumstances which entitled him to require its restoration, the law of nations gave him the right to prosecute his claim through his own government for the loss he sustained. That right was not taken from him by the Abandoned and Captured Property Act. It was open to him from the first moment of the capture. All he had to do was to induce his government to assume the responsibility of making his claim, and then the matter would be \u201cprosecuted as one nation proceeds against another, not by suit in the courts as matter of right, but by diplomatic representations, or, if need be, by war.\u201d In such cases, \u201c it rests with the sovereign against whom the demand is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>made, to determine for himself what he will do with it. He may pay or reject it; he may submit to arbitration, open his own courts to suit, or consent to be tried in the courts of another nation. All depends upon himself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Diekelman, 92 U. S. 520. This was the only right Collie had when- his cotton was taken, and the United States have never consented to grant him any other. \u2022 While the President, by his pardon, may restore lost rights, it has never been supposed that in such a way he can grant new ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">It may be that foreigners who have given aid and comfort to the'- enemies of the United States are in equity as much entitled to the privileges of the act as the pardoned enemies themselves; but that is for Congress to determine, and not for us. We have decided that the pardon closes the eyes of the courts to the offending acts, or, perhaps more properly, furnishes conclusive evidence that they never existed as against the government. It is with the legislative department of the government, not the judicial, to say whether the same rule shall be applied in cases where there can be no pardon by the President. A pardon of an offence removes the offending act out of sight; but, if there is no offence in the eye of the law, there can be no pardon. Consequently, the acts which are not extinguished by a pardon remain to confront the actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-7\">Mr. Justice Field dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
