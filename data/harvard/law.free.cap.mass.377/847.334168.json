The Labor Relations Commission (commission), after hearings pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F, concluded that the employer had committed a practice prohibited by that statute by terminating the teacher\u2019s employment in retaliation for protected union activity. Pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, effective July 1, 1974, the commission ordered reinstatement with back pay. We uphold the commission\u2019s order in all respects, and direct the entry of a judgment enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">The teacher, Michael Kressy, was advised in June, 1973, that his next yearly contract would be \"terminal.\u201d In October, 1973, the Massachusetts Teachers Association (union) filed on his behalf a complaint of prohibited practice. The commission made a preliminary investigation and filed its complaint in February, 1974. After hearings in April, May and June, 1974, the commission issued its decision on June 30, 1975. The employer sought judicial review, the commission by counterclaim sought enforcement of its order, and the union intervened. A judge of the Superior Court upheld the application of the remedial section of G. L. c. 150E, but ruled that the commission had committed error of law and had made its decision upon unlawful procedures. He remanded the case to the commission. The employer, the commission and the union appealed, and we granted the commission\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>We summarize the facts found by the commission. The teacher was hired in September, 1969, and received positive evaluations in February of 1970, 1971 and 1972, resulting in promotions and salary increases. In February, 1972, after an organizational campaign in which the teacher took an active part, the faculty voted to be represented by the union for purposes of collective bargaining. The management of the college did not welcome unionization. In the spring of 1972, the teacher was elected to serve on the negotiating team and on the committee that prepared the union\u2019s \"asking package.\u201d He also became the union\u2019s \"information officer\u201d and published a union newsletter. During the summer there were \"heated arguments\u201d between him and Dean Bassett, the chief negotiator for the college. In October he was elected vice president of the union; in March, 1973, he became president. In February, 1973, Dean Bassett was replaced as chief negotiator by the teacher\u2019s department chairman, Dr. O\u2019Neill, and there was an \"acrimonious debate\u201d and \"a vitriolic exchange at the bargaining table\u201d between the teacher and Dr. O\u2019Neill. Shortly thereafter, on February 23, 1973, Dr. O\u2019Neill sent the teacher a memorandum entitled \"Suggestions regarding your future performance,\u201d describing eight incidents, dating back to the spring of 1971, and charging that \"a pattern of immaturity, obstructionism, lack of cooperation and arrogance has consistently been displayed in your relationship with administration.\u201d Dr. O\u2019Neill visited one of the teacher\u2019s classes in April, 1973, and made a number of criticisms. In June, 1973, Dean Bassett informed the teacher that the decision to give him a terminal contract was based on the O\u2019Neill memorandum of February 23, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The commission said that \"the threshold requirement for the Commission in any case involving an alleged discriminatory discharge is to determine the actual motiva-' tian of the employer.\u201d It discussed in detail each of the employer\u2019s stated reasons for discharge. Some were found to be trivial or pretexts or not to be supported by evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>dence; one was stale and had been condoned; the balance related to protected union activities. The commission concluded: \"Considered individually, certain facts may not be of sufficient significance to warrant the conclusion that Mr. Kressy\u2019s discharge was in retaliation for his union activities. Taken together, however, the entire fact pattern makes this conclusion inescapable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">1. <em>Retroactive application of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a711. </em>Since it affects our jurisdiction to review the commission\u2019s order, we consider first the judge\u2019s ruling that the commission properly ordered a remedy under a statute that took effect after the prohibited conduct had taken place. Both G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(3), effective July 1, 1974, and the statute it superseded, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F(8), prohibited discrimination in employment on account of union activity. Before the enactment of c. 150E, the commission could only make \"recommendations for resolving\u201d the prohibited practice. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F(10), as amended through St. 1972, c. 713, \u00a7 1. Under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, however the commission could order the employee reinstated with back pay subject to judicial enforcement and review.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Because \u00a7 11 affects only the remedies available to the aggrieved party, its application to cases pending on its effective date is appropriate. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 657 (1977). <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624, 628 (1974). <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>United Vacuum Appliance Corp., </em>357 Mass. 680, 683-684 (1970). We draw no inference of any legislative intent to the contrary from the fact that the effective date of G. L. c. 150E was delayed more than a year and a half following its enactment. The delay appears to be explained by the substantive changes made in the scope and process of collective bargaining. Those changes are not involved here. Where a State enacts retroactive legislation impairing its own rights, it cannot be heard to complain on constitutional grounds. <em>Greenaway\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 121, 123 (1946), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>2. <em>Motivation for discharge. </em>In its opinion, the commission quoted from <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Symons Mfg. Co., </em>328 F.2d 835, 837 (7th Cir. 1964): \"The mere existence of valid grounds for a discharge is no defense to a charge that the discharge was unlawful, unless the discharge was predicated <em>solely </em>on those grounds, and not by a desire to discourage union activity\u201d (emphasis supplied). The judge ruled that it was an error of law to follow that rule, and directed the commission to follow the guidelines set forth in <em>Mead &amp; Mount Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>411 F.2d 1154, 1157 (8th Cir. 1969): \"The General Counsel has the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the employee was discharged for his union activities or membership\u2014 that <em>but for </em>his union activities or membership, he would not have been discharged\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">We need not decide which is the appropriate standard for proof of discriminatory motive, since the commission\u2019s findings meet either standard. It is apparent from the portions of the commission\u2019s decision we have quoted that it found that the teacher was discharged solely because of his union activities. Such a finding satisfies the \"but for\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">3. <em>Burden of proof. </em>The judge ruled that the commission\u2019s decision as written was unclear as to burden of proof, and directed the commission to \"follow the teaching\u201d of <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 139 (1976). See <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 230-232 (1978). The <em>Wheelock College </em>case was decided after the commission\u2019s decision, and the commission did not use the terminology of \"prima facie case.\u201d It now argues that it substantially complied with the procedures set forth in the <em>Wheelock College </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The <em>Wheelock College </em>and <em>Smith College </em>cases involved sex discrimination rather than discrimination by reason of union activity, and the elements of a prima facie case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>would obviously be different in the two types of cases. If the commission were to decide to follow the <em>Wheelock College </em>procedure, it would have to define the elements of a \"prima facie case\u201d and then determine whether those elements were proved. <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 229 (1978). We do not pursue these matters further, since the <em>Wheelock College </em>opinion makes it clear that discrimination mayobe proved without regard to a \"prima facie case.\u201d 371 Mass. at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The commission in the present case did not rely on a \"prima facie case.\u201d Instead, it arrived at a factual conclusion based on all the circumstances, and, in our opinion, there was substantial evidence to support that conclusion. We do not regard the quotation of <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Texas Bolt Co., </em>313 F.2d 761, 763 (5th Cir. 1963), as showing any confusion as to burden of proof. We think the burden of proof was properly placed on the charging party. Moreover, once there is an affirmative finding without reference to the burden, the issue of burden of persuasion is out of the case. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, </em>372 Mass. 257, 265 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">4. <em>Other issues. </em>The employer argues that the commission\u2019s order has the effect of granting tenure to Kressy and therefore exceeds the commission\u2019s \"jurisdictional authority and power.\u201d The commission did not order reinstatement with tenure. Cf. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>373 Mass. 53, 59 (1977) (challenge to arbitrator\u2019s award); <em>School Comm. of W. Bridgewater </em>v. <em>West Bridgewater Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 121, 126-127 (1977) (same). Nor does it appear from the record that a reinstatement order would necessarily result in tenure or foreclose the employer from later deciding whether or not to grant tenure. See G. L. c. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 35 (powers of board of regional community colleges).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Contrary to the employer\u2019s contention, we find nothing in the commission\u2019s decision to suggest that the commission members who participated had not read the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>5. <em>Disposition. </em>The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment affirming the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
