Kelliher, </em>Assistant Attorney General <em>(Richard Gross, </em>Assistant Attorney General, with her) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b889-13\">Wilkins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOP2\">The Attorney General, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, commenced this proceeding, under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 4, and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 28E, to obtain a determination, and an injunction declaring, that the defendant was not entitled to conduct a \"going out df business sale\u201d at the same location at which, within two years, it had conducted a sale designated as a \"must vacate\u201d sale. The Attorney General relied on that portion of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 28A, as appearing in St. 1961, c. 324, which indirectly but in effect forbids a person from conducting a \"going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>out of business sale\u201d and certain other sales if he (or an affiliated entity) has \"conducted a going out of business sale or sale of similar designation, at the same location\u201d (id.[2][c]) within two years preceding the date of the filing of a pre-sale inventory as required by \u00a7 28A.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">A judge of the Superior Court heard the case on a statement of agreed facts. He ruled that a \"must vacate sale\u201d was not a \"going out of business sale or sale of similar designation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 28A (2) (c) and entered a judgment that \"\u00a7 28A does not prohibit the defendant from conducting a going-out-of-business sale.\u201d The Attorney General appealed. The Appeals Court appears to have denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for mootness. The defendant based its motion on the ground that it had concluded its going out of business sale and was no longer in business. The defendant did not file a brief in the Appeals Court. A panel of that court considered the record and the Commonwealth\u2019s brief and, pursuant to rule 1:28 of that court (as amended, 6 Mass. App. Ct. 982 [1978]), without oral argument, ordered that the judgment be affirmed without opinion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lane\u2019s Furniture Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 977 (1978). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s request for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The issue which the Commonwealth presents is moot because the defendant has concluded its sale and has ceased business. On occasion, however, we have expressed our views where an issue might arise again, and, if it did, would likely be mooted by the passage of time in the appellate process. See <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271, 274 (1978). Cf. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Haufler, ante </em>209, 211 (1979). The question here is whether an expression of our opinion concerning the construction of \u00a7 28A (2) (c) would serve a worthwhile purpose. We conclude that it would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The draftsmanship of \u00a7 28A leaves much to be desired. It does not contain direct prohibitions of particular conduct but rather requires representations in a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>signed under the penalties of perjury by the owner of the business. A violation of any provision of \u00a7 28A is punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both. G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 28D. It is important that a statute having such a penal aspect be as clear as it can reasonably be. The members of the court are not in agreement concerning the proper interpretation of the words \u201csale of similar designation.\u201d If we are unable to agree whether a \u201cmust vacate\u201d sale is a \u201cgoing out of business sale or sale of similar designation,\u201d we think persons who must comply with \u00a7 28A at their peril will be similarly uncertain. An expression of our divergent views would not contribute meaningfully to the administration of \u00a7 28A.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We granted further appellate review because of the importance of protecting consumers against the kinds of frauds and deceptions which can be carried out in so-called \"close out\u201d or \u201cliquidation\u201d sales. The problem has been subject to legislation elsewhere. See, e.g., N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law art. 29-F (McKinney 1968 &amp; Supp. 1978) (Going Out Of Business Sales); New York City, N.Y., Administrative Code, c. 32, tit. B. art. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 B32-205.0 to B32-215.0. See also Dole, Merchant and Consumer Protection: The Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, 76 Yale L.J. 485, 492 (1967). We believe that the problems of draftsmanship in \u00a7 28A can better be resolved by legislative action than by piecemeal judicial construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Because the case is moot, the judgment shall be vacated with the notation that the decision is not on the merits, and the case remanded to the Superior Court with directions to dismiss the action. See <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>369 Mass. 701, 708 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
