Arno, challenges G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 16C,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as an improper, standardless delegation of legislative authority, and as violative of the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. We disagree with the plaintiffs characterizations, and hold the provision valid under both the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The parties have stipulated to all the material facts. On July 16, 1975, the plaintiff applied to the Nantucket board of selectmen (board) for a liquor license for Arno\u2019s Restaurant, located at 41 Main Street (premises), Nantucket, Massachusetts. The restaurant is within 500 feet of the Centre Street United Methodist Church (church). A public hearing was held on the application on August 6.1975. By a letter of that date, the recording steward of the church informed the board that the church\u2019s administrative board objected to the issuance of a liquor license to the plaintiff for the premises. In a letter dated August 7, 1975, the board notified the plaintiff of its denial of his application pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 16C, based on the church\u2019s written objection. A few days later, the plaintiff appealed pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67, from the board\u2019s decision to the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC). At a hearing before the ABCC on August 28, 1975, the board introduced documents demonstrating that the church administrative board was the governing body of the church. The plaintiff presented no contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>evidence. On the same date, the ABCC affirmed the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s license application.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The plaintiff\" filed the complaint in this action on September 16,1975, seeking judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, of the ABCC decision. Having agreed to all material facts, the parties requested that the judge reserve and report the case to the Appeals Court. The judge reported the case to the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">1. <em>Delegation of legislative authority. </em>This court has recognized as a general proposition that the Legislature cannot delegate the general power to make laws, <em>Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Ann &amp; Hope, Inc., </em>363 Mass. 409, 420-423 (1973),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> although it may delegate to a board or an individual officer the implementation of details of a legislative policy, so long as specific standards are supplied, <em>Arlington </em>v. <em>Board of Conciliation &amp; Arbitration, </em>370 Mass. 769, 775-776 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff urges us to apply these basic tenets to \u00a7 16C, and to find it constitutionally defective. We decline that invitation. Rather, while affirming the principles espoused in the cases cited above, we find them inapposite to the statutory provision before us, for the reasons which follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Statutes regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors have been accorded exceptional treatment by the courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has stated that \"[without doubt a State may absolutely prohibit the manufacture of intoxicants, their transportation, sale, or possession, irrespective of when or where produced or obtained, or the use to which they are to be put.\u201d <em>Ziffrin, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>308 U.S. 132, 138 (1939). Incident to the authority wholly to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors, the Legislature may permit sales subject to prescribed terms and conditions. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>334 Mass. 613, 619 (1956). The Legislature has established such terms and conditions in a scheme of regulation embodied in G. L. c. 138.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Section 16C of G. L. c. 138 prohibits, with stated exceptions, the granting of a liquor license to premises located within a radius of 500 feet of a church or school if the governing body of that church or school<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> files a written objection to its issuance. It long has been acknowledged that a State, in the exercise of its expansive police powers with regard to the regulation of sales of alcoholic bever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ages, may enact valid laws prohibiting, without the possibility of waiver, such sales within specified distances of churches<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and other institutions sought to be protected. See <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Easterling, </em>183 Miss. 575 (1938); <em>State ex rel. Dixie Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miami, </em>156 Fla. 784 (1946); 45 Am. Jur. 2d Intoxicating Liquors \u00a7 140 (1969). These statutes have been upheld as rationally implementing a legislative determination that the welfare and safety of individuals attending these institutions would be served by such a zone of protection. Likewise, local zoning ordinances prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors within certain areas have been upheld. In <em>Blackman </em>v. <em>Big Sandy, </em>507 F.2d 935, 936-937 (5th Cir. 1975), the court stated: \"The City might be legitimately concerned about the presence of a liquor establishment and its accompanying traffic in the midst of homes, churches and a school. The Supreme Court has recently made clear that zoning decisions \u2019addressed to family needs\u2019 are permissible ones. \u2019The police power is not confined to elimination of filth, stench, and unhealthy places. It is ample to lay out zones where family values, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion, and clean air make the area a sanctuary for people.\u2019 <em>Village of Belle Terre </em>v. <em>Boraas, </em>416 U.S. 1, 9 [1974].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">Accepting the premise that an absolute prohibition of new liquor licenses within a certain distance of a church constitutes a valid exercise of police power,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we turn to the improper delegation of power claims advanced by the plaintiff. A look at \u00a7 16C in its historical context is useful here. At its inception, when \u00a7 16C was inserted by St. 1954, c. 569, \u00a7 1, it was a categorical ban akin to those discussed above: \"Premises, except those of an innholder, located within five hundred feet... of a church or school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>shall not be licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages ....\u201d Statute 1968, c. 435, modified the absolute proscription by permitting licenses within the 500-foot radius \u201cif the governing body of such church or school assents in writing.\u201d Finally, St. 1970, c. 192, \u00a7 1, substituted the present language which essentially shifts the burden of formal objection to the church or school, and relieves the applicant of the duty to gain assent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The history of the statute demonstrates a progressive relaxation of licensing limitations against a backdrop of a legislative option of total prohibition. While seeking in part to facilitate the granting of licenses, the Legislature chose also to preserve, where appropriate, its legitimate police power objective of providing a zone of protection. The power to effectuate this goal is delegated, in part,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to churches located within 500 feet of the premises proposed to be licensed. As we pointed out in <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 619, \"[i]n dealing with a trade, which, because of its great potential evils, can be wholly prohibited, a wide power is given to the Legislature with respect to the delegation of discretionary powers\u201d (no invalid delegation of authority to the ABCC in leaving to it the power to approve or disapprove license applicants who had been approved by the local board.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The authority delegated need not vest exclusive<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ly in public bodies in order to pass constitutional muster. Indeed, statutes making the granting of a liquor license conditional on the consent of, or the absence of an objection by, residents or property owners within a certain area in which the proposed establishment is to be operated have been uniformly upheld. See <em>Beacon Liquors </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>279 Ky. 468 (1939); 45 Am. Jur. 2d Intoxicating Liquors \u00a7 156 (1969). Likewise, the Legislature\u2019s delegatian in \u00a7 16C of a veto power to the institutions most directly representing the interests it seeks to protect falls within permissible constitutional limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Reference to the case of <em>Cusack Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>242 U.S. 526 (1917), and its progeny,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is especially instructive. In <em>Cusack, </em>an ordinance which prohibited specific uses, but permitted waiver of the restrictions with the consent of a majority of the parties most affected, survived a claim of invalid delegation of legislative power. The distilled essence of <em>Cusack, </em>as construed in the majority of cases, is that if the effect of a consent provision is to legislate a restriction it is invalid,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but if it serves merely to permit the waiver of a restriction created by the legislative body, which has provided for such a waiver, it is upheld. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>285 Minn. 378 (1969); <em>Robwood Advertising Assocs. </em>v. <em>Nashua, </em>102 N.H. 215 (1959); 21 A.L.R.2d 551 (1952).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We regard the current \u00a7 16C as falling within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the latter category. Clearly, the 1968 version, which prohibited licensing within the 500-foot radius but provided for written waiver by the church, landed squarely within the ambit of the <em>Cusack </em>rule. The 1970 amendment created no material distinction for the purpose of analyzing the delegation issue. The current provision does not invest the church with a new, expanded power to legislate a prohibition. It merely shifts to the church the burden of objecting, while retaining the essential legislative mandate that no license be granted within the protected area in the face of a nonconsenting church.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We hold, therefore, that \u00a7 16C does not affront the Massachusetts Constitution. As a corollary, we hold that it comports with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, contrary to the assertions of the plaintiff. Due process does not require, as the plaintiff suggests, the promulgation of an elaborate scheme of standards governing decision making by the church. As an institution representing interests benefited by a valid police power protection, the church may waive that protection or not, in its discretion, without running afoul of the due process clause. Cf. <em>Nortown Theatre Inc. </em>v. <em>Gribbs, </em>373 F. Supp. 363 (E.D. Mich. 1974), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50 (1976). What due process does require, however, and what is available by statute,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is the opportunity for a hearing with respect to such questions as whether the objecting institution qualifies as a \"church\u201d for the purposes of the statute, whether it is within the statutorily protected zone of 500 feet, and whether the written objection was duly authorized by the appropriate \"governing body\u201d of the church.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As to ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tians such as these, an initial hearing and adequate opportunity for administrative and judicial review are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">2. <em>The First Amendment establishment of religion clause. </em>The plaintiff also urges us to invalidate \u00a7 16C on the alternative ground that it violates the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While we recognize that the plaintiff raises an issue which falls within an \"extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional law,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we also note that the \"hermetic separation\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of church and State is an impossibility which the Constitution has never required. The test which \u00a7 16C must pass is set forth in <em>Wolman </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>433 U.S. 229, 236 (1977): \"In order to pass muster, a statute must have a secular legislative purpose, must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\u201d Section 16C withstands scrutiny with respect to each consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">As we have discussed earlier in this opinion, the provision for a zone of protection from liquor establishments sought to be licensed within a given radius of a church or a school is a valid exercise of police power,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in that it seeks to safeguard the health and welfare of persons attending religious and nonreligious activities at such places. While \u00a7 16C does provide special protection for churches and schools,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we view its purpose as secular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and its principal effect as neither sponsorship of nor hostility toward religion. The United States Supreme Court has upheld in the face of establishment clause attacks: a statute granting a property tax exemption to religious organizations, along with other cultural and charitable groups, <em>Walz </em>v. <em>Tax Comm\u2019n of the City of N.Y., </em>397 U.S. 664 (1970); Maryland\u2019s Sunday closing laws, <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420 (1961); and State reimbursement of transportation costs to parents of parochial school students, even though the children might not have attended the church-affiliated school in the absence of the public program, <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Ewing, </em>330 U.S. 1 (1947). Just as these and other Supreme Court cases indicate tolerance of the incidental benefits which religious institutions reap by virtue of programs generated from secular concerns, so do we find acceptable both the goals and effects of \u00a7 16C.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Finally, we find that while \u00a7 16C inevitably occasions some degree of State involvement with religion, that involvement does not rise to the level of \"excessive entanglement.\u201d The governing body of a church may file an objection to the granting of a license, and that objection is subject to limited scrutiny.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The State-church interac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tian engendered by these restricted procedures represents far less involvement than that created by the \"sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards\u201d which the Supreme Court regards so warily.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">For the reasons stated, we uphold the validity under both the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions of that portion of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 16C, challenged here. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> The pertinent portion of c. 138, \u00a7 16C, as amended by St. 1970, c. 192, \u00a7 1, reads as follows: \"Premises, except those of an innholder and except such parts of buildings as are located ten or more floors above street level, located within a radius of five hundred feet of a church or school shall not be licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages if the governing body of such church or school files written objection thereto</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> The doctrine of nondelegation derives from art. 30 of our Declaration of Rights and from Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of our Constitution. <em>Arlington </em>v. <em>Board of Conciliation &amp; Arbitration, 370 </em>Mass. 769, 775 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> In <em>Arlington, </em>we upheld the constitutionality of an act authorizing the use of an arbitration panel to resolve disputes, in certain circumstances, between employee organizations representing firefighters or police officers and the employing city, town, or district. We found no improper delegation in that the neutral arbitrator/chairman, whether classified as a \"public\u201d or a \"private\u201d person, was impartial and was required to apply detailed statutory standards. We also based our holding on the extensive safeguards against arbitrary action built into the statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\"> The Supreme Court in <em>California </em>v. <em>LaRue, </em>409 U.S. 109, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>(1972), remarked that \"the broad sweep of the Twenty-first Amendment has been recognized as conferring something more than the normal state authority over public health, welfare, and morals.\u201d See <em>Trustees of Mortgage Trust of America </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>554 F.2d 237, 238 (5th Cir. 1977).
