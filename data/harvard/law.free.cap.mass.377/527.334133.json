By agreement with the Commonwealth, the record on the petition consists essentially of the transcript of the trial as it reached this court on the petitioner\u2019s unsuccessful appeal from his conviction of murder in the first degree. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 843 (1970). The matter is before us on reservation and report, without decision, of a single justice of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>court. (Other postconviction applications previously made by the petitioner are noted in the margin.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">To outline as much of the record as may be pertinent: The petitioner Connolly and a codefendant, Richard J. Cote, were charged with the murder on November 30, 1967, of John Chwalek.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> About 11:30 p.m. that day Chwalek was in a Chevrolet automobile on Water Street in Lawrence in the company of Sylvia Haggar, with whom Connolly had recently broken off relations. Connolly was in a Rambler automobile ahead, driven by Cote. There was testimony that the Chwalek car, after a high speed chase, forced the Cote car off the road. Other testimony had Chwalek merely beeping his horn to signal the other car to stop. Both vehicles pulled over and Connolly and Chwalek emerged. According to Haggar (the major prosecution witness), Connolly, without particular provocation, fired a \"gun\u201d several times at Chwalek, then went to the car where she, Haggar, was sitting, and shot and wounded her; the Cote car left, then returned, and Connolly fired <em>again at </em>Chwalek who had crawled into the Chevrolet. Chwalek died of the multiple wounds. According to Haggar, only one weapon was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Connolly took the stand to testify that Chwalek had approached with a shotgun and ordered him out of the Cote car. He got out, first grabbing from the back seat a .22 caliber rifle (he and Cote had bought the rifle the day before). Chwalek opened fire but Connolly ducked and retreated. His rifle went off (on cross-examination he said he \"shot back\u201d); then he dropped it. Connolly and Chwalek wrestled over the shotgun, during which time it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\"going off\u201d (Connolly could not say how many times). The struggle moved to the front seat of the Chevrolet. According to Connolly, Haggar at this time was pulling on his back and neck, and also grappling for the shotgun. At some point the Cote Rambler drove off. Connolly said he had no memory of what happened after the fatal episode or how he got back home.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Supporting Connolly\u2019s version to some extent was the fact that the wounds in Chwalek\u2019s body came both from the .22 caliber rifle and from a shotgun; and spent shotgun shells were found near the scene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No shotgun was found, however. (The rifle was subsequently located in the basement of Connolly\u2019s apartment building.) There was no dispute that Connolly and Chwalek had previously had at least one violent encounter \u2014 Chwalek, according to Connolly, having pistol-whipped him, knocked him down, and kicked his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We do not elaborate on the evidence which we have digested to bring out the nature of the defense. On a previous occasion (see note 1, supra) a master found the case against Connolly was \"very strong,\u201d <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>366 Mass. 435, 437 (1974), but it is clear that the state of the proof was such as to require the trial judge to instruct on the issue of self-defense, and he did so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question is whether the instruction given was constitutionally adequate under our decisions beginning with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">1. <em>The standard. </em>As malice is an essential element of murder, and a proper exercise of self-defense negates malice, it follows from <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>(1975),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt, in any case where the issue arises, that there was not a proper exercise of self-defense; and the judge should so charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Rodriguez </em>made this inference from <em>Mullaney; </em>and it found wanting a charge which suggested, without explicitly stating, that the defendant had to prove that he acted in proper self-defense, and also failed to \"impress on the jury the critical nexus between the elements of the crime charged and the absence of self-defense.\u201d 370 Mass. at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><em>Rodriguez </em>did not decide whether instructions would be reviewed in light of this standard in the absence of request or objection at trial, 370 Mass, at 692 n.9, or whether the standard applied retroactively. The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 588-590 (1978), answered both questions in the affirmative; as to the latter point it followed <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233 (1977).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We added in <em>Stokes, </em>however, that we would bring \"greater expectations\u201d (374 Mass, at 591) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>charges in trials that occurred after <em>Mullaney </em>(June 9, 1975), and especially after our <em>Rodriguez </em>decision (July 15, 1976), than we would to charges in earlier trials, when <em>Mullaney </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>could not have been foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We also said in <em>Stokes </em>(374 Mass, at 590-591):</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\"In adopting the ruling of <em>Mullaney </em>... we are not required to apply a narrow and precise test to the instructions given by the judge. If <em>Mullaney </em>imposed such a requirement, reversal would follow with mathematical certainty in all cases where self-defense or reasonable provocation had been raised in the evidence sufficiently and where the burden of proof as to these precise issues had not been placed by specific language on the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\"Rather, we believe that, in any case where the requirements of <em>Mullaney </em>are placed in issue, the charge to the jury must be examined in its entirety to determine whether the constitutional requirements have been met.... For example, a jury charge might well be constitutionally sufficient which clearly placed the burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt on the Commonwealth and contained other discussion which, although not referring to the burden of proof as to self-defense and reasonable provocation, adequately defined those factors and established them as negating a finding of malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The last requirement in the passage quoted above, that self-defense or provocation be \"established ... as negating a finding of malice,\u201d reiterated and clarified what we said in <em>Rodriguez, </em>that the \"critical nexus\u201d between the elements of the crime and self-defense must be brought home.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>2. <em>The instant charge. </em>On these lines we analyze the charge in the present case. The jury were told that the Commonwealth had the \"burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crime charged.\u201d In regard to murder, the judge said, \"[T]he burden is on the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Connolly] intentionally fired the shots that struck the deceased without legal justification or excuse and without such extenuation as may reduce the crime to manslaughter but with what in the law is called 'malice aforethought.\u2019 \u201d Defining malice, the court said, \"It not only includes hatred and ill-will or revenge, but every other unjustifiable motive.... It is enough if the killing was intentional and was without legal excuse and justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Arriving at manslaughter and self-defense, the judge mentioned killing in self-defense as one example of lawful homicide. Then, after outlining the substantive requirements of self-defense without reference to any burden of proof, the judge said:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\"The defendant Connolly claims as a ground of defense that the shooting was lawful, and that it was justified because done in defending himself.... [I]n order to find the defendant ... was justified you must find that the deceased ... assailed the defendant... and the defendant was so situated that he could not escape, or that he already had done all that he reasonably could to get away from the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\"Unless you find that to be the situation, you cannot find that the defendant Connolly was justified in killing in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\"If you find that he could not get away or that he had done all that he reasonably could to get away, but you should also find that there was nothing in the situation which you say caused him to have a reasonable fear of immediate death or great bodily harm and that he did not in fact have such a fear, then he was not justified in killing in self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The initial instruction regarding burden of proof on all essential elements, and about absence of legal justification or excuse as a condition of a guilty verdict, satisfied part of the <em>Stokes </em>guideline: it \"clearly placed the burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt on the Commonwealth.\u201d The later instruction that homicide may be justifiable if committed in self-defense, although good as far as it went, did not fully comport with the further <em>Stokes </em>requirement that self-defense be \"established ... as negating a finding of malice.\u201d Yet the defect<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> might be thought not enough in itself, in a <em>pre-Mullaney </em>trial, to hold an instruction bad. The greater difficulty with the charge lies in its repeated use of \"finding\u201d language when explaining the law of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The finding language combined two errors. First, especially when taken in relation to the judge\u2019s assertion that the defendant \"claims\u201d self-defense as a \"ground of defense,\u201d this language of finding strongly implied, if it did not directly impose, a burden of proof (i.e., persuasion) on the defendant. Indeed, whereas instructions using a terminology of burden of proof have a technical cast and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>may well be obscure to jurors, instructions telling the jury that they must find or be satisfied of a proposition, which the defendant \"claims,\u201d would readily convey to them in comprehensible lay terms that it was the defendant who was required to wield the laboring oar.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The second error may be seen as more prejudicial to the defendant than any parts of the charges held bad in our cases beginning with <em>Rodriguez. </em>It is contained in the instruction that \"in order to find the defendant ... was justified you must find\u201d certain elements of self-defense, and that \"[ujnless you find that to be the situation, you cannot find that the defendant Connolly was justified in killing in self-defense.\u201d This language does not describe precisely what degree of persuasion is required \u2014 whether beyond a reasonable doubt, or by a preponderance, or something in between \u2014 but it suggests at least a preponderance. That is, the jury would understand the words to mean that, in order to acquit, they must find the defendant, more likely than not, exercised proper self-defense. But, under the law, a jury, to acquit, need not \"find\u201d the various elements of self-defense. It is enough for acquittal that there be a reasonable doubt whether the defendant acted in proper self-defense. It will be noted that this defect in the instructions is separate from the question of who had the burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On this second point, <em>Notaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>363 F.2d 169 (9th Cir. 1966), is instructive. There the court accepted that the government had the burden of proving absence of entrapment once the issue had been raised in a prosecution under the Federal narcotics law. The court held erroneous an instruction in terms of finding, \"since in requiring that the jury 'should find\u2019 certain facts, the existence of which were made indispensable to acquittal, a definite, conclusive, determination of disputed factual issues was required of the jury as a condition to acquittal. Such a requirement was erroneously imposed. The appellant was indeed entitled to acquittal if the jury 'should find\u2019 that he 'had no previous intent or purpose to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>mit\u2019 the offense 'and did so only because he was induced or persuaded by some agent of the Government\u2019. But he was also entitled to be acquitted if, from the evidence, the jury, because of the entertainment of reasonable doubt, should be unable to 'find\u2019 that the necessary elements of the defense had not been excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">We can conceive that an isolated suggestion that the jury must find self-defense in order to acquit might not invalidate a charge if it could be fairly viewed as overcome and outweighed in the minds of a jury by the initial correct instruction and by the instructions as a whole. Cf. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, post </em>539, 542-543 (1979). Here, however, the finding language was repeated six times. The effect was to foist on the defendant the burden on the issue and to misstate the impression regarding that issue with which the jury must be left in order to acquit when the case was over.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Our previous decisions in <em>Rodriguez </em>and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>374 Mass. 596 (1978), portend our result here. In <em>Rodriguez </em>the judge used finding language repeatedly when charging on self-defense, and he summed up, \"the defendant could be found not guilty <em>if you are satisfied ... </em>that [he] acted within the permissible limits of self-defense.\u201d 370 Mass. at 690; emphasis in original. In <em>Collins </em>the finding idea was drilled in by repeated use. In both cases the jury were misled as to which side had the burden; they may also have been misled as to the level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>belief they must achieve to support a claim of self-defense, although in neither case did the judge push the point further (as did the judge in the present case) by saying that \"unless you find\u201d the elements of self-defense \"you cannot find\u201d the defendant justified.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">3. <em>Commonwealth contentions. </em>With respect to the first vice in the charge \u2014 the casting of the burden \u2014 the Commonwealth according to its brief expects the jury to reason \"that since the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a killing is done without legal justification, and a killing in self-defense is defined as one which is justifiable and lawful... it follows that the Commonwealth retains the burden of proof to demonstrate the absence of legal justification, i.e., the absence of self-defense.\u201d We suggest that in the present case this was by no means a clear inference. To make such an inference clear, <em>Stokes </em>sought a statement that \"established [self-defense] as negating a finding of malice.\u201d Further, a charge thus initially correct would fail if repeated suggestions of a burden on the defendant were made later on. Here the initial general instruction was separated from the prejudicial self-defense instruction by some twenty-four pages of transcript. We cannot assume that the jury discounted analytically the inference flowing from the finding language; on these facts we agree with the thought expressed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Corrigan, </em>548 F.2d 879, 882 (10th Cir. 1977): \"A specific instruction which is defective in respect to the burden of proof is not remedied by correct general statements of the law elsewhere given in the charge unless the general statement clearly indicates that its consideration must be imported into the defective instruction\u201d (quoting from <em>DeGroot </em>v. <em>United States, </em>78 F.2d 244, 253 [9th Cir. 1935]).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Ber</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>rier </em>v. <em>Egeler, </em>583 F.2d 515, 518 (6th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Warden, State Prison of S. Mich. </em>v. <em>Berrier, </em>439 U.S. 955 (1978);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Notaro </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>363 F.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">With respect to the second mistake, that in the \"unless you find\u201d part of the charge, the Commonwealth says the court was \"merely instructing on those elements of self-defense which would render a killing justified.\u201d True, the context was a definition of self-defense, but the language conveyed nevertheless a wholly erroneous view of the state of the evidence that could warrant acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Commonwealth seeks support from <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>375 Mass. 417 (1978), but there, after a correct initial charge as to the general burden and malice (with repetition that the burden went to all essential elements of the crime), the judge specified, as the record shows, that sufficient provocation would rebut \"the fact of malice.\u201d There was then an essentially neutral statement as to self-defense without language of \"finding\u201d or \"satisfying.\u201d Trial, as in the present case, was before <em>Mullaney, </em>and, under the more relaxed scrutiny, the instruction passed muster. The finding language in the present case distinguishes it from <em>Gagne </em>and puts it in the sphere of <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Collins. </em>Although in <em>Rodriguez </em>proper objection was taken, and in <em>Collins </em>the trial postdated <em>Mullaney, </em>those factors should not be held controlling where serious error is shown. Our standard for the pre<em>Mullaney </em>period cannot be utterly flaccid. The present case is the exceptional one with definitely toxic elements which call for a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Finally, the Commonwealth argues, although with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm, that any mistake in the instructions was harmless \u2014 \"not so prejudicial\u201d as to constitute reversible error. But an error on such a matter as self-defense goes to \"the very heart of the truth-finding function,\u201d Stokes, 374 Mass, at 589. The evidence demanded a charge on the point. We cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury verdict was unaffected by the serious errors as to burden and quantum of proof contained in the charge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>Case remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\"> In 1974 this court, following a master\u2019s report, affirmed the judgment of conviction as attacked by writ of error alleging inadequacy of counsel. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>366 Mass. 435 (1974).
