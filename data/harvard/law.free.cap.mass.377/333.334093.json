Dohoney (claimant) became pregnant and left her job with the Pittsfield National Bank (bank) on October 25,1976. She did not indicate a desire to return when she left her job, and when again available for work, she declined to accept the position she had held. Thereafter she applied for unemployment benefits. The director of the Division of Employment Security (division) allowed benefits. The bank appealed to the division\u2019s board of review (G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 40). The board assigned the matter to a single review examiner (G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 41), who held a hearing on March 29,1977. He concluded that the claimant had left work \"voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employing unit\u201d and was therefore ineligible under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), for unemployment compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board of review, one member dissenting, denied the claimant\u2019s application for rehearing thereby making the decision of the review examiner the decision of the board. A judge of the District Court of Central Berkshire concluded that the claimant\u2019s reason for leaving \u2014 to give birth to a child \u2014 was of such an \"urgent, compelling and necessitous nature as to make her separation involuntary,\u201d and reversed. We hold that the review examiner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>decision was supported by substantial evidence and not based on any error of law. We reverse the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We state the facts as found by the examiner. The bank hired the claimant on April 10,1972, primarily as a travel department consultant. The claimant\u2019s duties also included some bookkeeping. Up to July, 1976, the claimant performed her functions on a full-time basis. At that time, she was entering the latter portion of her pregnancy and requested that she be allowed to work part time only. The bank granted the request, narrowing her responsibilities strictly to bookkeeping, and assigned the claimant\u2019s full time duties as travel consultant to another employee. October 25 was the last day the claimant worked before leaving to give birth. Before leaving, the claimant did not discuss with bank officials the possibility of returning to work after the birth of her child. The bank\u2019s vice president in charge of personnel testified that as of the day she left he had considered her employment with the bank to be terminated. In November, after having received permission from her doctor to resume working, the claimant asked to return to work at her first position, but the personnel supervisor at the bank advised her that only the part-time position that she had held before leaving was still available to her. The claimant chose not to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It is now settled that a person who is forced to leave work because of compelling personal circumstances has left work involuntarily and is not subject to temporary disqualification under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(1). <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>364 Mass. 593, 596 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, it is clear that pregnancy or a pregnancy-related disability (e.g., a miscarriage) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>may be a compelling personal circumstance not unlike other disabilities that legitimately require absence from work, neither of which condition is viewed \u00e1s causing a \"voluntary\u201d departure from work. Cf. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 168-170 (1978) (pregnancy related disability); <em>Black </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Malden, </em>365 Mass. 197 (1974) (pregnancy). But neither of these principles resolves the issue presented here. The mere fact of pregnancy does not relieve an employee of the need to show that pregnancy or a pregnancy-related disability was the cause of her termination of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), provides that separation may be deemed involuntary only when the employee\u2019s \"reasons for leaving were for ... an urgent, compelling and necessitous nature ....\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e), as amended through St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 78. As it appears in \u00a7 25(e), \"leaving\u201d refers to the termination or severance of the employment relationship, see <em>Western Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>340 Mass. 190, 192-193 (1960), not to a temporary absence. The distinction is crucial in that not every \"urgent, compelling and necessitous\u201d absence requires termination. Normally, a worker who anticipates a legitimate absence from work can take steps to preserve her employment. When a worker fails to take such steps and severance results, it is the worker\u2019s own inaction rather than compelling personal reasons that causes the leaving. Compare <em>Olechnicky </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>325 Mass. 660 (1950), with <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra. </em>We do not believe that the Legislature intended benefits be paid to a claimant who, anticipating a necessary absence from work, fails to take reasonable means to preserve her job. In such an instance, the employee\u2019s separation need not be deemed involuntary, and disqualification under \u00a7 25(e)(1) is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>We are unpersuaded that the repeal of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 27, by St. 1973, c. 1042, requires a contrary result. Sectian 27, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 634, provided in part that \u201c[n]o waiting period may be served and no benefits shall be paid for the period of unemployment during which an individual is unavailable for work because of pregnancy____In no event shall a waiting period be served or benefits paid for the four weeks prior to or the four weeks next ensuing after the date of birth of the child.\u201d The claimant seems to suggest that repeal of this provision establishes maternity leave as involuntary per se for purposes of \u00a7 25(e)(1). We disagree. When in force, \u00a7 27 dealt solely with the question of a claimant\u2019s availability for work, see G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 24(6), not with the issue of whether a claimant left work voluntarily. Although related, these issues are distinct. See <em>Keough </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>370 Mass. 1, 5 (1976). Moreover, the express purpose of repeal as recommended by the Governor was to permit \"a working woman to schedule maternity leave according to her personal needs,\u201d see 1973 House Doc. No. 6489, not to make female employees who leave their jobs to give birth automatically eligible for unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">It remains for us to consider whether there is substantial evidence to support the examiner\u2019s determination that by failing to request a leave of absence the claimant had failed to explore a reasonable means of preserving her job. We believe there is such support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Not unlike a</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>person who had scheduled elective surgery, the claimant anticipated her departure from work well in advance. She had ample time and opportunity to explore with the bank the possibility of returning to work once she was physically able to do so. In such circumstances, it was proper for the examiner to have concluded that if the claimant had wanted to preserve her job, she would have requested a leave of absence. Employment contracts, including collective bargaining agreements, usually provide for leaves whereby the employment relationship continues and the employee maintains her job-related rights and status. See, e.g., <em>Western Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>340 Mass. 190, 191 (1960). Furthermore, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 105D, inserted by St. 1972, c. 790, \u00a7 1, specifically requires that a pregnant employee \"who shall give at least two weeks\u2019 notice to her employer of her anticipated date of departure and intention to return, shall be restored to her previous, or a similar, position with the same status, pay, length of service credit and seniority, wherever applicable, as of the date of her leave.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the claimant here failed without justification to explore any of these possibilities. She is therefore subject to disqualification under \u00a7 25(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The decision of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\"> General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(1), as amended through St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 78, provides in part: \"\u00a7 25.

For example, the employee might not qualify for statutory protection \u2014 \u00a7 105D applies only to employees who have \"completed the initial probationary period\u201d or who have been \"employed by the same employer for at least three consecutive months as a full time employee,\u201d and who are absent for no more than eight weeks. Or because of the employer\u2019s failure to post notice of the provision as required, the employee might not have had any notice of her rights.
