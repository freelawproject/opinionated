Aggrieved by this rule, Cynthia Zettlemoyer (complainant) brought the matter to the attention of the defendant, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (commission), which found the school committee in violation of the antisex discrimination prohibitions of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, and ordered it to cease and desist its disparate treatment of pregnancy and to pay the complainant the amount she would have received if her disability had been other than pregnancy-related. The school committee challenged this determination by filing a petition for review in the Superior Court, and the judge reserved and reported the case to the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). We granted direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">In accordance with this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160 (1978), we affirm the commission\u2019s order. We share the commission\u2019s view that the school committee\u2019s policy of denying female employees accrued sick leave benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities, like Massachusetts Electric Company\u2019s former practice of excluding temporary disabilities related to pregnancy from a comprehensive disability insurance plan, constitutes unlawful sex discrimination in employment under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The facts are as follows. As in <em>Massachusetts Elec., </em>the relationship between the employer (the school committee) and the complainant, a member of the Brockton teachers association, is governed in large part by a collective bargaining agreement. Pursuant to Article XVII (A) of the labor contract, teachers are entitled to at least nine sick leave days each year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If not used during the year in which they are earned, sick leave benefits may be accumulated up to a maximum of 165 days. According to par. B of art. XVII, sick leave days may be taken for personal illness or injury or for any other reason approved by the superintendent. Sick leave days, however, may not be utilized for disabilities resulting from pregnancy. Rather, art. XIX, par. C, of the collective bargaining agreement provides female teachers an unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>maternity leave of up to three years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To avail oneself of this provision of the contract, a female teacher is obligated to notify her principal as soon as pregnancy has been definitely ascertained. Further, once having begun a maternity leave, a teacher is prohibited from returning to work any earlier than six weeks after the termination of the pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In September, 1972, the complainant, a junior high school music teacher, became pregnant. Expecting delivery to occur near April 15, 1973, she wrote the school committee on January 30, 1973, requesting six weeks\u2019 maternity leave with pay, commencing April 23, 1973, and terminating on June 1, 1973.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although her physician, Dr. Jack Marcovitch, certified that the complainant would be physically unable to work for six weeks after delivery, and despite the fact that she had accumulated sufficient sick leave days to cover her anticipated absence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the school committee, while permitting maternity leave, denied the complainant\u2019s request to apply accrued sick leave to her period of disability. On the night of April 10, 1973, after teaching during the day, the complainant gave birth to a baby. Maternity leave commenced the following day, April 11, and it extended until May 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>1973, when, after consultation with her physician,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the complainant resumed her teaching duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On February 21, 1974, Zettlemoyer filed a complaint with the defendant commission, contending that the school committee\u2019s policy of denying sick leave benefits to pregnancy-related disabilities discriminated against her on the basis of sex. A public hearing was held on November 26, 1974, before a single Commissioner, during which the complainant testified and her physician\u2019s letters were introduced, all for the purpose of indicating that her disability had lasted six weeks. Applying the commission\u2019s maternity leave regulations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which require an employer to treat pregnancy-related disabilities identically to other temporary disabilities in awarding disability or sick leave compensation, the Commissioner determined that the school committee\u2019s refusal to pay the complainant sick leave benefits constituted illegal sex discrimination, and she ordered the school committee to pay the complainant the benefits which she otherwise would have received. The school committee appealed the decision to the full commission, challenging not only the finding of discrimination, but also the single Commissioner\u2019s exclusion of evidence relating to the projected cost of providing benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities. In addition, the school committee argued that its sick leave policy was legally shielded from a charge of discrimination both by the collective bargaining agreement and by the statutory maternity leave requirements of G. L. c. 149,\u00a7 105D. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ther, the school committee suggested that the Commissioner\u2019s ruling was not supported by substantial evidence and that the school committee was denied its right to a fair hearing during the course of the proceeding. With minor modifications, the commission affirmed the single Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">On appeal before us the school committee again raises these arguments. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the decision and order of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We turn first to the school committee\u2019s denial of sick leave benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities. Like most courts which have considered the question,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this court has left little doubt that deprivation of sick leave benefits because of pregnancy constitutes unlawful sex discrimination. Although we have never been squarely faced with a case involving a denial of pregnancy-related sick leave under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, our prior decisions provide considerable guidance for resolution of this problem. In <em>Black </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Malden, </em>365 Mass. 197, 210 (1974), we determined that \"categorical disallowance of all sick pay for disabilities related to pregnancy [for public employees] was [constitutionally] improper when sick leave was allowed for ... other disabilities whether voluntary, predictable, normal, or unique.\u201d More recently, in <em>Massachusetts Elec., supra, </em>we held that pregnancy was a sex-linked characteristic and, therefore, that exclusion of temporary disabilities related to pregnancy from a comprehensive disability insurance plan<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>unlawful sex discrimination in employment in violation of G. L. c. 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The result in this case is plainly governed by <em>Massachusetts Elec.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There is no functional or legal distinction between the disability plan challenged in that case and the sick leave policy at issue here. See <em>Nashville Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Satty, </em>434 U.S. 136, 143 (1977); <em>Zichy </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>392 F. Supp. 338, 342-343 (E.D. Pa. 1975), rev\u2019d and remanded on other grounds, 559 F.2d 1210 (3d Cir. 1977). As in <em>Massachusetts Elec., </em>the school committee compensates employees for limited periods of time, during which an employee must miss work because of a physical disability. See <em>Castellano </em>v. <em>Linden Bd. of Educ., </em>158 N.J. Super. 350, 362 (1978); Comment, Love\u2019s Labors Lost: New Conceptions of Maternity Leaves, 7 Harv. C.R.C.L.L. Rev. 260, 292 (1972). As in <em>Massachusetts Elec, </em>the compensation is not extended to pregnancy-related absences. Having previously determined that pregnancy is a gender-linked classification, <em>Massachusetts Elec., supra </em>at 167, we are compelled to conclude that the Commissioner was correct in finding the school committee\u2019s policy of excluding pregnancy from sick leave coverage sexually discriminatory. By withholding from women what is offered to men \u2014 comprehensive protection from the inability to earn income during a period of disability \u2014 the school committee quite clearly treats females less favorably than it does males.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The school committee advances three arguments in defense of its pregnancy exclusion policy and one additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>argument challenging the commission\u2019s procedures. All four we find unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">a. <em>Collective bargaining agreement. </em>The school committee contends that the inclusion of its maternity policy in the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>represents a waiver by the teachers of any right to receive sick pay while absent from school by reason of pregnancy. Failure to find a waiver, the school committee asserts, would unreasonably interfere with the operation of a collective bargaining agreement freely negotiated by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We disagree. While a union undeniably has the power to waive statutory rights related to collective activity, such as the right to strike, see <em>Boys Mkts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Retail Clerks Union, Local 770, </em>398 U.S. 235 (1970), certain other statutory rights stand on a different footing. The rights conferred by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, are in this category. General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4, concerns not collective processes, but rather each individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities. See <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gardner Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 51 (1974) (likewise characterizing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). Rights of this kind, which are of a personal, and not merely economic, nature are beyond a labor union\u2019s ability to bargain away. See <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gardner Denver Co., supra; Weber </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>563 F.2d 216 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. granted sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>439 U.S. 1045 (1978); <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </em>458 F. Supp 474 (E.D. Va. 1978); <em>Union Free School Dist. No. 6 </em>v. <em>New York State Human Rights Appeal Bd., </em>35 N.Y.2d 371 (1974).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would defeat the legislative purpose that each employee be free from discrimination in employment practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>b. G. L. c. <em>149, \u00a7 105D. </em>The school committee next argues that the commission\u2019s maternity leave regulations, see note 7 <em>supra, </em>impermissibly conflict with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 105D.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The school committee reads \u00a7 105D as guaranteeing a female employee an eight-week maternity leave, while allowing the employer complete freedom to decide whether the leave is to be with or without pay. Accordingly, it is contended that the commission\u2019s requirement that employers treat pregnancy like other disabilities contravenes the legislative intent that compensation for pregnant employees be wholly at the option of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">As we indicated in <em>Massachusetts Elec., supra </em>at 171-172, this interpretation of \u00a7 105D is incorrect. Nothing in the statute should be construed as suggesting that an employer, by granting the required maternity leave, is to be immunized against a charge of sex discrimination when pregnancy is omitted from a comprehensive disability or sick leave program. Section 105D simply states that an employer is not required to establish disability benefit programs for females taking maternity leave. Should an employer provide disability or sick leave benefits generally, the strictures of c. 151B, \u00a7 4, demand that these be administered free of discrimination on the basis of sex. Since the commission\u2019s regulations do no more than rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>force the policy of c. 151B, these directives are not inconsistent with \u00a7 105D.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">c. <em>Cost. </em>It is further maintained that the commission improperly denied the school committee opportunity to introduce evidence pertaining to the cost of granting sick leave benefits to pregnant employees. When offers of proof were made,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the single Commissioner ruled such evidence irrelevant. Had it been permitted to make this presentation, the school committee suggests, the anticipated cost would have been shown to justify disparate treatment of pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We find no error in the single Commissioner\u2019s determination that evidence of cost was irrelevant in a commission proceeding investigating an employer\u2019s denial of sick leave for pregnancy-related disabilities. Although it is well established under the Federal equal employment law that some discrimination may be justified in case of \"business necessity,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 429-431 (1971), the touchstone of the \"business necessity\u201d exception is whether the discriminatory employment practice is vital to safe and efficient job performance. See <em>Dothard </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, </em>433 U.S. 321, 331-332 n.14 (1977); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Pike Corp. of America, </em>332 F. Supp. 490 (C.D. Cal. 1971). The mere fact that an employer may incur additional costs by ending a discriminatory practice is usually insufficient reason to justify its perpetuation in discrimination cases where \"business necessity\u201d defenses are otherwise available. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Lorillard Corp., </em>444 F.2d 791, 799 n.8 (4th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 404 U.S. 1006 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Where discrimination is manifested by \"disparate treatment,\u201d as in this case, cost is an even weaker defense. Indeed, courts have repeatedly held this reason an inadequate justification for the exclusion of pregnancy from a disability or sick pay program. See <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Lake Oswego School Dist. No. </em>7, 519 F.2d 961 (9th Cir. 1975), vacated and remanded, 429 U.S. 1033 (1977); <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Waverly-Shell Rock Bd. of Educ., </em>390.F. Supp. 784 (N.D. Iowa 1975); Larson, Sex Discrimination as to Maternity Benefits, 1975 Duke L.J. 805, 823 (1975). This view is particularly applicable where, as here, the increased cost for pregnancy benefits can hardly be termed \"devastating.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>511 F.2d 199 (3d Cir. 1975), vacated and remanded on jurisdictional grounds, 424 U.S. 737 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">d. <em>Substantial evidence of complainant\u2019s disability. </em>Lastly the school committee urges that the commission\u2019s order should be set aside on the grounds that its finding regarding the length of the complainant\u2019s disability was not supported by substantial evidence and was unwarranted by the facts on the record. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (e)-(f). Again we disagree. Between the two letters from Dr. Marcovitch and the testimony of the complainant herself, the commission had sufficient evidence from which to find that her pregnancy-related disability had lasted six weeks. Indeed, the school committee presented no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Yet, the school committee contends that it was denied its right to a fair hearing under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 10, when Dr. Marcovitch failed to appear at the adjudicatory proceeding after the school committee had properly request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ed that he be subpoenaed by the commission.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Significantly, the school committee does not allege that the commission either wilfully or negligently failed to issue the requested subpoena; and, in the present posture of the case, we must assume that the subpoena was actually issued. Viewed in this light, the school committee\u2019s inability to cross-examine Zettlemoyer\u2019s physician cannot be characterized as a deprivation of procedural rights. Once having issued the subpoena, the commission was under no further obligation to enforce it. Rather, the school committee was itself fully capable of requiring Dr. Marcovitch\u2019s attendance by seeking an order in the Superior Court. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 12 (5).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Since the school committee chose not to request a recess in commission proceedings in order to pursue its statutory remedy, it would be inappropriate for us to grant relief at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Finding no error in the commission\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, nor in its proceedings, we remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of judgment affirming the commission\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-11\"> General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1965, c. 397, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6, declares it to be an unlawful practice \"[flor an employer, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>himself or his agent, because of the race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, age, or ancestry of any individual, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-5\"> Article XVII of the collective bargaining agreement states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\"SICK LEAVE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\"A.
