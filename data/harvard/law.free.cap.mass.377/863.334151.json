L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, involves the scope of the payment bond which prime contractors are required to provide as surety for work done on public projects. Specifically, we are asked to determine whether the trustees of employee fringe benefit funds may maintain an action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the general con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>tractor\u2019s surety, when the employer primarily liable for contributions to these funds is a \"sub-subcontractor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Superior Court judge granted the defendant surety company\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, Mass. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)j 365 Mass. 754 (1974), \"it appearing upon the allegations of the complaint that the plaintiffs have no contractual relationship with either the contractor principal on the bond or a subcontractor and thus are not within the protection of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29.\u201d The plaintiff trustees (trustees)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">For the purpose of ruling on a motion to dismiss, the allegations of the complaint are to be taken as true. <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., ante </em>37, 39 (1979). They are essentially as follows. Harvey Construction Co., Inc. (Harvey), was the general contractor on a public works construction project at the Essex Water Pollution Control Plant in Salem, Massachusetts. In accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, Harvey as principal and The Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (Hartford) as surety executed a bond to guarantee the payment of labor, materials, health, welfare, pension and other obligations in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>curred by Harvey, and its affiliates and subcontractors, on the construction project in question. Harvey, as general contractor, subcontracted with William M. Collins Co., Inc. (Collins), for a portion of the construction work, and Collins, in turn, subcontracted with HEMCO Corporation (HEMCO).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">From March, 1975, through October, 1975, HEMCO employed sheet metal workers at the Essex jobsite. Under a collective bargaining agreement between the Sheet Metal Workers Local Union No. 17 and an employer association, HEMCO was obligated to pay over amounts withheld from employees\u2019 wages for the union\u2019s vacation fund, and to contribute to the union\u2019s insurance and pension funds. HEMCO failed to turn over to the union any of these sums.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trustees thereafter sought payment from both Collins and Harvey, sending demand letters which met all the requirements of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. When payment was refused, this suit against Hartford was brought in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">We stated in <em>American Air Filter Co. </em>v. <em>Innamorati Bros., </em>358 Mass. 146, 150 (1970), that \u201c[a]n examination of the many decisions construing and applying G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, and the several predecessor statutes now merged therein reveals repeated statements that the statutes were intended to protect laborers and materialmen from nonpayment by contractors and subcontractors engaged in the construction of public buildings or public works.\u201d Hartford contends that through an amendment inserted by St. 1972, c. 774, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Legislature clearly limited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>scope of protection offered by the statute. Specifically, Hartford argues that, by virtue of the amendment, the statute now precludes claims against the surety bond by employees of a sub-subcontractor engaged in work on the project. We disagree with this contention for reasons which follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">A view of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, in its historical perspective is essential to our analysis. As we made clear in <em>Massachusetts Gas &amp; Elec. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Rugo Constr. Co., </em>321 Mass. 20, 22-23 (1947), the statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is an outgrowth of the mechanics\u2019 lien statutes. See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, </em>204 Mass. 494, 503-508 (1910). Recognizing that a lien in favor of those furnishing labor or materials with respect to public buildings or other public works was unavailable, <em>Lessard </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>171 Mass. 294 (1898), we stated that \u00a7 29<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> affords these parties the benefit of the security taken by bond or otherwise by the public contracting party. \"The object of these statutes is to give those furnishing labor and materials 'security equivalent to the lien which the law creates upon the property of other owners in like cases.\u2019 <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Massachusetts School for Feeble-Minded, </em>197 Mass. 357, 360 [1908].\u201d <em>Massachusetts Gas &amp; Elec. Supply Co., supra </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>In <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, supra, </em>the court surveyed the general lien law of this Commonwealth with respect to the protection granted subcontractors,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> laborers, and materialmen. \"Suffice it to say that a lien is given whether the lienor be the original contractor, a subcontractor of any degree, or simply a laborer or material man.... It is necessary only that the work be within the scope of the work called for by the parent contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504-505. The court continued, <em>id. </em>at 506: \"It is to be borne in mind, also, that, whatever may be the distinction in the lien laws of other States between subcontractors on the one hand and laborers and mere material men on the other, in our general lien law, as is above stated, there are no such distinctions, much less are there any between subcontractors of different degrees.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Having explored the contours of the general lien law, the <em>Friedman </em>court delineated the scope of St. 1878, c. 209, one of the precursors of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29: \"In a word, whoever is a creditor of either the original contractor or of a subcontractor of any degree, for labor performed or furnished, or for materials furnished and actually used in the public work is within the protection of the statute <em>...Id. </em>at 507.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Faced with this pronouncement of the court, left undisturbed for almost seventy years, Hartford takes the position that the Legislature intended to curtail the scope of coverage set forth in <em>Friedman </em>through the enactment of the 1972 amendments to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. Specifically, Hartford focuses on the following language inserted in the third paragraph of \u00a7 29 \u2014 \"Any claimant having a contractual relationship with a subcontractor performing labor or both performing labor and furnishing materials <em>pursuant to a contract with the general contractor </em>but no contractual relationship with the contractor principal furnishing the bond shall have the right to enforce any such claim as provided in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph (2) only if such claimant gives written notice to the contractor principal within sixty-five days\u201d (emphasis supplied) \u2014 as demonstrative of the legislative intention that the protections of the statute extended only to employees of subcontractors in direct privity with the general contractor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>In declining to accept Hartford\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language, we adhere to our oft-repeated determination that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, \"be given a broad or liberal construction to accomplish its intended purpose.\u201d <em>American Air Filter Co. </em>v. <em>Innamorati Bros., </em>358 Mass. 146, 150 (1970).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>M. Lasden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Decker Elec. Corp., </em>372 Mass. 179 (1977). The amendment on which Hartford relies is essentially procedural in nature. As we noted in <em>Manganaro Drywall, Inc. </em>v. <em>White Constr. Co., </em>372 Mass. 661, 664 (1977), \"The heading of [St. 1972, c. 774, \u00a7 5] is instructive in identifying its legislative purpose: 'An Act expediting payments to general contractors and to subcontractors and improving the flow of funds in the construction industry.\u2019 \u201d The Legislature is presumed to have been cognizant of the expansive definition of \"subcontractor\u201d set forth in such cases as <em>Friedman </em>and its progeny. It is unlikely that it intended to implement so substantial a curtailment of statutory protection for laborers and materialmen by virtue of an amendment which describes the notice prerequisites to the filing of a claim on the bond.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Significantly, the fundamental statutory language in the first paragraph of \u00a7 29, which requires that a bond be secured \"for payment by the contractor <em>and subcontractors </em>for labor performed or furnished\u201d was left unmodified<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied). Had the Legislature wished to abridge the broad definition of \"subcontractors,\u201d as that term appears in the sections of the first paragraph of \u00a7 29 pertinent here, it could easily have done so. See St. 1962, c. 696, which inserted in the first paragraph of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, a provision \"for payment of transportation charges for materials used or employed therein which are consigned to the contractor or to a <em>subcontractor who has a direct contractual relationship with the contractor\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Instead, it chose not to tamper with those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">We do not construe the words, \"[a]ny claimant having a contractual relationship with a <em>subcontractor performing </em>... <em>pursuant to a contract with the general contractor\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), as barring all claims against a subcontractor not in direct privity with the general contractor. Contrary to Hartford\u2019s assertions, performance \"pursuant to a contract\u201d need not imply a relationship of direct privity. Rather, it more generally signifies acts done in accordance with, by reason of, in agreement with, or in the prosecution of, the contract. See <em>Old Colony </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>301 U.S. 379 (1937); <em>Suppiger </em>v. <em>Enking, </em>60 Idaho 292 (1939); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1401 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). Ultimately, a sub-subcontractor who performs a portion of the contract performs it \"pursuant to a contract with the general contractor,\u201d although his relationship with that contract is indirect. Cf. <em>J.W. Bateson Co. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Bd. of Trustees, </em>434 U.S. 586, 601-602 n.13 (1978) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">While convinced that the statutory history and language require the result reached in this case, we also find that result to be warranted by a pragmatic analysis. First, we note that a contrary holding, limiting claims to those of laborers and materialmen employed by first-level subcontractors, could make possible an effective subversion of the broadly remedial statutory purpose. By creating \"straw\u201d subcontractors, who then contracted with sub-subcontractors for the actual performance of the work (including hiring of laborers and buying materials from materialmen), the general contractor could insulate the surety from \u00a7 29 claims on the bond. See <em>Mississippi Road Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Western Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>246 Mass. 510 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The result we reach does not necessarily impose burdensome liabilities on sureties for a long chain of relationships. General contractors may refuse to deal with subcontractors who do not indemnify them against remote claims, and they may even require a bond from each contractor. \"If the prime contractor wants to protect himself against loss caused by subcontractors, he can <em>'secure himself against loss by requiring the subcontractors to give security by bond, or otherwise, for the payment of those who contract directly with the subcontractors. </em>...\u2019 <em>F.D. Rich Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 123 [1974]..., <em>quoting MacEvoy Co. </em>v. <em>United States, ... </em>322 U.S. [102] at 110 [1944]... (emphasis by the <em>Rich </em>Court). And if he permits subcontractors to further subcontract, such permission can be made contingent on similar security being provided by the sub-subcontractor.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>J.W. Bateson Co., </em>551 F.2d 1284, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (Wright, J., concurring), rev\u2019d, 434 U.S. 586 (1978). Cf. <em>American Air Filter Co. </em>v. <em>Innamorati Bros., </em>358 Mass. at 153-154; St. 1960, c. 771, \u00a7 6, which amended G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Finally, the result we reach furthers the public policy of ensuring security for all laborers working at a public project site, and thereby promotes the unhampered completion of such projects. We decline to drive \"a wedge between employees working side by side on tasks equally vital to 'the prosecution of the work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bateson, </em>434 U.S. at 595 (Stevens, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The judge\u2019s order granting the motion to dismiss is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-14\"> The pertinent portion of G.

Co., </em>321 Mass. 20, 22-23 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b883-5\"> A subcontractor, as described in <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, </em>204 Mass. 494, 501-502 (1910), is \" 'one who has entered into a contract, express or implied, for the performance of an act with a person who has already contracted for its performance.\u2019 Phillips on Mechanics\u2019 Liens, (3d ed.) \u00a7 44. In this general sense it is manifest that often, especially in building contracts, there may be a great difference in the remoteness of the subcontracts in their relation to what may be called the original or parent contract____Each is a subcontractor, but there are differences of degree with respect to their remoteness from the parent contract.\u201d Under the <em>Friedman </em>analysis, then, the term \"subcontractor\u201d encompasses as within its scope a \"sub-subcontractor.\u201d See <em>Bumb </em>v. <em>Petersmith Controls, Inc., </em>377 F.2d 817 (9th Cir. 1967); <em>Kobayashi </em>v. <em>Meehleis Steel Co., </em>28 Colo.

For example, in <em>Hey Kiley Man, Inc. </em>v. <em>Azalea Gardens Apartments, </em>333 So. 2d 48, 50 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976), the court stated: \"We therefore read the term 'subcontractor\u2019 within the provisions of [Florida\u2019s Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law] to include anyone not in privity with the owner performing a portion of a contract to enhance realty; and we see no sense in drawing an arbitrary line cutting off would-be lienors, based on degrees of remoteness from privity, assuming the protective notice requirement for perfecting a lien pursuant to [the lien law].\u201d See <em>Bumb </em>v. <em>Petersmith Controls, Inc., supra; South-Way Constr.

L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. See, e.g., <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>262 Mich. 401 (1933); <em>Mississippi Road Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Western Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>246 Miss. 510 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b884-9\"> Hartford\u2019s position would appear to be bolstered by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>J. W. Bateson Co. </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Bd. of Trustees, </em>434 U.S. 586 (1978), which interprets the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270a (1976) (the Federal analog to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29), as regards the same issue we face in this case. In <em>Bateson, </em>a majority of the Court decided that the word \"subcontractor\u201d must be limited in meaning to one who contracts with a prime contractor. In reaching a conclusion contrary to that we reach here, however, the Court relied heavily on an arguably ambiguous statement in the committee reports related to the original Miller Act. See <em>id. </em>at 591; <em>id. </em>at 603-605 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Our examination of the legislative history incident to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, uncovers no parallel statement. Further, the Supreme Court rested the <em>Bateson </em>holding on its concern for the expectations of parties which, it stated, had been led to assume that the employees of a subcontractor would not be protected by the Miller Act payment bond, based on a \"well-settled body\u201d of Federal law.
