Roeser was a stockholder and a borrower from the defendant association to the amount of $2,600, for which loan he gave his bond and mortgage, dated May 7, 1897, on his leasehold situate in the city of Allegheny; that on April 25, 1900, he assigned said leasehold to Peter and J. F. Relin ; that about the same date he assigned to them his twenty-six shares of stock in the association; all of which was done with the knowledge and consent of defendant. That the plaintiffs have, from April 14, 1897, to February 5, 1905, paid to the defendant upon the mortgage ninety-four months\u2019 dues upon the stock at the rate of $18.00 each month, or fifty cents upon each share, amounting to- $1,222; and during the same time ninety-three monthly premiums of $13.00 each, being 'at the rate of fifty cents per share of $100, as fixed by the by-laws, amounting to $1,209; and also ninety-three monthly installments of interest of $13.00 each, amounting to $1,209, and that the defendant has credited the plaintiff with $353.24 dividends, altogether amounting to $3,993.24. That the premiums are illegal, and that the plaintiffs are therefore entitle'd to have said sums of $13.00 monthly paid as premiums credited to the principal as of the date of payment, and either to have the interest correspondingly reduced as of the date of payment or to have interest on account of said payments of premiums, from the date of payments, added to their credit. That all these payments have more than paid the amount of the mortgage, but that defendant claims there is a balance of $1,084.76 still due from plaintiffs to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">The prayers are to permit plaintiffs to pay into court the sum of $1,084.76, the balance claimed by defendant, and therefore the mortgage be ordered satisfied; that an account be stated between the plaintiffs and the defendant, and if any balance be found due to the defendant that it be paid out of the money in court; but if the mortgage be found to be overpaid, then the amount of overpayment to be paid by defendant to plaintiffs and the money in court returned to plaintiffs. The money was paid into court and the mortgage was satisfied of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>This raises practically the single question, \u201c Are the premiums illegal ? \u201d If they are legal, then the money in court must be paid to the defendant. If they are not legal, then an account must be stated, which will raise the subsidiary questions as to whether or not plaintiffs are entitled to have the payments of premiums applied to the reduction of principal and to have interest upon such payments, or its equivalent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-4\">The facts bearing upon the question of the payment of premiums show that John J. Roeser, desiring a loan of $2,600 upon his leasehold, applied to the defendant, and by the direction of the defendant became a subscriber for twenty-six shares of stock of defendant association at the par value of $100 each, and that thereupon he signed a written application for the loan, stating the value of the leasehold and improvements, rental value, and many other particulars as to it.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">There is some evidence that Roeser authorized Waldschmidt, a director of the association, through whom he was negotiating for the loan, to attend to all matters for him, including the bidding for the money, although there was no written authority presented as proof in this case. The evidence also indicates that Waldschmidt appeared at the meeting and bid fifty cents for each $100 borrowed, or $13.00 per month for the money, although there is no evidence showing that there were any other bidders present or that there was any competitive bidding whatever for the money. Section 39 of the by-laws of the association contains the provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">\u201c The rate of interest on all loans shall be 6 per cent, per annum, and the premium shall be fixed at fifty cents per month for each $100 borowed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">From the evidence we conclude that the loan was made to the plaintiff at a premium of fifty cents per month on each $100 borrowed, without any lower bid having been asked for and without any competition in the bidding whatever. Under the rule in the case of Stiles\u2019s Appeal, 95 Pa. 122, this is illegal and usurious, and can be set up by way of defense in an action against a borrowing stockholder. If it can be there set up, there can be no question that in a proceeding in equity to have the mortgage satisfied and the incumbrance removed from the property, the court will state an account and apply the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>rules as though it were a defense to the mortgage or bond or an action to recover the loan. If this be so, then the only question is whether the act of June 4, 1901, \u201c conferring upon mutual savings fund or building and loan associations, now incorporated or hereafter to be incorporated, the right to receive, in writing, bids of premium for priority, and making valid all such bids heretofore accepted,\u201d affects this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-3\">It is true that the act provides, \u201c And all such bids heretofore accepted by any such associations, and loans made thereon, are hereby confirmed and made valid; and no premium or bonus heretofore collected, or which may be hereafter payable on such loans, shall be deemed usurious by reason of the fact that any such bid was made or authorized in writing ; \u201d but we do not think the act permits the money to be loaned at a premium unless there is competitive bidding. It may have been intended to do away with competition, and so meet the condition in Stiles\u2019s Appeal and the other cases since that time. It does authorize submission of bids in writing, but does not authorize the practice of fixing a minimum premium, and receiving no bids below that, or of awarding the money at the premium bid, unless there were no other bids either in writing or by viva voce made for the money. In short, it does not warrant the charge of a premium unless there was competitive bidding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\">The language of Judge Shabswood, \u201c They are bound to offer all that is in the treasury to open competition, so that members may obtain a loan at a low premium, if there should be no bid at a higher \u201d (Stiles\u2019s Appeal, 9,5 Pa. 122), is just as true to-day as it was when written, notwithstanding the act of June 4, 1901. Nor can the defendant set up in answer to the claim of usury that each payment of the premium was a distinct transaction, and -that the limitation would run from that time, and thus prevent the plaintiff from setting it up as a defense to the mortgage. Stiles\u2019s Appeal is authority for the rule that it can be set up. Plaintiffs claim also that they are entitled to interest upon the premiums paid, as their payment was a reduction of the amount of the principal, and that therefore they have paid interest on money which had been paid. We cannot sustain that claim. Section 21 of defendant\u2019s bylaws, \u201c Exhibit No. 1,\u201d provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201cRunning stock shall be paid for in monthly installments of fifty or seventy-five cents per share, with the privilege to members of paying additional sums at any time and receiving credit therefor, together with interest at the rate of 6 per cent, for the average time, amounts so paid are in advance. Installments are due and payable on the last day of each and every month until the stock matures.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\">But this certainly applies to payments made by members upon stock and receiving credit therefor at the time of such payment. The plaintiffs neither said at the time of bidding the premium that they were to be applied to the stock, nor did they request any credit therefor, nor did either the plaintiffs or the defendant eyer suppose when the payments of premium were made that they were to be applied to the stock, but both supposed they were just what they purported to be, the payments of premium for the loan, in addition to the interest; and it was not likely that, until this case was prepared for filing, the plaintiffs ever supposed that the premiums were illegal. The plaintiffs, having come into a court of equity, must do equity, and it would be against equity to charge the defendant with interest, ignorant as it was that it was receiving monej^ upon which interest would be required, and especially after it has distributed this money in dividends to the stockholders. Plaintiffs \u00e1re clearly estopped by their application for the loan, by the bond wherein Roeser promises for himself, and, if he was acting for the other plaintiffs, promises for them to pay the premiums, and having paid them, while the law will allow him to have credit for them upon the loan, it will not enrich him by awarding him damages; that is, interest for his voluntary payments, even though they were illegal. The plaintiffs having waived at trial all right to any part of the dividends or profits, this credit allowed them by the computation of defendant will not be allowed. All that plaintiffs are entitled to have credit for is the amount paid by way of premiums, \u00a71,209, which will be applied to reducing the principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">From the pleadings in this case, and the evidence, the court finds the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">FINDINGS OF FACT.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">1. The defendant, the German National Building and Loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Association, is an association incorporated under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-3\">2. The 89th section of the by-laws of this association provide:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\">\u201c Loans will be made as fast as the funds of the associ\u00e1tion will permit. Members holding stock upon which three months\u2019 installments have been paid are entitled to borrow on proper security the face value of their stock, or $100 per share. The rate of interest on all loans shall be fixed at fifty cents per month for each $100 borrowed. In addition to the interest and premium, the monthly installment paid by the borrower shall be fifty or seventy-five cents' per share, and from such payment the premium and interest due on the loan shall be deducted and the balance credited as an installment on the stock on which the loan is borrowed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">3. John J. Roeser, of plaintiffs, became a stockholder of twenty-six shares of the par value of $100 each of the stock of the defendant association in April, 1897, and about the same time applied for a loan of $2,600, for which latter, on May 15, 1897, he gave his bond and mortgage, by which he became bound to pay defendant association monthly the sum of $13.00 upon his twenty-six shares of stock, $13.00 interest upon his loan pf $2,600 and $13.00 premium for the loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">4. That John J. Roeser assigned his stock to Peter and J. F. Rehn, his coplaintiffs, some time in April, 1900, and they, with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, assumed the payment of the loan, at the same time taking an assignment of the leasehold, on which the mortgage was an incumbrance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">5. That John J. Roeser, Peter Rehn and J. F. Rehn from April 14, 1897, to February 5,1905, have paid into the association the following sums of money: dues upon the twenty-six shares of stock, being for ninety-four months at $13.00 per month, $1,222; ninety-three monthly premiums of $13.00 each, $1,209, making a sum of $2,431; ninety-three monthly installments of interest of $13.00 each, $1,209 ; and that they, Peter Rehn and J. F. Rehn, were at that time furnished with a statement showing the balance of $2,172.93 claimed by the association upon the loan, and that they continued thereafter to pay said dues, premiums and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">6. That at the time of making application for the loan John J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Roeser authorized Frederick Waldschmidt, a director of the defendant association, and through whom he was trying to borrow money, to bid a premium for him of fifty cents per month on each $100 borrowed, and .that Waldschmidt did so bid at the regular and open meeting of the board of directors of the association ; and the money was thereupon awarded to Roeser; and that Waldschmidt reported this action to Roeser, who thereupon signed the bond, mortgage and other necessary papers and commenced and continued the payments of dues, premiums and interest, as set out in the fifth finding of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-3\">7. That at the meeting when the bid of Roeser was submitted by Waldschmidt no other person bid for the money, and no other bid was offered for the money, and the money was awarded to Roeser upon his bid of fifty cents per month for each $100 borrowed, although no other bid was made for the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-4\">8. That prior to the filing of the bill in this case none of said plaintiffs ever either requested or demanded that the money paid as premiums should be applied to the stock or mortgage debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">9.
