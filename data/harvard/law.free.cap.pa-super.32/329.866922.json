B. Browne, to wit: on or about September 24, 1902, sold to the defendant a carload (3,000 gallons) of Carrara paint at the usual and customary market price, and the said Browne, agent for the plaintiff, informed defendant at and before the time of the said sale that the usual and customary market price for said paint was $1.25 per gallon in carload lots f. o. b. Philadelphia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-4\">Defendant received the said paint on or about November 7, 1902. The defendant paid on account of the price of said paint, before the acceptance of the draft set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, the following amounts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">November 7, 1902, I 88.73</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AP9\">December 1, \u201c 33.87</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AK3\">.

Philadelphia; and that after accepting the draft he learned, and now avers, that the usual and customary price for this paint in carload lots, F. O.B. Philadelphia at the time the contract was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>made, was $1.05, and not $1.25 per gallon and remained at that figure until his affidavit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The contract was entire, and the price as averred in the affidavit was not at so much per gallon, but at the market price per gallon, whatever that might have been. The defendant does not seek to avoid the contract but insists upon its performance on its true terms, hence he is not prejudiced by his payments made on account of the claim after the acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s draft on him. He gave prompt notice of his defense as soon as he learned that he had been misled by the statement of plaintiff\u2019s agent: Fischer v. Dalmas, 173 Pa. 296 ; Hubbard v. French, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 218. Moreover, this contest is between the original parties to the contract, and the only question is as to what were its terms. On defendant\u2019s own showing he was liable to pay at the rate of $1.05 per gallon; and his defense relates only to the excessive charge which the plaintiff claims, that which was over and above the usual and customary market rate. Usually buyer and seller are dealing at arm\u2019s length, and there is no confidence between them unless a warranty is demanded and given. \u201c They use not each others eyes, but each his own. The seller is allowed to express freely his opinion of the value of his wares; the buyer is at equal liberty to answer that it is naught. If there is an intentional concealment or suppression by either party of material facts which he is bound to communicate to the other, there is fraud ; but neither party is bound to communicate that which is equally accessible to both. The state of the markets, the present and prospective value of a particular commodity, are among the things which are alike open to both buyer and seller, and neither is bound to instruct the other \u201d is the rule laid down in Rockafellow v. Baker, 41 Pa. 319. However, that was a case where a recission of an executed contract was contended for, and the defense related to the quality or value of the article. Under the averments of this affidavit it must be held that \u201c the usual and customary market price \u201d for the paint at the time the contract was made with the defendant was the price per gallon at which the plaintiff was then selling the article to other dealers ; which per gallon price was a substantive fact and was well known to the plaintiff; if the agent represented that \u201c the usual and customary market price \u201d was $1.25, whilst in fact it was but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>$1.05 per gallon, it was a false representation of a fact, intentionally made for the purpose of defrauding the defendant; which it is averred, was the inducement to the making of the contract: Smith, Kline &amp; French Co. v. O. Smith, 166 Pa. 563; Goodwin v. Schott, 159 Pa. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">We are to assume that the facts stated in the affidavit are true; if they are so, the defense is sufficiently set out to prevent a summary judgment, and put the plaintiff to the proof of his claim. The judgment is rev ersed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
