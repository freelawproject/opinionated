S. 0.</author>\n<p id=\"AM2\">Plaintiff appeals from a ruling of the President of the Civil Service Commission of the Department of Civil Service in a \u201cletter decision\u201d dated June 7, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In the spring of 1950, the then chief engineer of the Irving-ton fire department was retired, effective as of May 15, 1950. There were only three persons, including plaintiff, eligible to take the promotion test for the position of chief engineer. In the forenoon of May 16, 1950, Commissioner Balentine, director of public safety, appointed plaintiff to the position of chief engineer. The commissioner\u2019s term of office expired at noon that day. The plaintiff was sworn in on the forenoon of May 16, 1950, by the town clerk of Irvington and proceeded to discharge the duties of chief engineer. Commissioner Ilausmann, who succeeded Commissioner Balentine as director of public safety, commenced his term of office at noon on May 16, 1950. He forthwith directed plaintiff to relinquish the duties of chief engineer and designated one of the eligible persons, Ziegenfus, to be acting chief engineer. On the same day. Commissioner Hausmann notified the Civil Service Commission of Ziegenfus\u2019 appointment and requested that an examination be held for the position of chief engineer. On June 7, 1950, in reply to a protest from plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the President of the Civil Service Commission informed him by letter that he refused to approve the appointment of the plaintiff and directed that a promotional examination be held. The letter concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201cThe question whether I have exercised my authority wisely in the Irvington case is one to which T have a complete answer. This appointment by Director Balentine was a \u2018midnight appointment.\u2019 That is to say, it was attempted in the closing hours of Ms term of office. Since the day when Thomas Jefferson succeeded John Adams as President of the United States, \u2018midnight appointments\u2019 have been denounced by all who believe in sound government. If I have in this instance exercised the small powers vested in me by law to thwart a \u2018midnight appointment,\u2019 I have made some contribution to good government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The agreed statement of facts discloses no communication in reference to the appointment of plaintiff with the President of the Civil Service Commission prior to plaintiff\u2019s promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Plaintiff contends that in view of the provisions of Rule 24 of the Civil Service Commission, the action of the president was an abuse of discretion in not approving the appointment of plaintiff to the position of chief engineer of the Irvington fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>R. S. </em>11:4-2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201cAppointments to and promotions in the civil service of the state shall be made only according to merit and fitness, to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examinations, competitive, if practicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Under authority granted by <em>R. S. </em>11:5-1 (a), as am. <em>L. </em>1944, <em>c. </em>65, <em>p. </em>128, \u00a7 10, the Civil Service Commission adopted Rule 24, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">\u201cWhen there are not more than three persons eligible to take the promotion test, or not more than three of those who are eligible file an application to take such test, and the preference rights of veterans will not be affected, the President may, in his discretion, authorize such promotion without competitive test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The competitive system, as a means of ascertaining \u201cmerit and fitness\u201d of applicants for promotion, embodies the basic statutory policy. See <em>Davaillon v. </em>Elizabeth, 121 <em>N. J. L. </em>380, 385 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938). The power of appointment to positions in the classified service is limited either by competitive tests under <em>R. S. </em>11:4r-2 or by authorization from the president under Rule 24. Rule 24 vests no power in the appointing authority to ignore the requirement of a competitive examination, but rather permits the President of the Civil Service Commission, under certain circumstances, to authorize a promotion without a competitive test. The rule imposes no obligation on the president to exercise his discretion to approve or disapprove an appointment already made, but it does require authorization from the president as a prerequisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to an appointment in the absence of a competitive test. In the present case, the appointment- of plaintiff having been made without a competitive examination and without the authorization above mentioned, we conclude that the retiring director of public safety, Balentine, was without power to appoint the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Moreover, the act of the president, of which plaintiff complains, occurred on June 7, 1950. Before that date the existing appointing authority (Commissioner Ilausmann) had requested a promotional examination, which request had been granted. Under these circumstances we find there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The action of the President of the Civil Service Commission is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
