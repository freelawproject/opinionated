L. Smith,.in the above entitled and numbered cause, and moves the court to grant him a new trial and set aside the verdict and judment rendered herein against him on the 25th day of March, A. D. 1912, for the following reasons, to-wit: The verdict of the jury in said cause was contrary to the law and the evidence.\u201d It is thus seen the only ground in the motion is the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence. Taking into consideration the testimony of Mr. J. M. Nash, together with defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, the evidence is ample to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">The term of court at which appellant was tried adjourned May 15, ' 1912. Three months thereafter appellant seeks to assign other grounds by filing assignments of error on August 15, 1912. Being filed after adjournment of court, these grounds cannot be considered by this court on appeal. (Sue v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 122.) The reason for this rule has been so frequently discussed we deem it unnecessary to do so again.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-18\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
