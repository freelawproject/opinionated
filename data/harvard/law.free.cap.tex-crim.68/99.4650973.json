It appears that when complaint was filed the officer in affixing his jurat left off the year, the jurat reading: \u201cSubscribed and sworn to before me this 31st day of August, A. D. 190...\u201d The county attorney, before trial, requested the permission of the court to have the officer amend and correct his jurat, which l\u00e9ave was granted by the court, and the officer before whom the complaint was sworn to amended his jurat to read as follows: \u201cSubscribed and sworn to before me this 31st day of August, 1911.\u201d This was permissible, and the. court did not err in permitting the jurat to be amended.
