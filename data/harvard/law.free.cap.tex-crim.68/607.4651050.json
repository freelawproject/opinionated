The appellant in his motion for new trial complains that the court should have submitted the lesser degree of murder than murder in the first degree in his charge. Without a statement of facts we cannot determine whether this should have been done or not, but from the nature of the offense \u2014 murder in an attempt to rob \u2014 we are inclined to think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>if the facts were before us we would hold that the court properly only submitted murder in the first degree. There are many other grounds in the motion- for new trial, but in the condition the record is in nothing is presented for us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
