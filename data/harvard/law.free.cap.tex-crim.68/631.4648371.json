After the expiration of the license the testimony would show that in traveling he only sold peppers, spices, soaps and flavorings, at the same time advertising the remedies, but would not sell the same from the wagon. Without some evidence that he sold these remedies while acting as a traveling salesman, the judgment cannot be sustained. It is evident that after the expiration of his license he continued to drive about the country in the Watkins\u2019 wagon, but there is no evidence that he made a sale of any character of medicine, and under these circumstances the verdict of the jury was unauthorized, for the tax is not levied on one selling spices, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">We do not deem it necessary to discuss the other questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">\n<em>Beversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
