The law requires that the Judge who tried the case shall approve the bond. See Art 904, supra. This would render the appeal bond insufficient and not in compliance with the statute. Appellant was released from custody on this bond. Under the law, as it is, the bond being insufficient, this appeal will be dismissed, and it is accordingly so ordered. <em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
