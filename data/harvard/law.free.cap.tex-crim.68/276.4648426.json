When tried he was convicted of embezzlement of an amount less than fifty dollars \u2014 a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">After adjournment of court he attempts to perfect his appeal to this court by filing an appeal bond, not having entered into a recognizance during the term. Having been convicted of a misdemeanor only, the law does not authorize an appeal to be perfected by giving an appeal bond. (Art. 918, Code of Criminal Procedure; Herron v. State, 27 Texas, 337; Cook v. State, 8 Texas Crim. App., 671.)
