The two charges both relate to the same matter, and both were sufficiently presented in the court\u2019s main charge. The State\u2019s witness testified that he purchased a bottle of whisky from appellant and paid him one dollar for it. The defendant testified that the State\u2019s witness asked him for a drink and he handed him the bottle, and the State\u2019s witness kept it, paying him nothing for it. The court in his charge required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant made a sale of the whisky to the prosecuting witness, or they would acquit. \"Whether or not a sale was made was the sole issue, the State\u2019s witness affirming that a sale was made, while defendant denied this fact. As before stated, this issue was presented in a way that appellant would have and must have been acquitted unless the jury believed a sale was made, and under such circumstances the failure to give the special charges present no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-20\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
