The defendants thereupon moved the court to grant them a new trial; but the court overruled the motion. And the plaintiff' by his attorney then in open court released five dollars, parcel of the damages found by the verdict of the jury; and the court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants for. four hundred and ninety-five dollars, the residue of the damages found by the jury, with interest from that day, and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-12\">The defendants objected to the release of the five dollars, part of the damages ; but the court overruled the objection, and permitted it to be done: and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-13\">The defendants had taken several other exceptions in the progress of the trial; and applied to a judge of this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>for a supersedeas to the judgment; which was awarded.

Therefore, it is adjudged and ordered that the motion to dismiss the case for the want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment of the court below is for less than five hundred dollars, be overruled, and that the defendants recover against the plaintiff in the said motion, their costs by them about their defence in the same expended.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
