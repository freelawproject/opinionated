Carr, against his wife, Ascenith Ann Carr, for a divorce a mensa et thoro, and the recovery of the child of the marriage. The only ground on which the divorce was asked was desertion. This was admitted in the answer, and proved in the cause. The defendant insisted that she went with his consent. The parties, who seem to have been raised within a half mile of each other, were married on the 20th of May 1867. A female child was born 'x'to them on the 7th of April 1868; and on the 12th of Juljr she left her husband, taking her child with her, and went to her father\u2019s house, where she has since lived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">Thomas I). Carr was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and he had three sisters. At the time of his marriage he lived with his mother, and, probably, one sister, on a farm in which the mother was entitled to dower, which had not been laid off to her; and subject to her dower, it was the property of Thomas E- Carr and his sisters. He took his wife to this house, where they continued to live until she left him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-14\">Thomas E. Carr was honest, industrious, sober, and correct in his dealings; but he was penurious, selfish, illtempered, and unsocial. His wife, who seems to have been quite young, was virtuous, correct, of affectionate temper, fond of her friends, social in her nature, and withal spirited, and quick to feel. It is easy to imagine that the lives of two persons so unlike in disposition, and yet so closely united, would not glide on without a ripple. Their collisions seem to have been frequent. He was sometimes rude and dictatorial in his speech to her, and exacting in his demands, and sometimes unkind and negligent in his treatment of her, even when she was sick, or worn and weary with watching and nursing their sick child. She, on the other hand, was quick to feel his treatment, not very patient to bear it, nor with the self-denial to endeavor to accommodate herself to his disposition and wishes. The consequence of these disagreements was, that she twice left him. The first time she returned after a day or two, upon his request. The second time she has remained away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-15\">There are letters from the husband to the wife, filed by him, urging her to return to him, and assuring her of his continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>affection. The first is dated November 3d, 1868, and to this he received no answer. The second is dated March 2Sth, 1869, and to this he received a'reply, with a very decided refusal to return, *and which evinces that she was still smarting under the ill treatment she at least considered she had received. The third is dated March 20th, \u201971. In this he tells her that from the day she left him\u2014then nearly three years\u2014to the present time, there had been no hour in which he would not gladly have taken her back to his home and his heart. He says the time is near at hand for the hearing of their case, and he beseeches her to come back and let him prove to her that he can and will be her loving and devoted husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\">The cause came on to be heard on the 24th of April 1871, when the court made a decree giving to the plaintiff a divorce a mensa et thoro from the defendant, and giving to him the custody of the child, and refusing alimony to the wife. And leave was granted to either party to come into the court and apply for any further relief in the cause. Erom this decree Mrs. Carr obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-5\">Harrison, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-6\">Hunton, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b70-24\">Husband and Wife\u2014Legal Grounds for Wife\u2019s Desertion.\u2014Desertion is a breach of matrimonial duty, and is composed, first, of the breaking off of matrimonial co-habitation; and, secondly, an intent to desert in the mind of the offender. Both, must combine to make the desertion complete, and a mere separation by mutual consent is not a desertion by either party. Latham v. Latham, 30 Gratt. 307, and <em>note. </em>In Harris v. Harris, 31 Gratt. 13, it was held that the circumstances must be very peculiar indeed, if any such case there could be, which j ustifying a decree for an absolute divorce in behalf of the husband for wilful desertion of the wife, would at the same time warrant a decree in her behalf.

Latham v. Latham, 30 Gratt. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Origin of Alimony.\u2014\u201cAlimony had its origin in the legal obligation of the husband, incident to the marriage state, to maintain his wife in a manner suited to his means and social position.\u201d Harris v. Harris. 31 Gratt. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Amount of Alimony\u2014Discretion of Court\u2014General Rule.\u2014Says the court, in Bailey v. Bailey, 21 G ratt. 57. \"In regard to allotment for alimony, there is no fixed rule, it is a matter within the discretion of the court. Yet. it is not an arbitrary but a judicial discretion, to be exercised in reference to established principles of law relating to the subj ect, and upon an equitable view of all the circumstances of the particular case. The general rule in respect to alimony is, that the wife is entitled to a support corresponding to her condition in life and the fortune of her husband. And in the language of Nelsok, O. X, in Burr v. Burr. 7 Hill (N. Y.) 307: 'When the delinquency of the husband has been established, and the wile is the injured party driven by his cruelty or other wrongful conduct, from the comfort of domestic enjoyments, she should be liberally supported.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">\u201cBut while alimony is commonly defined a proportion of the husband's estate, yet the duty of a husband to maintain his wife does not depend alone upon his having visible tangible property. While the parties are living together, they are bound to contribute by their several personal exertions to a common fund, which in law is the husband\u2019s, but from which the wife may claim support. If she is compelled to seek a divorce on account of his misconduct, she loses none of her rights in this respect, only she is to draw her maintenance in a different way; that is under a decree for alimony, based, if he has no property, upon his earnings or ability to earn money.\u201d Cited and approved in Miller v. Miller, 92 Va. 200, 23 S. E. Rep. 232; Harris v. Harris, 31 Gratt. 17; Cralle v. Cralle, 84 Va. 202, 6 S. E. Rep. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">income of Husband, the Fund from Which Alimony is Granted.\u2014In respect to alimony the general rule is that the income of the husband, however derived or derivable, is the fnnd from which the allowance is made. Heninger v. Heninger, 90 Va. 274, 18 S. E. Rep. 193, citing Bailey v. Bailey, 21 Gratt. 43; Cralle v. Cralle, 84 Va. 198, 6 S. E. Rep. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-18\">\u201cThe general rule undoubtedly is, that the income of the husband, whether derived or to be derived from his personal exertions or from permanent property, or from both, is the fnnd from which alimony is decreed, and the amount, as already said, will depend upon the particnlar circumstances of each case.\u201d The court, in Cralle v. Cralle, 84 Va. 202, 6 S. E. Rep. 12, citing Harris v. Harris, 31 Gratt. 13; Carr v. Carr, 22 Gratt. 168; Myers v. Myers, 83 Va. 806, 6 S. E.

Trimble v. Trimble, 97 Va. 217, 33 S. E. Rep. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Alimony Hay Be Granted Independently of a Suit for Divorce.\u2014\u201cIn Virginia the statutes allow alimony as incident to a decree for a divorce. But this court has gone farther, and held that equity has jurisdiction in an independent suit to decree in favor of the wife in proper cases\u2014as, for example, when she has heen abandoned by the husband, or driven from his house by ill treatment, and compelled to seek an asylum elsewhere.\u201d The court, In Latham v. Latham, 30 Gratt. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Alimony may be granted independently of any divorce or application for one, as where the misconduct of the husband drives the wife from her home, or he turns her out of doors, or perhaps for any cause for which a divorce <em>a mensa </em>would he granted if asked for. 1 Minor\u2019s Inst.

Almond, 4 Rand. 662, Judge Cabb, delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u201cSuppose the husband turns his wife out of doors, or treats her so cruelly that she cannot live with him; suppose him to persevere In refusing to take her back, or to provide a cent to feed and clothe her. Surely, In a civilized country, there must be some tribunal to which she may resort.

Carr, against Ascenith A. Carr, his wife, seeking a divorce a mensa et thoro, on the ground of abandonment or desertion by the wife; and seeking also to obtain the custody of his infant daughter, the only child of the marriage, who had been taken from her father\u2019s home by the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">The divorce as prayed for was granted by the court; the child was remanded to the custody of the father, and alimony was denied to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">Erom this decree an appeal was allowed to this court, and the following errors are assigned by the appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-18\">1 \u20181st, It was error to grant a divorce a mensa et thoro *upon the pleadings and proofs in this cause, it appearing therefrom that the petitioner had cause for leaving, and that she left her husband with his consent and concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-19\">1 \u20182nd, It was error not to grant something for maintenance to the petitioner, under the circumstance of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-20\">\u201c3rd, It was error to take from the petitioner, and give to the complainant, the custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-21\">\u201c4th, There was no provision for the mother to have access to her child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-22\">The questions thus presented for our consideration have been discussed with much learning and ability by counsel on both sides, and numerous authorities have been cited; hut as their solution depends on the construction of a statute of this State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>comparatively recent date, and as that statute has received judicial interpretation by this court in the case of Bailey v. Bailey, decided at Wytheville, June term, 1871, and reported 21st Gratt. 43, the court deems it unnecessary to comment in detail on the previous authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The 7th section of chapter 109, Code of 1860, p. 630, authorizing the chancery courts to decree divorces from bed and board, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u201c\u00a7 7. A divorce from bed and board may be decreed for cruelty, reasonable apprehension of bodily hurt, abandonment or desertion. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Sections 12 and 13, of same chapter, confer on the courts full power, on granting a divorce, to make such orders as may seem just and proper under the circumstances, in relation to alimony to the wife, the custody and maintenance of the minor children, and the property of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The case of Bailey v. Bailey, 21 Gratt. 43, above cited, in which this statute was considered and construed by the court, was just the converse of the case under consideration. It was a suit by the wife against the husband, ^seeking a divorce a mensa et thoro, for abandonment and desertion by the latter. The fact of desertion by the husband, proved almost exclusively by the letters of the parties, was considered by the court as satisfactorily established, and the divorce was decreed. Alimony was allowed the wife; and the custody of her only child, an infant of very tender age, was given to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">In considering that case the court say that \u201cunder our statute no particular period is prescribed in which the desertion shall continue, to entitle a party to a divorce a mensa et thoro;\u201d that the courts had not laid down \u201cany particular rules of evidence for determining whether a separation does or does not, as a matter of proof, amount to desertion. \u2019 \u2019 And they go on, very property to say, that \u201cthe question does not admit of such rules, but each case must rest on its own circumstances.\u201d But the following proposition is affirmed by the court, as the result of the English and American cases on the subject: \u201cWe think it may be safely asserted, as a general principle of law, to be extracted from the English and American cases on the subject, that wherever there is an actual breaking off of matrimonial cohabitation, combined with the intent to desert in the mind of the offender, in such case desertion is established, and the party is entitled to a divorce a mensa et thoro. \u2019 \u2019 21 Gratt. 48-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">Such being the law, there can be but little difficulty in applying it to the facts of this case. Without recapitulating those facts, which we deem wholly unnecessary, it is enough to say, that the pleadings and proofs in the cause abundantly establish \u201can actual breaking off of matrimonial cohabitation, combined with the intent to desert,\u201d on the part of the wife, without legal cause or excuse\u2014an intent deliberately formed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and unreasonably and persistently adhered to, down to the rendition of the decree, in the face of repeated and earnest appeals and entreaties to her by the husband to return. Without *just cause she has violated her marriage vow, by thus breaking off matrimonial cohabitation with her husband, and has deserted him and his home with the declared purpose of never returning. Under such circumstances, we are of opinion, in the language of this court in Bailey v. Bailey, that \u201cdesertion is established, and the party deserted is entitled to a divorce a mensa et thoro.\u201d There was no error, then, in granting the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">2. We are further of opinion that the Circuit court did not err in refusing to allow alimony to the wife under the circumstances of this case. She was in the eye of the law, and in fact, the offending party. She has, without sufficient cause, deserted her husband and his home, and established herself elsewhere, thus disregarding his comfort and happiness, her own duty, .and the decencies of society. To concede to her, under such circumstances, the right to demand of her husband a separate support in her new establishment, would not only be a reward to misconduct, immoral and corrupting in its tendency, but would give a rude shock to the sanctity of the marriage contract. Happily, the law does not require it, and policy and propriety alike forbid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Alimony is a right of the wife, and a duty of the husband, growing out of matrimonial cohabitation. When the .wife, without cause, and against the wish .of her husband, breaks off cohabitation with intent to desert him, her right to alimony ceases. Bishop on Mar. &amp; Div. 564, and cases there cited. So long as the husband has committed no breach of matrimonial duty, he is under no obligation to provide the wife a separate maintenance; and she cannot claim it on the ground of her own misconduct. Bishop, ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">In Boggess v. Boggess, 4 Dana\u2019s R. 307, C. J. Robertson, delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201ca wife who has voluntarily abandoned her husband should not have a decree for her separate maintenance, unless her abandonment of him was, without her fault, rendered 'x'necessary for her safety or happiness, and was consistent with social order and public policy.\u201d We think the above ought to be, and is the law; and we have already said, that in our opinion the desertion of the husband by the wife in this case was not otily without sufficient cause, but was in violation alike of \u201csocial order and public policy.\u201d There was no error, therefore, in denying alimony to the appellant'.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">3. Nor did the court err in remanding the infant daughter to the custody of her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-16\">The child was three years old at the date of the decree of the Circuit court, and is now four. The tender nursing period has passed by, and the time for moral training and impressions has arrived; and the court must decide whether there is anything in the circumstances of this case which, having in view the good of the child, renders it necessary and proper that it should remain longer with the mother. We think not, but the reverse. We concur with the learned judge of the Circuit court when he says, that she \u2018 \u2018has too lightly abandoned duties which she was bound by religion, morals, and the laws of society conscientiously to perform. \u201d Ror matters which, however painful and annoying at the time, are not of infrequent-occurrence in early married life, and are, at most, of comparatively small importance, she has undertaken, of her own accord, to disregard and sever the sacred bond of marriage\u2014\u201cthe prop and bulwark of the social system\u201d-\u2014and to throw herself upon society, as was said by this court in Bailey v. Bailey, \u201cin the undefined character of a wife without a husband, burdened with disgrace\u201d ; and we are asked to compel the .father and deserted husband to allow his innocent and unoffending daughter to share with the mother this undefined, ambiguous position, this burden of disgrace, during the critical period of moral training and education, when the mother has neither a home to ' which to take her (except at sufferance) nor means whereby to ^maintain her. We are of opinion . that this should not be done, and that the Circuit court did not err in remanding the child to the custody of its father.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">4. We are further of opinion that there was no error in failing to provide that the mother should have access to the child. It does not appear to have been asked, and was in fact unnecessary; first, because the decree provides that either party may apply at any time for such further order as may be desired; and secondly, because the record shows that the heart and home of the hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>band are ever open to receive his misguided wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Upon the whole, we are of opinion that there is no error in the record of which the appellant can complain. But in holding, as we do, that there was no sufficient cause for the desertion of the husband by the wife in this case, we must add that we are very far from holding the husband blameless. On the contrary, his conduct towards his young and inexperienced wife has in many respects been in the highest degree reprehensible. He has treated her with too little tenderness and consideration in the new and trying position in which she was placed. He has at times been coarse, rude, and petulant, when -he should have been gentle, soothing, and affectionate. He has left her to bear alone burdens and trials which it should have been his highest pleasure to share and relieve; and he has been close, exacting and penurious with her, when he should have been, to the extent of his means, open handed, liberal, and generous. We think he has much, very much, for which to reproach himself. Both parties have been to blame. A proper spirit of forbearance and conciliation on each side would have saved much trouble. But we believe that neither contemplated or desired the sad consequences which have resulted from their unhappy dissentions. Believing this, and believing also that there is no good and substantial reason why the parties should not be reunited, and lead for the future respectable and *happy lives, we are reluctant, by an unconditional decree of divorce a mensa et thoro and perpetual separation, to close the door apparently against reconciliation. The decree will be so modified, therefore, as to give the appellant the option, within six months from this day, of returning voluntarily, with her child, to the home of her husband, to his bed and board; and should she fail to avail herself of this invitation, the decree of the Circuit court will stand affirmed as an act of this day. Should she return, the Circuit court will be instructed, on her motion, to set aside the decree, and dismiss the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In ordinary cases this affirmance would be with costs to the appellee, as the party substantially prevailing; but this being a suit between husband and wife, and the latter being without estate, the husband must pay the legal costs in both cottrts.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The decree is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The court is of opinion that there is no error in the record of which the appellant can complain. Brit for reasons assigned in the written opinion of the court, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the appellant, Ascenith A. Carr, be allowed the period of six months from this day, within which she is invited to return with her child to the bed and board of her husband, Thomas 13. Carr; and unless she shall voluntarily so return within the period aforesaid, then the decree of the Circuit court of Uoudoun county of April term, 1871, shall stand affirmed as an act of this day. Should she elect so to return, she shall be received and treated by the appellee as his wife; and in that event, the said Circuit court is directed, on her motion, to set aside and annul the decree of April term aforesaid, and dismiss the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">It is further ordered, that the appellee, Thomas 13. Carr, do pay the legal costs of suit in both courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Decree amended and affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
