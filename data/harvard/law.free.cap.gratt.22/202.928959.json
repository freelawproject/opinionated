Hpon the trial, which occurred in December 1869, the defendant demurred to the evidence, and the court rendered a judgment in his favor. The facts are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADZ\">On the 4th of March 1868, Lyons recovered a judgment in the Circuit court of the city of Eichmond, against Martha E. Hill and T. Clay Maddox, for two hundred and fifty-eight dollars, with interest and costs ; which was docketed in the office of the Hustings court, on the 10th of March 1869. In March 1868, Lyons sued out a <em>fi. fa. </em>upon this judgment, which was returned \u201cno effects;\u201d and on the29th of February 1869, he sued out an <em>elegit </em>upon the judgment. This <em>elegit </em>went into the hands of the sheriff of the city, and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>inquisition was taken; and the jury found that Mrs. Hill was possessed of a house and lot on Broad street, in the city, which is described in the inquisition of the annual value of seven hundred and fifty dollars; and the sheriff returned that it was delivered to the plaintiff at that value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-4\">The defendant was in possession of the house. He held, first, under an assignment of a lease to himself from a former tenant, dated the 20th of April 1868, which was to commence on the 1st of July 1868, and continue until the 1st of July 1869; and then under a lease from Mrs. Hill, dated the 27th of February 1869, to commence on the 1st of July 1869, and continue until the 1st of July 1870, for which he paid her five hundred dollars in advance. It appears that, when this lease was about to be made, the judgment docket was examined, and Lyons\u2019 judgment was not then upon it; but it also appeared that the defendant had been told by his counsel, that Mr. Lyons had a judgment against Mrs. Hill and Maddox, and threatened to sue out an <em>elegit; </em>but that he was doubtful whether an <em>elegit </em>would be valid, for a reason he stated. McGuire paid |&gt;500 in cash for the lease, and had been indemnified against loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">Hpon the application of Mr. Lyons, a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment was awarded by this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-6\"><em>Young, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-7\"><em>Cannon </em>and <em>Marshall </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-8\">Staples, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXRS\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The court is of opinion that a \u00ab\u2019editor extending the laud of his debtor under an <em>elegit, </em>stands, in judgment of law, as if he had taken a lease for years in satisfaction of his debt; and, by virtue of such extent, he acquires a title to the premises which may be the subject of adjudication in this court, within the true intent and meaniug of the constitutional provision conferring jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>upon the Supreme Court of Appeals in controversies concerning the title or boundaries of land.</p>\n<p id=\"A0J\">The court is further of opinion, that the officer exer ? cuting a writ of <em>elegit </em>does not deliver to the creditor ac\u00a3uaj possession of the premises, but only the legal possession, which may be enforced by ejectment, or, at the option of the creditor, by writ of unlawful entry and detainer, where the cause of action has accrued within three years. If after such extent the possession of the premises is withheld by the debtor, or some one claiming under him, the tenant by <em>elegit </em>has the right to recover the same by action, and to hold over even after his term has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The court is further of opinion, that the plaintiff in \u25a0error, by virtue of his writ of <em>elegit </em>executed, was entitled to the possession of the premises in controversy at the time of the emination of his writ; and as the said tenement was withheld by a party claiming under the debtor, and with his consent, the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery was not affected or impaired by the expiration \u2022of the term before the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The court is therefore of opinion, that the judgment of the Circuit court of the city of Richmond is erroneous, and that the same should be reversed and annulled. It appearing, however, by the admission of the plaintiff in error, that he has been satisfied his debt since the writ of error and <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded, the court deems it necessary to render judgment only for the costs incurred by the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
