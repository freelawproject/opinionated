Barnett. On the trial of the cause, after the plaintiff had introduced his evidence, the defendant offered in evidence an agreement in writing, purporting to be between Ann B. Barnett, \u25a0executrix of C. L. Barnett, deceased, and George <em>W. </em>Barnett; and to prove the signature of the paper by Ann B. Barnett, introduced a witness, Montague, who said, \u201cthat he was not familiar with the handwriting of the said Ann B.' Barnett, never having seen her write but once, and then only to make her signature ; that he would not be able, from his knowledge of her handwriting, to distinguish it from that of others ; but that he was of opinion, from having compared the present signature with the one he had seen her make, it was in her handwriting.\u201d To the introduction of the evidence the plaintiff objected ; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence ; and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The jury found a verdict for the defendant, and the court entered a judgment accordingly.

Greenl. on Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 576-577; <em>Bedford\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Peggy, </em>6 Rand. 316. In the case before us, the witness, Montague (who w7as called to prove the signature of Mrs. Baniett to the title bond sought to be given in evidence), stated that \u201che had never seen her write but once, and then only to make, her signature; that he would not be able from his knowledge of her handwriting to distinguish it from that of others; hut that he was of opinion from having compared the present signature with the one he had seen her make, and from other circumstances not disclosed by the witness, he was of opinion it was in her handwriting.\u201d The question is, was this evidence admissible ? However <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>little or however much credit may be given to it, is not the question. It may be entitled to very little weight; but the <em>weight </em>of the evidence is one thing, its <em>competency </em>is another. The point upon which courts have differed in opinion is upon the source from which the knowledge of the handwriting is derived, rather than as to the <em>degree </em>or <em>extent </em>of it. All the authorities agree that a witness is competent to testify to the genuineness of a controverted signature if he has the proper knowledge of the party\u2019s handwriting. The difficulty has been in determining what is proper knowledge, and how it has been acquired. One mode of acquiring this knowledge, and certainly one of the best, is <em>having seen the party write. </em>\"Whether he has seen him write <em>once </em>or <em>many times, </em>goes rather to the degree and extent of his knowledge than the source from which it is derived, and does not affect the question of his competency, but only the weight to be given to his evidence, which is a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">It has been wrell settled in numerous cases, and is laid down as settled law in all the standard works upon evidence, that a \u25a0 witness who has seen the party, whose signature is controverted, write <em>hut once, </em>and that only his signature, is competent to testify, although he may have to compare the signature which he knows to be genuine with the one in controversy, in order to refresh and strengthen his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The case (cited by the counsel for the appellee) <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>3 Eng. C. L. R. 168, is one exactly in point, and is strikingly like the one under consideration. In that case the witness, whose competency was questioned, stated, when called -to prove the signature of Harper, that he once saw him sign his name to a paper, which he then had in his possession; that the fact made so slight an impression upon his mind that, judging from that single occurrence, he was not able to say whether the handwriting to the agreement was the defendant\u2019s or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>not; that he would not venture, upon the mere inspection of the p'aper, to form a belief on the subject; but that, hy comparing the signature of the agreement, to which he was required to speak, -with 'that which was subscribed to the paper then in his possession, he was able to swear that he believed it to be the' defendant\u2019s writing. It was held in that case, and its authority has never been questioned, that the witness was <em>competent-</em>to prove the handwriting. The court in \u2019that case says : 4 \u2018 The mere fact of having seen a man <em>once </em>write his name may have made a very faint impression upon the witness\u2019 mind; but <em>some impression, </em>however slight in degree, it will make, and surely as the standard exists, and the witness possesses the genuine paper, he may recur to it to revive his memory upon the subject. Here a basis is laid in the fact of his having seen the defendant sign his name <em>once. </em>But his memory is defective. He then recurs to a paper which he knows to he an authentic writing. He uses it to retouch and strengthen his recollection, and not merely for the purpose of comparison. The evidence, therefore, is admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">In a case recently decided by the Supreme court of the Hnited States, Mr. Justice <em>Davis, </em>speaking for the whole court, says : <em>\u201c </em>It has been settled everywhere that if the witness has seen the party (whose signature is controverted) write his name but once, he is competent to testify.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>12 Wall. U. S. R. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">I am of opinion that there is no error in the judgment of the Circuit court, and that the same ought to be affirmed. '</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-13\">The' other judges concurred in the opinion of <em>Christian, </em>J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
