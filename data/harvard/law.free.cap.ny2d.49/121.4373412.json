The record does not establish malpractice by Dr. Gottsegen nor a basis for imposing tort liability upon a school board for not retesting plaintiff\u2019s IQ pursuant to the policy then in effect, when it was the judgmental evaluation of plaintiff\u2019s teachers not to recommend a formal retest of his IQ. Nor is there any basis for a finding that plaintiff would have done better on a retest, or, with his massive speech problems, done better in a regular class. <em>(Fein v Board of Educ., </em>305 NY 611; <em>Clark v Board of Educ., </em>304 NY 488.)

Plaintiff Daniel Hoffman entered kindergarten in the New York City school system in September, 1956. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff was examined by Monroe Gottsegen, a certified clinical psychologist in the school system, who determined that plaintiff had an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 74 and recommended that he be placed in a class for Children with Retarded Mental Development (CRMD). Dr. Gottsegen was, however, not certain of his findings. The apparent reason for this uncertainty was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>that plaintiff suffered from a severe speech defect which had manifested itself long before plaintiff entered the school system. Plaintiff\u2019s inability to communicate verbally made it difficult to assess his mental ability by means of the primarily verbal Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test administered by Dr. Gottsegen. As a result, Dr. Gottsegen recommended that plaintiff\u2019s intelligence \"be re-evaluated within a two-year period so that a more accurate estimation of his abilities can be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Pursuant to Dr. Gottsegen\u2019s recommendations, plaintiff was placed in a CRMD program. While enrolled in the program, plaintiff\u2019s academic progress was constantly monitored through the observation of his teachers and by the use of academic \"achievement tests\u201d given twice a year. Although in 1959 and 1960 plaintiff received a \"90 percentile\u201d rating as to \"reading readiness\u201d, indicating that his potential for learning to read was higher than average, the results of his achievement tests consistently indicated that he possessed extremely limited reading and mathematical skills. As a result of plaintiff\u2019s poor performance on the standardized achievement tests and, presumably, because his teacher\u2019s daily observations confirmed his lack of progress, plaintiff\u2019s intelligence was not retested on an examination designed specifically for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In 1968, plaintiff was transferred to the Queens Occupational Training Center (OTC), a manual and shop training center for retarded youths. The following year plaintiff\u2019s mother requested, for the first time, that plaintiff\u2019s intelligence be retested. Plaintiff was administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults (WAIS). The results of the test indicated that plaintiff had a \"verbal\u201d IQ of 85 and a \"performance\u201d IQ of 107 for a \"full scale\u201d IQ of 94. In other words, plaintiff\u2019s combined score on the WAIS test indicated that he was not retarded. Inasmuch as his course of study at the OTC was designed specifically for retarded youths, plaintiff was no longer qualified to be enrolled. As a result, plaintiff was allowed to complete the spring semester of 1969, but was not allowed to return in the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Thereafter, plaintiff commenced this action against the Board of Education of the City of New York, alleging that the board was negligent in its original assessment of his intellectual ability and that the board negligently failed to retest him pursuant to Dr. Gottsegen\u2019s earlier recommendation. Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>claimed that these negligent acts and omissions caused him to be misclassified and improperly enrolled in the CRMD program which allegedly resulted in severe injury to plaintiffs intellectual and emotional well-being and reduced his ability to obtain employment. At trial, the jury awarded plaintiff damages in the amount of $750,000. The Appellate Division affirmed this judgment, two Justices dissenting, as to liability, but would have reversed this judgment and required plaintiff to retry the issue of damages had he not consented to a reduction in the amount of the verdict from $750,000 to $500,000. The Appellate Division predicated its affirmance upon defendants\u2019 failure to administer a second intelligence test to plaintiff pursuant to Dr. Gottsegen\u2019s recommendation to \"re-evaluate\u201d plaintiffs intelligence within two years. The court characterized defendants\u2019 failure to retest plaintiff as an affirmative act of negligence, actionable under New York law. There should be a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">At the outset, it should be stated that although plaintiffs complaint does not expressly so state, his cause of action sounds in \u2019\u2019educational malpractice\u201d. Plaintiffs recitation of specific acts of negligence is, in essence, an attack upon the professional judgment of the board of education grounded upon the board\u2019s alleged failure to properly interpret and act upon Dr. Gottsegen\u2019s recommendations and its alleged failure to properly assess plaintiffs intellectual status thereafter. As we have recently stated in <em>Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist. </em>(47 NY2d 440), such a cause of action, although quite possibly cognizable under traditional notions of tort law, should not, as a matter of public policy, be entertained by the courts of this State. (47 NY2d, at p 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In <em>Donohue, </em>this court noted that \"[c]ontrol and management of educational affairs is vested in the Board of Regents and the Commissioner of Education (NY Const, art V, \u00a7 4; art XI, \u00a7 2; Education Law, \u00a7\u00a7 207, 305; see <em>Matter of New York City School Bds. Assn. v Board of Educ., </em>39 NY2d 111, 116; <em>Matter of Ocean Hill-Brownsville Governing Bd. v Board of Educ., </em>23 NY2d 483, 485).\u201d (47 NY2d, at p 444.) In that case, the court was invited to undertake a review not only of broad educational policy, but of the day-to-day implementation of that policy as well. We declined, however, to accept that invitation and we see no reason to depart from that holding today. We had thought it well settled that the courts of this State may not substitute their judgment, or the judgment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>jury, for the professional judgment of educators and government officials actually engaged in the complex and often delicate process of educating the many thousands of children in our schools. <em>(Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist., </em>47 NY2d 440, 444, <em>supra; James v Board of Educ., </em>42 NY2d 357, 366.) Indeed, we have previously stated that the courts will intervene in the administration of the public school system only in the most exceptional circumstances involving \"gross violations of defined public policy\u201d. <em>(Donohue v Copiague Union Free School Dist., </em>47 NY2d 440, 445, <em>supra; Matter of New York City School Bds. Assn. v Board of Educ., </em>39 NY2d 111, 121, <em>supra.) </em>Clearly, no such circumstances are present here. Therefore, in our opinion, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Donohue </em>is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The court below distinguished <em>Donohue </em>upon the ground that the negligence alleged in that case was a failure to educate properly or nonfeasance, whereas, in that court\u2019s view, the present case involves an affirmative act of misfeasance. At the outset, we would note that both <em>Donohue </em>and the present case involved allegations of various negligent acts and omissions. Furthermore, even if we were to accept the distinction drawn by the court below, and argued by plaintiff on appeal, we would not reach a contrary result. The policy considerations which prompted our decision in <em>Donohue </em>apply with equal force to \"educational malpractice\u201d actions based upon allegations of educational misfeasance and nonfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Our decision in <em>Donohue </em>was grounded upon the principle that courts ought not interfere with the professional judgment of those charged by the Constitution and by statute with the responsibility for the administration of the schools of this State. In the present case, the decision of the school officials and educators who classified plaintiff as retarded and continued his enrollment in CRMD classes was based upon the results of a recognized intelligence test administered by a qualified psychologist and the daily observation of plaintiff\u2019s teachers. In order to affirm a finding of liability in these circumstances, this court would be required to allow the finder of fact to substitute its judgment for the professional judgment of the board of education as to the type of psychometric devices to be used and the frequency with which such tests are to be given. Such a decision would also allow a court or a jury to second-guess the determinations of each of plaintiff\u2019s teachers. To do so would open the door to an examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the propriety of each of the procedures used in the education of every student in our school system. Clearly, each and every time a student fails to progress academically, it can be argued that he or she would have done better and received a greater benefit if another educational approach or diagnostic tool had been utilized. Similarly, whenever there was a failure to implement a recommendation made by any person in the school system with respect to the evaluation of a pupil or his or her educational program, it could be said, as here, that liability could be predicated on misfeasance. However, the court system is not the proper forum to test the validity of the educational decision to place a particular student in one of the many educational programs offered by the schools of this State. In our view, any dispute concerning the proper placement of a child in a particular educational program can best be resolved by seeking review of such professional educational judgment through the administrative processes provided by statute. (See Education Law, \u00a7 310, subd 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b165-6\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASt\">(dissenting). I agree with Mr. Justice Irwin Shapiro, on the analysis spelled out in his well-reasoned decision at the Appellate Division (64 AD2d 369), that this case involves not \"educational malpractice\u201d as the majority in this court suggests (pp 125, 126) but discernible affirmative negligence on the part of the board of education in failing to carry out the recommendation for re-evaluation within a period of two years which was an integral part of the procedure by which plaintiff was placed in a CRMD class, and thus readily identifiable as the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s damages. I, therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Gabrielli and Jones concur with Judge Jasen; Judge Meyer dissents and votes to affirm in a memorandum in which Judges Wachtler and Fuchsberg concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Order reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
