Respondent, a Town Justice of the Town of Platte-kill since 1971, is charged with granting favored treatment to defendants in traffic cases pending in his court on 70 instances and requesting similar treatment on behalf of defendants appearing in other courts on four instances. Respondent\u2019s answer to the charges raised questions of fact and the matter was referred to Honorable Raymond C. Baratta for hearing and to make findings. At the hearing counsel for petitioner withdrew five charges and the Referee found that the evidence sustained the remaining 69 charges. Petitioner moves to confirm the findings and for the respondent\u2019s censure. Respondent requests that the charges be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">The Referee\u2019s findings are confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">The court adopts the reasoning expressed in prior similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>proceedings (see <em>Matter of Kuehnel, </em>45 NY2d [y]; <em>Matter of </em>Byrne, 47 NY2d [jjj]) and imposes the sanction of censure.
