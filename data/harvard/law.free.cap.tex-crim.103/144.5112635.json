Induced by this promise, appellant entered a plea of guilty. The jury gave him one year and refused to suspend sentence. Appellant contends that his plea of guilty was induced by persuasion contrary to the statute. His contention must be sustained. The facts above stated fail to show a valid plea of guilty, but on the contrary they show a conviction obtained in a manner not sanctioned by law. Farris v. State, 17 Tex. Crim.
