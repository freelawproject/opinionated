Stinson, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, and <em>Nat Gentry, Jr., </em>Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-12\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Adx\">This appeal is from a conviction in the District Court of Montague County for transporting intoxicating liquor, with punishment fixed at eighteen months in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">There are no bills of exception in the record to the reception or rejection of any testimony. There is a bill to the refusal of a new trial, and one to the overruling of appellant\u2019s motion for an instructed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial set up the fact that through a statement made by some one in the court room the jury deprived information that a witness by the name of Hester had been arrested for perjury. This was claimed as hurtful to defendant\u2019s cause. The matter was contested by the state and several controverting affidavits filed. When it was presented to the court he overruled the motion, certifying that he did so after hearing evidence and the argument of counsel. It appearing that evidence was heard, this court would not be in position to say that the trial court was not justified in his action. It further appears that the witness Hester was a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>witness, and it is not quite clear to us how the statement, if made, could have affected the rights of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Reverting to the other bill of exceptions complaining of the refusal of the court to instruct a verdict favorable to appellant, it seems to us that the court was entirely correct in his action. Henry Hester testified for the state that on the occasion in question he went with appellant and one Taylor to a point ten or twelve miles east of Ringgold, and that they got a half gallon of whiskey, that Taylor and appellant went somewhere and got the whiskey and brought it back to the car and that they all then drove back together to Bowie from the place where they got it. He said that the whiskey belonged to the bunch, that he did not pay anything for the whiskey, or have any interest in it. Two other witnesses testified for the State to seeing the party composed of Taylor, appellant and Hester, and that appellant had a jug of whiskey in his possession down near the railroad crossing south of Ringgold, that he carried the jug or jar of whiskey down to a car and gave a party a drink and-brought it back and put it in the car from which he had taken it.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As we view the law, neither of the three witnesses were accomplices. Our statute specifically exempts persons who occupy the attitude either of purchasers, joint possessors or transporters of intoxicating liquor, from the taint of being accomplices. As far as we understand this record Hester\u2019s only connection with the liquor was that of a transporter, and neither of the other witnesses had any criminal connection with it at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Believing the evidence sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s verdict, and being unable to agree with any contention made by appellant, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b302-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A2A\">Appellant insists that the court hawing told the jury in his charge that the witness Hester was an accomplice, we were in error in holding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction. The court did so tell the jury, and in our view this was favorable to appellant, Hester not being in law an accomplice. However if we should hold that he was, we would be compelled to conclude that he was fully corroborated by two other credible witnesses whose testimony showed appellant in possession of the liquor while in transit.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>We are not able to agree with appellant\u2019s objection to paragraph five of the court\u2019s charge, which appears to be but a statement'of a general principle, and said paragraph must be viewed in connection with paragraph six wherein the court applied said principle to the facts, and told the jury in express terms that they could not convict unless from all the testimony they believed beyond a reasonable doubt appellant was guilty. This obviated any possibility of the jury reaching a conclusion of guilt while entertaining a reasonable doubt thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
