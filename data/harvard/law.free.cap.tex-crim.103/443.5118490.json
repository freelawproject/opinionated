The question as to whether it was in fact and in law a bowie knife must control our decision. Much that transpired on the trial of this case was a transgression of the rules of procedure, but appellant did not except to same. For instance, an officer was permitted to state to the jury that a knife having a blade over three and one-half inches long was against the law, and that the knife in question was manufactured for purposes of offense and defense. Following this testimony the court told the jury in his charge to find appellant guilty if they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that he carried on and about his person a knife manufactured and sold for purposes of offense and defense. None of this should have been done. The court told the jury further that if appellant carried a bowie knife to find him guilty, and gave the definition of a bowie knife laid down in Art. 1027 of Branch\u2019s Annotated P. C., which is \u201cAny knife intended to be worn upon the person which is capable of inflicting death, and not commonly known as a pocket knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The dictionaries accessible to this court define a pocket knife as \u201cA knife with one or more blades which fold into the handle so as to admit of being carried in the pocket.\u201d Webster\u2019s International Dictionary defines a bowie knife as \u201cA knife with a strong blade from ten to fifteen inches long, doubled edged near the point, used as a hunting knife and formerly as a weapon in the southwestern part of the United States. Also by extension, any large sheath knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHo\">Bearing in mind the definition of the statute above referred to as well as the definition by the lexicographers, we observe that a pocket knife has a folding blade or blades and \u201cis carried\u201d in the pocket, and this must be distinguished from a knife \u201cintended to be worn on the person,\u201d which was to some extent worn as a weapon or for hunting purposes when this statute was enacted in 1871. No witness testified that the knife in question was other than a knife having a folding blade or blades, or that it was not commonly known as a pocket knife, or that it was a knife \u201cintended to be worn on the person\u201d and not carried in the pocket. That death can be inflicted with a pocket knife is unquestioned, and we do not understand the statute referred to to make the question of whether death can be inflicted with a knife a distinguishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>characteristic. It must go further and be a knife \u201cIntended to be worn on the person\u201d and not commonly known as a pocket knife. A knife in a sheath or case may be \u201cworn on the person,\u201d but a knife with folded blades is never described as \u201cworn,\u201d but is carried in the pocket. The officer who arrested appellant said he had the knife closed in his pocket at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Believing that from the testimony in this case the knife in question was not one \u201cintended to be worn on the person,\u201d but that, on the contrary, it was a knife with folding blades intended to be carried in the pocket, and was therefore such knife as is commonly known as a pocket knife, it must follow, in our opinion, the judgment is unsupported by the testimony, and that the cause for this reason must be reversed and remanded, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
