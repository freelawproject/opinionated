The sheriff\u2019s testimony shows that he found appellant at the still and that the whiskey was running out of the still and that appellant was standing by with a spoon in his hand, tasting it at the time the arrest was made and practically coincident with the time the statement was made. Neither was it a proper objection to this testimony that it was in response to a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">The bill of exceptions attempting to preserve the complaint with reference to statements made by the appellant with reference to the bedclothes found near the camp, is insufficient to present any error. The only suggestion contained in this bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that appellant was under arrest at that time is found in his objections to the testimony. \u201cA mere statement of a ground of objection in a bill of exceptions is not a certificate of the judge that the facts which form the basis of the objection are true; it merely shows that such an objection was made. The defendant should incorporate so much of the evidence in the bill as will verify the truth of his objections.\u201d Sec. 209 Branch\u2019s P. C. for numerous authorities sustaining this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s bill of exceptions No. 3. The testimony objected to was clearly admissible for the purpose of impeaching the appellant and besides the record shows that his answer thereto was in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The record shows that appellant offered various special charges and also made numerous exceptions to the court\u2019s charge. We have carefully examined these and think they are without merit. The court in his main charge to the jury submitted the issues involved in a very clear and concise manner and we think that every right that appellant had was fully protected in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Finding no error in the record, it is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b305-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b305-11\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AVs-\">Reviewing appellant\u2019s complaint of our opinion, we observe that a statement of the accused may be res gestae though in answer to a question. Branch\u2019s Annotated P. C., p. 53, for authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">What is said by the accused at the time of the commission of the offense is part of the transaction itself, and therefore res gestae. Branch\u2019s Annotated P. C. p. 52, for authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">When appellant made the statement held res gestae in our opinion, he was then actually making whiskey, and the statement thus became part of the transaction and admissible. The Brown case, 271 S. W. Rep. 917, cited by appellant, is entirely different in facts and also in the law applicable, as will be seen from an inspection of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">Appellant objects to our disposition of his bill of exceptions No. 3. Same complains of a question put to appellant by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>state on his cross-examination. He had testified that he left Palo Pinto county in July or August, 1921, and did not return at any time until about Christmas of that year. The state asked him if it was not a fact that at some date between September 1st and December 1, 1921, he was at Mineral Wells with his brother Albert, with a fruit jar full of singlings and was there arrested by the chief of police. The objection made was that this was an inquiry as to an extraneous crime not connected with the one on trial. Before we can appraise the merit of an objection, the truth of the facts stated in a bill as constituting the ground of objection, must be made to appear in such bill. Nothing in the bill under discussion enables us to know whether-this was in fact an extraneous crime and not connected with the matter involved in the -instant prosecution. The rule is too well settled to need citation of authorities, that a bill of exceptions must be complete within itself and manifest the error, therein attempted to be set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Being unable to agree with appellant\u2019s contention, his motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
