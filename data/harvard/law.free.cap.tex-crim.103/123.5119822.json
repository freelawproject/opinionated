There are several questions raised on this appeal, but as the record is presented, there is only one question which we deem necessary to consider, and that is the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction. It will be observed from the above allegations in the indictment that appellants were charged with the unlawful possession for the purpose of sale of \u201cspirituous, vinous and malt liquors.\u201d The testimony upon the part of the state shows that appellants were arrested at a tent where there were a couple of barrels of water and many bottles full of what was denominated by the witnesses as \u201cchoc beer.\u201d There is not a line of testimony showing how, or from what choc beer is made; and in fact nothing to support the allegations of the indictment to the effect that it was spirituous, vinous or malt liquors. Without proof by the state showing that choc beer was spirituous, vinous-or malt liquors to sustain the allegations in the indictment, there is but one thing for this court to do and that is to hold that the evidence is insufficient to warrant the conviction. This court in the case of Chavez v. State, 275 S. W. 1006, under a similar indictment, where the evidence showed that the appellant was in possession of tequila, and the state failed to prove that tequila was spirituous, vinous and malt liquor, held, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the allegations of the indictment. Under the Chavez case, supra, and the authorities therein cited, we are forced to the conclusion that the evidence is, wholly insufficient to warrant the conviction, and the judgment of the trial court should be reversed and remanded, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b143-5\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b143-6\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">Counsel for the state have filed a motion for rehearing in which it is contended that while there is no specific proof that \u201cchoc beer\u201d was an intoxicating liquor, its designation as \u201cbeer\u201d, together with the proof that it contained about five per cent of alcohol at the time it was examined and probably contained about two per cent of alcohol at the time it was manufactured, would characterize it as an intoxicating liquor. While there is some conflict in the decisions of this state upon the subject, the great weight of judicial declaration is to the effect that under an indictment charging the possession of <em>intoxicating </em>liquor, proof that the liquid was beer meets the legal requirement. See Words &amp; Phrases, 2nd Series, Vol. 1, p. 417; Black on Intoxicating Liquors, Sec. 17, p. 18; Moreno v. State, 143 S. W. Rep. 157. In the case last mentioned, great research is displayed, in both the majority and dissenting opinions. The conclusion in the majority opinion that the proof that the beverage was beer was sufficient is in harmony with, as stated before, the great weight of authority, and with its correctness we find no occasion to take issue. The authorities cited in Moreno\u2019s case, supra, and elsewhere, take note of the fact, however, that not all beer is intoxicating, and where the article in question is described by some qualifying word, then proof of its intoxicating character is demanded. From the majority opinion in Moreno\u2019s case, supra, we quote:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u201cIt may therefore be said that beer is a liquor infused with malt and prepared by fermentation for use as a beverage. As a consequence, when \u2018beer\u2019 is called for at a place at which intoxicating drinks are sold, the bartender, having in view the primary meaning as well as the common use of the word, is justified in inferring, and must reasonably infer, that malted and fermented beer is wanted. If any other kind of beer is desired, it is expected that qualifying words will be used, such as spruce beer, root beer, small beer, ginger beer, and the like, thus attaching a remote and secondary meaning to the word \u2018beer\u2019 as descriptive of the particular beverages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In the present instance, it was not \u201cbeer\u201d that was possessed but \u201cchoc beer\u201d. In the indictment, the state charged and assumed the burden of proving that the article possessed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>intoxicating. This proof was not made by merely proving that it was \u201cchoc beer\u201d; nor was it done by proof that at the time of its manufacture it contained two per cent of alcohol by volume. The statute upon which the prosecution is founded, namely, Art. 666, P. C. 1925, denounces the possession of intoxicating liquors for the purpose of sale. The accompanying paragraph of (Art. 667, P. C. 1935) of the same statute denounces the possession of \u201cpotable liquors containing in excess of one per cent of alcohol by volume.\u201d These statutes denounce different offenses. See Estell v. State, 91 Tex. Crim. Rep. 481. They were intended by the Legislature to meet the character of transaction now under consideration. If the state could not prove that the liquid was intoxicating, then it should have charged that the liquid possessed was \u201cpotable liquor containing in excess of one per cent of alcohol by volume.\u201d If the indictment had been so drawn the proof in the present case would have been sufficient. As the case stands before this court, the appellants were indicted for one offense, named and denounced in Art. 666 P. C., and the proof established of a different offense, namely, that denounced in Art. 667, P. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
