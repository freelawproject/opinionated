No complaint is made by bill of exceptions of the rulings of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\">The sufficiency of the evidence is challenged upon the ground that it does not show a guilty intent. A recital of the evidence is not deemed necessary. The guilty intent was sufficiently established by the confession of the appellant and by direct testimony of others Moreover, on a plea of guilty, the sufficiency of the evidence is not available except in a case in which the facts adduced are such as to show innocence or in which there is no legal evidence adduced. Primarily, the purpose of' the evidence on a plea of guilty is to enable the jury to judge the proper punishment. See Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, Art. 556; Woodall v. State, 58 Tex. Crim.

No <em>evidence </em>was heard upon the issue when the motion for new trial was presented, or if so the record fails to show it. To support his contention he seems to rely, on the facts proven at the time he entered a plea of guilty. In our opinion they do not support such contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
