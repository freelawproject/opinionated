The punishment is a fine of \u00a725.00 and six' months in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-17\">The evidence affirmatively shows that the wife of the appellant is not in destitute or necessitous circumstances, and it affirmatively shows that she has never been in destitute or necessitous circumstances. The testimony wholly fails to meet the allegation with reference to this matter. It is necessary in a case of this character to show that the wife is in destitute or necessitous circumstances before a conviction will be sustained. O\u2019Brien v. State, 234 S. W. 668; Bobo v.
