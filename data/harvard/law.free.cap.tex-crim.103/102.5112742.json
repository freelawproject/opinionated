He attempted to justify or mitigate the offense upon the ground that his wife had separated from him and threatened to live with another man. This was controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-17\">The issue of insanity was raised by the evidence and presented to the jury in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">The issue of self-defense was also presented in the charge, though we find little basis for it in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">There are no bills of exception complaining in any particular of the rulings of the court.
