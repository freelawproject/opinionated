In support of his defensive theory, the appellant testified positively that he didn\u2019t know that there was any whiskey in the baggage, never had any idea or thought that Brown, the party with whom he was driving in the automobile, wae going up there to get whiskey off of the train and that he had no interest in any whiskey, did not go there with any intention of aiding Brown or anyone else in getting whiskey. He further testified that if there was any whiskey on the automobile seat he did not know anything about it, that it was not his whiskey, that he didn\u2019t take any whiskey on the way out there and didn\u2019t drink any whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In an attempt to present appellant\u2019s theory of the case, the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\u201cYou are further instructed that if C. Tucker transported or assisted in the transportation of the whiskey introduced in evidence without knowledge on his part of the contents of the suitcases and handbags, then in so far as he is concerned, it would not be an unlawful transportation and if he unwittingly assisted in the transportation without knowing the contents thereof, then the possession of the liquor was in B. B. Axton and not Tucker and no presumption of the law would arise as against the said Tucker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The defendant objected to the manner of the court\u2019s presentation of his defense and suggested in his objections that the court should charge the jury that if the defendant carried the suitcases from or about the train to the automobile that before he could be convicted that the jury must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that they contained whiskey, and if upon this point they had a reasonable doubt they should acquit the defendant. This was the only affirmative presentation of the theory of the defense and the charge was further objected to because nowhere in the same is the reasonable doubt given in connection with such defensive theory. The question here presented was decided in accordance with the appellant\u2019s contention in the cases of Jones v. State, 257 S. W. 895, Garcia v. State, 273 S. W. 856. The principle involved in those cases is identical with that in the instant case. Also see Carrier v. State, 271 S. W., 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Appellant objected because the court instructed the jury that the possession of more than a quart of whiskey is prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>evidence that the whiskey was for the purpose of sale but this presumption can be met and destroyed by evidence that there was no such purpose. Appellant specially criticizes the use of the word destroy in connection above used. While not a great deal of importance is attached to this, it might be objectionable. The views of this court as to a correct charge on this statute have been fully expressed in the following cases: Stoneham v. State, 268 S.W. 156; Newton v. State, 267 S.W. 272; Caldwell v. State, 273 S. W. 608. In view of another trial we think it proper to say that the language of the statute itself is appropriate in submitting this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">For the errors above mentioned, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b619-7\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AKK\">The State insists that in failing to couple the law of reasonable doubt with the appellant\u2019s affirmative defense the trial court committed no error. The district attorney has prepared a motion, displaying research and ability, in which many precedents are cited and discussed, including Powell v. State, 13 S. W. 599, 28 Texas Crim. App. 398; Johnson v. State, 15 S. W. 647, 29 Texas Crim. App. 150. Touching these cases and others following them, the writer has expressed his views in some detail in the case of Regittano v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep. 479. As stated in that case, the apparent lack of harmony in Powell\u2019s case and Johnson\u2019s case, supra, both of which were written by the same judge, is reviewed at some length and reference made to many subsequent decisions of this court. The Regittano case, while first reversed, was ultimately affirmed. The affirmance, however, was based upon the failure of the bill of exceptions to show that proper objections had been made to the omission in the charge. From the original opinion in that case we take the following quotation:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">\u201cThe law requiring a charge on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt is generally satisfied when the doctrine is applied by a charge referring to the whole case, that is, referring to the general issue of guilty or not guilty. * * * It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>has been held that it is not required that it shall be charged in every case with regard to each affirmative independent defense. * * * It is believed, however, that where, as in the instant case, the defensive theory is an affirmative one, that is, where the connection of the accused with the homicide is conceded and justified by affirmative testimony given by the accused, when the matter is properly presented in the trial court, there should be embodied in the charge submitting his defense the information to the jury that if they believe the affirmative defensive facts or have a reasonable doubt of their truth, an acquittal should result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">From the opinion on motion for rehearing the following quotation is taken:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">\u201cNo exception having been taken, we need not further discuss the proposition that appellant\u2019s rights were fully protected by the general charge on reasonable doubt and the other references thereto, in said charge above mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In the present case, it is the sufficiency of- the charge as against proper exception that is at issue. According to the State\u2019s testimony, upon the stopping of a train at a station, certain suit cases were put off of the train. Appellant and others who were nearby \"picked up the suit cases and carried them some thirty steps to an automobile. Appellant testified that he and some ladies became the guests of one Brown, who had an automobile in which they were taken out for a ride. During the ride they came to the station of Huffman, Brown stating that he was going to meet a traveling man and take him to Humble. The automobile stopped at Huffman, the train arrived, a man got off and said to the parties in the automobile: \u201cCome over here and help us bring the baggage over.\u201d Responding to this request, and with no knowledge of the contents of the package, he assisted in conveying it to the automobile. It was later discovered that there was intoxicating liquor in the suit cases. Appellant declared in his testimony that he had no interest in the whiskey and no knowledge or intimation that the suit cases contained whiskey. It is clear that the appellant was connected with the criminal transaction. He admitted it, but gave affirmative testimony explaining it, which, if true, might have been regarded by the jury as sufficient to exculpate him. He, like other persons accused of crime, was within the purview of the statute which declares that in a criminal case the defendant is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal evidence. This presumption is as much a part of the law of the land as that upon which the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tion is founded. The jury in the present case knew that the appellant had carried the liquor. Upon the appellant\u2019s exception and request, they should have been specifically told that if he carried it in ignorance of its presence or if they entertained a reasonable doubt as to his knowledge of its presence, he should be acquitted. The facts of the case, in our judgment, bring it within the rule in Johnson\u2019s case, supra; also Regittano\u2019s case, supra, - and other cases therein cited, and cited in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
