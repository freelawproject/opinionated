In the Statute, it is made a penal offense for \u201cany person liable to work upon the public roads after being legally summoned to fail or refuse, etc.\u201d See Art. 835, P. C. 1925; Acts of 37th Leg., 1st Called Session, Chap. 42, Sec. 37. In Section 19 of the same Act, certain classes of persons are exempt from road service.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>To sustain a conviction, the burden is upon the state to show that the accused came within the purview of the Statute, that is, that he was liable for road service. The indictment, in failing to charge such liability, was defective. This was the holding of this court in Bennett v. State, 14 S. W. Rep. 336, 26 Tex. Crim. App. 671; Bluitt v. State, 56 Tex. Crim. Rep. 525; Wilson\u2019s Crim Forms, No. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">The court was in error in refusing to quash the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
