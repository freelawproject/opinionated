Under this qualification, the court did not abuse his discretion in sustaining a challenge for cause to this juror. If he was prejudiced against the law, this was a proper ground of challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the question of appellant being an innocent agent. Elam v. State, 16 Tex. Crim. App. 39; Knight v. State, No. 9697.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Appellant also complains because the court permitted the jury to take with them in their retirement the bill of indictment which contained counts four and five which counts had been quashed. If any error is shown in this matter it is not of sufficient importance to reverse this case. The appellant re-received the lowest penalty under testimony clearly showing his guilt and which testimony was in no wise disputed. It is also true that the court certifies in explaining this bill that no testimony was offered to show that the jury ever read counts four and five after they had retired to consider their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The evidence being amply sufficient and no errors appearing in the record, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b177-11\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQW\">In his motion appellant raises no new question, presents no additional authorities nor argument which leads us to conclude our disposition of the case was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
