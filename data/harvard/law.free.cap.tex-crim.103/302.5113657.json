After a careful consideration of all the evidence adduced upon the trial of this case, we are unable to reach the conclusion that the jury was unauthorized under the facts as presented, in convicting the defendant; and are therefore of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court should be in all things affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals, and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
