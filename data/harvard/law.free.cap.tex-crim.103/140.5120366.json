There are no objections to the court\u2019s charge or bills of exceptions in the record, except a general bill setting up the entire motion for new trial, wherein among other things, it was contended by the appellant that the court erred in not granting him a new trial for newly discovered testimony. The record discloses that this alleged newly discovered testimony was to prove that at the time of the arrest of the prosecuting witness that he was in a state of intoxication, and when asked if he desired bond, he replied he did not care what they did with him; and from an attorney, Mr. Eubanks, the appellant expected to prove that the general reputation of said prosecuting witness for truth and veracity was bad. The record discloses that both of said proposed witnesses lived in Lamar County, and that one was a sheriff and the other was a practicing attorney, both of whom were in frequent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>tact with the appellant\u2019s counsel, and with the slightest diligence said testimony could have been procured for the trial. The court\u2019s explanation in overruling defendant\u2019s motion in this particular shows no error therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We have caref\u00fclly examined the entire record, and finding no error in the trial of this case, are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court should be in all things affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals, and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
