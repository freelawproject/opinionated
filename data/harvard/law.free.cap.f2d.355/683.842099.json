Because it had made a substantial addition to its plant subsequent to the-1935 amendment to the Act, petitioner finds itself in the same position as Central Maine Power Co., requiring it to take an antedated license. Central Maine Power Co. v. FPC, 1 Cir., 1965, 345 F.2d 875. This, petitioner accepts. Its petition, brought pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825Kb) following denial of its request for reconsideration or a hearing, results from the Commission\u2019s inclusion in its proposed license of a provision known as Article 31. This provision the petitioner says is unreasonable and beyond the Commission\u2019s power.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Commission counsel stated during argument that Article 31 is of recent conception, and is now normal standard procedure for all new licenses. This is, apparently, correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It follows that if petitioner had filed when it should have done so, no such provision would have been included in its license. In seeking to persuade us, in Central Maine Power Co. v. FPC, supra, that it was fair to antedate Central Maine\u2019s license, the Commission pointed out that had that petitioner filed a declaration of intent under the 1935 amendment when it should have done so, it would have received a license bearing the earlier date, which, by coincidence, was demonstrated as a matter of record by another case. We agreed that it would be unfair for the petitioner to be any better off than it would have been had it filed on time. 345 F.2d at 876-877. Now, the shoe is on the other foot. The present petitioner is demonstrably worse off, since in 1954 Article 31 was not written into licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\"> We adhere to the principle that petitioner should not be better off than other applicants who did file properly at the earlier date when petitioner should have filed; i. e., that there must be antedating. We also agree that petitioner should not be better off than other applicants who made timely filing on the date on which petitioner in fact filed. We do not think the Commission should be required to have two present policies as to what should be in licenses currently issued; favoring those whose applications were overdue. To that extent this petitioner loses by its tardiness. However, the Commission cannot penalize the petitioner, because of its delay, by requiring it to accept a provision which could not properly be demanded of applicants presently applying for prospective construction. Nor do we understand it to contend otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the same time, we agree with the Commission\u2019s action refusing petitioner\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. No adequate grounds were asserted for making it specially exempt from the provisions of Article 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">For the above reasons, we will consider Article 31 as license \u201cboiler plate,\u201d and not with particular reference to any problems peculiar to this petitioner. The article reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-12\"><em>\u201cSI. </em>On the application of any person, association, corporation, Federal agency, State or municipality, the Licensee shall, after notice and opportunity for hearing, permit such reasonable use of its reservoirs or other project works or parts thereof as may be ordered by the Commission in the interest of comprehensive development of the waterway or waterways involved and the conservation and utilization of water resources of the region for water sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ply for steam-electric, irrigation, industrial, municipal or similar purposes, consistent with the primary objective of the project. The Licensee shall receive such reasonable compensation as may be appropriate for use of its reservoirs or other project works or parts thereof for such purposes, any such compensation to be fixed either by Commission approval of an agreement between the Licensee and the party or parties benefiting or by the Commission in the event the parties are unable to agree. Applications shall contain information in sufficient detail to afford a full understanding of the proposed use, including satisfactory evidence that the application [sic] possesses necessary water rights pursuant to applicable State 'law, or a showing of cause why such evidence cannot be submitted, and a statement as to the relationship of the proposed use to any State or municipal plans or orders which may have been adopted with respect to the use of such waters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Basic to a consideration of petitioner\u2019s contentions is a full understanding of what Article 31 provides. Since we find it less than clear in some respects, we undertake to examine certain clauses in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">1. \u201cOn the application of any person, association, corporation, Federal agency, State or municipality * * * \u201d (lines 1-2) (hereinafter, applicants). Petitioner contends that this includes applicants who do not \u201cpossess necessary water rights pursuant to applicable State law\u201d (lines 23 and 24) because the article permits applicants to show, in the alternative, \u201cwhy such evidence cannot be submitted.\u201d Although petitioner raised this matter in its petition for reconsideration, the Commission responded only indirectly, citing, largely, cases dealing with specific provisions elsewhere in the license, not objected to by petitioner, and expressly authorized. In its brief, Commission counsel state that the clause, \u201cnecessary water rights pursuant to applicable State law,\u201d indicates an \u201cintention to harmonize multiple uses in a unified, comprehensive plan.\u201d The brief neglects, however, to mention the alternative clause. We note, also, that in the order of April 7, 1965 (fn. 2, supra) the Commission, in speaking of the article, states that \u201cnecessary water rights for such non-project purposes must be acquired pursuant to applicable State law. * * * \u201d In spite of these observations, Article 31 may be considered broad enough to constitute the licensee\u2019s acceptance of takings, not elsewhere provided for, in favor of applicants not possessing the necessary State rights. Certainly the overall impression created by the article is not one of diffidence on the part of the Commission, and certainly, too, in some respects, the Act does permit takings in favor of parties not possessing state property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">2, \u201c * * * utilization of water resources of the region for water supply for steam-electric, irrigation, industrial, municipal or similar purposes. * * * \u201d Petitioner suggests that this clause is broad enough to include private, nonmu-nicipal uses. The Commission does not respond. Petitioner\u2019s apprehension has seeming merit. As opposed to it, however, this clause appears to have been derived from section 10(a) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a), which would appear to limit the Commission\u2019s power to \u201cbeneficial <em>public </em>uses.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">3. \u201c * * * consistent with the primary objective of the project.\u201d This is, perhaps, the nub of petitioner\u2019s concern. Although it is not clear what might be considered \u201csecondary\u201d objectives, and the Commission\u2019s memorandum opinion fails to identify the primary one, its brief is replete with assertions that the primary objective is the manufacture of power. This we accept. The brief is equally replete with assurances that the Commission can do nothing under Article 31 which could in any way diminish petitioner\u2019s use (which we take to mean at maximum capacity) of its generating mac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>hinery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This construction is considerably more restricted than we would, with full confidence, be willing to read into the phrase \"consistent with the primary objective of the project.\u201d Certainly one explanatory clause in the article, or one sentence in its opinion, would be worth more than six in the brief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its absence we do not know whether the Commission, acting under Article 31, would be limited absolutely, or limited only to what it might determine to be reasonable consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">4. \u201cThe Licensee shall receive such reasonable compensation as shall be appropriate. * * * \u201d What the standard of appropriateness is, is in no way indicated. While under other circumstances the term \u201cpresent fair value\u201d might be inferred, no particular inference seems warranted in a milieu where, for at least some purposes, a licensee is required to evaluate its property on the basis of written down cost. Federal Power Act \u00a7 14, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 807. We do not find it unambiguously apparent that for a taking for the benefit of someone applying under Article 31 the licensee is to be compensated on the basis of a Commission-supervised condemnation proceeding. Rather, it would seem that the licensee might receive what is reasonable in the opinion of the then members of the Commission, subject to court review on a standard not presently known to the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">A fundamental objection which petitioner raises to Article 31 is that it unsettles its license, where Congress intended that it be secure;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that it does not know what it may have to surrender, or to what extent it will be compensated. Being uncertain as to the proper interpretation of the article, we find it peculiarly difficult, as, indeed, must peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>tioner, to deal with this issue. It is regrettable, particularly in view of the general importance which the Commission itself attaches to the article, that it saw fit to answer the substantial points<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that petitioner raised in its initial petition by, essentially, an assertion that the article is within its powers and in the public interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">We find ourselves unable to give proper consideration to the article when we are in doubt as to what it means. Accordingly, we remand the case to the Commission for clarification, either by a revision of the article itself, or by way of an opinion responsive to the questions we have raised herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\">.

This court recalls vividly the disclaimer which another administrative body subsequently expressed of interpretations of its language made by its counsel appearing before us. See Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. FTC, 1 Cir., 1963, 326 F.2d 517, 519 fn. 4, rev\u2019d on other grounds, FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 1965, 380 U.S. 374, 85 S.Ct. 1035, 13 L.Ed.2d 904. We cannot, of course, criticize an administrative body for this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b791-20\">. Parenthetically, it does not affirmatively appear that petitioner is entitled, to a Commission hearing for the compensation determination. The article provides for a hearing (line 4) when the application is made. It is then provided that a successful applicant may agree with the licensee as to compensation (lines 17 and 18); otherwise compensation shall be fixed by the Commission (lines 19 and 20). The words \u201cafter hearing\u201d do not here appear. This, very possibly, is but a criticism of draftsmanship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b791-21\">. For example, section 10(a), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a), grants to the Commission the \u201cauthority to require the modification of any project and of the plans and specifications of the project works before approval.\u201d Petitioner contends that insofar as Article 31 permits a taking in any way detrimental to the project, beyond that permitted by specific provisions in the Act and duly reflected in other articles in the proffered license, it would be a modification of the project <em>after </em>approval. The force of this not implausible contention must depend upon the extent of the additional powers the Commission has reserved to itself under this article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b792-14\">. We must agree with the Commission that some do not seem substantial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b792-15\">. The Commission also stated that it would be time enough to determine in the future when some matter arose whether petitioner was hurt. In the context made, namely, that petitioner had not shown grounds for special relief from a standard provision, we might agree. This statement has been escalated by Commission counsel, however, to suggest in the brief (fn. 9) that there is no present controversy, and that petitioner should not be here. Rarely have we seen a more specious contention. If the Commission by Article 31 reserves something which, without it, was not reserved, the fact, as here appears, that it is not presently threatening or seeking to exercise rights thereunder, does not mean that petitioner is not presently affected. The difference between receiving a license without a reserved right and having to take one with a reserved right is a present difference. Not only do we find counsel\u2019s suggestion surprising, but the Commission itself has answered it in its order of April T, 1965 (fn. 2, supra) where it observed that this article could not be incorporated into licenses already issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
