Wholesale, upon non-payment by Allen, brought this action against appellees alleging that Allen was their agent and, in the alternative, that appellees were equitably estop-ped from denying liability for the materials. The District Court filed concise findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it ruled that no facts were proven to establish agency or to invoke equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">A careful consideration of the record convinces us that the Court\u2019s findings are fully supported by the evidence and that its decision and judgment are correct and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
