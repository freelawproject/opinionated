The contention that the revenue agent violated 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3109 by his entor into the building which housed the incriminating evidence is without merit. The building in question, which housed one of the largest illicit distilleries the officers had ever seen, was not within the curtilage. It was three hundred feet in length and was constructed for commercial use in the chicken industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-22\">The denial of the motion to suppress the evidence seized in the building was therefore correct. Moreover, there was ample basis for the issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
