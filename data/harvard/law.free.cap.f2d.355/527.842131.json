In September, 1960, Verville moved to withdraw his plea of guilty and to vacate the sentence on the ground that his guilty plea had been induced by <em>\u201ca </em>deal\u201d with the Assistant United States Attorney. The motion was denied by the district court. Verville appealed to this court, where the United States Attorney confessed error because of the \"impression\u201d that Verville had of a promise of a lesser sentence, which made his guilty plea non-voluntary. This court in September, 1961, reversed Verville\u2019s conviction and remanded the cause with directions to allow his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Subsequently Bishop\u2019s guilty plea was withdrawn by leave of court. Verville and Bishop were tried together beginning June 8, 1964, and were each convicted on all counts in which they were named in the indictment. Verville was sentenced to four years imprisonment on each of the seventeen counts of mail fraud, the sentences to run concurrently, and on Count 21, the conspiracy charge, was fined $5,000.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Verville alone has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\"> Verville argues that the Government failed to prove a <em>prima, facie </em>case of his guilt on any of the counts. He claims, on the mail fraud counts, a failure to prove (1) misrepresentations to the suppliers of merchandise, and (2) intent to defraud at or prior to obtaining the merchandise on credit. His claim, on the conspiracy count, is failure to prove a conspiracy and that the goods transported and sold were those obtained by the mail fraud. On appeal from jury verdicts we must take the view of the evidence, with reasonable inferences therefrom, most favorable to the Government. United States v. Sears, 332 F.2d 199, 200 (7th Cir. 1964). We hold that the district court did not err in submitting these counts to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The evidence of the acquisition by Ver-ville and Bishop, under assumed names, of Scanlon\u2019s Radio and Music Shop, their mailing of post cards to suppliers soliciting catalogs and price lists of merchandise, the cards saying \u201cHello Again from Scanlon\u2019s\u201d and \u201cHere Since 1933,\u201d their manner of ordering, receiving, storing, transporting and disposing of goods received, and other evidence in this record justified reasonable inferences of misrepresentations in a scheme to defraud the suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">There is no merit in Verville\u2019s contention that there was no evidence identifying the goods transported and sold as part of the goods which were sold to Scanlon\u2019s pursuant to the purchase orders sent by Bishop and Verville, and that the conspiracy count therefore should not have gone to the jury. The record does indicate that the identification testimony, as well as that of the value of the goods, is thin. However, the conspiracy count alleges the offense of receiving in interstate commerce goods which were obtained as a result of fraud. We think there is enough evidence of receipt of the goods by Bishop and Verville to justify submitting the conspiracy count to the jury. On retrial the district court should be careful to protect Verville in his right to have this issue kept from the jury unless sufficient <em>prima facie </em>evidence of all elements of the alleged crime on this issue is proven by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Over objection of Verville, the district court permitted the Government to introduce into evidence, under the conspiracy count, bankruptcy records consisting of thirty exhibits, petitions, documents and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>orders <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in an involuntary proceeding by creditors, from various states, against Bishop under the name \u201cJames B. Kelly,\u201d d/b/a Scanlon\u2019s Radio and Music Shop. The material was read to the jury. We agree with Verville that the court\u2019s ruling was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In Berry v. United States, 15 F.2d 634 (5th Cir. 1926), the Fifth Circuit reversed a conviction for mail fraud on the sole ground that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting into evidence a petition for a receiver in a bankruptcy proceeding against both defendants, which alleged that there was danger of bankrupts\u2019 assets on hand being \u201clost, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.\u201d The court thought this allegation could be understood as \u201cinvolving the charge\u201d that there was that danger. A similar result was reached by the Eighth Circuit in Todd v. United States, 221 F. 205 (8th Cir. 1915), also a mail fraud case. There one of Todd\u2019s alleged victims, Dykes, testified that \u201cwe replevined the goods,\u201d and on cross-examination he said that he was not present when re-plevin was brought and did not know if the ground for replevin was that the goods were not sold to Todd. The Government th\u00e9n introduced, over objection, a reclamation petition signed by an attorney for Dykes\u2019 concern which alleged the facts in the Todd indictment as to the alleged fraudulent scheme and prayed for-return of the property. The court\u2019s ruling alone, in admitting the petition, was held to be reversible error as it admitted self-serving \u201cwritten hearsay of verbal hearsay\u201d for the purpose, according to the trial judge, of explaining testimony which Dykes \u201cnever gave,\u201d and the petition was inadmissible as against Todd under any \u201cprinciple or rule of law.\u201d 221 F. at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">We reverse on authority of Berry and Todd. The prejudice in Verville\u2019s case is more aggravated than in Berry, since not only does the bankruptcy petition for receiver admitted here, as there, allege the necessity of preventing loss, but the order appointing the receiver containing a finding of that necessity was also before the jury. To some extent the prejudice to Verville is also probably greater than in Todd and Berry, because the single bankruptcy document in those cases was charging the defendant, while here the many documents were charging Bishop, and the bankruptcy petitioners therefore were virtually witnesses against Verville, Bishop's alleged co-conspirator, who had no opportunity for cross-examination. The error here is further aggravated by admission of a list of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors with claims of almost $344,000.00, as well as many other documents containing allegations pertinent to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The Government \u201cdisagrees and takes strong issue with the holding of Berry.\u201d No civil or criminal rules cited to us justify the district court\u2019s ruling admitting the bankruptcy records in this case against Verville.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Government relies upon this court\u2019s decision in Tank v. United States, 8 F.2d 697 (7th Cir. 1925). That case has no application. There the indictment charged that stock, the object of the alleged mail fraud scheme, \u201cwould be and was of little or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>no value.\u201d The trustee in bankruptcy testifying on this question merely refreshed his recollection from the bankruptcy records in answering the question, \u201cWhat did the assets amount to?\u201d The witness was stating a fact, not the contents of bankruptcy records, none of which were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We shall not speculate on the claim of error in the district court\u2019s ruling which failed to limit evidence at this trial to disclosures by the Government at a pre-trial conference called for the purpose of excluding \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d i. e., evidence obtained as a result of his suppressed statements and incriminating testimony given at the trial of his co-defendants in 1960. There is a record now made of the testimony of this trial. According to the spirit of efficient procedure stated in Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341-342, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939), a pretrial hearing on remand will easily enable Verville to challenge on-the-record testimony as \u201cthe \u2018fruit\u2019 of official illegality,\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 485, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). It will also provide \u201cample opportunity to the Government to convince the trial court that its proof had an independent origin,\u201d Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. at 341, 60 S.Ct. at 268, and to the court to excise from trial any \u201cpoisoned fruit.\u201d The court can at the same time induce the Government to disclose and make the necessary showing with respect to any additional evidence it may intend to introduce. The court did not err in not excluding Government evidence merely because it was not disclosed at the pretrial conference \u2014 to so hold would too narrowly confine the conduct of criminal trials within mechanical rules, also condemned by Nardone, 308 U.S. at 342, 60 S.Ct. at 268. Error is committed, however, if evidence not so disclosed is proffered at trial and the court does not require a showing, before ruling, that this evidence is not \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Verville also argues that error was committed in three instructions given by the court, and in the court\u2019s refusal to give one offered by him, and that the charge to the jury, considered as a whole, was erroneous. Because of the remand we simply comment that the instructions on flight and exculpatory statements were correctly limited to Bishop by other instructions given, and that, contrary to Verville\u2019s argument, the instruction given concerning the elements of the offense which had to be proved by the Government did not assume anything. It was not error to refuse Verville\u2019s instruction, as the Government\u2019s burden of proof and the elements of the offense charged, see United States v. Shavin, 287 F.2d 647, 649-650, 90 A.L.R.2d 888 (7th Cir. 1961), had already been adequately charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The court did not err in denying Verville\u2019s motion to inspect the grand jury minutes on the ground of an earlier statement by the Assistant United States Attorney, in arguing against the motion to suppress statements made by Verville and a co-defendant, that without the statements the Government would have insufficient evidence to prosecute him. No authority is cited, and we know of none, for the claim of error. The facts do not reveal a \u201cparticularized need\u201d which would outweigh the policy of secrecy, see United States v. Coduto, 284 F.2d 464, 468 (7th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 881, 81 S.Ct. 1027, 6 L.Ed.2d 192 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Because we hold that the admission of the bankruptcy records was prejudicial error, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341-1342.

After Ver-ville\u2019s successful appeal in 1961, the convictions of the four convicted co-conspirators were vacated and the Government dismissed the indictment as to them. The indictment of the fifth co-defendant had previously been dismissed by the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">.
