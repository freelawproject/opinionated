When the appellant was asked whether he had had an opportunity to discuss the offense with his counsel he replied that he had. When asked whether he was prepared to enter a plea, his response was \u201cGuilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-d\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then interjected: \u201cJudge, if I could have about 30 seconds or 15 seconds right here with the defendant, I\u2019d like to advise him of what counsel is telling him, so he will understand what he is doing. I believe he understands, but I want to be sure myself.\u201d After a conference with the appellant, his counsel explained to the Court that the appellant was actually represented by another member of the bar who was unavoidably absent; that the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>would enter a plea of not guilty and when his retained counsel returned he would confer with the appellant further to determine whether he might change his plea. The Court accepted the plea of not guilty and passed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The following day, September 19, 1962, the appellant and his retained counsel appeared before the Court. Counsel moved to withdraw the appellant\u2019s plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">The Court: Do you understand what you are charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">The Defendant: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">The Court: What are you charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">Mr. Semaan (Defendant\u2019s counsel): Do you know what the Judge is asking you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">The Court: You said you under- ' stood what you were charged with; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">The Defendant: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">The Court: What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">Mr. Semaan: What are you accused of having done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-15\">The Court: You don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-16\">The Defendant: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-17\">The Court: Well, say what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-18\">Mr. Semaan: What did I explain to you when you sat there a few minutes ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-19\">The Court: Better explain it again. Bead the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">The indictment was then read to the defendant. He was asked if he understood it and he replied yes. He plead guilty, denied that there were any promises, inducements or threats made to him and stated that his plea was voluntarily made. Sentence was deferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">Two days later, September 21, 1962, when the appellant appeared in Court for sentencing, his counsel announced that the defendant had discharged him and desired to change his plea. The Court then inquired as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-22\">\u201cThe Court: Now, Mr. DeLeon, is it true that you wish Mr. Semaan to withdraw from this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-23\">The Defendant: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-24\">The Court: Is it true that you stated to him that you wanted to change your plea from guilty to not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-25\">The Defendant: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-26\">The Court: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-27\">The Defendant: Because I didn\u2019t understand the charge, and I thought I was accused of just knowing these people from Mexico that were implicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-28\">The Court: You thought what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-29\">The Defendant: I knew these people from Mexico that were implicated in narcotics. I thought that was my charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-30\">The Court then questioned the defendant with respect to having heroin in his possession, of burying it in the ground, and of having dealt in it on a large scale, all of which the defendant denied. Under rigorous questioning by the Court about the defendant\u2019s failing to understand the charges, the defendant persisted in his answer that he thought he was charged because he knew certain people from Mexico who were implicated with narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-31\">Without counsel the Court then proceeded to sentence the defendant to ten years, adding that the defendant could get an attorney to file a motion if he wished to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-32\">On September 25, 1962, the defendant\u2019s case was again called, and after ascertaining that defendant did not have counsel, the Court stated: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to set the sentence aside that I imposed on you a few days ago <em>and I\u2019ll sentence you a little bit later today.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-33\">The Court then appointed counsel to represent the defendant and called defendant\u2019s formerly retained counsel as a witness to testify in detail concerning his conversations with the defendant. The testimony was not limited to the question of whether the plea was understandingly made, but was a running account of defendant\u2019s disclosures to his then retained counsel and the latter\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>stated reasons for his disbelief in what defendant had told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court again overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and enter a plea of not guilty and imposed sentence of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The case is before us on an appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s 2255 motion attacking the sentence imposed by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The government raises a threshold question that the appellant\u2019s 2255 motion may not be utilized as a substitute for appeal. The cases are, of course, legion to this effect. Iterating this in Larson v. United States, 5 Cir., 275 F.2d 673, we pointed out our reluctance, however, to generalize too broadly where \u00a7 2255 is concerned because \u201cThe Great Writ and its little brother Section 2255, cannot be compressed within a stereotyped generalization.\u201d We have no doubt that when, as here, the appellant asserts that his guilty plea was entered by him without knowledge of his rights, \u201cthe plea suffers the defect of inherent untrustworthiness,\u201d Watts v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 367, 278 F.2d 247, and a sentence rendered thereon is amenable to proceedings under \u00a7 2255. Poole v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 71, 250 F.2d 396, cf. Harris v. United States, 5 Cir., 216 F.2d 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The withdrawal of a guilty plea before sentencing is not an absolute right but is within the sound discretion of the trial court which will be reversed by an appellate court only for an abuse of that discretion. Williams v. United States, 5 Cir., 192 F.2d 39. When a guilty plea has been received from a defendant appearing without counsel, leave to withdraw it prior to sentencing should be freely allowed. Gearhart v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 272 F.2d 499. If, for any reason, the granting of the motion seems fair and just, the Court in its discretion should permit an accused to substitute a plea of not guilty and have a trial. Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Courts must always be diligent to ascertain whether a plea of guilty was understandingly made, and when it appears <em>before sentencing </em>that such a plea was entered by a defendant who did not understand the charges or acted as a result of mistake, it is an abuse of discretion not to permit the plea to be withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">While a hearing to determine this issue may well be required, accusatory inquiries of the defendant and eliciting confidential conversations between the defendant and his counsel were clearly beyond the permissible scope of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">On this record, the Court should have granted leave to appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty. The cause will be remanded to the district court with direction to vacate the judgment of conviction to allow appellant. to withdraw the plea of guilty and enter a plea of not guilty, and to conduct such further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-17\">. The indictment charged that Oscar DeLeon did knowingly and fraudulently receive, conceal, and facilitate the transportation and concealment of a narcotic drug, to-wit: thirty-two (32) grams of heroin, after the said narcotic drug had been imported and brought into the United States contrary to law; and the said Oscar DeLeon then knew said narcotic drugs had been imported and brought into the United States contrary to law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
