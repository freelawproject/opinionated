Sutherland (hereinafter, decedent) from a judgment of the district court in favor of the Government, in a suit for refund of estate taxes. The case was submitted to the trial court on stipulated facts, as follows: The decedent died on August 11, 1958 with a gross estate, for estate tax purposes, of $308,876. He was 83 years old at death and was survived by his wife, Bertha, age 81. His will set up a \u201cM\u00e1rital Trust\u201d and a \u201cResidual Trust.\u201d The terms of the Marital Trust required the trustee to pay over all income to the decedent\u2019s widow for her life and to invade corpus for her health and maintenance and for so much \u201cas she may request from time to time without any limitation whatsover.\u201d The wife was granted a power to appoint the remainder by her will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The residue of decedent\u2019s estate was to be held in a trust known as the Residual Trust under which the widow was bequeathed a beneficial life estate, and the trustee was empowered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\u201cA. The trustee shall pay to or for the benefit of my wife, Bertha W. Sutherland, as much of the net income and/or principal of the Residual Trust as in its uncontrolled discretion it deems proper, taking into consideration the income she has from all other sources:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">1. To enable her to maintain the standard of living to which she was accustomed at the time of my death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-14\">2. To enable her to provide proper hospital, nursing, doctors and medical care for herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-15\">Any net income not required for the foregoing purposes shall be accumulated and added to the principal of the Residual Trust. It is my strong wish and desire, without limiting my Trustee\u2019s discretion herein, that at all times my Trustee\u2019s consideration shall be my wife\u2019s well-being and comfort and that my Trustee shall give sympathetic consideration to any requests that my wife may make from time to time, as I have every confidence that she will not ask for principal unless it is really required, and I, therefore, authorize and empower my Trustee to be generous in the exercise of this discretion even though there may be considerable depletion of the Trust Estate, provided, however, that the Trustee shall invade the principal of the Marital Trust for my wife whenever it shall find it practicable to do so rather than utilizing this power to invade the Residual Trust for her benefit, this provision being solely to effect tax savings by depletion of that part of my estate which will be taxable upon my wife\u2019s decease subsequent to my decease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">Under the terms of the Residual Trust, the remainder was to be distributed to certain qualified charities upon the widow\u2019s death. On the estate tax return, taxpayers claimed a deduction in the sum of $57,370.73 for the value of the charitable remainders with respect to the Residual Trust. They also claimed a deduction in the amount of $385.67 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>intangible personal property taxes for the year 1958 which were collected by the State of Florida after decedent\u2019s death. The District Director disallowed the claimed deductions and assessed a deficiency which taxpayer paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">With respect to the Residual Trust, the District Court held that since the decedent\u2019s will did not create a sufficient standard from which to ascertain accurately the amount of the remainder interests at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, no deduction was allowable for the charitable remainders. It further held that since the intangible personal property tax imposed by the State of Florida \u201caccrued\u201d after the decedent\u2019s death, the amount paid in satisfaction thereof could not be deducted from the gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In order for the charitable remainder to qualify as a deduction, the trustee\u2019s power of invasion must be limited by definite and ascertainable fixed standards capable of being translated into terms of money. See Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 256, 64 S.Ct. 108, 88 L.Ed. 35 (1943); Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151, 49 S.Ct. 291, 73 L.Ed. 647 (1929). In determining whether the trustee\u2019s power meets this test, we must first attempt to ascertain the intent of the testator as expressed in the will. See Lincoln Rochester Trust Co. v. McGowan, 217 F.2d 287, 290 (2d Cir. 1954). Here, although testator did use the magic words, \u201cto enable her to maintain the standard of living to which she was accustomed at the time of my death,\u201d see Ithaca Trust Co., supra, 279 U.S. at 154, 49 S-.Ct. at 291, he went much further. Had he stopped with \u201ccomfort and well being,\u201d the deduction might yet be saved, since these latter terms might reasonably be interpreted as meaning comfort and support according to the life beneficiary\u2019s accustomed mode of living. Compare Blodget v. Delaney, 201 F.2d 589 (1st Cir. 1953) (\u201ccomfort and welfare\u201d interpreted as constituting an objective standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">However, since the testator did not stop with \u201ccomfort and well being,\u201d the taxpayer must argue that the following additional terminology used by decedent in his will, [i] requesting that the trustee \u201cgive sympathetic consideration to <em>any request\u201d </em>(emphasis added) made by his wife \u201cfrom time to time,\u201d and [ii] \u201cauthorizing\u201d and \u201cempowering\u201d the trustee to be \u201cgenerous\u201d in the exercise of his discretion, \u201ceven though there may be considerable depletion of the Trust Estate,\u201d was merely superfluous preca-tory language, which did not modify or broaden the preceding objective standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">It should be noted that the use of the conjunctive or cumulative form in the crucial part of decedent\u2019s will <em>[\u201cand </em>* * * give sympathetic consideration to <em>any </em>request my wife may make from time to time,\u201d (emphasis added)] militates against the taxpayer\u2019s contention. Such subjective standards of invasion bring \u201cinto the calculation elements of speculation too large to be overcome, notwithstanding the widow\u2019s previous mode of life was modest and her own resources substantial.\u201d Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston, supra, 320 U.S. at 263, 64 S.Ct. at 112. With regard to the proper principle of construction in such cases, the court in State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, 313 F.2d 29, at 31 (1st Cir. 1963), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">We realize that wills may be redundant. But there is also a principle that additional words presumably import additional meaning. There comes a time when this principle must be recognized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">In accordance with this principle of construction and because any other view would permit the use of standards so subjective as to make computation of present values impossible, we hold that the charitable deduction must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">\u2022 Florida levies an intangible personal property tax under the authority of 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Fla.Stat. 199.11, F.S.A. This tax is assessed on personal property owned by residents of Florida on January 1st of each year. However, the intangible personal property tax does not become \u201cdue and payable\u201d until the first of November of each year, 10 Fla.Stat. 199.15, F.S.A. From this latter date the tax becomes a lien on the taxpayer\u2019s property in the county in which the tax is assessed, 10 Fla.Stat. 199.22, F.S.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The crucial issue here is whether the intangible personal property tax had \u201caccrued\u201d before decedent\u2019s death in August 1958, so as to qualify as a deductible expense in determining decedent\u2019s taxable estate, by virtue of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2053. The Treasury Regulations on Estate Tax interpret the statutory phrase \u201caccrued before his death\u201d to mean that property taxes \u201cin order to be deductible must be an enforceable obligation of the decedent at the time of his death.\u201d But this provides little aid and merely establishes the normal test of deductibility for \u201cclaims against the estate\u201d (Tres. Reg. on Estate Tax, \u00a7 20.2053-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Taxpayer premises its case for deducti-bility upon the fact that even if decedent had disposed of his property after January 1st, he would still be liable for the tax thereon. Thus, it submits that these taxes had not merely accrued in an accounting sense, but had become an absolute liability of decedent\u2019s estate on January 1, 1958, even though not payable until November.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The Government, on the other hand, while admitting that an enforceable obligation may presently exist, even though the time for payment is deferred, argues that absent a showing as to when the personal obligation for property taxes arises, the date of attachment of the lien is considered the determinative factor. Although the Government\u2019s argument has surface appeal, it begs the question to which the taxpayer has already provided the simple answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court, insofar as it denied taxpayer a charitable deduction, is affirmed, but insofar as it held that the Florida intangible personal property tax had not \u201caccrued\u201d at decedent\u2019s death, and, therefore, was not deductible, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\">. The Marital Trust is not directly involved in this case; its terms are relevant only as they may have bearing on the decedent\u2019s intent with respect to the Residual Trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
