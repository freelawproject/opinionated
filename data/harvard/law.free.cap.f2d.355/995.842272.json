I. Stone Co., Inc., and paid under protest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied the claim and we affirm that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-19\">All the facts have been stipulated. During the years 1943-1945, Ruderman was the president and 50% stockholder of D. I. Stone Co., Inc., a New York corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of ladies blouses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wishing to maintain production despite wartime shortages, Stone purchased some of its material on the black market at prices above the O. P. A. maxima. The illegal purchases were not recorded on Stone\u2019s books and, when the finished products were sold, some of the sales were not recorded either. The receipts from these unrecorded sales were retained by Ruder-man and allegedly disbursed in amounts approximating the total unrecorded sales receipts. The corporation took no corresponding income tax deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-20\">On March 2, 1954, a statutory notice of deficiency (90-day letter) was sent to Stone for taxes plus penalties aggregating $356,035.40, attributable to the unreported sales during the years 1943-1945.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the same day, 90-day letters were sent to Ruderman and his wife for taxes plus penalties for the year 1943 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>aggregating $18,058.92<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to Ruder-man alone for taxes plus penalties aggregating $56,396.28 for the years 1944-1945,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> attributable to Ruderman\u2019s alleged receipt of distributions from Stone, in the nature of dividends, which were not reported as income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">Ruderman and Stone petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the alleged deficiencies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prior to the taking of testimony, the question of offsets or allowances for cash actually paid to the suppliers was raised by the court. Since the Commissioner had allowed nothing for these payments even though Ruder-man had alleged that they approximated the total unrecorded sales income, the court suggested an adjournment to determine whether a compromise and settlement could be effected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">The parties held several conferences concerning the matters then before the Tax Court as well as the question of Ruderman\u2019s transferee liability and, on May 27, 1956, the parties entered into stipulations that Stone was liable for taxes plus penalties aggregating $205,-943.40 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that Ruderman was personally liable for taxes plus penalties aggregating $30,980.54.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These stipulations were filed with the Tax Court on June 1, 1956 and a decision was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">On the same day the parties entered into the above stipulations, Ruderman\u2019s counsel attempted to dispose of the alleged transferee liability by submitting a Form 870-AD <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> wherein it was proposed that the entire transferee liability alleged against Ruderman be reduced to $62,072.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">After the Form 870-AD was executed by the parties, an audit statement was prepared by the I. R. S. and forwarded to Ruderman. On August 3, 1956, Ruder-man was notified that there had been assessed against him, as transferee of Stone\u2019s assets, taxes and fraud penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>totaling $62,072.70<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> plus interest in the amount of $24,077.40 computed from the respective due dates of the 1944 and 1945 income tax returns of Stone to the date of assessment which was August 3, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Ruderman made payments in complete discharge of his personal and transferee liability. Payment of the $24,077.40 which had been asserted as interest on the transferee liability was made under written protest. On November 9, 1961, Ruderman filed claims for refunds of the payments made on the interest charges and then commenced two actions for refunds which were later consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Ruderman first argues that the government\u2019s acceptance of his offer to settle the transferee liability constituted a compromise and settlement or an accord and satisfaction of the total liability under New York law, and thus, no interest charges could be asserted against him. The district court held that \u201cthe parties had contemplated the payment of interest as allowed by law\u201d and had not intended the government\u2019s acceptance of the Form 870-AD to preclude either further claims by the government or challenges thereto by Ruderman. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">United States v. Prince, 348 F.2d 746 (2 Cir. 1965) is authority for the proposition that the nature of the Form 870-AD agreement is a matter of federal rather than state law. We held in Prince that the Form 870-AD is neither a closing agreement nor is it a compromise<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the government may assert further liability subsequent to its acceptance of the Form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Ruderman\u2019s second argument is that \u201cactual fraud,\u201d a <em>sine qua non </em>to the government\u2019s assertion of interest liability, was not shown, and thus the interest charges are not permissible. The district court held that on the basis of the stipulated facts, Ruderman\u2019s participation in the fraud as determined by New York law could be inferred and that interest was properly chargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">Both plaintiff and the government agreed in the district court that the question of whether Ruderman, as transferee, was liable for interest was dependent upon New York law. The government concedes in its brief that it is bound here by that concession with the caveat that it \u201cwishes to leave the issue open for other cases.\u201d Accordingly, on the strength of the concession, which we feel constrained to honor, we look to the New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">The leading New York case is MacIntyre v. State Bank of Albany, 307 N.Y. 630, 120 N.E.2d 832 (1954) which held that, absent actual fraud, interest runs from the time of demand. However, contrary to Ruderman\u2019s assertions, actual fraud is not limited to fraudulent conveyances which fall within the definitions of \u00a7 276 of New York\u2019s Debtor and Creditor Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 12, but may include transfers which are denoted as \u201cconstructively fraudulent\u201d and which fall, for example, within \u00a7 273 of the Debtor and Creditor Law or \u00a7 15 of the Stock Corporation Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 59.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>Ruderman, the president and 50% owner of D. I. Stone, stipulated that the corporation did not record all the purchases and sales in Stone\u2019s tax returns for the years 1944 and 1945. We think that the stipulations admitting a scheme to evade the O. P. A. price ceilings and the stipulations admitting a wilful failure to report these transactions in federal income tax returns will support an inference of actual fraud, as that term is used under New York law to determine whether interest will be assessed from the date of the transfer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACa\">\u201cTransferred assets</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ani-dedup-0\">(a) Method of collection.- \u2014 The amounts of the following liabilities shall, except as hereinafter in this section proyided, be assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the taxes with respect to which the liabilities were incurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-13\">(1) Income, estate, and gift taxes.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-21\">(A) Transferees. \u2014 The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-22\">(i) of a taxpayer in the case of a tax imposed by subtitle A * * <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1100-23\">.
