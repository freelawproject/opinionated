The claimed compensation of appellants for legal service was not based upon any \u201crate\u201d but primarily on a claimed $7,000.00 higher return from the sale of the assets. Funds of the estates were derived solely from the sale of the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">On May 17, 1961, appellants filed their application for compensation setting forth the services they rendered as attorneys for the receiver. After notice to creditors as prescribed by Section 58 (a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Act [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 94] a hearing on such application was had on October 10, 1961, before Referee in Bankruptcy Charleville, who later resigned his office and was succeeded by Referee Seymour. An order was made by the referee awarding to appellants the sum of $2,000.00 for their services as attorneys for the receiver. Such amount was paid to applicants on October 24, 1961. No creditors appeared at the hearing, no evidence was taken at the hearing, and there was no opposition at the hearing to the allowance of the compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">On December 20, 1963, Referee Seymour, on his own motion, set a hearing for January 17, 1964, for the purposes of:</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">(1) Reconsidering Referee Charle-ville\u2019s order of October 23, 1961, allowing to appellants the compensation above mentioned; and</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">(2) Considering appellants\u2019 further application for fees as attorneys for ap-pellee as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">Notice to creditors of said hearing was given. At said hearing Mr. Levitt objected to the reconsideration by Referee Seymour of Referee Charleville\u2019s order. Testimony of Mr. Levitt and the appellee was taken. On March 23, 1964, the referee caused to be entered his findings of fact, conclusions of law and orders which, in substance, allowed appellants a fee in the sum of $250.00 as attorney\u2019s fees for the receiver and surcharged them $1,750.00, being the difference between the $250.00 fee and the sum of $2,000.00 previously paid under Referee Charleville\u2019s order. Appellants were given credit against said surcharge to the extent of $400.00 representing the fee allowed to appellants as attorneys for the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">On November 10, 1964, the District Court on petition for review affirmed the orders of Referee Seymour and approved and adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">Appellants\u2019 main contention on this appeal is that Referee Seymour was without power to reconsider Referee Charle-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ville\u2019s order for the reason that such order became final ten days after its entry under \u00a7 39(c) of the Bankruptcy Act [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 67] which provides in the part pertinent to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIU\">\u201cUnless the person aggrieved shall petition for review of such order within such ten-day period, or any extension thereof, the order of the referee shall become final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">This quoted provision was added to \u00a7 39(c) in 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Appellants\u2019 premise is that as \u00a7 58(a) (8) of the Bankruptcy Act, since its amendment in 1938, requires that creditors shall have at least ten days\u2019 notice by mail of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">\u201call applications by receivers, ancillary receivers, marshals, trustees, committees, and attorneys for compensation from the estate for services rendered, specifying the amount and by whom made: * * * \u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">such quoted provision makes an order awarding attorney\u2019s fees subject to review only under the provisions of the 1960 amendment to \u00a7 39(c) of the Bankruptcy Act. From such premise appellants argue that since no petition for review of Referee Charleville\u2019s order was taken within the ten day period, his order became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Appellants concede that they have been unable to find any decision of trial or appellate courts supporting their views as to the effect of the 1938 amendment to \u00a7 58(a). Appellants likewise concede that the authorities cited and relied upon by the appellee support his position that the order in question is an administrative order subject to reconsideration and reexamination by the referee until the estate is closed. See Matter of Pottasch Bros. Co., Inc., 79 F.2d 613, 101 A.L.R. 1182 (2nd Cir. 1937); Fazakerly v. E. Kahn\u2019s Sons Co., 75 F.2d 110 (5th Cir. 1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">As above noted, the hearing by Referee Charleville on appellants\u2019 petition for compensation was informal. No issues of fact or law were framed, no testimony was taken, and no findings of fact or conclusions of law were made. In our view such order was purely an administrative order subject to reconsideration and rexamination by Referee Charleville or his successor in office, Referee Seymour, until the bankruptcy estates were closed. Referee Charleville\u2019s order was not a final one to which the 1960 amendment to \u00a7 39(c) of the Bankruptcy Act applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Appellants further contend that should we find that Referee Charleville\u2019s order did not become final and was subject to reconsideration by Referee Seymour, that the orders made by Referee Seymour constitute an abuse of discretion. We are unable to agree. We have examined the record in this case. We find that the findings of fact of Referee Seymour are fully supported. We are bound by the rule that the findings of fact of the Referee in Bankruptcy must be adhered to unless they are found to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d General Order in Bankruptcy No. 47; Tepper v. Chichester, 285 F.2d 309 (9th Cir. 1960), Rehearing Denied, Feb. 1, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
