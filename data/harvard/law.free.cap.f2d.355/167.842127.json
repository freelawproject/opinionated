This appellant, on behalf of his insurance company, arranged with an Air Force sergeant to pay fifteen (15) and later twenty-five (25) cents per name for the names of all new recruits, contrary to Air Force Regulations. The information thus obtained was the basis of immediate solicitation of a family to purchase insurance on the life of the airman. Some $27,000 was paid to Sergeant Shand and his helpers over a period of ten months under this arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">Whether or not these payments were given with the intent to influence the employee\u2019s \u201caction\u201d on a \u201cmatter pending\u201d before him, it cannot be seriously doubted that the payments were made to \u201cinduce him to do an act in violation of his lawful duty\u201d of complying with Air Force Regulations dealing with the operation of the Lackland Air Force Base. This Court has approved the cases from those circuits which have given a broad construction to this statute. In Pipkin v. United States, 5 Cir., 248 F.2d 491, we noted with approval the cases of Hurley v. United States, 4 Cir., 192 F.2d 297, and Wilson v. United States, 4 Cir., 230 F.2d 521. Such construction certainly comprehends such conduct as the jury here found appellant had carried on.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-18\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">It being made to appear by the petition for rehearing that the indictment did not actually charge the giving of money to the government official \u201cwith intent * * * to induce him to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty * * * \u201d, we must consider whether the proof warranted a finding by the jury that the payments made to Sergeant Shand were \u201cwith intent to influence his decision or action on any question, matter, cause, or proceeding which may * * * be pending, or * * * brought before him in his official capacity * * <em>* </em>or with intent to influence him to commit * * * any fraud * * * on the United States. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">We conclude, in light of the broad construction to be given this statute, see Hurley v. United States, 4 Cir., 192 F.2d 297, and Wilson v. United States, 4 Cir., 230 F.2d 521, and in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of our decision in Pipkin v. United States, 5 Cir., 243 F.2d 491, approving the principles of those cases, that the language of the statute, \u201cwith intent to influence his * * * action on any * * * matter * * * pending * * * before him,\u201d comprehends an intent to influence Sergeant Shand to sell the names of the recruits which were in his custody and control. Moreover, we think the conduct here also falls within the language \u201cwith intent to influence him to commit * * * any fraud, * * * on the United States * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The jury could find that, as charged in the indictment, \u201csaid fraud [was] to deprive the United States of its right to have the faithful and honest services, decisions and actions of * * * Sergeant Shand free from corruption and improper influence by a business and person in selling life insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
