Gen., of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b130-8\">Before WATERMAN, KAUFMAN and HAYS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Appellant, who is presently incarcerated in Dannemora State Hospital, was convicted of first degree robbery in 1950. He attacks the validity of his sentence as a second felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Appellant claims that he was not represented by counsel, and was \u201cmentally and legally incompetent\u201d when he entered a plea of guilty to a robbery charge in 1938. The record shows that appellant was represented by counsel at his sentencing; no attack was made on the prior plea at that time. Given these circumstances, appellant\u2019s first contention is answered in Canizio v. New York, 327 U.S. 82, 86, 66 S.Ct. 452, 453, 90 L. Ed. 545 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">\u201c[E]ven though petitioner may not have had counsel at the beginning, he had counsel in ample time to take advantage of every defense which would have been available to him originally. We think the record shows that petitioner actually had the benefit of counsel. When that counsel took over petitioner\u2019s defense he could have raised the question of a defect in the earlier part of the proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">Accord, United States ex rel. Caccio v. Fay, 350 F.2d 214 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">The New York courts have already fully examined and rejected appellant\u2019s claim that he was mentally incompetent. Since appellant alleges nothing which would cast any doubt on the correctness of that conclusion, we see no reason for granting him a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
