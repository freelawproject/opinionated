Upon the bankruptcy of the corporation, its assets were bought by persons who thereafter organized New Dubrow\u2019s, Inc., the appellee, to operate a cafeteria at the same location and with the same equipment. The trustee in bankruptcy sold the assets by one sale and the name Dubrow by a separate sale. These orders of sale were not attacked in the bankruptcy court or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-20\">Upon the filing of a motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits asserting these facts, appellants made no counter showing to establish any basis for the trial court\u2019s submission of any issues to the jury. The court therefore properly granted the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
