Under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, in order for taxpayer to be entitled to claim his son as a dependent for the year 19.59, over half of the son\u2019s support for that year had to have been received from the taxpayer. We find completely without merit the contentions of taxpayer (a) that the health insurance benefits received by the son under a medical insurance policy rather than the premium paid by taxpayer for the policy should be accepted as part of his support of the child and (b) that the support furnished the son by his mother and her sister and the latter\u2019s husband prior to the mother being awarded custody of the boy by the state court should not be considered as part of the support furnished the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
