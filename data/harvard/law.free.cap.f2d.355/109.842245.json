Pursuant to a suggestion from appellant the Patent Office subsequently withdrew the Weather-Rite mark from issue and ordered re-examination of the application. The problem was that the originally submitted specimens had not supported the description in the application of the goods to be covered by the mark. Applicant promptly submitted corrected specimens, the Examiner found the mark entitled to registration, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was passed to issue, to be matured into a registration, without republieation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Appellant seeks in this action to require the Commissioner of Patents to republish the trademark for purposes of opposition. The District Court correctly held, 238 F.Supp. 509, 511, that a second publication is not required unless the mark has been amended \u201cin such a way as to invite opposition to the mark in its amended form that would not have been invited by its form when originally published.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We also agree that the correction of Weather-Rite\u2019s specimens was not such a substantial amendment of the application as to require a second publication. Carter Medicine Co. v. Barclay, 36 App.D.C. 123 (1910), is not to the contrary. The court held the Commissioner was \u25a0 justified in republishing the mark where there had been an amendment of substance to the trademark application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant's ground for opposition to the mark existed at the time of the publication on May 12, 1964, and is not attributable to applicant\u2019s correction of specimens. The Patent Office was justified in issuance on reexamination without a second publication and remitting appellant to its remedy, under \u00a7 14 of the Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064), for cancellation of the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"AoS\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">. In <em>Garter </em>the court stated (see 36 App.D.C. at 127) that the Commissioner was exercising the discretion given him by the provision of the Trademark Act that \u201cthe commissioner shall cause the mark to be published at least once in the Official Gazette of the Patent Office.\u201d Act of Feb. 20, 1905, c. 592, \u00a7 6, 33 Stat. 726.</p>\n<p id=\"AJV\">The 1905 Act was replaced by the Act of July 5, 1946, c. 540, \u00a7 12, 60 Stat. 432. Although the words \u201cat least once\u201d were omitted in the 1946 revision, we do not read this change as a prohibition of a second publication, or as a limitation on the Commissioner\u2019s discretion under the <em>Garter </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">In <em>Garter </em>the court pointed out differences between the original application, for registration of a technical trademark, and the amended application, for registration of a non-technical mark, in terms of the necessary showing and available defenses and said (36 App.D.C. at 126): \u201cIt was quite possible for an opposition to lie against the amended application, and not against the original.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
