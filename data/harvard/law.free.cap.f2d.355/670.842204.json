In that year such income amounted to $142,091.88. From this it paid dividends and other sums to stockholders amounting to $13,060.76. Upon the balance, $129,031.12, the tax of $38,676.98 was assessed. As of December \u201d31, 1959, appellant\u2019s current assets and current liabilities (in round dollars) were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">Current Assets:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">Cash $ 331,852</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeF\">Short Term Securities 850,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIc\">Accounts Receivable 102,965</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEv\">Log Inventories 463,186</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajd\">TOTAL $1,748,003</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agx\">Current Liabilities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFsI\">Accounts \u2014 Wages Payable 36,545</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzS\">Accrued Income Tax 156,086</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-g\">192,631 TOTAL</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-20\">All of the stock of the corporation (except for four qualifying shares in the names of employees) were owned by Ralph L. Diekman and his wife. Had the entire $129,000 mentioned been distributed in dividends in 1959, the Dickmans\u2019 tax liability would have been increased by more than $87,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-21\">The trial court held that appellant\u2019s \u201caccumulated earnings and profits were in excess of its reasonably anticipated needs as of the end of 1959 and that the said $129,031.12 was not so needed\u201d; that plaintiff had failed to sustain its burden of proving that it did not have, as one of its purposes for accumulating earnings and profits, the avoidance of income taxes on its shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-22\">Appellant contends that \u201c[a] 11 undistributed earnings and surplus in excess of cash dividends paid in the sum of $12,000 at the end of 1959, were necessary for the four following reasonably anticipated needs of appellant\u2019s business, and by reason thereof such earnings and surplus had not been accumulated for the purpose of avoiding surtax upon the shareholders of appellant: 1. Reserves required to meet competition, fluctuations and hazards of business. 2. Large amounts of available money required in supplying appellant\u2019s mill with logs and timber. 3. Expenditures required for planned modernization and improvements of appellant\u2019s mill. 4. Corporate funds required for payment of federal estate, state inheritance taxes and expenses of administration on retirement of a decedent shareholder\u2019s stock under \u00a7 303 of the 1954 Code on the death of either or both of the two principal shareholders of appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-23\">The findings of the court examine in detail and in depth each of these claimed reasons for the accumulations made. In each case the court found as a fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>these claims were without basis, that \u201cthe earnings and profits of the plaintiff, in addition to the said $129,031.12 were more than sufficient, in view of the liquidity of the corporation, to meet its anticipated needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The key question here is whether there was accumulation \u201cbeyond the reasonable needs of the business\u201d. This, in our view, was a question of fact. Lundgren v. Freeman, 9 cir., 307 F.2d 104 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the trial court\u2019s finding with respect thereto is supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Since we hold that the findings of the trial court are not clearly erroneous, we must affirm the judgment. It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-24\">.
