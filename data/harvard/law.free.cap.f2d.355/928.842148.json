Petitioner claims that it purchased a controlling interest in a corporation which held property similar to or related in service to that which was involuntarily converted, and thus, satisfied the requirements of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-16\">The Tax Court analyzed the facts before it and concluded that the transactions resulting in the purchase of corporate stock lacked economic substance and, in fact, \u201camounted to no more than a sham * * Our examination of the record discloses no clearly erroneous finding of basic facts by the Tax Court. Therefore, those determinations must remain undisturbed. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). It is also well settled that where the ultimate determination reasonably flows from the basic facts and those basic facts are persuasive of the ultimate fact, the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion will not be altered or modified. The Tax Court\u2019s conclusion here was clearly a permissible one. Simon v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 285 F.2d 422 (C.A.3, 1960); Heebner v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 280 F.2d 228 (C.A.3, 1960); Pennroad Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 261 F.2d 325, 328 (C.A.3, 1958), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-19\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
