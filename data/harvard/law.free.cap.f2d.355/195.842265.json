Koeller, 7 Cir., 310 F.2d 409, it is clear that there was sufficient evidence to warrant submission of this case to the jury and to warrant the verdict of guilty on the four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-20\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that Agent Wood\u2019s evidence was incompetent because of his reference to a memorandum to aid him in refreshing his recollection. See United States v. Riceardi, 3 Cir., 174 F.2d 883. See also III Wigmore Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 748, 759-760 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-21\">No reversible error appears from the charge by the trial court. We think appellant received a fair trial and no prejudice resulted from the failure to give any of the requested charges. See Phelps v. United States, 5 Cir., 252 F.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
