Williams v. United States of America, 307 F.2d 366 (9th Cir., 1962). Despite this, however, the district court granted a full hearing and found from the evidence thus adduced that this appellant was, in fact, advised of his right of appeal on the day of his sentencing, and, further, that his failure to appeal was not due to any actions by government agents or prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">The record before us fully supports these findings by the district court and its denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. 2255 is</p>\n<p id=\"b648-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
