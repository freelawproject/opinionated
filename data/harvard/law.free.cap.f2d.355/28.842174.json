Ball because of his union activities and also violated Section 8(a) (1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) by coercively interrogating an employee about his attitude toward the union. The usual cease and desist order was entered, and respondent was directed to reinstate Ball with back pay and post the customary notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">In its supplemental decision and order the Board determined that as a result of his illegal discharge Ball lost $5,317.92 in wages from the time of his discharge to June 30, 1963, and directed payment of this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-20\">Respondent contends that the Board failed to consider the testimony of the vice president of the union on cross examination which was favorable to respondent, including his statement that respondent\u2019s president had no animosity whatsoever against the union; and also failed to consider testimony that Ball was discharged for valid economic reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-21\">It is well settled that the ' weighing of the evidence is a function of the Board, N.L.R.B. v. Precision Castings Co., 130 F.2d 639 (C.A. 6). This court in reviewing the decision of the Board \u201cis not empowered to weigh one bit of evidence against another with a view of determining which it will accept as true or to substitute its judgment for that of the Board in determining what ultimate facts are established by the circumstances in evidence.\u201d Eastern Coal Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 176 F.2d 131, 135 (C.A. 4). The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); N.L.R.B. v. Tru-Line Metal Products Co., 324 F.2d 614 (C.A. 6), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 906, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L.Ed.2d 177. We hold that the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of fact by the Board in the present case are so supported. Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Enforcement of both orders is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
