Knowles, as compensation for services. We are satisfied that the Tax Court did not err with respect to the Commissioner\u2019s burden of proof and in holding that the deficiency asserted against the petitioners for the year 1954 is not barred by the statute of limitations on assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
