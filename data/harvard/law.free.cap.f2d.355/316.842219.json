In the petition, he requested that the lien be \u201cenforced to such extent and in such manner as may be just and proper at the present time <em>* </em>* <em>* </em>[and] that the proceeds of the captioned actions [Civ. 131-97 and 62 Civ. 2272] be preserved and not disbursed until the discharge of petitioner\u2019s lien, * *</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">Since 1947, the United States (the Government) by appropriate condemnation proceedings has possessed and occupied premises at 111 East 16th Street, New York, New York. Perlin in his present proceeding claims that since January 1960 he has not been paid by his clients, the lessees of the premises, Jacob Freidus and Samuel E. Aaron, nor by Aaron\u2019s estate after Aaron\u2019s death, for services rendered to them in two condemnation proceedings. Previous opinions as to this property and the fair compensation therefor have adequately covered the essential facts. For purposes of this appeal, the two proceedings cover a taking (Civ. 131-97) for the year July 1, 1958 to June 30, 1959, extendible for yearly periods to June 30, 1962 and for the period July 1, 1962 to June 30, 1963, extendible for yearly periods no longer than beyond June 30, 1967 (62 Civ. 2272). The issues framed by the pleadings in these proceedings were tried before Judge Dimock as to the period from July 1, 1960 and ending June 30, 1964, and resulted in judgments fixing the fair per annum value in No. 131-97 at $230,-000 to which was added for the 1960-62 period a sum of $230,000, and in 62 Civ. 2272 at $230,000 per annum plus an additional sum of $325,833.33 for the 1962-64 period. The judgments were entered on October 8, 1964 and appeals from both judgments are pending. On or before July 1, 1965, the Government deposited $225,000 to he credited against the estimated condemnation award for the period July 1, 1965 to June 30, 1966, which sum since that date is being reduced by $18,750 each month because of monthly payments to Freidus and the Aaron Estate which they, in turn, assert are being used to meet monthly payments to their landlords, Benjamin Kaufman and Nathan P. Jacobs. No orders for those monthly distributions have been made since October 1, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">In denying Perlin\u2019s petition, Judge Dimock was of the opinion that since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201cthere have been as yet no proceedings to fix the compensation for use and occupation for the year July 1, 1965 to June 30,1966,\u201d Perlin could have no lien against any portion of the 1965-66 deposit because Perlin had not as yet rendered any services in any such proceeding. The judge regarded the claims as \u201cfour successive and different claims in that action, to wit, for the years ended June 30, 1963, June 30, 1964, June 30, 1965 and June 30, 1966,\u201d and held that \u201cthese claims were different because, * * * the annual rental is not fixed in advance but the landlord has the right \u2018to annually negotiate or litigate the annual rent.\u2019 United States v. 396 Corp., [2 Cir.] 264 F.2d 704, 707 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">With this conclusion we disagree. Under condemnation, the Government has been in possession of the property since 1947. To be sure, various proceedings had to be held in the absence of stipulation or other agreement to fix the annual amount of compensation and, as the Judge said, \u201creal estate values fluctuate.\u201d However, the annual payments arise and become a Government obligation only as a result of the takings pursuant to actions Civ. 131-97 and 62 Civ. 2272. In fact, the deposit of the $225,000 for the 1965-66 period was made for the continued occupancy by the Government pursuant to its right under the complaint in 62 Civ. 2272 to extend its occupancy from year to year.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Under Section 475 of the New York State Judiciary Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 30, an attorney has a lien upon his client\u2019s \u201ccause of action, claim or counterclaim\u201d from the commencement of the \u201caction, special or other proceeding.\u201d The fact that under the 1962 taking, extendible until 1967, there might be periodic or annual inquests to fix a specific amount does not thereby create five separate actions or claims for compensation. Nor does the fact that the exact amount of the 1965-66 payment has not yet been fixed deprive Perlin of a lien against the sum now on deposit. Perlin represented Freidus and Aaron in the action which resulted in the occupancy from July 1, 1962 to date. The deposit now in the Registry is there because of the Government\u2019s desire to escape interest on its obligation; it is not a voluntary contribution in some other and different action to which Perlin is not related.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In advance of a hearing to determine the value of Perlin\u2019s services, this court should render no opinion thereon. Therefore, whether the defenses of waiver and/or estoppel are spurious or have any merit must be passed upon by the trier of the facts. That Freidus and the Aaron Estate claim that they need the money more than Perlin does, should not be an influencing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Perlin by his petition \u201cseeks to enforce his lien against the monies now under the control of the court to the extent of the aforesaid $34,000 [bills rendered by Perlin between April 5, 1961 and November 2, 1964], * * * without prejudice to [his] right to a further counsel fee to be fixed hereafter on the basis of the final result of the condemnation actions, among other things.\u201d His disbursements are claimed to be $729.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">In the judgments appealed from were awards which have been referred to as \u201crisk of vacancy\u201d compensation. This theory of compensation may have been different from the yearly occupancy payments but we do not regard these awards as springing from separate claims or actions. Freidus (in his brief) states that there \u201cis concededly a lien which appellant [Perlin] will utimately have against the proceeds of the final recovery, whether such recovery results from the culmination of the now pending settlement negotiations or, failing the same, by determinations of this Court.\u201d Referring to \u201cthe judgment pursuant to my [Judge Dimoek\u2019s] memorandum of December (sic) [July] 6, 1964,\u201d Judge Dimock said: \u201cThat judgment was obtained by the efforts of petitioner and he is presumably entitled to impress a lien upon its proceeds.\u201d In the meantime, however, there is no reason why Perlin should risk the dissipation of the fund now on deposit at least to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>of the $34,000 which he currently claims. Therefore, until there be a determination of the value, if any, of the services represented by his bills for services in the amount of $34,000, this amount should not be disbursed by way of monthly payments to Freidus and the Aaron Estate. In the event that the court finds that Perlin\u2019s services in connection with the fixing of the annual occupancy awards during the years subsequent to July 1, 1960 do not justify the $34,000, only such amount need be retained as to the court may appear just and proper. Such amount as the court believes should be attributed to services in obtaining the risk-of-vacancy segments of the judgments should await the final outcome of the litigation. It would appear that Per-lin\u2019s lien as to this phase is not seriously challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Order reversed; petition remanded for hearing to extent set forth in opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
