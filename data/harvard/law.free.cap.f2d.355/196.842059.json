Erie R. Co., 8 Cir., 132 F.2d 362; American R. Co. of Porto Rico v. Coronas, 1 Cir., 230 F. 545, L.R.A.1916E, 1095. This construction seems implicit in Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The evidence introduced at the trial in this case included testimony which, if believed, would support the proposition that McClelland\u2019s dermatitis was manifested prior to February 29, 1961, the beginning of the statutory period of three years. Not only did two of his fellow employees relate that Mc-Clelland had made continued complaints about his skin condition over the last eight years, but one doctor\u2019s written records show that McClelland sought medical treatment for his condition of dermatitis on October 9, 1959 and another doctor testified that he had made tests and treated McClelland for a skin condition as early as 1958. The jury could well have believed that this skin condition was the same contact dermatitis for which he sought recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">The United States Supreme Court dealt with the difficulties of fixing the \u201cday\u201d upon which a cause of action \u201caccrued\u201d when his cause of action is one that arises from a long recurring act or condition of employment without any appreciable or significant single occurrence bringing it to a head in Urie v. Thompson, supra. In that case, the court formulated the following rule to be applied in such a situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-15\">\u201cIt follows that no specific date of contact with the substance can be charged with being the date of injury, inasmuch as the injurious consequences of the exposure are the product of a period of time rather than a point of time; consequently the afflicted employee can be held to be \u2018injured\u2019 only when the accumulated effects of the deleterious substance manifested themselves * * *Citing Associated Indemnity Corp. v. Industrial Accident Commission, 124 Cal.App. 378, 381, 12 P.2d 1075. Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. at 170, 69 S.Ct. at 1025.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">In a similar case, Fowkes v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 3 Cir., 264 F.2d 397, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that it was appropriate for the trial court in such a case to submit the following question to the jury: \u201cDid the plaintiff, Charles Fowkes, know or should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>he have known, on or before August 31, 1952, that the physical condition for which he now claims damages existed?\u201d In the instant case, appellant\u2019s counsel requested a charge in the following language: \u201cDid the plaintiff, Robert Mc-Clelland, know or have reason to know, on or before February 10,1961, that the skin disease for which he now claims damages existed?\u201d Upon the refusal of the court to give the charge, counsel again requested that it be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">We think it clear that on the record before the court it was incumbent upon the trial court to submit this issue of the statute of limitations to the jury for its resolution. It was prejudicial error for the court not to do so, and the judgment must be reversed for resubmission of this issue to the jury. We leave it to the discretion of the trial court to determine whether the entire case shall be resubmitted or only the issue of limitation. If it should follow the former course, we suggest that the trial court consider what this Court said as to the single standard of causation to be applied to both negligence and contributory negligence in Page v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co., 5 Cir., 349 F.2d 820. The <em>Page </em>opinion was published after the trial in the instant case. Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"b302-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Appellee criticizes the language of our opinion because it is thought to have required the trial court, on remand, to submit the precise charge as requested by the appellant and quoted in our opinion. We meant merely to state that it was incumbent upon the trial court to submit to the jury the issue of the statute of limitations. We did not mean to phrase the form of the question or of the \u201cissue,\u201d as it is sometimes called. We think that a fair reading of the Court\u2019s language in Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, at 170, 69 S.Ct. 1018, at 1025, 93 L.Ed. 1282, requires the determination of the time when the accumulated effects of the disease to McClelland\u2019s skin manifested themselves to him as an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Having thus modified the opinion in this respect, the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
