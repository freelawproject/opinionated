The Board found that Respondents violated Section 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by threatening reprisals against employees for joining the United Industrial Workers of America, Local 286, and by interrogating employees concerning the extent of Union organization in the Respondents\u2019 plant. The Board also found that Respondents violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act by discriminatorily reducing the hours of work of four Union adherents <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and later by discharging two of these employees <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. 29 U.S.C., Section 158(a) (1), and (a) (3). The Board\u2019s decision and orders are reported at 145 N.L.R.B., No. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Respondents are Michigan corporations located in Detroit. Respondent Dale Industries, Inc., manufactures and sells metal moldings, gutters, roofing, edges, and related building products. Respondent Wyoming Service, Inc., supplies Dale Industries with manpower.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">In mid December, 1962, two Union organizers regularly came to the Respondents\u2019 plant and solicited membership of all the employees of Respondents. This solicitation occurred outside the plant and was observed by the Respondents. With several exceptions, all twenty employees of the Respondents signed Union cards during this December solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">In January, 1963, two employees, Frai-land and Brostean, asked Albert Fruman, President of Dale Industries, Inc., if they had to join a Union. Fruman answered, \u201cno, you don\u2019t have to join a Union if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d A third employee, Fisher, asked President Fruman if he would lose his job if he signed up with the Union, and Fruman answered, \u201cno, go on back to work\u201d. In mid January, 1963, employee Manee was asked if he signed a Union card. Manee was later told by his supervisor that he would \u201clease his trucks out\u201d if the Union came in, and the \u201cUnion shop would be run by the books\u201d. This conversation took place when his supervisor called Manee to his office to talk about Mance\u2019s work attitude. Oh January 28, 1963, employee Landers asked President Fruman for a ten dollar loan. Fruman objected to lending Landers any money and then told Landers that he was one of the ringleaders of the Union and that he should go to his \u201cUnion buddies\u201d for the loan. Fruman then asked employee Ingram to loan ten dollars to Landers. Ingram refused, saying Landers\u2019 credit was no good. No statements concerning the Union were made to employees Ford or Ingram.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">On the basis of these statements, the Board found that the Respondents violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act. The National Labor Relations Act specifically provides that the expression of any views shall not be evidence of an unfair labor practice if such expressions contain no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit. 29 U.S.C., Section 158(c). Interrogation regarding Union activity does not in and of itself violate the Act. There must be an over-all pattern to restrain or coerce. National La<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>bor Relations Board v. Tennessee Coach Co., 191 F.2d 546 (C.A.6, 1951); Lincoln Bearing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 311 F.2d 48 (C.A.6, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Considering the entire record, we are of the opinion that the above comments were made in the exercise of free speech, and that any illegal purpose was so minimal that Section 8(a) (1) of the Act was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">On January 28, 1963, the work week of employees Landers, Ford, Ingram and Manee was reduced to three days a week. While Landers worked in several departments, his principal job was working in the gutter department. Prior to his partial lay-off, he had been told his work on the slitting machine was not satisfactory. Ford worked in the valley department. Ingram worked in the slitter, unloaded trucks, and swept the floors. His principal job was as a porter, sweeping floors. Manee was a truck driver, operated the hi-lo and worked in the gutter room. Manee came late to work at least once a week during the several months prior to his partial lay-off. In the first week of January he damaged a hi-lo machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">In December, 1962, shipping had fallen off 25i/2 <em>% </em>over the previous five months, and in January, 1963, shipping had fallen off 53% over the previous five months. Also, a year\u2019s stockpile of \u201cvalleys\u201d was on hand. It was for these reasons, Respondents maintain, that the work week of Landers, Ford, Ingram and Manee was reduced. Respondents\u2019 plant was not run on a seniority basis. There were other men whose work week was not reduced who had less seniority than the above four whose work week was reduced. After the reduction, other employees were hired. After two weeks, the new employees were laid off and then, after one week of lay-off, were recalled. While the record is in conflict, it appears the new employees performed jobs which were substantially different from the jobs of the four laid off. Several months later, Ingram and Manee again worked full time.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">In early February, Landers and Ford were discharged after an argument. Landers and Ford were operating the slitting machine. Landers fed the pipe into the machine and Ford took it up. The pipe was jamming the machine. John Bykaylo was called to fix the machine. This happened several times. The second time Bykaylo and Landers began arguing and calling each other names. Bykaylo left and started to go home. President Fruman was told by Bykaylo that Landers threatened to kill him with a hammer. Fruman talked to Landers and Ford, and both denied that Landers threatened Bykaylo with a hammer. Fruman then asked all three to take lie detector tests. Landers and Ford at first agreed, and then said they would not do so unless a Union man was present. Fruman then discharged Landers and Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The Board found the Respondents had violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act when they reduced the work week of Landers, Ford, Ingram and Manee, and discharged Landers and Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">In National Labor Relations Board v. Lassing, 284 F.2d 781 (C.A.6, 1960), this Court held that an employer may curtail operations, with a resulting loss of employment on certain employees, as long as the changes in operations are not illegally motivated. Only discrimination which encourages or discourages membership in a labor organization is prohibited by the Act. Curtailment or suspension of operations, motivated by economic reasons, is not an unfair labor practice under the Act. See National Labor Relations Board v. Adkins Transfer Co., 226 F.2d 324 (C.A.6, 1955); Plasti-Line, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 278 F.2d 482 (C.A.6, 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive. National Labor Relations Act, as amended, Sections 10(e) (f), 29 U.S.C., Section 160 (e) (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Considering the entire record, we conclude there is not substantial evidence of an illegal motive to support the Board\u2019s finding that the partial lay-offs and the discharges violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act. There is substantial evidence that the Respondents\u2019 conduct relating to the partial lay-off of the four employees was reasonably adopted to achieve legitimate business ends. By January, 1963, shipping had fallen off 53% over the previous five months. Respondents produced and had on hand a year\u2019s stock of valleys. The reasonable conclusion is that the employees most affected by these adverse economic conditions had their work week reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The evidence is likewise substantial that Landers and Ford were discharged because of the argument with Bykaylo, and not because of Union animus on the part of the Respondents. The record does not disclose a prior history of Union animus on the part of the Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The enforcement of the Board\u2019s orders is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-13\">.
