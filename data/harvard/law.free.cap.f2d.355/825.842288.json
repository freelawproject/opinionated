A jury awarded $700,000. The court confirmed this award, but by order of July 20, 1964 allowed the Government to deduct $16,500 as fair and equitable rent for the period from the date of taking to July 31, 1964, and ordered payment of $1,200 per month to the Government so long as appellant Capott Corporation, which had owned the hotel and continued to operate it, remained in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\"> The taking was obviously for a public use although appellant asserts the contrary. The compensation awarded was within the range of the testimony. In a condemnation case, when the jury reached \u201ca valuation from the evidence which the trial court confirms, it is not for us to say that it is so inadequate that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant a new trial.\u201d Murray v. United States, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 179, 181, 130 F.2d 442, 444 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">\u25a0 The court instructed the jury not to consider any \u201cpersonal property\u201d in fixing the amount of compensation. This was correct, for no personal property was taken. \u201cThe Constitution and the statutes do not define the meaning of just compensation. But it has come to be recognized that just compensation is the value of the interest taken. This is not the value to the owner for his particular purposes or to the condemnor for some special use but a so-called \u2018market value.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372, 377, 66 S.Ct. 596, 90 L.Ed. 729 (1946). Since \u201cconsequential losses\u201d are not compensable in federal condemnation proceedings, <em>id. </em>at 377-378, 66 S.Ct. 596, appellant cannot recover for depreciation in the value of furniture and removable equipment. Potomac Electric Power Co. v. United States, 66 App.D.C. 77, 85 F.2d 243, cert. denied, 299 U.S. 565, 57 S.Ct. 27, 81 L.Ed. 416 (1936). \u201cIt is generally held that damages in condemnation proceedings should be allowed in respect of fixtures which have become a part of the realty\u201d but \u201c * * * compensation cannot be recovered in such a proceeding for damages resulting to personal property not annexed (at least constructively) to the freehold.\u201d 90 A.L.R. 159-160 (1934). Futrovsky v. United States, 62 App.D.C. 235, 66 F.2d 215 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Capott Corporation does not contend that the rent established by the court is unreasonably high. It objects to paying any rent, on the theory that it still owns the property. But when a declaration of taking is filed and the estimated amount of compensation is deposited, title to the condemned property vests in the United States and the court \u201cmay make such orders in respect of encumbrances, liens, rents, taxes, assessments, insurance, and other charges, if any, as it deems just and equitable.\u201d D.C.Code, 1961 ed., \u00a7 16-628; as amended, Supp. IV, 1965, \u00a7\u00a7 16-1353, 16-1355. The \u201ccourt should order the payment of reasonable compensation to the Government, the then owner of the property, as provided by the statute * * United States v. Certain Interests in Property, etc., 302 F.2d 201, 203 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Far from suggesting that $1200 a month is too much, appellant contends that the court erred in refusing to admit in evidence, as bearing on the value of the property, a letter from the General Services Administration which says \u201cThe fair rental value established by the Government\u2019s appraisers is $7,500 a month\u201d and demands a rent of $6,750 a month. Appellant does not offer to pay any such rent and there is nothing to suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>anyone would pay it. What the General Services Administration, as landlord, saw fit to demand of the tenant throws little or no light on the rental value of the property and still less light, if possible, on the market value of the property itself. Therefore the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the letter. The case is more than covered by our ruling in another condemnation case that the District Court did not abuse its \u201clarge discretion\u201d in refusing to admit prices which the Government had actually paid for certain parcels of land in the neighborhood. Hannan v. United States, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 118, 120, 131 F.2d 441, 443 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
