This Court has previously held that this is a factual matter. (Woodworth v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 218 F.2d 719, 724, C.A. 6th 1955, and Chandler\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 228 F.2d 909, C.A. 6th 1955.) As such, it should be decided initially by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">This matter is hereby remanded to the Tax Court for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
