On June 28, 1963, while he was yet Vice President and Chairman of the Board of the Group Employer, Dr. Shands became totally disabled. Subsequently, on July 17,1963, he resigned these positions. He died as a result of these disabling conditions within three months on October 6, 1963. If, as claimed, there was a duty to file notice of disability prior to suit, it was either waived by the Insurer\u2019s outright denial of coverage or was satisfied by a timely notice of death. The contention under a clause extending coverage if death occurs \u201cwithin one year after discontinuance of premium payments\u201d that there is no liability because the Employer, apparently inadvertently, continued to pay premiums after death is patently without any substance whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-22\">Summary judgment was eminently correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
