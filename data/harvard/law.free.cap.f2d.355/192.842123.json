However, in view of the facts that these observations were narrated in the present tense, that some time lapse between the observations and the making of the affidavit is inevitable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the property sought included the semi-permanent structure of a distillery,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we hold that the Commissioner in issuing the search warrant could have reasonably concluded that the distillery was at the time on the premises. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\">. In support of his belief that \u201cthere is now being concealed * * * an unregistered distillery, arid supplies and apparatus connected therewith * * affiant swore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">\u201cThere is a new tar paper shack built on the back of a barn to the rear of the residence with vehicle travel between the house and barn. To the rear of the barn a <em>2\" </em>slop hose with fresh slop at the end about 30 ft. from the barn. There is spent grain at the side of the barn, fuel oil drums beside the barn. The distinct odor of mash can be readily ascertained. The barn is papered up inside to cover cracks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">On argument, appellant conceded that to support a nighttime search warrant, it was not necessary that these observations be made on the very day of the affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-14\">. See Ewing v. United States, 5 Cir., 1930, 37 F.2d 287, 288:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">\u201cUnless an affidavit be made on the premises, something unthinkable in the orderly procedure of applying for a warrant, it would be manifestly impossible for the affiant to state of his own \u201cknowledge that the illegal property was at the moment on, the premises to be searched. * * * The most he is required to do is to state facts within his own knowledge from which the officer issuing the search warrant may reasonably conclude that the liquor or other property subject to seizure is at the time on the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b297-24\">. Considering the large, cumbersome nature of modern illicit stilling apparatus, the time lapse between the observations and the affidavit may properly be greater here than was permitted in the Prohibition-era cases such as Distefano v. United States, 5 Cir., 1932, 58 F.2d 963, and In re Hollywood Cabaret, 2 Cir., 1925, 5 F.2d 651, where the presence of readily movable quantities of liquor was sought to be shown by the affiant\u2019s observations of single sales weeks before the search warrant was applied for.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
