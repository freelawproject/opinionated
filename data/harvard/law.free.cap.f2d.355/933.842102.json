Morgenthau, the defendant, had no authority in law or in fact to appear for and defend Judge Bonsai in another action brought by plaintiff against Judge Bonsai affecting matters ruled upon by him as a United States District Judge. We disposed of this contention on plaintiff\u2019s last appeal from a judgment dismissing his complaint. Weiss v. Morgenthau, 2 Cir., 1965, 344 F.2d 428. The complaint in Weiss v. Bonsai was also dismissed because of plaintiff\u2019s wilful refusal to submit to a pretrial deposition, following our action allowing plaintiff a further opportunity to appear and testify. Weiss v. Bonsal, 2 Cir., 1965, 344 F.2d 428. The appeal to this Court from the judgment of dismissal in Weiss v. Bonsal was dismissed on October 6, 1965 as frivolous and devoid of merit, and the petition for rehearing was denied on November 12, 1965. As the issues have already been fully explored and decided, despite the verbal characterizations so freely used by plaintiff, we have no alternative other than to dismiss this appeal also as frivolous and devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
