After a trial the District Court rendered judgment for Ap-pellee on the ground that the negligence of the jeep operator in crossing over the center line into Appellee\u2019s lane was the proximate cause of the collision. The Court further held that no acts of the Ap-pellee proximately caused the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-26\"> The District Court\u2019s findings come here with the insulation of Rule 52(a) which prevents us from granting Appellant another trial of the facts- \u2014 \u25a0 either here or again in the Trial Court on mere differences of fact conclusions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The District Judge, having heard the evidence and determined its credibility, resolved the conflicts and drew reasonable inferences from the testimony. The Government fails to demonstrate that on this record these factual determinations were clearly erroneous or that the Judge misapplied the applicable Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"AF6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
