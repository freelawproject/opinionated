C. on the next day. The automobile was found abandoned two months later in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">The defendant testified that, after obtaining possession of the vehicle, she drove it to Baltimore and thereafter to West Virginia, and then to Ohio, ultimately returning to Baltimore. She testified, however, that by telephone calls to the lessor\u2019s offices in Baltimore, Mar-tinsburg, West Virginia and Toledo, Ohio, she obtained permission for what she did. She testified that she abandoned the vehicle because she did not have the funds to pay the charges incurred, but claimed her intention to abandon it was not formed until after she returned to Baltimore. In light of the fact that the lessor\u2019s records contained no report of any telephone call from the defendant, her failure to do anything to secure payment of the rental beyond the initial deposit of $25, her extended sojourn in states other than Maryland, and her ultimate abandonment of the car, the District Judge, to whom the case was tried without a jury, was not required to accept the defendant\u2019s testimony relating to claimed telephone calls or her claim that she did not form the intention to abandon the automobile or to appropriate it to her own use until after her return to Baltimore. The evidence abundantly supports beyond a reasonable doubt the finding that the intention to appropriate the vehicle to her own use was formed before the conclusion of her interstate travels.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
