The alleged \u201cterrible jail\u201d is the Juvenile Receiving Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-23\">The petitioner says that he has not been found to have been involved in any antisocial act, but has been detained in the Home since October 29, 1965, awaiting a hearing on his mother\u2019s representation to the Juvenile Court that he is \u201cbeyond control.\u201d He contends there was no inquiry into whether his mother\u2019s allegations are true; whether his present plight is attributable to his delinquency or parental neglect; or whether he needs custody or treatment in general and detention in the Receiving Home in particular. He urges that this detention is violative of due process of law and the constitutional right to bail. He also alleges that he has been \u201cremoved from his own family * * * [without being secured] custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his parents.\u201d 11 D.C.Code \u00a7 902 (1961). His petition was denied in the District Court and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-25\">After oral argument in this Court, the Juvenile Court released petitioner in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>father\u2019s custody. Since the detention from which petitioner sought release no longer exists, I agree that the serious issues raised in his petition are rendered moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
