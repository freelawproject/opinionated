There now being made to appear some doubt as to whether joinder of the fire carriers would destroy diversity jurisdiction, we hold that although the fire insurers may be \u201cinterested\u201d in this action, they do not have a sufficient legal interest in the contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>versy so as to be deemed necessary parties. Any effect which the District Court\u2019s hypothetical determination of their liability (in order to ascertain Mutual Boiler\u2019s liability under the \u201cjoint loss\u201d apportionment formula of its policy) may have upon the fire carriers is merely incidental, and, thus, complete and final justice may be done in their absence. In reaching this conclusion, we are influenced by our serious doubt that diversity jurisdiction would exist if the fire insurers were joined, see Wright, Federal Courts, 262-263 (1963). Although certain Fifth Circuit \u201cloan receipt\u201d cases dealing with the issue of \u201cinterest\u201d in another context might, on their surface, suggest to the contrary, see, e. g., Peoples Loan &amp; Finance Corp. v. Lawson, 271 F.2d 529 (5th Cir. 1959), we feel that those cases were based upon considerations other than the ultimate or fundamental interest of the parties, see Celanese Corp. of America v. John Clark Indus., 214 F.2d 551, 556-557 (5th Cir. 1954). It is this latter criterion by which we are bound in considering questions of alignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Accordingly, the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
