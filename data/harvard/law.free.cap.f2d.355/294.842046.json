At the time the deduction involved here was claimed, section 162 read in pertinent parts:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-28\">\u201c(a) In General \u2014 There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">(2) traveling expenses (including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The facts, found by the Tax Court as stipulated, are substantially as follows. During the taxable year 1958 taxpayer was a captain in the United States Marine Corps. For approximately two and one half years prior to October 1, 1957, he had been attached to an air squadron stationed in El Toro in Southern California. On October 1, 1957, taxpayer, together with his component, was assigned to duty in the Far East with the First Marine Aircraft Wing, a part of the Aircraft Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, with administrative headquarters at Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro (Santa Ana) California. It was impossible for taxpayer to be accompanied abroad by his family because Marine Corps orders prohibited dependents of personnel assigned to duty with the Aircraft Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, from accompanying such personnel or establishing homes in the Far East. During taxpayer\u2019s entire tour abroad his wife and two children remained at the family\u2019s established home in Santa Ana, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Commissioned officers pay for their own meals at an official duty station unless they are considered to be on a temporary assignment or in travel status, in which cases they are reimbursed for their meal expenses. Taxpayer\u2019s principal duty station while in the Far East was Iwakuni, Japan. While at Iwakuni he received free lodging; but as he was not considered to be on travel status while there, he did not receive free meals. During 1958, except for forty-nine days during which he was placed on travel status while absent from Iwakuni and reimbursed for travel expenses, taxpayer had to pay for his own meals at a cost to him of $650.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On his joint return for 1958 taxpayer deducted the $650 as a travel expense incurred while away from home. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and claimed a deficiency. Taxpayer petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the alleged deficiency, and the Tax Court found as ultimate facts that during the taxable year taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax home\u201d was his military post of duty in the Far East, and that his stay there was \u201cindefinite, indeterminate, or permanent and not temporary.\u201d Accordingly, the Tax Court found that the expenses in question were not incurred while traveling \u201caway from home\u201d within the meaning of section 162(a) (2) and therefore were not deductible. On appeal from the decision of the Tax Court, we are faced squarely with the question of the meaning of \u201chome\u201d within section 162(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Examination of the legislative history surrounding the introduction of the phrase \u201caway from home\u201d into the Revenue Act of 1921 is inconclusive as to Congressional intent regarding the meaning of \u201chome.\u201d As early as 1927, however, the Board of Tax Appeals held that the precursor of section 162(a) (2) was intended to permit a deduction for traveling expenses only if the expenses were incurred while the taxpayer was away from his \u201cpost of duty\u201d or place of employment. Mort L. Bixler, 5 B.T.A. 1181 (1927). The word \u201chome\u201d thus became a term of art with a meaning different from its normal usage as residence, domicile or dwelling place; and the \u201ctax home\u201d doctrine was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Since the Tax Court\u2019s decision in the Bixler case the Commissioner has consistently maintained that \u201chome\u201d in the statute means \u201ctax home\u201d and that one\u2019s tax home is one\u2019s \u201chome post\u201d or place of employment. This construction has been accepted by a number of courts. See Barnhill v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 148 F.2d 913, 159 A.L.R. 1210 (4th Cir. 1945); O\u2019Toole v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 243 F.2d 302 (2nd Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">In Wallace v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 144 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1944), however, this court rejected the \u201ctax hofne\u201d doctrine and held that the travel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ing expenses of a taxpayer who regularly lived in San Francisco but visited Los Angeles on business met the statutory requirement that traveling expenses be incurred while away from home. In Wallace we unequivocally stated that \u201chome\u201d as used in the statute should be given its ordinary and usual meaning. Wallace v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A chance to resolve a conflict among the circuit courts as to the meaning of \u201chome\u201d to which our opinion in Wallace contributed came before the Supreme Court in Flowers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203 (1946). In considering the travel expense deduction the court set out three requirements, each of which had to be met before the deduction would be allowed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201c(1) The expense must be a reasonable and necessary traveling expense, as that term is generally understood. This includes such items as transportation fares and food and lodging expenses incurred while traveling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">(2) The expense must be incurred \u2018while away from home.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">(3) The expense must be incurred in pursuit of business * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The court noted the division of opinion regarding the meaning of \u201chome\u201d in the circuit courts but found it unnecessary to reconcile because in its view of the case the expenses involved did not meet the third requirement of being incurred in pursuit of business. Flowers thus avoided rather than settled the \u201chome\u201d controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">Strictly applied, the \u201ctax home\u201d doctrine would greatly restrict the travel expense deduction; and the Tax Court soon recognized an exception to it in cases where the taxpayer\u2019s employment away from home could be considered \u201ctemporary.\u201d Chester D. Griesemer, 10 B.T.A. 386 (1928); Walter F. Brown, 13 B.T.A. 832 (1928); accord Cobum v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 138 F.2d 763 (2nd Cir. 1943). However, where the employment away from home was of indefinite or indeterminate duration, the deduction was denied. Willard S. Jones, 13 T.C. 880 (1949). The Commissioner accepted the \u201ctemporary-indefinite\u201d distinction and recognized \u201ctemporary\u201d employment as an exception to the rule that \u201chome\u201d equals place of employment. I.R.S.Pub. No. 300, 5 CCH 1956 Stand.Fed.Tax Rep. para. 6347; Rev.Rul. 189, 1960-1 Cum.Bull. 60, 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">The Supreme Court had a second opportunity to clarify the \u201chome\u201d controversy when the question of the scope of the \u201ctemporary\u201d employment exception came before it in Peurifoy v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 358 U.S. 59, 79 S.Ct. 104, 3 L.Ed.2d 30 (1958). In Peurifoy three construction workers claimed deductions for living expenses incurred while living for periods of from eight to twenty months at construction sites some distance from their permanent residences. The Tax Court allowed the deductions on the ground that the employment away from home was \u201ctemporary.\u201d The Fourth Circuit assumed without deciding that the temporary employment exception was valid and that it applied to the \u201cexigencies of the business\u201d requirement as well as the \u201caway from home\u201d requirement set out in Flowers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra. The court then reversed because the taxpayers had not met their burden of proof of showing their employment was temporary and not indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">Upon review on writ of certiorari the Supreme Court made the same assumptions and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">\u201cGenerally, a taxpayer is entitled to deduct unreimbursed travel expenses * * * only when they are required by the exigencies of business * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">To this rule, however, the Tax Court has engrafted an exception which allows a deduction for expenditures of the type made in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>where the taxpayer\u2019s employment is \u2018temporary\u2019 as contrasted with \u2018indefinite\u2019 or \u2018indeterminate.\u2019 * * * The respondent does not in the present case challenge the validity of this exception to the general rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The Commissioner contends that in Peurifoy the Supreme Court approved the temporary employment concept as an exception to its rule in Flowers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, and that, therefore, a post of indefinite or indeterminate employment necessarily becomes the taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax home.\u201d It is clear from the language quoted above, however, that the validity of the temporary employment exception was assumed without decision by the Supreme Court in Peurifoy because the court did not consider that a challenge to the exception was before it. The court affirmed on the ground that it would not disturb the circuit court\u2019s factual assessment that the employment involved was not temporary. And for the second time the Supreme Court specifically avoided a definition of the word \u201chome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">This was our position in Harvey v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 283 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1960), when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cPeurifoy, then, does not establish the rule, as suggested by the Commissioner, that the place where a taxpayer is employed for an \u2018indefinite\u2019 period, is <em>necessarily </em>his tax home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In Harvey the taxpayer maintained his home in Santa Monica, California, where he worked for the Douglas Aircraft Company. From Santa Monica he was transferred on temporary assignment to Edwards Air Force Base, 117 miles away. Taxpayer\u2019s tour of duty at Edwards was to be for an indeterminate length of time; he knew only that he would work there as long as he was needed, a period which in the circumstances of his job could be expected to last from a few months to two years. In fact, he remained thirteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The Tax Court found Edwards to be the taxpayer\u2019s home during the taxable year in question on the ground that his term of employment there was \u201cindefinite.\u201d We concluded that when the term \u201cindefinite\u201d was used as the Tax Court used it, the test applied became a mechanical one, incapable of effectuating the purpose of the deduction provision; and we formulated a more flexible test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">\u201cAn employee might be said to change his tax home if there is a reasonable probability <em>known to him </em>that he may be employed for a long period of time at his new station. What constitutes \u2018a long period of time\u2019 varies with circumstances surrounding each case. If such be the case, it is reasonable to expect him to move his permanent abode to his new station, and thus avoid the double burden that the Congress intended to mitigate. On the other hand, if it is very likely that taxpayer\u2019s stay away from home will be short, then it seems quite unreasonable to expect him to move his domicile, even though it cannot be said that his employment will terminate \u2018within a fixed or reasonably short period,* to use the words of the Tax Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">In drawing the distinction between long and short periods of employment we did not reject the distinctions which had been drawn by other courts, but we did reject the inflexible manner in which the distinction had been employed by the Commissioner and the Tax Court. We used the length of employment away from one\u2019s established home as a factor in determining what we considered to be the fundamental question in these travel expense cases \u2014 is it reasonable to expect the taxpayer to move his residence to his place of employment. Applying this test to the facts of the Harvey case, we held that the taxpayer could not reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>have been expected to move his residence, and the deduction was allowed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In Wright v. Hartsell, 305 F.2d 221 (9th Cir. 1962), we again looked to whether it would be reasonable to expect the particular taxpayer to move his home nearer to the place where he was working in determining the deductibility of claimed travel expenses. In Wright the taxpayer commuted daily from his residence in Pocatello, Idaho, to work at Atomic Energy Commission research sites seventy miles away in an inhospitable desert area remote from any town or place of habitation. We held that a taxpayer\u2019s inability to maintain a home in the usual sense at his place of employment was a valid reason for allowing the deduction as travel expenses of the resulting costs of transportation, food and lodging. We concluded, however, that the taxpayer had a duty to mitigate his expenses by moving as near to the job site as is reasonable. The deduction in Wright was accordingly measured with reference to the nearest habitable community to the employment site, the town of Arco, Idaho. As Arco was neither the taxpayer\u2019s actual residence nor his place of employment, our decision in Wright necessarily proceeded upon the basis that \u201chome\u201d as used in the statute means residence, with the qualification that the taxpayer should establish his residence as near to his place of employment as is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The Commissioner has argued that rejection of the \u201ctax home\u201d doctrine will result in the deductibility of nondeductible commuting and other personal expenses. We think, however, that the words of section 162 limiting deductions to \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d expenses stand to prevent such a result. It has been clear since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Flowers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue that \u201cthe exigencies of business rather than the personal conveniences and necessities of [this taxpayer] must be the motivating factors.\u201d Flowers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">By placing the emphasis on the \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d requirement of the statute, there is no necessity for attributing any special \u201ctax sense\u201d to the word \u201chome.\u201d Both the Commissioner's distinction between temporary and indefinite employment and the \u201cexigencies .of business\u201d test as set out in Flowers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue look to the duration of employment as a principal factor in separating deductible business expenses from nondeductible personal expenses. The \u201cexigencies of business\u201d test follows directly and naturally from the \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d requirement of the statute itself. The temporary-indefinite distinction, on the other hand, introduces into the statute an extraneous concept formulated in the first place only to provide an exception to the Commissioner\u2019s strained rule that \u201chome\u201d equals place of employment. Neither the rule nor its exception are necessary and both obscure the fundamental question of whether expenses claimed as travel expenses under section 162 are ordinary and necessary business expenses. Deductibility under the statute need not turn on fictions and inflexible rules of thumb. By looking to the ordinary and necessary requirement of the statute the end result will in most cases be substantially the same, and the unfairness inherent in a strict application of the \u201ctax home\u201d doctrine will be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">\u201cHome\u201d in the statute, then, means home in its ordinary and usual sense, as we stated long ago in Wallace v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The length of time a taxpayer is employed away from that home does not itself give_ the answer, but is a factor in determining the answer to the question whether the taxpayer could reasonably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>expected to have moved his home. If it appears reasonable to have expected the taxpayer to move closer to his place of employment, then expenses claimed as travel expenses cannot be said to be \u201cordinary and necessary.\u201d On the other hand, if such a move appears unreasonable, the ordinary and necessary requirement is met, and the deduction will be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We turn now to the particular-facts of the case before us. Taxpayer\u2019s duty station in the Far East was dictated by military orders. Marine Corps orders also prohibited him from establishing a home for his dependents in the Far East.- There is no question here as to whether it was reasonable for taxpayer to have moved his home. He had no choice but to maintain a separate residence for his family.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that taxpayer\u2019s travel expenses while away from home during the taxable year in question were \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d expenses and are deductible under section 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Commissioner appears to be making the final argument in this case that taxpayer is not entitled to a deduction for the meal expenses because he has failed to show that he would not have been obliged to pay an equal amount for meals at his home post in the United States. The statute, however, specifically provides that \u201ctraveling expenses, (including the <em>entire </em>amount expended for meals and lodging)\u201d is deductible. (Emphasis added.) We have determined the expenses claimed to have been ordinary and necessary. Taxpayer need make no further showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-29\">. This opinion was written by Judge William E. Orr. Following Judge Orr\u2019s death on October 7, 1965, Judge Browning was assigned to the panel and the case was reargued. The- majority of the court as now constituted adopts Judge Orr\u2019s opinion as its own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-30\">. Section 162(a) (2) was amended in 1962 by striking out \u201c(including the entirfe amount expended for meals and lodging)\u201d and inserting in lieu thereof \u201c(including amounts expended for meals and lodging other than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances).\u201d Revenue Act of 1962, \u00a7 4(b), COH Stand. Fed.Tax Rep. 85, 100 (extra ed. No. 44). This amendment is not involved in the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. In Harvey v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, both the taxpayer and the Commissioner had stipulated that \u201chome\u201d meant \u201chome post\u201d or place of employment and not place of abode. The meaning of \u201chome\u201d as such was, therefore, not before us; and we inquired only into the application of the distinction between temporary and indefinite employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">. Taxpayer\u2019s position is similar to that of the public official who must maintain his home elsewhere than his official place of employment. In such cases the travel expense deduction has been granted. United States v. Le Blanc, 278 F.2d 571 (5th Cir. 1960); Moss v. United States, 145 F.Supp. 10 (W.D.S.C.1956); Em-mert v.

With our late Brother Orr, one of the noblest of men, I discussed my opposing views, and he, without doubt, would have expected and encouraged me to record them.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">When the Marine Corps transferred the taxpayer to his post of duty in Japan, the assignment was for a period of fifteen months. The period was subject to extension by orders of the Marine Corps. As the majority points out, there were forty-nine days during taxpayer\u2019s fourteen and one-half months of service in Japan when he was away from his station on temporary duty, placed in \u201ctravel status\u201d, and reimbursed for his expenses. For the remainder of the period of overseas duty, approximately thirteen months, the taxpayer received from the Government, in addition to his lodging, a tax-exempt payment of approximately $145 per month as a quarters and subsistence allowance. Notwithstanding the fact that the allowance for subsistence was $42.50 per month, the majority upholds the taxpayer\u2019s claim that the <em>entire </em>cost of his meals during the approximate thirteen-month period is a tax-deductible expense allowance. In so doing, the majority casts our circuit into direct conflict with Revenue Ruling 55-571, 1955-2 Cum.Bull. 44,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and with the decision of the Fourth Circuit in Bercaw v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 165 F.2d 521 (1948), wherein the Court wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">\u201cThe taxpayer was engaged in the business of an Army officer. His place of business was his particular Army post. If his Army duties required him to travel, he would have received a per diem travel allowance * * *. Thus the expendi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tures for meals and striker service while at this post were personal living expenses and non-deductible * * #. This conclusion is inescapable when it is remembered that this officer has been paid commutation of quarters and a subsistence allowance, both of which allowances are not considered as income for the purposes of taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">165 F.2d at 524. (Citations omitted.) See also James R. Whitaker, 24 T.C. 750 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Regardless of whether or not the taxpayer was- \u201caway from home\u201d within the meaning of that language as it is used in section 162(a)(2), the only expenses which are deductible under the section are \u201ctraveling expenses\u201d. Flowers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203 (1946). \u201cThe expense must be a.reasonable and necessary <em>traveling </em>expense, as that term is generally understood.\u201d 326 U.S. 470, 66 S.Ct. 252. (Emphasis added.) It should follow that the question is not whether the taxpayer was \u201caway from home\u201d, but whether during the period for which the expense is claimed he was actually \u201ctraveling\u201d. The Tax Court has determined that he was not, and our duty is to sustain the finding absent demonstration by the taxpayer that the finding was clearly erroneous. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960); Truck Terminals, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 314 F.2d 449,455 (9th Cir. 1963); Young v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 268 F.2d 245 (9th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">A factual determination of the Tax Court, supported by substantial evidence, should not, on review, be set aside as \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d, unless \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duber-stein, supra, 363 U.S. at 291, 80 S.Ct. at 1200, quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), and, in my opinion, the whole body of evidence clearly supports the Tax Court\u2019s finding. In the first place, the period of time for which the taxpayer was assigned to his Japanese post made of that post his \u201cpermanent\u201d station in a military sense. In making provisions for \u201ctravel and transportation allowances * * * upon a <em>change </em>of <em>permanent </em>station\u201d (37 U.S. C. \u00a7 404(a). (Emphasis added.)), the Congress has recognized that a soldier\u2019s \u201cpermanent station\u201d, being subject to \u201cchange\u201d, is never permanent in an enduring sense. In the present case, however, the period of assignment, fifteen months with possibility of extension, was factually determined to be an \u201cindefinite\u201d period rather than a \u201ctemporary\u201d period, and this should be an important, if not a controlling, consideration. Peu-rifoy v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 358 U.S. 59, 79 S.Ct. 104, 3 L.Ed. 2d 30 (1958). In the second place, the Marine Corps itself determined that the taxpayer, during his fourteen and one-half months in Japan, was not in \u201ctravel status\u201d except for the forty-nine days when he was temporarily detached to locations comparatively short distances from his \u201cpermanent\u201d Japanese post. If it be conceded that the Marine Corps\u2019 determination should not be conclusive, it nevertheless constitutes strong support for the Tax Court\u2019s factual decision. William W. Todd, 10 T.C. 655 (1948). See also Allan Cunningham, 22 T.C. 906 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The Congress has undertaken to assure that military men who serve our country overseas shall not suffer undue financial loss. It is provided that the Secretaries of the uniformed services may authorize payment to overseas military personnel of per diem allowances related to the cost of living, \u201cincluding a cost of * * * subsistence\u201d, and such allowance is authorized to be made to the soldier \u201cwhether or not he is in a travel status\u201d. 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 405, revising in 1962 without substantial change The Career Compensation Act of 1949, ch. 681, \u00a7 303(b), 63 Stat. 813. From these provisions I see an intent on the part of Congress that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the soldier assigned to overseas duty shall not sustain significant financial loss and that any such loss shall be prevented by the direct payment of travel expenses and increased allowances rather than by tax deduction which might properly be claimed by others for whom no specific increased benefits are provided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">I would affirm the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\">. \u201cmembers of the Armed Forces of the United States on permanent duty assignments at official stations overseas are not traveling \u2018away from home\u2019 and may not deduct their expenses for meals and -lodging at such locations, even though they are required to maintain homes in the United States for their families who are not allowed to accompany them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-14\">. I do not believe that in the selection of qualified military personnel for overseas duty, the Department of Defense should be invited to concern itself with increased cost to the Government depending upon whether one soldier is \u201caway from home\u201d and another soldier, with a different family status, is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">In the so-called \u201cCuban crisis\u201d of recent years, we read that the dependents of our military personnel stationed at Guantanamo Bay were removed to the United States. Would the majority say that those servicemen, immediately upon the transfer of their dependents, became \u201caway from home\u201d and commenced to \u201ctravel\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">It is anomalous and discriminatory that our servicemen now engaged in Vietnam are entitled, under the majority opinion, to a more favorable tax treatment in our circuit than are those who, while doubtless fighting with equal valor, are denied deductions for their \u201ctraveling\u201d expenses in the Fourth Circuit and, apparently, in the Sixth Circuit also. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Motch, 180 F.2d 859 (6th Cir. 1950), wherein the court wrote, at 861,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-25\">\u201c[An armed services officer] is limited in his personal expenditures chargeable to the government, or tax-wise deductible, to the usual stipends fixed under appropriate regulations adopted in pursuance of Acts of Congress for his subsistence and travel expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
