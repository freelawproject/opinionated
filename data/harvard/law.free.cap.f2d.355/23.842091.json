Appellants\u2019 business is straightening and replating damaged and otherwise unusable automobile bumpers. The narrow issue on appeal is whether appellants\u2019 restoration process constituted \u201cmanufacturing\u201d under Internal Revenue Code of 1954 Section 4061(b) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and accompanying regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-19\">The district court filed a thorough opinion containing concise findings of fact and conclusions of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are in agreement with the conclusions reached by the court below and nothing is to be gained by further discussion in this court. We approve and adopt the district court\u2019s opinion and order the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-10\">. Int.Rev.Code of 1954 Section 4061(b) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">\u201cThere is hereby imposed upon [automobile] parts or accessories * * * sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer a tax equivalent to 8 percent of the price for which so sold * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-13\">.

Rebuilding of automobile parts or accessories, as distinguished from reconditioning or repairing, constitutes manufacturing, and the rebuilder of such parts or accessories is liable fox the tax imposed by section 4061(b) with respect to his sales of such rebuilt parts or accessories. RebOring or other machining, rewinding and comparable major operations constitute rebuilding * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-20\">(b) Reconditioned <em>parts or accessories. </em>The mere disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling (with any necessary replacement of worn parts) of automobile parts or accessories * * * are regarded as reconditioning operations rather than the manufacturing or production of rebuilt parts or accessories. The sale of reconditioned parts or accessories is not subject to tax. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-22\">See generally Hartley v. United States, 252 F.2d 262 (5th Oir. 1958); Campbell v.
