(Progress), brought suit under \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Progress, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and two of its Locals, #1841 and #2005. The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, holding that it was without jurisdiction, inasmuch as the conduct complained of <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was arguably an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>unfair labor practice and, under existing authority, the action was preempted by the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"> While this appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court handed down its opinion in the case of Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L. Ed.2d 842 (1967), holding that in a suit by a member against his union charging a violation of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation, the National Labor Relations Board does not have exclusive jurisdiction and, therefore, a Court\u2019s traditional jurisdiction to curb arbitrary conduct by an employee\u2019s statutory representative is not preempted by the Board. In discussing the intricate relationship between the duty of fair representation and the enforcement of collective bargaining contracts, the Court pointed out that the question of whether a union has breached its duty of fair representation will in many cases be a critical issue in a suit under \u00a7 301 charging an employer with a breach of contract. As a result, if an employee sues his employer for breach of contract in a \u00a7 301 action and joins the union as a defendant alleging a breach of its duty of fair representation, the action is still a \u00a7 301 suit and the jurisdiction of the Court is not preempted. Consequently, the pivotal point in the District Court\u2019s disposition of defendants\u2019 motions was removed by the ruling in <em>Vaca </em>(supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Conceding the applicability of <em>Vaca </em>to the present case, insofar as it negates Labor Board preemption of fair representation disputes, defendants nevertheless assert most strenuously that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because the gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 action does not fall within \u00a7 301 inasmuch as \u201c * * the complaint does not allege a breach of contract nor are the allegations of the complaint sufficiently broad to reasonably support such a claim.\u201d According to defendants, in order to establish \u00a7 301 jurisdiction here the complaint must contain specific allegations of (1) an unlawful discharge in violation of an identified paragraph of the collective bargaining contract, (2) the existence and extent of the grievance and arbitration procedure under the contract, and (3) the violation of the union\u2019s duty to fairly represent plaintiffs in processing their grievances through the arbitration procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">To meet this contention we must analyze the allegations in the complaint, and a fair reading thereof reveals the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Progress is engaged in the manufacture and sale of light fixtures and other electrical appliances; plaintiffs were hourly-rated employees at Progress\u2019 plant and were members in good standing of Local 1841 and/or Local 2005, both of which are affiliates of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (AFL-CIO); defendant unions represented plaintiffs in all labor-management relations with Progress under a collective bargaining agreement in force during the period in question and which was to expire \u201cin the early part of 1959\u201d; on or about October 21, 1958, defendants \u201c * * * unlawfully, wickedly, deliberately and maliciously conspired and agreed together to injure the plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, to cause them to lose their jobs at Progress * * * (and) * * * to deprive them of their contractual rights * * \u201d; in pursuance of said conspiracy, Progress, on October 24, 1958, suspended and subsequently discharged plaintiffs \u201c * * * alleging falsely that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated lacked the qualifications and ability to do their jobs well and perform their duties properly * * * \u201d; that this \u201c * * * mass discriminatory discharge of plaintiffs and others similarly situated was in violation of the labor agreement then in effect and in force * * * \u201d; that after these discharges defendant unions, pursuant to the conspiracy, \u201c * * * and contrary to their obligations to plaintiffs as bargaining union representatives, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>* * * \u201d refused and failed \u201c * * * to process grievances, obtain arbitration, or file charges with the National Labor Relations Board * * * \u201d and forestalled plaintiffs from filing their charges until such time as the six-month statute of limitations before the Board had expired, and further maliciously refused to support plaintiffs before the Board and in seeking reinstatement of plaintiffs with Progress; all of which, according to plaintiffs, deprived them \u201c * * * of the emoluments and benefits to which each * * * were entitled under and pursuant to their collective bargaining agreements * * * Obviously, the thrust of the complaint is to charge defendants with engaging in a conspiracy through which Progress discharged plaintiffs in violation of the collective bargaining contract by falsely accusing them of inability to perform their duties and the unions breached their duty of \u201cfair representation\u201d by refusing and failing to process the grievances and obtain arbitration. However, the collective bargaining contract is not appended to the complaint and there are no express allegations quoting the language of the contract allegedly breached or specifically identifying the pertinent provisions by article, paragraph or section. Such specific allegations, according to defendants, are \u201cthe <em>sine qua non </em>for the assertion of jurisdiction by the federal courts under Section 301.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">It is \u201chornbook law\u201d that the jurisdiction of a District Court must appear affirmatively on the face of the Complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Patton v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 197 F.2d 732 (3d Cir. 1952). If a party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction asserts a substantial claim under a federal statute, then this jurisdictional prerequisite is satisfied. In this regard, the opinion in Romero v. International Term. Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 359, 79 S.Ct. 468, 473, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959), is illuminating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">\u201cThe District Court dismissed petitioner\u2019s Jones Act claims for lack of jurisdiction. \u2018As frequently happens where jurisdiction depends on subject matter, the question whether jurisdiction exists has been confused with the question whether the complaint states a cause of action.\u2019 Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., 341 U.S. 246, 249, 71 S. Ct. 692, 694, 95 L.Ed. 912. Petitioner asserts a <em>substantial </em>claim that the Jones Act affords him a right of recovery for the negligence of his employer. <em>Such assertion alone is sufficient to empower the District Court to assume jurisdiction over the case and determine whether, in fact, the Act does provide the claimed rights.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">See also, Roadway Express, Inc. v. General Teamsters Local 249, 330 F.2d 859, 861 (3d Cir. 1964), wherein it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\">\u201cIn other words, Local 249\u2019s position is that the existence of a contract in an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 301 of the Act is a jurisdictional fact, the existence of which may be determined by a district court prior to trial. We cannot agree. The complaint properly averred a cause of action under \u00a7 301 of the Act. Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., 370 U.S. 238, 241, 82 S.Ct. 1318, 8 L.Ed.2d 462 (1962). Hence the District Court had jurisdiction over the claim. Whether such averments have merit or not is immaterial on the question of jurisdiction since that is determined from the face of the complaint. Hall v. Sperry Gyroscope Co., etc., 183 F.Supp. 891 (D.C. N.Y.1960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">The complaint in this ease cannot be likened to those that rely on a bare reference to a Federal Statute or which make frivolous and unsubstantial allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>tions in support of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While it would have been better pleading to specify the particular contractual terms involved and to append a copy of the contract, such exactness was not indispensable for jurisdiction to attach in light of the extent and import of the allegations made. Certainly a study of the allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint reveals that the claim here is substantial and not frivolous. Moreover, the basic purpose of the statute involved, viz., \u00a7 301(a), was not to limit, but to expand, the availability of forums for the enforcement of contracts made by labor organizations. Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U.S. 502, 508, 82 S.Ct. 519, 7 L.Ed.2d 483 (1962). The statute is not to be given a narrow reading as Congress intended to have the administration of collective bargaining contracts accomplished under a uniform body of substantive law. Smith v. Evening News Ass\u2019n., 371 U.S. 195, 199, 83 S.Ct. 267, 9 L.Ed.2d 246 (1962). To require a plaintiff to set out each and every contractual fact and contention in detail before federal jurisdiction would attach under \u00a7 301 would be unreasonable and unwarranted in light of the purpose underlying \u00a7 301 and the function of the complaint in federal pleading.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to establish jurisdiction in the District Court under \u00a7 301(a). See Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U.S. 335, 84 S. Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964). Whether the contract will support plaintiffs\u2019 contentions concerning their discharge and the failure to utilize the grievance and arbitration machinery is another matter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But it is a matter which must be pursued beyond this juncture of the proceedings. We, therefore, reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-10\">. \u201c(a) Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\u201d Labor Management Relations Act, \u00a7 301(a), 29 U.S.O. \u00a7 185(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\">. The District Court opinion noted, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-12\">\u201cPlaintiffs allege a number of instances of unfair and discriminatory treatment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-21\">by tbeir union and employer. It is merely claimed in tlie broadest terms that such discrimination violated the collective bargaining agreement. We are, therefore, faced with the question as to whether this action rightly can be considered a suit \u2018for violation of (a) contract(s) between an employer and a labor union\u2019 under Section 301. <em>To treat this as a suit under Section 301, and thus not subject to the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, xoould be a significant extension of the rxtle of Smith v.
