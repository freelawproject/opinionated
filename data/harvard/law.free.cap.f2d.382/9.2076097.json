BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">This civil rights removal case is more fallout from \u201cthe Albany, Georgia imbroglio. See Kelly v. Page, 5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 114; Rabinowitz v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 366 F.2d 34\u201d, Smith v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d [April 3, 1967]. Smith,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff, sued the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Georgia State Court for damages growing out of picketing of his store. His claim was that the defendants had conspired to boycott his store because of his service on a recent federal jury which tried a civil rights ease against the sheriff of Dougherty County, Georgia and found for the sheriff. The defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> removed the case to the Federal Court under the Civil Rights Removal provisions of \u00a7 1443 (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court remanded it to the State Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-16\">Thus it is another in a long line of removal cases beginning with Strauder v. West Virginia, 1880, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664, and State of Virginia v. Rives, 1880, 100 U.S. 313, 25 L.Ed. 667, Kentucky v. Powers, 1906, 201 U.S. 1, 26 S.Ct. 387, 50 L.Ed. 633, culminating in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncements in Rachel v. State of Georgia, 1966, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925, and City of Greenwood, Miss. v. Peacock, 1966, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944. And even more recently this Court\u2019s decision in Bass v. State of Mississippi, 5 Cir., 1967, 381 F.2d 692 [No. 24029, July 31, 1967],</p>\n<p id=\"b58-21\">The grounds asserted for removal were twofold. First, it was claimed, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>real purpose of this suit was to harass, intimidate and obstruct the defendant\u2019s exercise of their constitutionally protected right to freedom of speech and peaceful protest against racially discriminatory policies in the City of Albany. Therefore, the pendency of the action in the courts of the State of Georgia would deny them equal protection of the laws under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution and 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1983. The second had to do with racial jury exclusion- The defendants asserted that they could not enforce and were denied in the courts of Georgia the right- to be free of racial discrimination or segregation in the composition of the jury which' would try the present \u25a0 suit. Such denial arose because the jury.commissioners are required by Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 59-106 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to select the names of persons eligible for jury service in criminal and civil proceedings from the tax digests of the respective county. Under Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 92-6307,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> these tax digests are maintained and organized on the basis of race or color in that Negro and white taxpayers are listed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Time, tide, and now and then the law wait on no man. But here by waiting,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> time and outside events have worked toward an affirmance of an order of possible initial limited mortality.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">In view of <em>Peacock </em>and <em>Rachel, </em>nothing need be said \u25a0 as to the first ground which invoked the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Whatever other Federal remedies might be available to vindicate these rights <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> they do not meet the <em>Rachel </em>test of a statute providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality. Bass v. Mississippi, 5 Cir., 1967, 381 F.2d 692 [No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>24029, July 31, 1967]. Remand on this score was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">And so too has it become on the racial jury exclusion ground. We phrase it this way for the passage of time and events eliminates' the two questions whether the race-indicated tax digest (note 6 supra) and its mandatory use in making up the jury lists (note 5 supra) (1) was itself an invalid statutory structure apart from administration under it and (2) if so, was this such a statute as to satisfy the <em>Peacock-Rachel </em>standard of a prediction that the right to a trial free from racial jury exclusion would be denied or could not be enforced in the state courts. These events also make it unnecessary for us to divine whether <em>Whitus and Sims </em>(see note 7 supra) apart from maladministration under them condemns the Georgia statutes (notes 5 and 6 supra) outright because of the system and the ready opportunity for discrimination.'</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">For these statutes have been repealed and no trace of statutory racial distinctions remain. Former \u00a7 92-6307 (note 6 supra) has been so thoroughly replaced <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as to be scarcely recognizable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And the successor to \u00a7 59-106<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (note 5 supra) abandoning completely any tie into the tax digests bears the strong imprint of recent decisions on jury composition including perhaps some of our own en banc.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The result is that measuring today the propriety of an earlier remand of <em>a </em>case we must reckon with the fact that this ground for removal no longer exists. No longer is there the requisite state statute on which to base the prediction that the parties will be denied or cannot enforce in the state courts the federally recognized right to a trial free of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">With the cases back in the state court there is no statute which will deny the federal right. Likewise, there is now no statute which makes enforcement of that right in the state courts unobtainable. If impermissible discrimination occurs it will come, not from the statutory scheme, but from maladministration. Removal under \u00a7 1443(1) is not the remedy for that.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-10\">. The plaintiff is Carl Smith, owner and operator of a grocery store named Food-land Supermarket.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\">.

But in view of our disposition we need not determine whether this frustrated removal. See IA.J. Moore, Federal Practice If 0.-168, at 1171; CF. as to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1442 IA.J.
