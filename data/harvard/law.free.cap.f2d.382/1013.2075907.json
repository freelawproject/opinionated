Appellants contend that (1) the action was instituted in the wrong forum and the Tribe should have asserted its \u201crights\u201d before the Indian Claims Commission;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the State of Oregon has power to enforce its game laws equally among all of its citizens and the Treaty, of 1855 did not grant any special immunity to the Umatilla Tribe of Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Appellants argue that the statute admitting Oregon into the Union conflicted with the Treaty, the Treaty to that extent was amended, any \u201crights\u201d to hunt granted by the Treaty were \u201csubsequently diminished\u201d by the admission of Oregon, and any claim for damages or other relief by reason of the diminishing of the rights was a matter for determination by the Indian Claims Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">While the Treaty was negotiated in 1855, it was not ratified until March 8, 1859 (12 Stat. 945). Oregon was admitted into the Union on February 14, 1859 (11 Stat. 383).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Treaty has no effect until it is ratified (87 C.J.S. Treaty \u00a7 5, p. 931). The Treaty in question expressly provided that it should be \u201cobligatory on the contracting parties as soon as * * * ratified by the President and Senate of the United States.\u201d (12 Stat. 948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">We find no merit in appellants\u2019 contention that the Tribe\u2019s rights were diminished by the admission of Oregon into the Union. The Tribe did not have, nor is it asserting, any claim for compensation which should have been presented to the Indian Claims Commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sole question is whether the Treaty granted the rights, privileges and immunities found by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-16\">In Maison v. Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, 9 Cir. 1963, 314 F.2d 169, cert. den. 375 U.S. 829, 84 S.Ct. 73, 11 L.Ed.2d 60, this court construed the Treaty of 1855 with respect to fishing rights and held that to deprive the Tribe of its fishing activities, the restriction must be \u201cindispensable, as required by the treaty\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while \u201ca restriction of the fishing activities of other citizens of a state is valid, if merely reasonable, as required by the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-17\">The district court found that since the ratification of the Treaty, the national forest lands have been utilized by members of the Tribe for subsistence hunting in accordance with the Treaty, and it was not until 1960 or 1961 that Oregon officials attempted to interfere with the exercise of those rights; that the number of elk and deer taken by the Indians is a very small fraction of the total harvest; that in spite of a large harvest by sportsmen, the population of both elk and deer is in healthy condition; and that \u201cit is not necessary for the conservation of the game that Oregon\u2019s game laws and regulations be applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>hunting by members\u201d of the Tribe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found further that there are alternative methods of conservation and that the Tribe has expressed a willingness to consider \u201cany conservation data which the Oregon State Game Commission should wish to submit demonstrating a need for limiting or further restricting Indian hunting\u201d, but that the Commission has rejected this offer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The findings are amply supported by the evidence and are not questioned by appellants. Nor do appellants attempt to distinguish the Maison case. They simply contend that the decision in Maison was erroneous. We adhere to the decision in that case for the reasons therein stated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">. Article I of the Treaty of June 9, 1855, ratified on March 8, 1859, and proclaimed on April 18, 1859, 12 Stat. 945, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQW\">\u201cThat the exclusive right of taking fish in the streams running through and bordering said reservation is hereby secured to said Indians and at all other</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-28\">usual and accustomed stations in common with citizens of the United States, and of erecting suitable buildings for curing the same; the privilege of hunting, gathering roots and pasturing their stock on unclaimed lands in common with citizens, is also secured to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">. The Indian Claims Commission was created by Act of August 13, 1946, c. 959, ' 60 Stat. 1049, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 70 et seq., for determination of claims of Indian tribes against the United States accruing before the date of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">. Appellants rely heavily on Ward v. Race Horse, 1896, 163 U.S. 504, 16 S.Ct. 1076, 41 L.Ed. 244, where it was held that the admission of Wyoming into the Union \u201con equal terms with the other states\u201d was in conflict with a <em>prior </em>treaty granting hunting privileges, and the treaty to that extent was abrogated. Here, however, Oregon was admitted before the treaty was ratified. Moreover, the strict holding of Ward v. Race Horse has been modified by implication in subsequent decisions. See United States v. Winans, 1905, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1062-20\">. The district court held that it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 relating to federal questions and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act. We agree. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1062-22\">. Following Tulee v.
