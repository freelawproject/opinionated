SPENCER BELL,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> WINTER and CRAVEN, Circuit Judges, sitting en banc.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-11\"> Judge Boll sat ns a member of the Court when the case was heard but died before it was decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b375-9\">HAYNSWORTH, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">In this school case, the Negro plaintiffs attack, as a deprivation of their constitutional rights, a \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plan, under which each Negro pupil has an acknowledged, \u201cunrestricted right\u201d to attend any school in the system he wishes. They contend that compulsive assignments to achieve a greater intermixture of the races, notwithstanding their individual choices, is their due. We cannot accept that contention, though a related point affecting the assignment of teachers is not without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">\u201cFreedom of choice\u201d is a phrase of many connotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">Employed as descriptive of a system of permissive transfers out of segregated schools in which the initial assignments are both involuntary and dictated by racial criteria, it is an illusion and an oppression which is constitutionally impermissible. Long since, this court has condemned it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The burden of extracting individual pupils from discriminatory, racial assignments may not be cast upon the pupils or their parents. It is the duty of the school boards to eliminate the discrimination which inheres in such a system.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-19\">Employed as descriptive of a system in which each pupil, or his parents, must annually exercise an uninhibited choice, and the choices govern the assignments, it is a very different thing. If each pupil, each year, attends the school of his choice, the Constitution does not require that he be deprived of his choice unless its exercise is not free. This we have held,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we adhere to our holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-20\"> Whether or not the choice is free may depend upon circumstances extraneous to the formal plan of the school board. If there is a contention that economic or other pressures in the community inhibit the free exercise of the choice, there must be a judicial appraisal of it, for \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d is accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>able only if the choice is free in the practical context of its exercise. If there are extraneous pressures which deprive the choice of its freedom, the school board may be required to adopt affirmative measures to counter them.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">A panel of the Fifth Circuit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> recently had occasion to concentrate its guns upon the sort of \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plan we have not tolerated, but, significantly, the decree it prescribed for its district courts requires the kind of \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plan we have held requisite and embodies standards no more exacting than those we have imposed and sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"> The fact that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has approved the School Board\u2019s plan is not determinative. The actions of that department, as its guidelines, are entitled to respectful consideration, for, in large measure or entirely, they are a reflection of earlier judicial opinions. We reach our conclusion independently, for, while administrative interpretation may lend a persuasive gloss to a statute, the definition of constitutional standards controlling the actions of states and their subdivisions is peculiarly a judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Since the plaintiffs here concede that their annual choice is unrestricted and unencumbered, we find in its existence no denial of any constitutional right not to be subjected to racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Appropriately, the School Board\u2019s plan included provisions for desegregation of the faculties. Supplemented at the direction of the District Court, those provisions are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>These the District Court found acceptable under our decision in Wheeler v. Durham City Board of Education, 4 Cir., 363 F.2d 738, but retained jurisdiction to entertain applications for further relief. It acted upon a record which showed that white teachers had been assigned to the \u201cIndian school\u201d and one Negro teacher had been assigned to a formerly all white school.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The appellants\u2019 complaint is that the plan is insufficiently specific in the absence of an immediate requirement of substantial interracial assignment of all teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On this record, we are unable to say what impact such an order might have upon the school system or what administrative difficulties might be encountered in complying with it. Elimination of discrimination in the employment and assgnment of teachers and administrative employees can be no longer deferred,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but involuntary reassignment of teachers to achieve racial blending of faculties in each school is not a present requirement on the kind of record before us. Clearly, the District Court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction was for the purpose of swift judicial appraisal of the practical consequences of the School Board\u2019s plan and of the objective criteria by which its performance of its declared purposes could be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">An appeal having been taken, we lack the more current information which the District Court, upon application to it, could have commanded. Without such information, an order of remand, the inevitable result of this appeal, must be less explicit than the District Court\u2019s order, with the benefit of such information, might have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">While the District Court\u2019s approval of the plan with its retention of jurisdiction may have been quite acceptable when entered, we think any subsequent order, in light of the appellants\u2019 complaints should incorporate some minimal, objective time table.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Quite recently, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has required some progress in faculty integration for the school year 1967-68. By that decree, school boards are required to take affirmative steps to accomplish substantial desegregation of faculties in as many of the schools as possible for the 1967-68 school year and, wherever possible, to assign more than one member of the minority race to each desegregated faculty. As much should be required here. Indeed, since there was an earlier start in this case, the District Court, with the benefit of current information, should find it appropriate to fashion an order which is much more specific and more comprehensive. What is done on remand, however, must be done upon a supplemented record after an appraisal of the practical, administrative and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>problems, if any, remaining to be solved and overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">SOBELOFF, Circuit Judge, with whom WINTERS, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring specially.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Willingly, I join in the remand of the cases<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to the District Court, for I concur in what this court orders. I disagree, however, with the limited scope of the remand, for I think that the District Court should be directed not only to incorporate an objective timetable in the School Boards\u2019 plans for faculty desegregation, but also to set up procedures for periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the Boards\u2019 \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plans in the elimination of other features of a segregated school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">With all respect, I think that the opinion of the court is regrettably deficient in failing to spell out specific directions for the guidance of the District Court. The danger from an unspecific remand is that it may result in another round of unsatisfactory plans that will require yet another appeal and involve further loss of time. The bland discussion in the majority opinion must necessarily be pitched differently if the facts are squarely faced. As it is, the opinion omits almost entirely a factual recital. For an understanding of the stark inadequacy of the plans promulgated by the school authorities, it is necessary to explore the facts of the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\"><em>New Kent County. </em>Approximately 1,-290 children attend the public schools of New Kent County. The system operated by the School Board consists of only two schools- \u2014 -the New Kent School, attended by all of the county\u2019s white pupils, and the Watkins School, attended by all of the county\u2019s Negro pupils.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">There is no residential segregation and both races are diffused generally throughout the county. Yet eleven buses traverse the <em>entire </em>county to pick up the Negro students and carry them to the Watkins School, located in the western half of the county, and ten other buses traverse the <em>entire </em>county to pick up the white students for the New Kent School, located in the eastern half of the county. One additional bus takes the county\u2019s 18 Indian children to the \u201cIndian\u201d school, located in an adjoining county. Each of the county\u2019s two schools has 26 teachers and they offer identical programs of instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">Repeated petitions from Negro parents, requesting the adoption of a plan to eliminate racial discrimination, were totally ignored. Not until some months after the present action had been instituted on March 15, 1965, did the School Board adopt its \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">The above data relate to the 1964-1965 school year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the Board\u2019s \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plan has now been in effect for <em>two </em>years as to grades 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and one year as to all other grades, clearly this court\u2019s remand should embrace an order requiring an evaluation of the success of the plan\u2019s operation over that time span, not only as to faculty but as to pupil integration as well. While the court does not order an inquiry in the District Court as to pupil integration, it of course does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>forbid it. Since the District Judge retained the case on the docket, the matter will be open on remand to a thorough appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><em>Charles City County. </em>Approximately 1,800 children attend public schools in Charles City County. As in New Kent County, Negroes and whites live in the same neighborhoods and, similarly, segregated buses (Negro, Indian and white) traverse many of the same routes to pick up their respective charges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board operates four schools in all \u2014 Ruthville, a combined elementary and high school exclusively for Negroes; Barnetts, a Negro elementary school; Charles City, a combined elementary and high school for whites; and Samaria, a combined elementary and high school for Indian children. Thus, as plaintiffs point out, the Board well into the second decade after the 1954 <em>Brown </em>decision, still maintains \u201cwhat is in effect three distinct school systems \u2014 each organized along racial lines \u2014 with hardly enough pupils for one system!\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court found that \u201cthe Negro elementary schools serve geographical areas. The other schools serve the entire county.\u201d This contrasting treatment of the races plainly exposes the prevailing discrimination. For the 1964-65 school year, only eight Negro children were assigned to grades 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 at the all-white Charles City School \u2014 an instance of the feeblest and most inconsequential tokenism.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Again, as in New Kent County, Negro parents on several occasions fruitlessly petitioned the School Board to adopt a desegregation plan. This suit was instituted on March 15, 1965 and the Board adopted the plan presently under consideration on August 6, 1965. Not until June 1966 did the Board assign a single Negro teacher to the all-white faculty at Charles City School. Apart from this faint gesture, however, the faculties of the Negro and white schools remain totally segregated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">The majority opinion implies that this court has gone as far as the Fifth Circuit and that the \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plan which that circuit has directed its district courts to prescribe \u201cembodies standards no more exacting than those we have imposed and sanctioned.\u201d If this court is willing to go as far as the Fifth Circuit has gone, I welcome the resolve.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It may be profitable, therefore, to examine closely what the Court of Appeals of that jurisdiction has recently said and done.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We may then see how much further our court needs to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>to bring itself abreast of the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">I. <em>Pwpils</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Under the plans of both Charles City County and New Kent County, only children entering grades one <em>or </em>eight are <em>required </em>to express a choice. Freedom of choice is <em>permitted </em>children in all other grades, and \u201cany pupil in grades other than grades 1 and 8 for whom a choice of school is not obtained <em>will be assigned to the school he is now attending.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In sharp contrast, the Fifth Circuit has expressly abolished \u201cpermissive\u201d freedom of choice and ordered <em>mandatory </em>annual free choice for <em>all </em>grades, and \u201c[a]ny student who has not exercised his choice of school within a week after school opens <em>shall be assigned to the school nearest his home </em>* * <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is all that plaintiffs have been vainly seeking in New Kent County \u2014 that students be assigned to the schools nearest their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">If, in our cases, those who failed to exercise a choice were to be assigned to the schools nearest their homes, as the Fifth Circuit plan provides, instead of to the schools they previously attended, as directed in the plans before us, there would be a measure of progress in overcoming discrimination. As it is, the plans manifestly perpetuate discrimination. In view of the situation found in New Kent County, where there is no residential segregation, the elimination of the dual school system and the establishment of a \u201cunitary, non-racial system\u201d could be readily achieved with a minimum of administrative difficulty by means of geographic zoning \u2014 simply by assigning students living in the eastern half of the county to the New Kent School and those living in the western half of the county to the Watkins School. Although a geographical formula is not universally appropriate, it is evident that here the Board, by separately busing Negro children across the entire county to the \u201cNegro\u201d school, and the white children to the \u201cwhite\u201d school, is deliberately maintaining a segregated system which would vanish with non-racial geographic zoning. The conditions in this county present a classical case for this expedient.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">In Charles City County, <em>Negro </em>elementary school children are geographically zoned, while <em>white </em>elementary school children are not, despite the conceded fact that the children of both races live in all sections of the county. Surely this curious arrangement is continued to prop up and preserve the dual school system proscribed by the Constitution and interdicted by the Fifth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-15\">\u201cThe Court holds that boards and officials administering public schools in this circuit have the affirmitive duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to bring about an <em>integrated, unitary </em>school system in which there are no Negro schools and no white schools\u2014 just schools. * * * In fulfilling this duty it is not enough for school authorities to offer Negro children the opportunity to attend formerly all-white schools. The necessity of overcoming the effects of the <em>dual school system </em>in this circuit requires integration of faculties, facilities, and activities, as well as students.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">The Fifth Circuit stresses that the goal is \u201ca unitary, non-racial system\u201d and the question is whether a free choice plan will materially further the attainment of this goal. Stating that courts must continually check the sufficiency of school boards\u2019 progress toward the goal, the Fifth Circuit decree requires school authorities to report regularly to the district courts to enable them to evaluate compliance \u201cby measuring the performance.\u201d In fashioning its decree, that circuit gave great weight to the percentages referred to in the HEW Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>lines,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> declaring that they establish \u201cminimum\u201d standards</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">\u201cfor measuring the effectiveness of freedom of choice as a useful tool. * * * If the plan is ineffective, longer on promises than performance, the school officials charged with initiating and administering a unitary system have not met the constitutional requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment; <em>they should try other tools.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u201cFreedom of choice\u201d is not a sacred talisman; it is only a means to a constitutionally required end \u2014 the abolition of the system of segregation and its effects.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the means prove effective, it is acceptable, but if it fails to undo segregation, other means must be used to achieve this end. The school officials have the continuing duty to take whatever action may be necessary to create a \u201cunitary, non-raeial system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">While I would prefer it if this court were more explicit in establishing requirements for periodic reporting by the school officials, I assume that the District Court will do this, rather than place the burden upon the plaintiffs to collect the essential data to show whether the free choice plan is materially furthering the achievement of \u201ca unitary, non-racial system.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">A significant aspect of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s recent decree that, by implication, this court has adopted, deserves explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>recognition. The <em>Jefferson County </em>decree orders school officials, \u201cwithout delay,\u201d to take appropriate measures for the protection of Negro students who exercise a choice from \u201charassment, intimidation, threats, hostile words or acts, and similar behavior.\u201d Counsel for the school boards assured us in oral argument that relations between the races are good in these counties, and that no incidents would occur. Nevertheless, the <em>fear </em>of incidents may well intimidate Negroes who might otherwise elect to attend a \u201cwhite\u201d school.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To minimize this fear, school officials must demonstrate unequivocally that protection will be provided. It is the duty of the school boards actively to oversee the process, to publicize its policy in all segments of the population and to enlist the cooperation of police and other community agencies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The plaintiffs vigorously assert that the adoption of the Board\u2019s free choice plan in Charles City County, without further action toward equalization of facilities, will not cure present gross inequities characterizing the dual school system. A glaring example is the assignment of 135 commercial students to one teacher in the Negro school in contrast to the assignment of 45 commercial students per teacher in the white school and 36 in the Indian school. In the <em>Jefferson County </em>decree, the Fifth Circuit directs its attention to such matters and explicitly orders school <em>officials </em>to take \u201cprompt steps\u201d to correct such inequalities. School authorities, who hold responsibility for administration, are not allowed to sit back complacently and expect unorganized pupils or parents to effect a cure for these shockingly discriminatory conditions. The decree provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cConditions of overcrowding, as determined by pupil-teacher ratios and pupil-classroom ratios shall, to the extent feasible, be <em>distributed evenly </em>between schools formerly maintained for Negro students and those formerly maintained for white students. If for any reason it is not feasible to improve sufficiently any school formerly maintained for Negro students, * * * such school shall be <em>closed </em>as soon as possible, and students enrolled in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>school shall be reassigned on the basis of freedom of choice.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">II. <em>Faculty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Defendants unabashedly argue that they cannot be compelled to take any affirmative action in reassigning teachers, despite the fact that teachers are hired to teach in the <em>system, </em>not in a particular school. They assert categorically that \u201cthey are not required under the Constitution to desegregate the faculty.\u201d This is in the teeth of Bradley v. School Bd. of Educ. of City of Richmond, 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Having made this declaration, they say that they have nevertheless submitted a plan which does provide for faculty desegregation, but circumspectly they add that \u201cit will require time and patience.\u201d They protest that they have done all that could possibly be demanded of them by providing a plan which would permit \u201ca constructive beginning.\u201d This argument lacks appeal an eighth of a century after Brown.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Children too young for the first grade at the time of that decision are beyond high school age by now. Yet their entire school experience, like that of their elder brothers and sisters, parents and grandparents, has been one of total segregation. They have attended only a \u201cNegro\u201d school with an all Negro staff and an all Negro student body. If their studies encompassed Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, 38 A.L.R.2d 1180 they must surely have concluded sadly that \u201cthe law of the land\u201d is singularly ineffective as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The plans of both counties grandly profess that the pattern of staff assignment \u201cwill not be such that only white teachers are sought for predominantly white schools and only Negro teachers are sought for predominantly Negro schools.\u201d No specific steps are set out, however, by which the boards mean to integrate faculties. It cannot escape notice that the plans provide only for assignments of <em>\u201cnew </em>personnel in a manner that will <em>work towards </em>the desegregation of faculties.\u201d As for teachers presently employed by the systems, they will be \u201callowed\u201d (in Charles City County, the plan reads \u201callowed and encouraged\u201d) to accept transfers to schools in which the majority of the faculty members are of the opposite race. We are told that heretofore an average of only 2.6 new white teachers have been employed annually in New Kent County. Thus the plan would lead to desegregation only by slow attrition. There is no excuse for thus protracting the corrective process. School authorities may not abdicate their plain duty in this fashion. The plans filed in these cases leave it to the <em>teachers, </em>rather than the Board, to \u201cdisestablish dual, racially segregated school systems\u201d and to establish \u201ca unitary, non-racial system.\u201d This the law does not permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">As the Fifth Circuit has put it, \u201cschool authorities have an <em>affirmative duty </em>to break up the historical pattern of segregated faculties, the hallmark of the dual system.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-14\">\u201c[Ujntil school authorities recognize and carry out their affirmative duty to integrate faculties as well as facilities, there is not the slightest possibility of their ever establishing an operative non-discriminatory school system.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>In contrast to the frail and irresolute plans submitted by the appellees, the Fifth Circuit has ordered school officials within its jurisdiction not only to make <em>initial </em>assignments on a non-discriminatory basis, but also to <em>reassign </em>staff members \u201cto eliminate <em>past </em>discriminatory patterns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">For this reason, I wholeheartedly endorse the majority\u2019s remand for the inclusion of an <em>objective </em>timetable to facilitate evaluation of the progress of school authorities in desegregating their faculties. I also join the majority in calling upon the District Court to fashion a specific and comprehensive order requiring the boards to take firm steps to achieve <em>substantial </em>desegregation of the faculties. At this late date a desegregation plan containing only an indefinite pious statement of future good intentions does not merit judicial approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">I must disagree with the prevailing opinion, however, where it states that the record is insufficiently developed to order the school systems to take further steps at this stage. No legally acceptable justification appears, or is even faintly intimated, for not immediately integrating the faculties. The court underestimates the clarity and force of the facts in the present record, particularly with respect to New Kent County, where there are only two schools, with identical programs of instruction, and each with a staff of 26 teachers. The situation presented in the records before us is so patently wrong that it cries out for immediate remedial action, not an inquest to discover what is obvious and undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">It is time for this circuit to speak plainly to its district courts and tell them to require the school boards to get on with their task \u2014 no longer avoidable or deferrable \u2014 to integrate their faculties. In Kier v. County School Bd. of Augusta County, 249 F.Supp. 239, 247 (W.D.Va. 1966), Judge Michie, in ordering complete desegregation by the following years of the staffs of the schools in question, required that \u201cthe percentage of Negro teachers in each school in the system should approximate the percentage of the Negro teachers in the entire system\u201d for the previous year. See Dowell v. School Bd. of Oklahoma City, 244 F.Supp. 971, 977, 978 (W.D.Okl. 1965), aff\u2019d 375 F.2d 158 (10th Cir., Jan. 23, 1967), cert. denied, 387 U.S., 87 S.Ct. 2054, 18 L.Ed.2d 993 (U.S. May 29, 1967). While this may not be the precise formula appropriate for the present cases, it does indicate the attitude that district courts may be expected to take if this court speaks with clarity and firmness.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">III. <em>The Briggs v. Elliott Dictum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">The defendants persist in their view that it is constitutionally permissible for <em>parents </em>to make a choice and assign their children; that courts have no role to play where segregation is not actively <em>enforced. </em>They say that <em>Brown </em>only proscribes enforced segregation, and does not command action to undo existing consequences of earlier enforced segregation, repeating the facile formula of Briggs v. Elliott.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">The court\u2019s opinion recognizes that \u201cit is the duty of the school boards to eliminate the discrimination which inheres\u201d in a system of segregated schools where the \u201cinitial assignments are both involuntary and dictated by racial criteria,\u201d but seems to think the system under consideration today \u201ca very different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>thing.\u201d I fail to perceive any basis for a distinction. Certainly the two counties with which we are here concerned, like the rest of Virginia, historically had <em>de jure </em>segregation of public education, so that by the court\u2019s own definition, the boards are under a duty \u201cto eliminate the discrimination which inheres\u201d in such a system. Whether or not the schools now permit \u201cfreedom of choice,\u201d the segregated conditions initially created <em>by law </em>are still perpetuated by relying primarily on Negro pupils \u201cto extricate themselves from the segregation which has long been firmly established and resolutely maintained * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201c[T]hose who operate the schools formerly segregated by law, and not those who attend, are responsible for school desegregation.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">It is worth recalling the circumstances that gave birth to the Briggs v. Elliott dictum \u2014 it is no more than dictum. A three-judge district court over which Judge Parker presided had denied relief to South Carolina Negro pupils and when this decision came before the Supreme Court as part of the group of cases reviewed in Brown v. Bd. of Educ., the Court overruled the three-judge court and issued its mandate to admit the complaining pupils to public schools \u201con a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed.\u201d Reassembling the three-judge panel, Judge Parker undertook to put his gloss upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and coined the famous saying.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This catchy apothegm immediately became the refuge of defenders of the segregation system, and it has been quoted uncritically to eviscerate the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Having a deep respect for Judge Parker\u2019s capacity to discern the lessons of experience and his high fidelity to duty and judicial discipline, it is unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>for me to speculate how long he would have adhered to his view, or when he would have abandoned the dictum as unworkable and inherently contradictory.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In any event, the dictum cannot withstand the authority of the Supreme Court or survive its exposition of the spirit of the <em>Brown </em>holding, as elaborated in Bradley v. School Bd., 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965); Goss v. Bd. of Educ., 373 U.S. 683, 83 S.Ct. 1405, 10 L.Ed.2d 632 (1963); Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L. Ed.2d 5, 19 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Anything that some courts may have said in discussing the obligation of school officials to overcome the effects of <em>de facto </em>residential segregation, caused by private acts and not imposed by law, is certainly not applicable here. Ours is the only circuit dealing with school segregation resulting from past legal compulsion that still adheres to the <em>Briggs </em>dictum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201cThe Fourth is apparently the only circuit of the three that continues to cling to the doctrine of Briggs v. Elliott and embraces freedom of choice as a final answer to school desegregation in the absence of intimidation and harassment.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We should move out from under the incubus of the Briggs v.
