It was defendant\u2019s policy to have the store manager, Bernard A. Letsinger, Jr., pick people at random and question a person so selected as a matter of routine at the checkout counter, as if he had stolen a \u201ccommonly pilfered item\u201d; that this was on the instructions of \u201ctheir detective agents\u201d and also to deter shoplifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-22\">After plaintiff finished her shopping, she went into the checkout line and waited her turn. When an employee was ringing up plaintiff\u2019s groceries, the manager said to plaintiff \u201cDon\u2019t you want those Marlboro cigarettes?\u201d Plaintiff responded, \u201cI stopped smoking six months ago, and I am not about to start again.\u201d After she paid for the groceries the manager said that he would see her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>outside. As she cleared the door to the outside of the store, the manager stood in her way and stopped her, saying in a very forceful manner, \u201cFollow me.\u201d She did so and was taken to a back room. Although she repeatedly asked what was wrong, he said \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. You follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">She was in the back room about 20 minutes. The manager \u201ckept interrogating\u201d her about \u201cwhere the cigarettes were\u201d and \u201cthere was another girl there.\u201d Plaintiff wore slacks and a blouse, without pockets. She opened her purse and asked the manager to see if he could find any cigarettes there. As she came out of the back room with tears in her eyes, there were many people around. On that day, plaintiff neither handled cigarettes nor stole anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Testifying for defendant was Nola Andrews, its head cashier at that time and place. On cross-examination she stated that from what went on in her sight and hearing, she thought that \u201cthey thought possibly she might have taken some cigarettes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Plaintiff testified that when she was told to follow the manager, she asked \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d and he said that he would tell her later and directed her to follow him. He led her to a back room through folding doors and he then said \u201cAll right. Now, where are those Marlboro cigarettes I saw you looking at?\u201d, to which she replied \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d She opened her purse and showed it to the manager and he said \u201cWe don\u2019t search people.\u201d Thereupon the manager said: \u201cWe have detained this woman long enough\u201d and he had a stock boy push her cart out. Plaintiff was still crying and \u201cchoked up\u201d, and she got in her car and drove to her husband\u2019s place of business. She was then hysterical and in tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that he drove to the defendant\u2019s store and talked with the manager, who finally said there was no reason to pick her up \u2014 just a routine matter \u2014 and that the manager said \u201cthey choose a person at random at the checkout counter and questioned them as if they had stolen an item, commonly pilfered item\u201d, that the reason was to deter shoplifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">For the defense, Manager Letsinger testified that he saw plaintiff handling a carton of cigarettes at the cigarette stand and saw her put it in her cart. He testified that he asked plaintiff, \u201cHow about the cigarettes?\u201d and she said she did not have any cigarettes, that she had quit smoking, whereupon he said, \u201cI will see you outside.\u201d He further testified that he went to the office and told Mrs. Andrews to follow him outside, where he went, after plaintiff checked out, He asked if he could check her order and she was agreeable. He then led plaintiff and Mrs. Andrews to a side [sic] room and asked about cigarettes again.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">He further testified on cross-examination that defendant permitted the taking of people out of the line at random and asking their permission to check their baskets or purchases, if he was suspicious. On redirect examination the manager stated he was suspicious of plaintiff because he had seen her placing a carton of cigarettes in her cart, but she did not have those cigarettes when she arrived at the checkstand.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">The court made findings of fact and conclusions of law, which in substance included the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Defendant\u2019s manager falsely arrested and imprisoned plaintiff and, in the presence of Mrs. Andrews, a cashier, slandered plaintiff in that he falsely accused her of stealing cigarettes from the store; that the imprisonment and slander were without justification, and that as a proximate result thereof plaintiff suffered damage in the sum of $5,000 and became entitled to recover punitive damages in a similar amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">The court entered judgment accordingly against defendant for $10,000 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">We hold that the record sustains the district court\u2019s findings in favor of plaintiff on the charge of false imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>under count I, as well as its findings in her favor on the charge of slander under count II. We therefore affirm the judgment from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
