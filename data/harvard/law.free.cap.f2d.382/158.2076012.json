She claims on appeal (1) that an oral admission that she stabbed White was improperly admitted into evidence; (2) that it was improper for the Government in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>rebuttal to read from Appellant\u2019s subsequent written statement; and (3) that there was not sufficient evidence corroborating Appellant\u2019s statements for the case to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Appellant and White lived in a second-floor room of a rooming house. At about 5:00 a. m. on Saturday, March 20, 1965, the police responded to a report initiated by Appellant that there was an unconscious man in her room. They were met by Appellant, who told them she could not rouse White. She told the police that White had arrived home from work Friday evening bleeding from a wound in his chest which he said he had received at the hands of some \u201cjitterbugs\u201d who had jumped, robbed, and stabbed him. The police found White dead in bed with wounds in his chest and jaw. There was a small amount of blood on the undershirt and shorts he was wearing, on the sheet and blanket, and on the floor between the bed and the wall. There was no sign of disorder in the room. The police found White\u2019s jacket, which had a hole corresponding with his chest wound, and his overcoat, which had blood on it but no hole.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The police questioned Appellant about White\u2019s habits, the route he would have taken home from work, his friends, associates, and debtors and about her own activities that evening. At 6:15 a. m. Detective Cannon sent other officers to verify the place of White\u2019s employment, which Appellant had described as a hotel near a stated intersection, and to trace his route homeward.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Cannon told Appellant he intended to take her to the Homicide Squad Office at Police Headquarters to prepare a written report of what she had told them; she was also told she would be taken home when this was finished. Detective Cannon testified that while he generally considers everyone found on the scene of a homicide as a \u201csuspect in a way,\u201d he did not consider Appellant a suspect; in short her statements were considered plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">On the way to Headquarters with Appellant, the police attempted to locate White\u2019s sister and made another stop to buy a package of cigarettes which Appellant requested. They arrived at Headquarters at 6:40 a. m. and went to a private room in the rear of the Homicide Squad Office. Appellant was interviewed and her statement was typed in about two hours, 45 minutes being consumed by interruptions for Cannon to attend to other police business.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Cannon asked Appellant to read and sign the statement if she found it to be accurate. As she started to read it, she said she was \u201cin trouble.\u201d Cannon asked what she meant by that and she responded, \u201cWell, it just looks like I am in trouble.\u201d He offered her a phone to call a lawyer, assuring her that the lawyer \u201cwill tell you that you are a witness and what you are saying is what you know about the man\u2019s death.\u201d Shortly thereafter she signed. Cannon then offered to provide a ride home as soon as a driver was available. While they were waiting, they talked about a church where Appellant had been the previous evening and with which Cannon was acquainted. In the midst of this conversation, Appellant repeated her fear about being \u201cin trouble,\u201d and at 9:05 a. m., she leaned forward and said \u201cWell, I might as well tell you, I stabbed him.\u201d Cannon testified that at once he said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">stop right there. I want to tell you right now you are under arrest. You are charged with homicide. You are entitled to the services of a lawyer and a bondsman. You don\u2019t have to say anything. If you do, I am going to take it down and it can possibly be used against you. If you can\u2019t get your own lawyer, the Court will appoint one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The District Judge found that Appellant\u2019s oral statement had been voluntarily given, and his ruling is not challenged here; he also found \u201cthat she was not under compulsion at the time she went down to Headquarters, that she was acting voluntarily and that the inquiries of the police were of a general nature, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>direct at her, not focused upon her * * as a suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">(1) <em>The Oral Admission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Appellant argued that her oral admission that she had stabbed White was inadmissible on three alternative grounds: (a) that it was made during an illegal arrest; <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (b) that if the arrest were legal, it was made during an illegal detention prior to being taken before a United States Commissioner; <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or (c) that it was the product of custodial interrogation in the absence of requested counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The first two claims turn on whether Appellant was under arrest when she left her room or at any point when she was engaged with police in preparing her report of the event. That answer must be found not merely in Appellant\u2019s subjective feeling as to whether she was under arrest, but also in the nature of police intentions and actions in all the surrounding circumstances. \u201cTo constitute an arrest, there must be an actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person, performed with the intention to effect an arrest and so understood by the person detained.\u201d Jenkins v. United States, 161 F.2d 99, 101 (10th Cir. 1947); <em>accord, </em>Fisher v. United States, 324 F.2d 775 (8th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 999, 84 S.Ct. 1935, 12 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1964). The thought processes of both the police and Appellant, to the extent they can be discerned, are considerations, but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">the test must be not what the defendant * *\u25a0 * thought, but what a reasonable man, innocent of any crime, would have thought had he been in the defendant\u2019s shoes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">United States v. McKethan, 247 F.Supp. 324, 328 (D.D.C.1965) (Youngdahl, J.), aff\u2019d by order, No. 20,059 (D.C.Cir., Oct. 6, 1966). We reject the claim that a defendant\u2019s belief that he was under arrest is controlling; his subjective beliefs are a factor but they must be considered by the trier along with evidence of his conduct and all the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">We hold there was ample evidence to sustain the District Court findings and conclusion that no arrest occurred when Appellant was taken to Police headquarters to secure a written statement from her as a material witness in a homicide case. The detective who interrogated Appellant at her home might well have concluded that, apart from the need for transcribing facilities available only at the police office, the room where White lay dead was not conducive to an unemotional recall of all relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\"> Advising Appellant they wanted her to come to Headquarters, rather than \u201crequesting\u201d or \u201cinviting\u201d her, does not alter our view. See Hutcherson v. United States, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 51, 53, 351 F.2d 748, 750 (1965); Scarbeck v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 135,152, 154, 317 F.2d 546, 563-565 (1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 856, 83 S.Ct. 1897, 10 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1963). An assumption that one is required to cooperate with the police can hardly be equated with an arrest; every citizen has a duty to assist police officers up to the point of self-incrimination. The cooperative innocent person would find it oppressive indeed if courts were to hold every person interrogated must first be taken before a magistrate and subjected to the judicial processes applicable to a person criminally charged, i. e., warned that he had a right to maintain silence and to counsel as a preliminary to interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">The next inquiry is whether Appellant came under arrest at the Homicide Squad office before her oral admission. It is undisputed that at no time was Appellant restrained. Appellant\u2019s non-incriminating written statement indicates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>police were treating her as a witness; it discloses that Appellant told the police about White\u2019s habits and movements of the previous evening and then answered other questions. In only a minor degree can any of the questions put to her be thought as touching on Appellant\u2019s possible involvement; as to these questions she gave exculpatory answers which satisfied the police. After the statement was prepared and Appellant demurred about signing, Cannon explicitly assured her that he considered her only a witness. Appellant at no time made an attempt to leave; she had been promised in advance that she would be taken home by car, and her incriminating statements were made as police were about to fulfill that promise. Here there were none of the familiar concomitants of arrest, e. g., searching, booking, fingerprinting, to negate the statements of police that Appellant was simply being interrogated as an important witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Seals v. United States, 117 U.S. App.D.C. 79, 325 F.2d 1006 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 964, 84 S.Ct. 1123, 11 L. Ed.2d 982 (1964), on which Appellant relies, is readily distinguishable from this case; Seals, unlike Appellant, was an acknowledged suspect at all times and the investigation was directed at his part in a robbery;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> furthermore, he was a high school student. There is ample evidence to sustain the District Court finding and the conclusion that no arrest occurred at any time before her spontaneous oral admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Appellant\u2019s third argument for exclusion is that she requested counsel before making the incriminating statement, that this request was denied, and that <em>Escobedo </em>controls. We reject the <em>Escobedo </em>contention since no process of police investigation had focused on her, 378 U.S. at 492, 84 S.Ct. 1758; rather the circumstances that police were arranging to send her to her home demonstrates the contrary. Appellant is not aided by the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation in <em>Miranda </em>that what it meant in <em>Escobedo </em>by \u201cinvestigation which had focused on an accused\u201d was \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d i. e., \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The investigation here was not initiated by the police but came after Appellant voluntarily reported a homicide; Appellant, not police, set the inquiry in motion. Nor was there any \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d in the <em>Miranda </em>sense. Questioning of a witness cannot be characterized as \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d simply because it occurs \u00e1t a police establishment. Nor is there anything in the record to indicate that Appellant had been deprived of her freedom of action in any significant way; since she never attempted to leave the presence of the police, it cannot be said that her presence at Headquarters was against her will, especially as it is now clear that her conduct and very presence at the police station were part of her attempt to put the police on a wild goose chase in search of the mythical \u201cjitterbug\u201d attackers.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">(2) <em>Use of Appellant\u2019s second written statement in rebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">Upon changing her story and telling Detective Cannon she had stabbed White and after being promptly warned to remain silent and being advised of her right to counsel, Appellant made another written statement, in which she indicated that she had stabbed White in self-defense after he had slapped her. The existence of this statement came out at the hearing on the motion to suppress, but the Trial Judge stated that he did not want to hear evidence on the circumstances surrounding it since he understood that the Government was not going to use it. The prosecutor stated, however, that he reserved the right to use it in rebuttal, should that prove necessary. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>defense attorney evinced no interest in challenging the admissibility of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">When the Government introduced evidence of Appellant\u2019s oral admission, defense counsel complained that by not introducing the later written statement the Government was omitting exculpatory explanations. He stated to the Trial Judge that he intended to quote verbatim from two paragraphs and ask Detective Cannon whether Appellant had made those statements. The Court explained that if he did so the whole statement could come in. Defense counsel replied, \u201cWell, then, I will take my chances,\u201d and subsequently agreed to the Court\u2019s statement that permitting defense counsel to cross-examine from the statement was with the understanding that the Government could fill in the gaps if it desired. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Cannon included, among other questions, whether Appellant had stated she stabbed White only after being attacked by him. Cannon answered that she had. When the Government sought to ask him to read from other parts of the statement, defense counsel objected to the use of the statement although his cross-examination had been based on its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Having thus opened up this line of inquiry, the defense cannot be heard to complain that the Government pursued it, even assuming its inadmissibility as part of the Government\u2019s case. Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954); Johnson v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 69, 70, 344 F.2d 163, 164 (1964); Crawford v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 234, 198 F.2d 976 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">(3) <em>Corroborative Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">We find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument that there was not sufficient evidence corroborative of Appellant\u2019s statements for the case to go to the jury. Decedent\u2019s body supplied evidence of the <em>corpus delicti </em>and the bloody clothing rent by knife thrusts constituted an <em>abundance </em>of corroboration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\">.
