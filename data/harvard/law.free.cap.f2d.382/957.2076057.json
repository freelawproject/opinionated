The defenses failed and he appealed. His appeal was dismissed on his own motion for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">In post conviction remedies in the Oregon courts, this appellant relied solely on his failure to receive <em>\u201cEscobedo\u201d </em>rights. He never contended that his statement contained untruths, or was coerced. The Oregon trial court denied relief because Lugo had taken the stand in his own defense \u201cand admitted in substance the same admissions contained in his statement admitted in evidence,\u201d hereby \u201cwaiving any right to object to any admission made by him without his first having been advised of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent\u201d (414 P.2d 324), following State v. Unsworth, 240 Or. 453, 402 P.2d 507 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">The Oregon Supreme Court denied his appeal solely on the nonretroactivity of Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758,12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">What appellant now describes as \u201cthe basic factual issue\u201d is whether the taking of his confession introduced against him violated his constitutional right against self-incrimination. Appellant urges that he was coerced while intoxicated when he made it, and/or was \u201csuffering from traumatic shock\u201d; and that he was not informed of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">It is important to note that at the hearing in the district court it was <em>stipulated </em>the judge could decide the petition for habeas corpus on the pleadings, the exhibits, the transcript of Lugo\u2019s trial, the transcript of his post conviction hearing, and the briefs filed by each side in the Supreme Court of Oregon. Thus no hearing was required at which defendant was entitled to be present. The district court went thoroughly into two factual questions: defendant\u2019s intoxication and the voluntariness of his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">As to the representation Lugo was intoxicated and in shock, the district court judge found the claim \u201chad no merit\u201d (C.T. p. 14). Lugo\u2019s own statement to that effect, said the court, was \u201ccontradicted by the opinions of four other witnesses.\u201d (C.T. p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-18\">As to Lugo\u2019s right to remain silent and to have a lawyer, the Supreme Court of Oregon and the district court correctly held that <em>Escobedo </em>rights did not apply to his case, tried previously to <em>Escobedo. </em>Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-19\">Appellant\u2019s counsel now states he does not quarrel with this latter finding, but asserts that, contrary to the assertion made by him to the Oregon state court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant was coerced into confessing, without regard to any rights given by <em>Escobedo, </em>and that the issue of coercion and the voluntariness of the confession should have been determined by the Oregon trial court out of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-20\">This point the district court disposed of in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-21\">\u201cThere is no merit in this contention. The [Oregon] trial judge gave Lugo\u2019s lawyers an opportunity to present testimony about the statement\u2019s voluntariness in a hearing outside the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>ence of the jury. When the defense attorneys declined that opportunity, the judge admitted the statement.\u201d (C.T. p. 15.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Thus, the district court did <em>not, </em>as appellant\u2019s counsel urges, rule that appellant was <em>not entitled </em>to a hearing out of the presence of the jury on the issue of voluntariness, but that appellant had, through his counsel, refused to accept, and had waived that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">First, we need not and do not reach the issue raised but not passed upon by the Oregon Supreme Court', b\u00fat relied upon by the Oregon trial court, <em>i. e., </em>that appellant was \u201cnot entitled to relief because he had taken the stand in his own defense \u2018and admitted in substance the same admissions contained in his statement admitted in evidence,\u2019 thereby waiving \u2018any right to object to any admission made by him * * (414 P.2d 324.) Cf. State v. Unsworth, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Second: We find that a careful reading of the transcript establishes that there was ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s factual determination and finding that appellant was not intoxicated when he confessed, and was not coerced into the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Third: We agree with the district court judge\u2019s statement and finding that appellant\u2019s counsel waived his client\u2019s right to have testimony taken outside of the presence of the jury, before the court finally ruled on the admissibility of the confession or statement in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">The last point requires a close consideration of what took place at the time. Counsel for appellant refers to the \u201cbetter practice\u201d outlined in State v. Bouse, 199 Or. 676, 700-701, 264 P.2d 800 (1953), suggesting that the trial judge hear all the evidence on the subject before ruling on the confession\u2019s admissibility. (R.T. p. 102.) The trial judge inferentially, at least, agreed that this practice should be followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge actually invited defense counsel to make an objection and/or ask for a hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence. (R.T. p. 33.) We quote from the trial transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: I thought there was another objection to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-16\">\u201cMR. STEARNS [for appellant]: There was, your Honor, which we have discussed privately in chambers. \u201cTHE COURT: Well, I know, but unless that is brought out I have no record of it, you see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-17\">\u201cMR. STEARNS: We certainly object, your Honor, to the introduction of this statement in its present condition. There are certain corrections and deletion.\u201d (sic)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-18\">Corrections were then made to meet this objection, apparently to the satisfaction of all parties and the court. The record continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is that the objection?\u201d (meaning the deletions)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">Mr. Ramirez then made a further objection as to the time element, and \u201can implied threat\u201d in \u201cone portion of that statement.\u201d The trial court read the statement, and again asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is that the only point?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-23\">Mr. Ramirez again discussed the time element \u2014 \u201cone hour or an hour and a half that is missing.\u201d After further discussion, the confession, Exhibit T, was admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-24\">Thereafter the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-25\">\u201cTHE COURT: The Court is going to set aside its order admitting Exhibit T in evidence, and the Court is doing this so that there will be no question as to the defense of offering testimony if they so desire relative to the voluntariness of the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-26\">\u201cMR. STEARNS: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Do you have any testimony to offer relative to the admission of Exhibit T?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-4\">\u201cMR. STEARNS: Well, if your Honor please, now that puts us in something of an embarrassing situation. We hadn\u2019t anticipated this at the moment, and I don\u2019t believe we are prepared, are we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, in the statement itself it states the defendant has not taken the stand. That is in your statement. And the defendant, or any other witnesses you have now against the admission of this Exhibit T, this is the time here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-6\">\u201cMr. STEARNS: What I had requested the Court to do was withhold admitting this until after the defendant had taken the stand.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief, pp. 38-39; R.T. p. 225.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Appellant now urges that to offer a defendant \u201can opportunity to rebut out of the presence of the jury is meaningless.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant should realize that if he wanted such a hearing, it was incumbent upon him to call for such a hearing to be held outside the presence of the jury, when the statement was offered. The quoted testimony demonstrates that by failing to raise the point it was waived. Under such circumstances we cannot conclude that appellant has been deprived of any rights which would amount to a denial of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">Appellant suggests that Oregon law required a hearing out of the presence of the jury as to the voluntary character of the statement. In State v. Bouse, supra, however, it was said that conducting a hearing in the presence of the jury is not reversible error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\"> In any event, our function is not to test appellant\u2019s trial by Oregon law, but by federal constitutional standards. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (3). We do not conclude that the presence of the jury, without objection, during the inquiry by the trial judge into the voluntary nature of Lugo\u2019s statement offended due process standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">After a thorough consideration of the evidence, we are satisfied that the district court was correct in finding (a) that appellant\u2019s counsel had waived any objection to the presence of the jury by failing to object, and (b) that Lugo\u2019s statement was voluntary. On the whole case we are convinced that Lugo received a fair trial consistent with due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">The denial of the petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">. In seeking post conviction relief before the Supreme Court of Oregon, appellant stated that he \u201cdoes not contend that the statement was coerced or contained untruths.\u201d 414 P.2d 324.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">. \u201cMR. STEARNS: I think I have made my position clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes. The Court isn\u2019t going to bar you from the ordinary questions and answers. It is after the offer is made, after that offer is made that the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axl\">question arises and probably should he taken care of in the absence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-28\">\u201cMr. BEDDOE: That is the way we have always done it in the past.\u201d (R.T. pp. 102, et seq.) ,</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">. We assume appellant means \u201cineffective\u201d or \u201cuseless.\u201d But appellant\u2019s approach would be even more so. He suggests that the government complete its case and await the defendant\u2019s decision as to whether or not he will testify on his own behalf before the trial court should rule on the admissibility of the statement. Such a proposition better deserves the adjective \u201cmeaningless\u201d than the trial judge\u2019s offer. How, for example, could the trial court rule on a motion to dismiss at the end of the prosecution\u2019s case when the court cannot know of a challenge to the statement until the defense is offered?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">. In the state trial in 1960, able and experienced counsel for defendant frankly admitted, in making his objection, that there was in Oregon no hard and fast rule that \u201cno questions should be asked about</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">a confession or an admission, in the presence of the jury. (R.T. p. 103.) The lack of the jury\u2019s presence was described by him simply as \u201ca better practice.\u201d \u201cI am not saying the court is bound to do it, but [that it is] the better practice.\u201d (R. T. p. 104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-17\">In so portraying the law of Oregon as it existed on that date, counsel for appellant was accurately stating, and, indeed, paraphrasing, the law in State v. Bouse, 199 Or. 676, 264 P.2d 800 (1953), where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-19\">\u201cAlthough we have held that it is not necessarily reversible error for this preliminary investigation to be held in the presence of the jury, State v. Spanos, 66 Or. 118, 134 P. 6, yet, for obvious reasons, the better practice is that it be conducted in the absence of the jury.\u201d (264 P.2d at 811.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
