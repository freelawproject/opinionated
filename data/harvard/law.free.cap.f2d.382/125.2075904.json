In the Juvenile Court and on the intermediate appeal, he claimed that the dispositional hearing was procedurally infirm because the Juvenile Judge did not fully explore alternatives to commitment and, in several questions directed to petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, appeared to place on petitioner the burden of identifying such alternatives. We find it unnecessary to assay the disposition against these contentions in view of Creek v. Stone,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> decided subsequent to the Juvenile Court\u2019s action and its affirmance, which to us has decisive bearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-20\">In <em>Creek, </em>we carefully consider the Juvenile Court Act, noting a clear legislative purpose to establish a professionally equipped, specialized court to deal with the myriad of situations coming before it. We pointed out that the Juvenile Court is armed with broad statutory powers to the end that the community\u2019s resources may be marshaled to provide individualized care and treatment and held that \u201c[t]he Congressional objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>comprehends psychiatric care in appropriate cases.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Recognizing that full and imaginative use of these powers enables the Juvenile Court to fashion a dispositional decree tailored to meet the peculiar needs of a particular child, we deemed that court obligated to conduct an \u201cappropriate inquiry\u201d when presented with a \u201csubstantial complaint\u201d concerning commitment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In this case, we have on the one hand an explicit finding by the Juvenile Court that petitioner needs \u201cpsychological and/or psychiatric care to meet his particular needs\u201d while, on the other, a claim that petitioner is receiving no treatment whatever. We think this presents, within the meaning of <em>Creek, </em>a \u201csubstantial complaint\u201d calling for \u201cappropriate inquiry.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Petitioner, of course, was not able to advance, nor either of the courts to deal with, his contentions in the light of that opinion, but we think it clear that petitioner is entitled to whatever benefits might flow from such an evaluation. \u201cThere may always be exceptional cases or particular circumstances which will prompt a reviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise result, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court or administrative agency below.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Among these are cases \u201cin which there have been judicial interpretations of existing law after decision below and pending appeal \u2014 interpretations which if applied might have materially altered the result.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For \u201cin the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. And in determining what justice does require, the Court is bound to consider any change, either in fact or in law, which has supervened since the judgment was entered.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such a change we may accommodate by granting an appeal solely to enable a remand for further consideration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">As this case involves final disposition, as contrasted with the interim custody presented in <em>Creek, </em>we think the Juvenile Court will have need for a full development of the salient facts which an evidentiary hearing can afford. If, by reason of the time the appellate process has consumed, there has been any significant change in petitioner\u2019s condition requiring reevaluation of the initial commitment order, the Juvenile Court has power to shape its decree to reflect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>current facts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, should it develop that the need for professional care persists, the Juvenile Court will then proceed to evaluate the present confinement in light of the standards announced in <em>Creek, </em>utilizing its expertise and discretion secure in the knowledge that it is amply authorized to fulfill the rehabilitative purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Petitioner also asks us to definitively construe the \u201cbeyond control\u201d sections of the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But while the parties and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals treated this exclusively as a \u201cbeyond control\u201d ease, we are not entirely certain that the section to which petitioner refers was the sole foundation for the Juvenile Court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction. At the conclusion of the trial, the Juvenile Judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cThe Court has listened to the evidence presented in this case and is of the opinion that Jesse Elmore is within the jurisdiction of the Court for the following reasons: First [the] evidence sustains beyond any question of mine in this Court and by a preponderance thereof that Jesse Elmore has been truant in school. Secondly, the evidence sustains by a preponderance thereof that he is without adequate supervision in his home, or was during the period in question. And thirdly, the evidence sustains that he has been habitually beyond the control that was attempted to be exerted by his mother. And for these reasons the Court finds that he is within its jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-18\">It is not unreasonable to read this jurisdictional finding as embracing the judge\u2019s conclusion that petitioner was \u201chabitually truant from school,\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>and </em>\u201cwithout adequate parental support or care,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>and </em>\u201chabitually beyond the control of his parent.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We deem it inappropriate to reach construction of the \u201cbeyond control\u201d section unless and until it is certain that it was the only basis upon which the Juvenile Court was empowered to act. Petitioner will be free on the remand to seek clarification in this connection and to raise with precision any legal objections he might have. The Juvenile Court will be in position to decide in the first instance the several points now urged by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-19\">Should jurisdiction be found to rest on the three alternative statutory sections, questions of fair notice and opportunity to defend would be presented.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If, on the other hand, it is rested solely on the \u201cbeyond control\u201d provision, the Juvenile Court should consider petitioner\u2019s argument that such a conclusion is at odds with the finding that petitioner was without adequate parental supervision.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In either event, both the practical effect and the legal permissibility of the \u201cdelinquency\u201d finding can be probed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We do not, of course, in this ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>stract context, undertake to resolve or suggest answers to these potentially perplexing questions. We do say, however, that should these issues develop on remand, the Juvenile Court\u2019s delineation of its views, by memorandum opinion or otherwise, would put appellate courts, if further review is required, in position to know exactly what was decided and why.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">An appropriate order will be entered granting the petition for allowance of an appeal and remanding this case to the Juvenile Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\">.

Code \u00a7 16-2302 (Supp. V 1966), alleged only that petitioner was habitually beyond control although it was supported by a factual allegation that he had been truant from school. Prior to trial, the Juvenile Court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to change the nature of the proceeding to one for parental neglect. See In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b176-21\">.

In an earlier \u201cbeyond control\u201d proceeding, petitioner was found to be a \u201cdependent\u201d child. In this case, he was adjudged a \u201cdelinquent.\u201d These are terms not found in our statutes, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Juvenile Court has promulgated a definition of the terms. Juv.Ct.Ann.Rep. 14 (1966). The practical effect of a \u201cdependent,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cdelinquent,\u201d determination is not clear to us. Perhaps a \u201cdelinquent\u201d child is isolated from \u201cdependent\u201d children and receives different care or treatment.
