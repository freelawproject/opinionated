A jury verdict of guilty was returned on both counts. Subsequent thereto the trial court \u201cset aside [the] conviction on Count I, but affirmed [the] conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>on Count II\u201d. Appellant was sentenced to seven years\u2019 confinement on Count 2. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Reversal and a new trial are asked on three alleged errors: (1) Evidence adduced at trial failed to prove knowledge by appellant that the notes passed were counterfeit or that he aided or abetted the principals; (2) evidence obtained by an illegal search of appellant\u2019s automobile without a warrant and not incident to arrest should not have been admitted during the trial; (3) the failure of the trial judge to acquit appellant as to Count 1 before submitting the case to the jury was unfairly prejudicial. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">With reference to appellant\u2019s first contention, it is necessary to recite the government\u2019s evidence in some detail. In that regard, appellant did not testify himself and offered no testimony in his own behalf with the exception of recalling Allen Ray Livingston, a government witness, asking a few questions with reference to his appearance on June 16, 1966, the date of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The government\u2019s testimony indicated that shortly prior to June 16, 1966, Karen Staires and Allen Ray Livingston, together with the appellant, received a number of counterfeit $20 Federal Reserve Notes from an unidentified man who was not known to either Karen Staires or Allen Livingston; that the receipt of the same was in West Tulsa, Oklahoma, from which place the three began a journey to Arkansas. At the time both Karen and Allen were sixteen years of age. At no time did the appellant handle the counterfeit money but he was present at the time of its receipt and the inference is that he was the only one who knew the unidentified man and that he, the appellant, made the arrangements. Karen carried the money on her person, being told by the appellant that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t frisk a girl\u201d. The first day took them to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where the appellant registered himself, Karen and Allen under an assumed name at a motel. Appellant apparently paid the bill for the rooms. Karen testified that her purpose in coming to Fort Smith with appellant \u201cwas to pass $20 counterfeit bills\u201d. After cashing the counterfeit bills, Karen and Allen placed the real money change left over after their small purchases in a sack in the appellant\u2019s car. After entering Arkansas, appellant changed the license plates on his car. Numerous purchases were made by Karen and Allen in towns in Arkansas. Each time they kept the articles purchased but placed the good money change in a sack in the appellant\u2019s car. At an amusement center near Hot Springs, Arkansas, Karen and Allen took a sky ride while appellant waited nearby in his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Robert W. Hill, an Arkansas State Policeman, who had been alerted by radio communication with reference to the passing of counterfeit bills, observed appellant\u2019s car parked on the west edge of Hot Springs near the amusement center. It fitted the description given him by radio. Officer Hill asked the appellant, who was sitting in the car, for identification and when the appellant failed to produce papers for the automobile, appellant was placed under arrest. Officer Hill also noticed Karen and Allen walking in the vicinity and took them into custody. Appellant\u2019s car was placed in storage overnight and searched the next day under authority of a search warrant issued with probable cause, which is not in dispute here. At the time of appellant\u2019s arrest he denied being with anyone. During the cross-examination of Karen by appellant\u2019s counsel, the following testimony was given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">\u201cQ. Did I understand you to say Karen on direct examination that you and Allen were to have all the money that you obtained through the passing of those $20 bills ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">\u201cA. No, sir, the other part of the money was to go back to Mr. Lewis and he was to return it to the man that we met at the Hamburger stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">\u201cQ. Return to who ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">\u201cA. The man that we also met at the Hamburger Stand \u2014 the one that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>gave us the money in Sapulpa \u2014 gave it to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201cQ. Do you remember the name of the man that gave you the money there in Oklahoma?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">\u201cA. No, sir, I did not know him. I know nothing about him. The only one I know is Mr. Lewis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201cQ. You say he was from Sapulpa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u201cA. No, sir, I don\u2019t know where he was from. I met him in Sapulpa. That is where I was given the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\u201cQ. From this man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">\u201cQ. Did you have this money with you all of the time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">\u201cA: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-13\"> In a criminal ease, where there has been a conviction and on appeal it is claimed that the evidence was insufficient, an appellate court, in looking at the record, must take that view thereof which is most favorable to supporting the jury verdict and must accept as established all reasonable inferences that tend to support the verdict. Taylor v. State of Mississippi, 1943, 319 U.S. 583, 585-586, 63 S.Ct. 1200, 87 L.Ed. 1600; Koolish v. United States, 8 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 513, 519, 85 S.Ct. 1805, 14 L.Ed.2d 724; Smith v. United States, 8 Cir., 1964, 331 F.2d 265, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 824, 85 S.Ct. 49, 13 L.Ed.2d 34 (1964); Koop v. United States, 8 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 53. Here the evidence clearly disclosed that the appellant was present when the counterfeit bills were given by the unidentified man to Karen and the inference is that the appellant made the arrangements and, by indirection, continued to \u201cdeliver\u201d the counterfeit notes to Karen and Allen through Arkansas. Appellant advised Karen to carry the counterfeit bills \u201cbecause they wouldn\u2019t frisk a girl\u201d. The appellant owned the car and furnished the transportation for the trip, the only purpose of which seemed to have been to pass counterfeit money. Appellant apparently paid the motel bill for all three. Appellant changed the license plates on his car. He registered in the motel under an assumed name. He was in possession of the \u201creal money\u201d obtained by passing counterfeit <em>$20 </em>bills in exchange for small purchases and receiving good money in change. Clearly, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found knowledge and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">We find appellant\u2019s second contention that his conviction was based on the fruits of an illegal search of his automobile without a warrant and not incidental to his arrest to be equally unpersuasive. Hill, the arresting officer, denied making any search of the car at the scene of the arrest, either prior to or after the arrest of the appellant. According to the government\u2019s witnesses, appellant\u2019s automobile was stored in the Market Street Garage. Later a proper search warrant was obtained for it, the search was made and the merchandise found therein was received in evidence. Officer Hill\u2019s testimony to the effect that he did not search the car at the time of the arrest of the appellant was contested by Karen Staires, who testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">\u201cQ. Did you see the State Police officer drive up ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-17\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-18\">\u201cQ. When is the first time that you saw the Police Officers ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-19\">\u201cA. We were up on this ride and we seen them down below, and then we seen him when he pulled up beside us and got us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-20\">\u201cQ. Did you see him talking to Mr. Lewis over here ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-21\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, had him in the car with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-22\">\u201cQ. Did you see him while he was talking to Mr. Lewis around his car\u2014 around the Lewis ear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-23\">\u201cA. No, sir, he just walked away from it and got in the Police Car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-24\">\u201cQ. Did you see the officer do anything with the Lewis car ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-25\">\u201cA. He got my things out of it I know, because they were in my bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201cQ. He got your things ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">\u201cA. He went through all of my things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u201cQ. Where were your things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u201cA. They were still in the car, but the trunk was open and they were all out in the back end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201cQ. Did you take them [her personal effects] with you to the jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u201cA. No, he left them in that car and closed the trunk and told Mr. Lewis to drive the car and me and Allen rode with the Highway Patrolman, whatever he is up to the jail. The things stayed in the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">Officer Hill was thereupon recalled by the court and the following transpired:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">\u201cBy the Court: Mr. Hill, I called you back just to ask you one or two questions. Did you testify just a few moments ago when you were on the stand, that you did not look into the back of the car, the turtle shell or take anything out of the ear at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">\u201cWitness: No, sir, I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that Officer Hill\u2019s reply was inconsistent with his earlier testimony that he did not search the car. Obviously, Hill\u2019s reply was ambiguous. It could have meant that he did not testify earlier that he did not search or it could have meant that he did not look into the back of the ear or take anything out of the ear. In view of Officer Hill\u2019s repeated denials on both direct and cross-examination that he searched the car, and in view of the fact that the court did not pursue the matter further, which it undoubtedly would have had Hill\u2019s inflection or manner indicated that the first interpretation of his answer \u2014 that he did not so testify \u2014 was the correct one, we find no inconsistency. The trial judge, asking the question out of the hearing of the jury, apparently considered that there was no inconsistency in Officer Hill\u2019s testimony and his determination that there was none must stand. Findings on preliminary questions of fact concerning the existence of an illegal search are for the court rather than the jury, Ford v. United States, 1927, 273 U.S. 593, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793, and may not be reversed on appeal if they are fairly supported by the evidence. Roberson v. United States, 6 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 752; Miller v. United States, 8 Cir., 1966, 354 F.2d 801, 805, 808; United States v. Vita, 2 Cir., 1961, 294 F.2d 524, 528, cert. denied 369 U.S. 823, 82 S.Ct. 837, 7 L.Ed.2d 788; Channell v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 285 F.2d 217, 220. Cf., United States v. Bracer, 2 Cir., 1965, 342 F.2d 522, cert. denied 382 U.S. 954, 86 S.Ct. 427, 15 L.Ed.2d 359. The conclusion of the trial court that there was no search of the appellant\u2019s car at the time of his arres.t is amply supported in the testimony and must be sustained here.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">Appellant\u2019s third contention to the effect that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to dismiss Count 1 before submitting the case to the jury is also unconvincing and without merit. At the close of the government\u2019s case in chief appellant\u2019s counsel moved for dismissal of Count 1 and of Count 2. His motions were overruled. Appellant then moved for a \u201cverdict of acquittal\u201d in both Counts 1 and 2. Such motion was overruled. Motions as to both counts were renewed after the parties had rested. While the record indicates no particular ruling thereon, the trial court directed counsel to proceed with argument, which, in effect, was an overruling of the motions. Subsequent to the return of the guilty verdicts, appellant\u2019s counsel asked that an appeal bond be fixed and stated that he would file the appropriate motions, to which the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">\u201cThe Court: You go ahead and file your motion for New Trial and I will not sentence him until after the motion has been acted upon. <em>There is one question that you have raised that I want to give some consideration to.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-17\">\u201cMr. Page: <em>I understand.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-18\">Subsequently the court set aside the conviction on Count 1 but entered judgment of conviction on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Appellant argues that there was no evidence in the record to the effect that the appellant delivered the counterfeit notes to Karen and Allen, that the trial court should have, granted his motion for judgment of acquittal and that failure to do so prejudiced the appellant by allowing both counts to go to the jury. As proof of prejudice, appellant points to the fact that the jury found guilty verdicts as to both Counts 1 and 2 and that the court, in submitting the two counts to' the jury, may have indicated that the appellant might have committed not one crime but two. The argument is unpersuasive. Rule 29(b), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Reservation of Decision on Motion. </em>If a motion for judgment of acquittal is made at the close of all the evidence, the court may reserve decision on the motion, submit the case to the jury and decide the motion either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict.\u201d As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">While the record is not particularly satisfactory, it nevertheless is obvious that the trial court did, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 29(b), supra, reserve decision on the motion, submitted the case to the jury and then determined it after a verdict of guilty had been returned strictly in accordance with the provisions of Rule 29(b), supra. Appellant argues that there simply was no evidence to support the charge contained in Count 1 and that he was therefore severely prejudiced by the court\u2019s allowance of a Count 1 determination to go to the jury. We do not agree. There was some evidence in the record from which the jury might have inferred that the appellant knew the unidentified person who transmitted the counterfeit money to Karen, that Lewis made the arrangements and actually, but indirectly, continued to deliver the counterfeit money to Karen and Allen as the teenagers spread out from his car to make small purchases and receive good money in change which was given to appellant. This must have been on the trial court\u2019s mind when he said, after renewal of the motions, \u201cThere is one question that you have raised that I want to give some consideration to\u201d and appellant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We are satisfied from a review of this entire record that appellant was afforded a fair trial and that his conviction was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
