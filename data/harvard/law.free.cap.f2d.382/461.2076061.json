The court had then found that the appellant was financially able to make payment as thus fixed. Repeatedly thereafter the appellant defaulted in meeting the payment schedule. On March 9, 1965 the court found that Scott had \u201cfailed and refused to obey\u201d the court\u2019s order \u201calthough able so to pay\u201d and was therefore in contempt. He was ordered committed to jail for a period of 180 days \u201cor until such earlier time as he shall purge himself of his contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">A stay of execution was thereupon ordered upon condition that Scott \u201cshall not fail to make another $20.00 payment as the same comes due every Saturday, and in addition thereto, shall pay $5.00 every Saturday on the arrears.\u201d The conditional payment order on its face would appear to be entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Yet, following the March, 1965 order, Scott had paid only $130 and as of January 7, 1966 was $2,270 in arrears. It is apparent that the intermediate appellate court is quite aware that an order of imprisonment must take into account the financial ability of the contemnor to comply with the terms of a court order,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as has been well developed in Truslow v. Truslow, 212 A.2d 763, 765 (D.C.App. 1965). There the District of Columbia Court of Appeals commented upon the contemnor\u2019s failure to present to the trial court competent evidence of his inability financially to pay the total amount set by the order. The court observed that it had been open to the appellant to take prompt measures to apply for the aid of the court in having his contribution toward support of his family realistically reduced or corrected \u201cif his financial situation had changed since the date of the initial order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Moreover, in the instant case after an order of commitment had been entered on an ex parte application the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYy\">\u201cEven then appellant could have sought a suspension of the commitment by making an appropriate showing, <em>and he is still free to do so. </em>Hurst v. Hurst, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 242 F.2d 229 (1957). But we cannot consider the existence of an excuse for failure to comply with the order until such excuse is <em>first presented to and passed upon by the trial court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">We do not read the order setting aside the stay of execution as imposing a condition that Scott forthwith pay then and there the entire balance of $2,270 found to be in arrears as of March 9, 1965.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, Judge Ryan\u2019s order setting aside the stay of execution was simply recording the amount of the <em>balance </em>\u201cyet to be paid\u201d under the March, 1965 order. When Judge Waddy had found that the appellant at that time was \u201cable so to pay\u201d the amount in arrears, we deem it clear that his finding was to be related to the conditions upon which the stay of execution had been entered, namely that the appellant \u201cshall not fail\u201d to make total payments of $25 per week. Of that amount, the financial clerk would have applied $5 in reduction of the arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">This appellant clearly was in default. He had failed to comply with the conditions fixed by the trial court. The intermediate appellate court had pointed out, not once but on various occasions, the procedures to be followed by a contemnor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>who would seek suspension of a commitment. He must make an appropriate showing that he is unable to comply with the court's order, and the place for that showing is in the trial court. As Chief Judge Hood observed, \u201c[H]e is still free to do so.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfhL\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-16\">. Scott v.
