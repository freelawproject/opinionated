Mrs. Meyers pleaded guilty. Mr. Arnold was convicted after trial to the court. He appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b53-21\">Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. Briefly stated, the facts established were these.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-22\">Shortly before noon on the day in question, Mr. Baker, assistant manager of the bank, saw appellant on a public way near the rear entrance to the bank. A few minutes later appellant entered through the bank\u2019s front entrance and spoke to a teller, stating he wished to open a savings account. Given an application card, he asked if he could take it to the center counter, but was told the card must be completed in the teller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>presence. He wrote his name on the card \u201cslowly\u201d and \u201cnervously,\u201d stopping from time to time to look to his left, where Mrs. Meyers, who had entered the bank in the meantime, was confronting another .bank employee at a teller\u2019s window with a note demanding money. Appellant announced he had spoiled the first application card, requested and was given another. Subsequent examination revealed that he had not filled in either card and that he had signed both \u201cRonald Jones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The note which Mrs. Meyers presented to the window teller contained the statement \u201cany mistake youl die first bieeing watched.\u201d The teller handed Mrs. Meyers $659.00, and she left the bank. Moments later, appellant left the bank, saying that he did not have the identification which the bank required for the opening of an account.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Mrs. Meyers was arrested within a half block of the bank. Appellant joined the crowd at the scene. He was pointed out to Police Officer Crawford by Mr. Baker, the assistant bank manager. Officer Crawford asked appellant what he was doing in the bank. Appellant replied, \u201cWhat bank?\u201d The officer asked him what he was doing in town. Appellant replied, \u201cNothing.\u201d Officer Crawford then began to \u201cpat down\u201d appellant. The officer noticed a large bulge at appellant\u2019s belt line, felt something hard, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a gun.\u201d Another officer seized appellant\u2019s arms. Officer Crawford removed a fully loaded .32-calibre revolver concealed between appellant\u2019s trousers and underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Following his arrest appellant told an FBI agent he saw Mrs. Meyers in the bank but said he \u201chad never seen her before in his life.\u201d The agent said this would be easily disproved if untrue. Appellant responded \u201che would worry about that if and when that time came.\u201d Mrs. Meyers testified at trial that she recognized appellant in the bank, that Arnold knew her husband and brother-in-law, and that she had met appellant on occasion in her mother-in-law\u2019s home or in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Appellant told the FBI agent he had gone to a bank five miles from his residence to open a savings account, rather than to one of several nearby, because he would be less likely to withdraw his money. He said he intended to open the account in his own name, and if he had signed a different name \u201cit was only because he couldn\u2019t write any better than that.\u201d He stated he was carrying the concealed revolver for protection, having \u201cbeen jumped one time\u201d; and that he had purchased the gun from a friend whom he did not wish to identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\"> We think the facts proven were sufficient to permit the trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant participated in planning the robbery and that he sought by his armed presence in the bank to make it succeed. Cf. United States v. Garguilo, 310 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir. 1962)-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">Appellant contends that the gun found on his person and the testimony of Officer Crawford and the FBI agent as to his oral statements were fruits of an illegal arrest and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">Officer Crawford was on motorcycle patrol duty nearby and sped to the scene of the robbery. As he approached he saw Mrs. Meyers in the custody of Officer Rumple, and saw another motor officer, Officer Clewett, speaking to Officer Rumple. Officer Clewett drove up to officer Crawford and said there was \u201ca possible second suspect\u201d still in the bank. The two officers entered the rear entrance and walked through the bank in search of the suspect. As they emerged from the front entrance Mr. Baker approached them, identified himself as the assistant manager of the bank, said that the \u201cpossible second suspect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>was standing on the corner, and pointed to appellant. He told Officer Crawford that he had seen appellant inside the bank at the time of ,the robbery. Officer Crawford went up to appellant, asked him to remove his hands from his pockets and step from the crowd. The officer then questioned and eventually searched appellant, as already described.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Appellant argues that an arrest occurred when Officer Crawford asked appellant to take his hands from his pockets and step away from the crowd, that the arrest was invalid because made without probable cause, and that the interrogation and search which followed were therefore tainted. Alternatively, appellant argues that the arrest occurred when the officer pinioned Arnold\u2019s arms after the gun was found, and that the search was invalid because it preceded the arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> Any exercise of police restraint over a person\u2019s freedom of movement may constitute a \u201cseizure\u201d within the Fourth Amendment, sustainable only if not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Gilbert v. United States, 366 F.2d 923, 928 (9th Cir. 1966). However, brief on-the-scene detention for limited investigative inquiry, prior to a determination that the person is to be taken into custody, may satisfy the test of reasonableness. See Wilson v. Porter, 361 F.2d 412, 415 (9th Cir. 1966), and other cases cited in Gilbert; Cotton v. United States, 371 F.2d 385, 392 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The reasonableness of such on-the-scene detention is determined by all the circumstances. The seriousness of the offense, the degree of likelihood that the person detained may have witnessed or been involved in the offense, the proximity in time and space from the scene of the crime, the urgency of the occasion, the nature of the detention and its extent, the means and procedures employed by the officer, the presence of any circumstances suggesting harassment or a deliberate effort to avoid the necessity of securing a warrant \u2014 these and other factors will be relevant in balancing the need for limited on-the-scene detention and inquiry against the inconvenience and indignity to the individual detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Here the offense was serious. It had just occurred. The officer was informed by a fellow officer that a suspect was at large in the immediate vicinity. Cf. Travis v. United States, 362 F.2d 477, 481 (9th Cir. 1966). An officer of the victimized bank identified appellant as the possible offender. Cf. Duval v. United States, 383 F.2d 378 (9th Cir. July 17, 1967); Trimble v. United States, 369 F.2d 950, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1966). Appellant was a member of the crowd, unknown and free to depart at will. The officer had no choice but to accost him. Asking appellant to remove his hands from his pockets and to step away from the crowd were measures dictated by minimal prudence for the offense commonly involves the use of weapons. The action also minimized the embarrassment and indignity to which appellant might be exposed. No force was used. The questions asked were limited to inviting an exculpatory explanation of appellant\u2019s presence at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">In light of these circumstances, we think the detention was reasonable and therefore appellant\u2019s answers to Officer Crawford\u2019s questions were properly admitted in evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Appellant\u2019s answer to Officer Crawford\u2019s first question was patently-intended to deceive. It was sufficient to convert the officer's reasonable suspicion into reasonable belief that appellant had joined in the' offense. Cf. United States ex rel. McCullers v. McMann, 370 F.2d 757, 759 (2d Cir. 1967). As we view the record, the search which produced the weapon was an integral part of, and incident to, a process of arrest which was then supported by probable cause. We therefore hold that the gun was properly admitted in evidence, without reaching the question, presently pending before the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of whether a \u201cfrisk,\u201d as well as a \u201cstop,\u201d may be based upon reasonable grounds for suspicion, and thus upon less than probable cause. Cf. United States v. McMann, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The government placed Mrs. - Meyers on the stand. She testified that she planned and executed the robbery by herself. The government claimed \u201clegal surprise,\u201d and was permitted to cross-examine. On cross-examination Mrs. Meyers admitted that she told an FBI agent she had an accomplice who had helped plan the robbery the night before and was to share the money \u2014 that the plan was that she would enter the bank unarmed and her accomplice would go in with a gun to protect her. However, she also testified that her statements to the FBI agent were false, that she had no accomplice, and that appellant was not implicated in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Appellant asserts that the government was not in fact \u201csurprised\u201d by Mrs. Meyers\u2019 testimony, for the government knew long before trial that Mrs. Meyers had repudiated her initial statements to the FBI agent. He therefore contends that it was error for the government to call Mrs. Meyers solely to impeach her and for the trial judge to examine the FBI agent\u2019s report containing Mrs. Meyers\u2019 initial statements, citing Belton v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 259 F.2d 811 (1958); Fong Lum Kwai v. United States, 49 F.2d 19 (9th Cir. 1931); and United States v. Biener, 52 F.Supp. 54 (E.D.Pa. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The government admits prior knowledge that Mrs. Meyers had repudiated her statements implicating appellant, but argues that the government \u201chad a right to anticipate that, under oath, and in court, she would testify in accordance with her story to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d Weaver v. United States, 216 F.2d 23, 25 (9th Cir. 1954). But see Bushaw v. United States, 353 F.2d 477, 480-481 (9th Cir. 1965). This is at least true, the government contends, as to \u201ca witness whom it is under a legal duty or obligation to call, such as an available witness to the crime.\u201d Meeks v. United States, 179 F.2d 319, 321, 12 Alaska 545 (9th Cir. 1950), citing also Stevens v. United States, 256 F.2d 619, 622-623 (9th Cir. 1958), and cf. United States v. Freeman, 302 F.2d 347, 350 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">It should be noted that in this case it cannot be said that the government called the witness solely to inject prior extrajudicial statements into the record. Mrs. Meyers was also examined as to her associations with appellant, and her testimony that she had met appellant on a number of occasions prior to the offense was important to the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">We think it is unnecessary to examine the conflicting contentions of the parties as to whether error occurred in dealing with Mrs. Meyers\u2019 initial statements to the FBI, for we are satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that if error occurred it was harmless. The issue of appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence was tried to the court, not to a jury. The record establishes beyond any doubt that the judge was well aware that Mrs. Meyers\u2019 out-of-court statements were not to be considered as evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, and that they were not considered in determining that issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. Weaver v. United States, 216 F.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\">. We also reject tlie contention that there was insufficient evidence of conspiracy independent of the demand note to warrant admission of the note against appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\">. For Ms first contention, appellant relies upon Jackson v. United States, 118 U.S. App.D.C. 341, 336 F.2d 579 (1964) ; and Kelley v. United States, 111 U.S.App. D.C. 396, 298 F.2d 310 (1961). For Ms alternative argument appellant cites Mosco v. United States, 301 F.2d 180 (9th Cir. 1962) and Lee v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 232 F.2d 354, 355 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b55-14\">. Appellant also contends that his oral statements to Officer Crawford were ex-cludable under Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1963). Neither Escobedo, 378 U.S. at 492, 84 S.Ct. at 1766, nor Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 477 \u2014 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), applies to on-the-scene ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tioning before the process has shifted from the .investigatory to the accusatory stage. See also Cotton v. United States, 371 F.2d 385, 392 (9th Cir. 1967). And it is not contended that Arnold requested and was refused the aid of counsel, a prerequisite to Escobedo\u2019s application. Manning v. State of California, 378 F.2d 357 (9th Cir. May 15, 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b56-15\">. Sibron v.

When the prosecutor mentioned Mrs. Meyers\u2019 statements to the FBI in closing argument he was immediately admonished by the judge. The judge said that the statements in the FBI report could not be considered by the court in determining appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence, that the statements were not offered for that purpose, and that the FBI report had not in fact been admitted in evidence for any purpose. He said that Mrs. Meyers\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AQv_\">statements to the FBI should not have been adverted to, and that if a jury had been present the incident might have caused a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-21\">In summarizing the evidence which induced him to find appellant guilty, the judge again said that \u201cI have not considered for any purpose the statements made by the confessed robber\u201d set out in the FBI report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
