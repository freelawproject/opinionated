Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 2 Cir., 382 F.2d 961, also decided today, to wit: Can a ship be rendered unseaworthy solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>on account of the negligence of a longshoreman during a loading operation? A long line of cases in this Circuit starting with Grillea v. United States, 232 F.2d 919 (2 Cir. 1956), had held that operational negligence alone does not create unseaworthiness, but in <em>Candiano, </em>we recognized that the Supreme Court rejected the distinction between operational negligence and unseaworthiness in Mascuilli v. United States, 387 U.S. 237, 87 S.Ct. 1705, 18 L.Ed.2d 743 (U.S. May 22, 1967), and thus an affirmative answer must be given to the question posed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Plaintiff, Aaron Alexander, a longshoreman, sued Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem), alleging that, while working aboard the S. S. Elba owned by Bethlehem, he had suffered injuries as a result of (1) negligence by an employee of Bethlehem in the operation of the crane, and (2) the unseaworthiness of the vessel. Bethlehem in its answer denied negligence and unseaworthiness, claimed contributory negligence and that plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy was under compensation law. Bethlehem also filed a third-party complaint against plaintiff\u2019s employer, International Terminal Operating Co., Inc. (ITO), alleging breach of warranty of workmanlike stevedoring services and, hence, that ITO was liable to Bethlehem for any judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. ITO by answer, in addition to a denial, alleged that Bethlehem's conduct precluded recovery against ITO. Upon this alignment, the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">In answers to written interrogatories, the jury found (1) that Bethlehem had not been negligent, (2) that the vessel had been unseaworthy which unseaworthiness contributed in whole or in part to plaintiff\u2019s injuries, (3) that plaintiff had not been contributorily negligent, (4) that Bethlehem was therefore liable in the amount of $26,500 for plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but (5) that Bethlehem was entitled to recover over against ITO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Only a sketchy outline of the facts is necessary as a background for the legal issues. On the early morning of August 16, 1964, two gangs of ITO longshoremen were unloading steel beams into the No. 3 hold of the Elba. Dunnage was placed between each layer of beams. Plaintiff was engaged in the operation. In order to enable a lift of steel to be placed in a narrow gap or hole, removal of any overhanging dunnage was required. Plaintiff and a coworker undertook to move dunnage so that it would not protrude. The steel was lowered but the crane operator allowed the lift to fall during the last three or four feet. The beams struck pieces of protruding dunnage, causing them to fly through the air, striking and injuring plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s claims of negligence were premised upon the alleged incompetence of, and faulty operation of the lowering mechanism by, the crane operator. His claims of unseaworthiness were based upon unsafe stowage, namely, improper placing of dunnage and incompetence of the crane operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\"> The principal issue on appeal concerns the jury\u2019s finding that the vessel was unseaworthy. Bethlehem urges that in light of this Circuit\u2019s operational negligence cases, there was insufficient evidence on which to base a finding of unseaworthiness, whereas ITO argues that, at any rate, the charge to the jury on the issue was inadequate. The trial judge properly charged that, to support a finding of unseaworthiness, \u201cIt is sufficient if a given condition temporarily renders the vessel, its equipment and appurtenances, unseaworthy,\u201d but did not give further instructions distinguishing between operational negligence and unseaworthiness as required by our holding in <em>Grillea. </em>Although neither counsel for Bethlehem nor ITO requested a charge in the specific language suggested by <em>Grillea, </em>requests were made and denied by the court to the effect that Bethlehem would not be liable if the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>were caused solely by the manner in which plaintiff and his co-workers were carrying out their work or by the misplacing of the dunnage by the longshoremen in the course of their loading operations. We believe these requests were sufficient to apprise the trial court of the nature of the alleged errors in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">In the light of <em>Mascuilli, </em>the trial court\u2019s charge on unseaworthiness now appears to have been substantially correct. A charge distinguishing between operational negligence and unseaworthiness would appear to have been error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">ITO\u2019s further claim that the jury verdict was excessive is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1013-7\">LUMBARD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AWf\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">I concur in affirming the judgment, but I do so on the ground that appellants\u2019 attorneys failed to make a sufficient objection to the court\u2019s charge on unseaworthiness. They requested an instruction, and objected to the court\u2019s refusal to charge, \u201cthat negligence alone would not render the vessel unseaworthy.\u201d This requested instruction, however, was an incorrect statement of the standard of Grillea v. United States, 232 F.2d 919, 922 (2 Cir. 1956), since under that standard a negligently created condition of sufficient duration can constitute unseaworthiness. When appellants\u2019 attorneys objected to the court\u2019s refusal to give this instruction, moreover, the court told them to attempt to work out an instruction in suitable language. This was not done. Under these circumstances, I do not believe that appellants have satisfied the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 that a party objecting to an instruction state \u201cdistinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d The charge as a whole was not such fundamental error that we should consider this asserted error absent a sufficient objection. Cf. Pettus v. Grace Line, Inc., 305 F.2d 151 (2 Cir. 1962).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
