The district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to Carolina Freight\u2019s liability and ordered a new trial to determine damages. Also, the district court conditionally granted plaintiffs\u2019 alternative motion for new trial in the event that its ruling on the judgment notwithstanding the verdict were overruled on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">Defendant Carolina Freight appealed. Plaintiffs now move in this court to dismiss the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order. We agree with plaintiffs that this appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">Generally, an order of the district court determining the issue of liability, but leaving damages to be determined, is not a final, appealable order. <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 744, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1206, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976). <em>See </em>9 J. Moore, B. Ward, and J. Lucas, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 110.07, at 108 n. 6 (2d ed. 1988) (\u201cWhere a summary judgment completely terminates the action it is, of course, a final judgment. An order, however, granting summary judgment but ordering that the case proceed to trial for determination of the amount of damages is not final\u201d). In this case, the judgment of the district court granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict determined only the liability of Carolina Freight, and left for future determination the amount of damages. Thus, that order was not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">Carolina Freight argues that a different result is required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(c), which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-10\">If the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, provided in subdivision (b) of this rule, is granted, the court shall also rule on the motion for a new trial, if any, by determining whether it should be granted if the judgment is thereafter vacated or reversed, and shall specify the grounds for granting or denying the motion for the new trial. If the motion for a new trial is thus conditionally granted, <em>the order thereon does not affect the finality of the judgment, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1365-11\">Carolina Freight argues that under Rule 50(c) both the judgment notwithstanding the verdict and the conditional grant of a new trial are final, appealable orders. We reject Carolina Freight\u2019s reading of Rule 50(c). As the emphasized language above quoted indicates, Rule 50(c) states that the conditional grant of a new trial will not \u201caffect the finality of the judgment.\u201d Thus, if the judgment notwithstanding the verdict is itself a final, appealable order, the conditional grant of a new trial will not \u201caffect the finality of the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, if the judgment notwithstanding the verdict is not a final, appealable order, as in this case, we hold that Rule 50(c) cannot be read to make it appealable anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-12\">The grant of a new trial in a civil case is ordinarily appealable only after the verdict in the new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>phasized language of Rule 50(c) is to create an exception to this general rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The purpose is not to convert into an appealable order an otherwise non-appealable judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">Accordingly, the instant appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">.
