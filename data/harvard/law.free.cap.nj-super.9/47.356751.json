The appellant was charged with serving alcoholic beverages to a minor, and after hearing was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\"> The appellant argues that the respondent has not met the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant is guilty\" of the charge preferred against it. While we may review the facts and make independent findings thereon, when the interests of justice so require <em>(Rule </em>3 :81-13), we find no occasion here for the exercise of this power. There was substantial evidence to support the finding below, and it will not be disturbed. <em>Passarella v. Board of Commissioners, </em>1 <em>N. J. Super. </em>313 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The contention that the suspension of the license for ten days is so harsh, oppressive and nnjnst as to constitute an abuse of discretion, is without merit. <em>Grant Lunch Corp. v.
