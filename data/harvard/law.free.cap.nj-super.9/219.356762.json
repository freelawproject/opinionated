Fiducia, </em>135 <em>N. J. Eq. 7 (Ch. </em>1944); affirmed, 136 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>117 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945); <em>Liberty Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Plews, </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>196, 212 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); certif. granted, 4 <em>N. J. </em>459 (1950). Our only concern is whether there is any merit to the appellant\u2019s contention that the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>should not have been determined on summary application but should have awaited trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">After the complaint and answer were filed the plaintiff received formal admissions pursuant to requests made under <em>Rule </em>3 :36. Pretrial conference was held and a pretrial order was filed on November 2, 1949, which stated, in part, that the parties agreed that the matter \u201cmay be submitted to the Court\u201d upon the admissions and that certain documents referred to therein may be marked exhibits P-1 to P-26, inclusive, and \u201care true and genuine.\u201d Thereafter the plaintiff served and filed notice of motion pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3 :56 for summary judgment. Although the notice of motion was not accompanied by supporting affidavit it expressly stated that it was based on the pleadings, exhibits and admissions. See <em>Fletcher v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., </em>133 <em>F. </em>2d 395 <em>(D. C. Cir. </em>1942). The defendants filed no affidavits or any other proof whatever in opposition to the motion nor is there anything in the record which suggests that they then voiced objection to determination of the motion on the documents before the court. Those documents showed palpably that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and, in the absence of any showing by the defendants that they had a ground of defense, the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment. <em>Cf. Pen-Ken Gas &amp; Oil Corp. v. Warfield Natural Gas Co., </em>137 <em>F. </em>2d 871 <em>(6th Cir. </em>1943); cert. denied, 320 <em>U. S. </em>800, 88 <em>L. Ed. </em>483 (1944); rehearing denied, 321 U. <em>S. </em>803, 88 <em>L. Ed. </em>1089 (1944), where the court, in discussing the federal rule relating to summary judgments, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cThe rule should not be used by the court for the trial of disputed questions of fact upon affidavits, but when it is invoked by either party to a case and a showing is made by the movant, the burden rests on the opposite party to show that he has a plausible ground for the maintenance of the cause of action alleged in his complaint, or if a defendant, that he has a ground of defense fairly arguable and of a substantial character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
