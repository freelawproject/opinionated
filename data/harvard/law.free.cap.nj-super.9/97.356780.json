A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ApI\">Appellants were arrested and tried before a magistrate on identical complaints charging that on November 2, 1949, each unlawfully procured a resident hunting license contrary to <em>B. 8. </em>23 :3-21 which provides that \u201cA person not entitled hereunder to a residents\u2019 license who procures the same shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and pay a fine of not less than one hundred dollars and costs of prosecution, and whether or not he has been criminally prosecuted for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>violation, shall be liable to a penalty o\u00ed one hundred dollars.\u201d Before the magistrate, the trials resulted in judgments of dismissal. The State of New Jersey took appeals to the County Court wjiere the matters were tried <em>da novo, </em>the appellants were found guilty and each sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>R. S. </em>23:3-1- provides for residents\u2019 and nonresidents\u2019 licenses and sets the qualifications for the former that one be a citizen of the United States above fourteen years of age, who is an \u201cactual and <em>bona fide\u201d </em>resident of the State at the time of application for the license and who has been an actual and <em>bona fide </em>resident of the State for at least one year immediately prior thereto. The vital question is whether the appellants were \u201cactual and <em>bona fide </em>residents\u201d of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The State proved that Joseph John Perretti, Sr., and Arthur Perretti were registered voters in New York State and gave their address as 1720 West Third Street, Brooklyn; that all three held chauffeurs\u2019 licenses issued in New York and upon which the same address appeared. In addition there was the testimony of Warden Williams that in his opinion the house occupied by the Perrettis was \u201ca summer bungalow uninhabitable in winter.\u201d This conclusion was arrived at after an inspection of the living-room while the witness was standing in the doorway and without any knowledge beyond what lie saw from the single observation. On behalf of the defendants there was undisputed testimony that the property had been owned by Katherine Perretti for three or four years, that it contained all their furniture, that it consisted of a sun-porch, living-room, kitchen, bath and two bedrooms, and that it had a hot-air furnace in the cellar. A nearby neighbor testified that she first met the Perrettis in July, 1948, and saw them living in the house each month thereafter until November, 1949, when they went to Brooklyn because of the illness of Urs. Perretti\u2019s mother. The three defendants were employed as drivers for New York trucking firms and there is testimony that it was necessary for each to have a New York license to drive a New York truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The State\u2019s argument on the question of residence is that \u201cif they were residents of Brooklyn, New York, in November, 1949, they could not be <em>bona fide </em>legal residents of New Jersey at the same time.\u201d In passing, we note, that the word \u201clegal\u201d is not found in <em>R. S. </em>23 :3-4. On the license as issued there is a note reading: \u201cMere ownership of property in this State does not entitle a person to a resident\u2019s license. Applicant must be a citizen and actual <em>bona fide </em>legal resident for one jear immediately prior to this application.\u201d The fact of residence in Brooklyn is not necessarily incompatible with residence in New Jersey. To so argue arises from confusing domicile and residence. One may have several residences but only a single domicile. 17 <em>Am. Jur., Domicil, </em>\u00a7 9; <em>State v. Atti, </em>127 <em>N. J. L. </em>39 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941); <em>State v. Garford Trucking, Inc., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>346 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"> It is settled that a statute imposing a penalty must be strictly construed. <em>Smith v. City of Asbury Park, </em>3 <em>N. J. Super. </em>161 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949). Here the Legislature used the phrase \u201cactual and <em>bona fide </em>residents.\u201d We may not construe that phrase to mean domicile where it appears in a penal statute. Such change must be by legislation, not judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We are of the opinion that this case is one which requires us under <em>Rule </em>3:81-13 to make independent findings of fact. The sole unexplained evidence is voting registration out of the State. On the other hand, there is a plenitude of evidence to establish an actual and <em>bona fide </em>residence in New Jersey and we so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u2022 Our disposition on this ground makes unnecessary a discussion of the other grounds argued by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The judgments are reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
