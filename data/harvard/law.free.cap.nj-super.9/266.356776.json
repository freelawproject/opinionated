J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aid\">The plaintiff\u2019s action sought recovery from Boosevelt Hicks, individually, and Boosevelt Hicks and John Hicks, partners, trading as Hick\u2019s Auto Body Shop. At the close of his case a motion to dismiss the action against the partners was granted, and the cause proceeded and a verdict was rendered against Boosevelt Hicks, individually. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of dismissal in favor of Boosevelt Hicks and John Hicks, partners, trading as Hick\u2019s Auto Body Shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">'During the evening of October 23, 1945, the defendant Boosevelt Hicks, while driving an automobile registered in his wife\u2019s name, struck the decedent Theresa Kelley, wife of the plaintiff James E. Kelley. The plaintiff testified that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the scene of the accident and while he was down by his wife\u2019s body Roosevelt Hicks came over to him and said, \u201cI am awfully sorry that I hit your wife. I was in a hurry down the pike to get hold of a stalled car.\u201d He further testified that Roosevelt Hicks was dressed in a mechanic\u2019s coverall which bore the name \u201cHick\u2019s Auto Body.\u201d Chief of Police Norton testified that Roosevelt Hicks was dressed in a suit worn by mechanics and said he was going after an automobile that had been stalled on the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Following a motion to dismiss, the lower court permitted the plaintiff to reopen his case for the purpose of calling Roosevelt Hicks as a witness. In response to questions addressed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Roosevelt Hicks testified that he and his brother John Hicks were partners trading as Hick\u2019s Auto Body Shop, part of their business was to go out after stalled or wrecked cars, and although they customarily worked from 8:00 A. m. to 5:00 p. m. they also worked at late hours. He stated that he was uncertain whether any vehicles were registered in the partnership name at the time and it might reasonably be inferred from his testimony that the partnership did not then own any vehicles and he used the car registered in his wife\u2019s name for partnership purposes. He denied that he was \u201cdriving on business\u201d at the time of the accident or that he was out to pick up a stalled car but stated that he believed that he had told the chief of police where he was going. The sole issue before us is whether the testimony was sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case and call upon the defense to proceed with proof that Roosevelt Hicks was not engaged in partnership business at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">It seems clear from the decisions of our courts that where a vehicle driven by an emplojree or partner bears the partnership business name, proof of that fact would ordinarily give rise to an inference that he was then engaged in the partnership business sufficient to withstand a motion for dismissal. See <em>Dennery v. Great Atlantic Pacific Tea Co., </em>82 <em>N. J. L. </em>517, 519 <em>(E. A. </em>1911); <em>Callaban v. National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Lead Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>150, 153 (1950). And courts in other states have applied a similar underlying principle with like result when dealing with an employee wearing a uniform bearing the employer\u2019s name and regularly used in his employ. See <em>Tieman v. Red Top Cab Co., </em>117 <em>Cal. App. </em>40, 3 <em>P. </em>2d 381 (1931); <em>Deep Rock Oil Corporation v. Fox, </em>178 <em>Okl. </em>516, 63 <em>P. </em>2d 24 (1936); <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, </em>297 <em>S. W. </em>267 <em>(Tex. Civ. App. </em>1927); <em>Phillips v. Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>194 <em>Mo. App. </em>458, 184 <em>S. </em>W. 958 (1916). <em>Cf. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kirby, </em>37 <em>F. </em>2d 480 <em>(3rd Cir. </em>1930); <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hale, </em>277 <em>F. </em>422 <em>(5th Cir. </em>1921); <em>certiorari </em>denied, 258 <em>U. S. </em>621, 66 <em>L. Ed. </em>795 (1922). In some of the cited cases the uniform was buttressed by a statement as to where he was going made by him at the time of the accident and admitted as part of the <em>res gestee. </em>See <em>Deep Rock Oil Corporation v. Fox, supra; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, supra. Cf. Mattan v. Hoover, </em>350 <em>Mo. </em>506, 166 <em>S. W. </em>2d 557 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The respondents contend that, in the instant matter, the statement made by Roosevelt Hicks to the plaintiff at the time of the accident should not be given any affirmative testimonial value to establish where he was going. We infer from the record before us that the statement was made before there had been time to contrive and misrepresent <em>(Stayback Van Order Co. v. Eiben, </em>115 N. <em>J. L. </em>17, <em>22 (Sup. Ct. </em>1935)), and may be considered as \u201can undesigned incident of a litigated act, made spontaneously and without reflection.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>494, 496 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939) . The attendant circumstances appear to support its trustworthiness and we have concluded that it may properly have affirmative testimonial value within the holdings in <em>Stayback Van Order Co. v. Eiben, supra; Sharp v. Sears, Roebuck </em>&amp; <em>Co., supra; Demeter v. Rosenberg, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>55, 57 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934); <em>Murphy v. Brown &amp; Co., </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>412, 416 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918). <em>Cf. Wigmore, Evidence (3rd ed. </em>1940) . \u00a7 1750.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>We believe that at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s ease the evidence together with the legitimate inferences which the jury was entitled to draw therefrom in plaintiff\u2019s favor <em>(Dobrow v. </em>Hertz, 125 <em>N. J. L. </em>347 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1940)), was legally sufficient to support a finding that at the time of the accident Roosevelt Hicks was driving the automobile to a stalled car in connection with the operation of the partnership business. Upon that view it was incumbent upon the lower court to deny the motion to dismiss and call upon the defense for proof in support of the contention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The judgment of dismissal in favor of Roosevelt Hicks and John Hicks, partners, trading as Hick\u2019s Auto Body Shop is reversed and a new trial is ordered, costs to abide the event thereof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
