The suit arose out of an assault and battery committed upon plaintiff by a gateman employed by the defendant. There was no evidence that the employer participated in the wrongful act of the servant, either expressly or impliedly, by conduct authorizing Or approving it, either before or after it was committed. Therefore, the defendant could not be held in punitive damages. <em>Wendelken v. N. Y., S. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>88 <em>N. J.
