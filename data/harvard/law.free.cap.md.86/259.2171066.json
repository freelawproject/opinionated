J., Bryan Fowler, Page and Boyd, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-10\"><em>Francis K. Carey </em>(with whom were <em>John N. Steele, John E. Semmes, Nicholas P. Bond, S. Tagart Steele </em>and <em>William H. Buckler </em>on the brief), for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-11\">This suit is based upon alleged injuries to the permanent fee value of the lot owned during his lifetime by Mr. Garrett, and it being a well-established principle of law that executors or administrators cannot recover for any injuries done after the death of the testator or intestate, and it being conceded that the lot in question has been from the time of the building of the road and is still vacant, the proper party to maintain the suit after the death of the fee-simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>owner was the devisee of the land, Mrs. Garrett. If any injury is done to the lot in question, it is done to the present owner of the lot and not to the executors, who represent only the personal estate of the testator. It is plain that it might well be the case that the heir or devisee ot land would be unwilling to take the position before a jury that the property was damaged, and unless the heir or devisee was held to be the proper party to maintain and continue such a suit, the extraordinary spectacle would be presented of the executors or administrators of an estate pressing such a suit to trial, and injuring the market value of the property for the purposes of sale, by bringing witnesses to swear that it was damaged, against the will of the real owner. Article 75, sections 24-33, Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">The first exception arises out of the objection of the appellant, overruled by the Court, to a speculative question, put by the appellees\u2019 counsel to the witness Gorter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">The appellant contends that the Court erred in overruling its objection to this question. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>New York Elevated Railway, </em>128 N. Y. 455<em>; Doyle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Railway, </em>128 N. Y. 488; <em>Suydam v. New York Elevated Railway, </em>19 N. Y. Suppl. 50. In the case of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Metroplitan Elevated Railway (supra), </em>the question objected to and held to be inadmissible was : \u201c What, in your judgment, would the property be worth without the elevated railway\u201d (page 494), and the questions held to be inadmissible in the other cases were of a similar character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">The second exceptio, mises out o\u00ed the claim of the appellant that the Court erred in rejecting the certified copies ot the deeds offered by the defendant for the purpose of showing the prices at which the lot and improvements at the northeast corner of North and Eager steeets, immediately opposite the lot in question, had sold for, after the building of the defendant\u2019s railway. A certified copy of an instrument required to be recorded is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the circumstances necessary to give it validity, and receipts and acknowledgments in deeds of the amount of the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>money paid are <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the amounts of purchase money recited as having been received by the grantor, were in fact paid by the grantee, although parol evidence may be admitted to explain or contradict such recital of consideration. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>6 Md. 525; Cranford <em>v. State, </em>6 H. &amp; J. 231; <em>McCauley v. State, </em>21 Md. 556; <em>Bladen v. Wells, </em>30 Md. 577; <em>Morgan v. Bitzenberger, </em>3 Gill, 350.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">The third exception is based upon the refusal of the Court to permit testimony to be introduced by the appellant showing the effect of the building and maintenance of the southern inclined approach upon the property opposite to it. The appellant understands that it is conceded that testimony is admissible relating to the effect of the structure upon land similarly situated, and that the only objection to this testimony was that stated by the Court, viz., that the property opposite the southern inclined approach was too remote from the lot in question to furnish a proper subject of comparison. The appellant claims that the fact that the southern inclined approach is an exact duplicate of the northern inclined approach would give a peculiar appropriateness and relevancy to the testimony offered by the appellant in regard to the property opposite to it. The varied character of the improvements opposite the southern -inclined approach, viz., a church, a school, stables, shops .and other business property, makes it impossible for the appellees to fairly contend that the character of the uses made of the property in the. southern square render it an unfair guide for the jury. In the square opposite the Garrett lot are a saloon, a tile factory, a lumber yard and small dwelling-house property, and yet testimony in regard to property in this square was offered on both sides without objection. The test always is whether the property is \u201csimilarly located,\u2019-\u2019 and the distance of the property offered for comparison is entirely a relative matter to be determined by the circumstances of each case. Thus, in <em>Cemetery Association v. Railroad Company, </em>121 Illinois, pp. 199, 212, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Court held that the \u201cevidence in regard to prairie land one mile distant,\u201d was competent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">But apart from these four grounds of appeal the appelpellant claim that the learned Judge of the Superior Court erred in his instructions to the jury as to the measure of damages. The appellant believes that this Court will conclude from the evidence in the cause on both sides that the <em>actual result </em>of the construction and use of the appellant\u2019s elevated structure has been to increase the market value of the lot in question by nearly 50 per cent. Although the Court gave practically the same instructions in the first trial of the case, the jury refused to give more than the nominal verdict of five hundred dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-6\">It will be plain to the Court that the practical, as well as the legal effect of the granted three prayers, was to instruct the jury not only that there was no benefit to the property by reason of the use made of the elevated structure, which they could take into legal consideration, but actually to require them to separate damages and benefits, and to base their verdict solely upon such <em>damages </em>(considered separately from <em>benefits) </em>as would be done to abutting property by the maintenance of such a structure,'which is either not used for railway purposes at all or could be used for some injurious purpose, such as for the operation of a steam railway. The appellant claims that such an attempt at division of damages and benefits, which wholly forbids the jury to consider benefits, is not only opposed to reason, but has no sanction whatever in any adjudicated case, at least, where damages are claimed for alleged <em>consequential injuries.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">The attempt made by the appellees and approved by the Court below, to prevent the jury from considering the actual result of the building and use of the structure complained of upon the market value of the lot in question, is founded upon a metaphysical paradox. The actual result of the appellant\u2019s act has been to increase to a most extraordinary extent the market value of the lot in question ; that is to say, by reason of the appellant\u2019s act the market value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of the lot in question has been increased in value about fifty per cent. Now, by what fair process of reasoning can it be possible for a benefit to be legally construed into a subject of damage? The appellant has either diminished the market value of the lot or it has not. If it has not, surely upon no principle of law can damages be charged against the appellant. This exact question has been several times before the New York Court of Appeals under precisely similar circumstances, and the position taken by the appellant in this case has been vigorously sustained. <em>Bohm </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated Railway </em>Company, 129 N. Y. 593\u2014594; <em>Becker </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated Railway </em>Company, 131 N. Y. 511\u2014512; <em>Sutro v. Manhattan Elevated Railway Com</em>pany, 137 N. Y. 593.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">The Court of Appeals of New York has held that an interference with the use of the street easements of access, light and air by an elevated railway constitutes a \u201ctaking\u201d of the property of the abutting lot owner; that the value of these easements has been held to be nominal, and that the lot owner has been permitted to recover from the elevated railway damages which are represented by any diminution caused to the market value of his lot, which the Court of Appeals of New York calls \u201cthe rest\u201d of his property. In Maryland, this Court has proceeded directly to the real issue, and has reached the same result as the New York Court of Appeals, by permitting the abutting lot owner to recover as <em>consequential damages </em>the amount represented by any diminution which an underground or elevated railway may cause to the market value of his lot. <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>Baltimore Belt Railway, </em>74 Md. 375; <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Lake Roland Elevated Railway, </em>79 Md. 277.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">The appellant claims that there is a clear distinction to be made between the case at bar, where no property is \u201c taken,\u201d and where the sole inquiry is and must be as to the actual <em>consequential </em>effect of the appellant\u2019s act upon the market value of the lot in question, and cases which relate to the allowance of damages, in condemnation proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>where land is actually \u201c taken.\u201d But, even if this Court should be disposed to treat the case at bar from the standpoint of a condemnation case, the appellant claims that this Court has already fully sustained the position contended for by the appellant in relation to such proceedings. <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>B. &amp; P. R. R. Co., </em>34 Md. 343.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-5\"><em>Arthur W. Machen </em>and <em>Arthur George Brown, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">The rule now well established in most jurisdictions in this country, in cases where the construction of a railroad involves damages to property of an individual, which is particularly affected in an injurious manner by the work, and for which injury the law provides a means of obtaining compensation, is that, while a set-off may be made against the damage done to the property for any <em>special </em>benefits which may be conferred upon it by the work, no deduction is to be made for <em>general </em>benefits resulting either to the public at large or to owners generally of lands abutting on or adjacent to the road. Obvious justice is the basis of the rule. The damage done is special. It affects the owner of that piece of property and no one else. It is necessarily an injury peculiar to that property. A special and peculiar benefit to the same property, is something which the owner receives the advantage of, and it may be proper that he should be charged with it. On the other hand, a general benefit caused to others, as well as himself, is something which they are not required to pay for, nor is it right that he should have the burden of paying for it for their advantage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">In the case of the construction of a railway on a public highway, the general benefit which may result from it, including in this the benefit to the owners of lots bordering on the highway or in proximity to it, is the justification for the grant of the railway franchise. If the facilities of travel afforded by the railway directly increase the value of all the land upon the street, or increase it indirectly by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>stimulus which is given to the erection of houses in the vicinity, and a consequent general increase of values, these are beneficial consequences which the railway corporation can claim no recompense for giving. Its recompense is in the fares it receives from its passengers, or other profits of the use of its franchise. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>North Hudson R. R. Co., </em>51 N. J.

R. Co., </em>34 Md. 343; <em>Friedenwald </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto., </em>74 Md. 116, 126.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b294-6\">Bryan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The present is one of the many actions which have been brought to recover damages caused by the construction of the elevated railway structure belonging to the appellant. Robert Garrett brought the action in his lifetime; and after his death his executors became parties plaintiff. The j udgment having been rendered in favor of the plaintiffs, an appeal was taken by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Garrett was the owner of a lot of ground fronting on the west side of North street. The elevated structure of the defendant was in front of a portion of this lot, and was alleged to injure the property and diminish its value. A particular description of the lot and the structure is not considered necessary, as they are fully described in the opinions deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ered in the equity suit brought by Garrett against the defendant, and reported in 79 Maryland. At the trial a demurrer was filed to the declaration as it was amended after the executors were made parties. It was contended that the executors had no right of action for injuries done to the real estate in the lifetime of the testator. We think that if this question were ever debatable, it must be considered as settled in this State. <em>Kennerly's case, </em>1st Maryland, 107; <em>Same case, </em>2 Maryland, 245; <em>Barton Coal Company's case, </em>39 Maryland, 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Testimony was offered by the plaintiffs tending to show that the lot was damaged by the construction of the elevated crossing. Albert L. Gorter testified that he knew the market value of the lot before the railroad was built, and its market value after it was built; and that before the building of the road it was worth more than fifty-two thousand dollars ; and that after it was built the value was fifteen thousand less ; that the lot was damaged to this extent by the railroad. He was then asked the following question : \u201c Q. Assuming the value of the lot after the construction of the railway, the value of the property to have been $37,066.67, what, in your opinion, would have been its value in 1894, if there were no elevated structure in front of it? A. $15,000 more.\u201d Defendant objected, and its objection being overruled, took an exception. The evidence seems to be merely the statement in another form of the estimate which the witness had already made.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The plaintiffs offered other evidence tending to show that the lot had been greatly injured by the construction of the elevated crossing in front of it; and that a general rise in the value of property in the neighborhood had taken place since the building of the road; that it was not owing to the existence of the road, but to other causes operating at the same time. The defendant produced certified copies of certain deeds, and tendered them in evidence for the purpose of showing for what price the property was sold which was therein described. On objection by the plaintiffs the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>rejected the evidence and the defendant excepted. These certified copies are evidence that the grantors validly conveyed to the grantees the property therein described. In other words there are evidence of every circumstance necessary to make the deeds valid conveyances. As between the parties the acknowledgements of the payment of the considerations are evidence that they were actually paid. And if the deeds should be attacked for fraud in a suit at law or in equity we may concede (for the sake of the argument) that the parties alleging that the considerations were not paid would be obliged to sustain the charge by proof. And that the presumption of innocence would apply in favor of the party charged with fraud, and that the <em>onus </em>of proof would rest upon his assailant. But as between parties in no way connected with the deed, the statement by the grantor that he had received so much money would be <em>res inter alios acta; </em>it would be hearsay pure and simple. A statement made by a stranger that he had concluded a transaction with another stranger can have no binding effect upon third persons ; it .is certainly not entitled to be received as evidence without the sanction of an oath made by some witness acquainted with the fact. In <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Lynch, 28 </em>Pennsylvania State R. 424, the Court, speaking of an acknowledgement of the payment of the consideration contained in a deed, as it affected strangers to the instrument, said : <em>\u201c </em>Against them, it is nothing but hearsay. It is a mere <em>ex parte </em>declaration not under oath, taken without any opportunity to cross-examine. It has long been settled that such declarations are not evidence against strangers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Mr. A. R. White was called by defendant as a witness to prove the character and condition of the neighborhood and property on North street between Centre and Saratoga, now facing the main structure of the defendant, as they existed before the structure was built and its present character and condition ; and also to show the character and condition of the improvements between Saratoga and Lexington street's opposite the southern inclined approach to the elevated struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ture ; the defendant offering to follow up this testimony by proof that the southern inclined approach is practically a counterpart of the northern approach. The testimony was rejected and the defendant took an exception. We will consider these questions, although the exception is not taken in such manner as to present both of them. We presume that it was the intention of the defendant to follow the evidence by testimony showing the effect of the building of the elevated road. The distances are not shown in feet; but Saratoga street is distant four blocks from Centre; and Centre is distant four blocks from Eager. The witness testified that in the space between Saratoga and Eager there was but one lot which was not occupied by buildings and that one was used as a marble yard ; that there were only two houses used as dwellings, and their occupants kept bar-rooms ; that most of the property was used for business purposes and large warehouses ; and that the streets were \u201c <em>honeycombed.\" </em>with the tracks of steam railroads ; that there was no vacant land between Saratoga and Lexington ; and that opposite the structure there is a church, and the Hibernian school-house, and that there are stables, the express company and a paint shop. Evidence had been given that the Garrett property was vacant land, and before the construction of the railroad was suitable for dwelling-houses. As the property in regard to which the evidence was proposed was extremely different from the Garrett lot, we think that the effect upon its value caused by the construction of the railroad would furnish no aid in ascertaining the effect on the Garrett lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The defendant offered evidence that the value of the Garrett property had not been diminished by the building of the road ; and also evidence that it had been increased by it. Both parties offered prayers for the instruction of the jury. The question to be decided was whether the lot had been diminished in value by reason of the elevated structure in front of it; and if so, what was the extent of the injury. Ordinarily the question would be settled by a comparison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>of values before and after the erection of the structure ; but in case there were a general advance in the value of property in the neighborhood from the growth and progress ot the city or from any other cause, this test would not be sufficient. To state a hypothetical case: Suppose that a lot is worth thirty thousand dollars, and that it is injured by the railroad to the extent of ten thousand dollars, thus reducing its value to twenty thousand dollars ; and 'that after the building of the railroad there is a general rise in the value of property in the neighborhood, and that participating in this improvement, the value of the lot at the time of the trial reaches forty thousand dollars, which is more than it was worth before the road was built. The railroad cannot be exempted from liability for the damage which it has done, by the circumstances that the injured property has received the benefit of the general prosperity. The railroad has inflicted an injury and the property still suffers from the effect of it. If the damage had not been done, the value of the lot would have been greater; and this increase in reasonable probability would be at least equal to the extent of the injury. It has been argued by the counsel for the appellant that \u201cthe building and use of the structure\u201d has increased the value of the lot. We do not suppose that he means obstructing access to the lot, and reducing the width of the open street in front of it, has increased its value; but that the existence of the railroad by increasing' and improving the facilities of travel, and in other ways has conferred benefits upon the property. It is insisted that these should be taken into consideration by the jury, and if they are found to equal the injury, that the verdict ought to be for the defendant. There has been some conflict of opinion in the Courts on this question. We cannot do better than to quote a passage from a recent work of great value, where the result of the weight of authority is stated. We refer to <em>Elliott on Railroads, </em>and we make an extract from volume 3, section 989: \u201c Where the construction of a railroad adds increased value to the land of an individual different in its nature from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the benefit to the general community, he receives a special benefit which lessens his injury or loss, so that he really sustains no injury or loss except that which is above and beyond the amount of the peculiar benefit which the construction of the railroad confers upon him by enhancing the value of that part of his land which is not appropriated. But where the land-owner reaps no advantage peculiar to himself, but only such as is shared by the community at large, there is reason for excluding the benefits from consideration. Special benefits may be said to be such as are direct and peculiar to the land. General benefits such as are bestowed upon other lands of similar character and situation in the same vicinity.\u201d This is the doctrine in this State. <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Baltimore and Potomac R. R. Co., </em>34 Maryland, 343; <em>Friedenwald </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., </em>74 Maryland, 126. We suppose that we have shown our approval of the ruling of the trial Court on the prayers. We think, however, the Court might properly have rejected the defendant\u2019s third prayer. It seems to have been drawn on the theory that the running of the passenger cars conferred benefits on the lot. There was no evidence of any special benefits; and we have already given our opinion in reference to general benefits.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b299-6\">(Decided June 23rd, 1897).</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
