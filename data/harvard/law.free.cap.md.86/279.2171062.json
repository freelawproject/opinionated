In 1892, one Charles Brown, being the owner of certain stalls in the Lexington and other markets, borrowed on the security of the same the sum of $2,000 from the Butchers\u2019 Mutual Protective Association. At the same time, Charles W. Brown, son of Charles Brown, subscribed for certain shares of stock in the association in his own name, as trustee, and the loan to Charles Brown was to be liquidated <em>pro tanto </em>by any payments made on the shares. Afterwards Charles Brown borrowed an additional $500 from the association, making his total indebtedness $2,500. This was secured by a mortgage of the stalls from Chas. Brown to the association executed in 1894, covering both loans, and also by a pledge of the shares subscribed for by C. W. Brown. Chas. Brown had previously borrowed $250 from G. W. Green on the security of two of the stalls. In January, 1895, Charles Brown died and Charles W. Brown and Emil Budnitz were appointed administrators of his estate, which consistsd only of the stalls. These were appraised in the inventory at $2,000. In December, 1895, the administrators reported a private sale of the stalls to G. W. Green for $2,750 which was ratified. This was the amount of the liens on the property, viz., the mortgage to the association for $2,500 and the pledge to Green for $250. The association released its mortgage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the administrators on December g, 1895. At that time however, the association received in money only the sum of $ 1,086.97, because the payments previously made by Charles W. Brown, with his own money, to the association, on his shares of stock, amounted to $1,427.37, and served to reduce the mortgage indebtedness to that extent. The above-mentioned sum of $1,086.97 was loaned by Green to Chas. W. Brown, for the purpose of paying off the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">By virtue of the administrator\u2019s sale the title to the stalls appeared to be in Green, free from the mortgage, but there was an agreement between him on the one hand and Brown and his partner on the other, by which the latter agreed to pay Green $1,200 for the stalls within two years and to have possession of the same in the meantime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">In November, 1895, the Western National Bank recovered a judgment against Charles W. Brown for $1,209.80. Execution was issued on November 29, and returned <em>nulla bona </em>on December 9. The next day the bank filed a bill alleging that Charles W. Brown was the real owner of the stalls and asking for a sale thereof to satisfy its judgment lien. After testimony was taken the Court below decreed, in October, 1896, that the title to the stalls was in Charles W. Brown, subject to the claims, if any, of Green, and directed a sale of the same. No appeal was taken from this decree. A sale was made and auditor\u2019s report A distributing the proceeds, amounting to $2,075, was ratified, by which the claim of the bank was allowed in full, and only a small dividend audited on the claim of Green against Brown for $1,200. The Court sustained exceptions to account B stated at the direction of Green, in which he was allowed priority for the sum of $1,086.97, being the amount advanced by him for the purpose of paying off the mortgage to the Butchers\u2019 Association.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b307-7\">The cause was argued before McSherry, C. J., Bryan, Fowler, Briscoe, Page and Boyd, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Charles A. Briscoe </em>(with whom was <em>Fetter S. Hoblitzell </em>on the brief), for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-5\">The ratified order in account A allows the appellant his lien claim of $250 on the Lexington market stalls Nos. 5 and 5 but allows the judgment claim of appellee as a preferred lien, because of the issue of a <em>fi. fa. </em>which was placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands and returned <em>milla bona </em>before the 9th of December, 1895. This fact giving appellee a prior lien over appellant\u2019s claim as reported by the auditor under the rulings in 6 <em>Har. &amp; Joh. </em>455, and 64 <em>Md. </em>455. The question before the Court is a narrow one, and the history of the case would seem to furnish its solution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-6\">At the time of the first loan to Charles Brown by the Butchers\u2019 Association, title in the stalls was in Charles-Brown, deceased, and when he made the transfer to the association the evidence of the title being vested in the transferee under the ordinance, the <em>fi. fa. </em>of appellee could not affect its money value by way of lien even if such a right held under such license be a subject of lien by way of execution, because Charles W. Brown had no title, legal or equitable in the stalls, at that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-7\">It cannot be contended that appellee as Charles W. Brown\u2019s creditor obtained any lien upon the amount representing the payments made on the shares of stock in the name of Brown, trustee for Elenora Brown, under the judgment of <em>fi. </em>/\u00ab. issued, even if that money was in fact paid by him, such a writ of execution not having such force and effect on money due a debtor. A <em>fortiori </em>could not the appellee claim any lien on the <em>fi. fa. </em>on these payments, because they were hypothecated under the terms of the contract for the payment of the loan made to Charles Brown, and were first to be applied to its liquidation, which contract Charles W. Brown was competent to make and he was bound thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-8\">The title, if any existed in Charles W. Brown, was derived under the pretended private sale made under the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, December 4th, 1895, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>only held title from the date of December 9th, 1895, the day when the mortgage indebtedness of the intestate Charles Brown was paid off, and prior to this date the writ of <em>fi. fa. </em>issued on appellee\u2019s judgment has been returned <em>nulla </em>bona, therefore, no lien could attach under that <em>fi. fa. </em>because Charles W. Brown only obtained title after it was dead, and to effect it by lien, if subject to lien by such issue of <em>fi. fa. </em>and placing in hands of sheriff, a new execution should have issued on or after December 9th, 1895. <em>Barry </em>v. Kennedy, 11 Abb. (N. Y.) N. S. 42; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>M. &amp; C., </em>51 Md. 270; <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>3 Bland. Ch. 315\u20146, 325.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">The appellant was an innocent purchaser for value of the title held by the association from Charles Brown, deceased, without any notice whatever of the claim of appellee. When the Butchers\u2019 Association transferred its paper title received from Charles Brown to this appellant on the receipt of $1,086.97 by the order of the administrators of his estate, thereafter, under the operation of sec. 17, Art. 35, appellant held the evidence of title as its grantee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">There has been a total failure on the part of appellee to show any fraud of appellant in his connection with the proceedings in question or any collusion with Charles W. Brown or any other person whatever to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors. The appellant\u2019s loan obtained by fraud has by the ratification of auditor\u2019s account A been obsorbed to pay a debt of Charles W. Brown, to appellee, and it cannot be reconciled on any principle of law or equity n the absence of fraud or collusion of appellant, and it would be inequitable for the appellee to be permitted to profit by the fraud of his debtor under the circumstance. Appellant held the transfer of the stalls to secure the repayment of the advance of $1,200 to Charles W. Brown, without regard to the rights of the heirs and distributees of Charles Brown, or their creditors, and it would be inequitable to compel him to surrender the value of his title holding as assignee or transferee of the association, without reimbursing him of said sum advanced as a consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>transfer. Even if appellee had an equal equity upon this fund with appellant, as creditor of Charles W. Brown, the fact that appellant held the transfer under the circumstances would entitle him to be paid first out of the funds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">Again, it is apparent, that if the administrators had sold these stalls for the cash price they were sold under decree of this Court, subject to appellant\u2019s Hen of $250 on stalls 5 and 5 <em>y2, </em>-which sold for $300, it would not have been much more than what was required to pay off the mortgage to the Butchers\u2019 Association, after paying the expenses of a sale and costs of administration. If the claim of appellant is allowed the priority over appellee\u2019s claim, it is evident the appellee is in no worse condition than he would have been if the appellant had not been imposed upon by the fraud of Charles W. Brown and induced to pay the $1,086.97 in liquidation of that mortgage balance, believing he was getting the title to secure the repayment, because the mortgagee could have enforced its claim by foreclosure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">Appellant having paid $1,086.97 of the money advanced to liquidate the mortgage to the Butchers\u2019 Association is in equity entitled to be substituted, or subrogated to the security of its mortgage as a prior lien to the appellee\u2019s judgment. The law of substitution is not founded on contract or agreement, but upon the equitable powers of the Court. It is in the nature of equitable relief to protect a meritorious creditor who has paid the debt of another, against loss and damage. <em>Robertson, &amp;c., </em>66 Md. 538, citing <em>Milholland's case, </em>64 Md. 455.

In May, 1892, he borrowed $250 from the appellant, and to secure its payment pledged to him stalls Nos. 5 and 51^, in the Lexington Market. There is no controversy over this transaction. On the 24th February, 1892, the Baltimore Butchers\u2019 Mutual Protective Association loaned him <em>$2,000 </em>and on the 4th of April, 1894, the further sum of $500. To secure the payment of these two sums, amounting in the aggregate to $2,500, the association received a 'mortgage from Brown on all the stalls, and also the transfer of the licenses therefor on the books of the City Comptroller. At the same time, to comply with the rules of the association, Charles W. Brown, the son of Charles Brown, in his own name as trustee for Elenora Brown, his wife, subscribed for certain shares of stock of the association, and pledged them as additional security.for the loan. In his lifetime Charles Brown paid no portion of this debt. Charles W.. Brown, however, kept the stock paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>up, according to the rules of the association. Brown states as the reason why the shares were subscribed for by him as trustee that the association required the borrower to become a member by subscribing for its stock, and his father not being \u201c in a condition \u201d to do so, he consented to take them as trustee for his wife, and pledge them for the debt of his father. It was not insisted at the argument that the payments made by Brown on account of the stock was out of his wife\u2019s money, as Brown in his answer had alleged. There is no proof in the case that would enable us to find that Mrs. Brown\u2019s money was so used. Although at the requirement of the association, she joined in the receipt to it for the amount standing to the credit of her husband, trustee, there is nothing in the record to satisfy us that she had any interest in the matter whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In January, 1895, Charles Brown died and within a month thereafter, Charles W. Brown and Emil Budnitz qualified as the administrators of his estate. On the 27th of November, 1895, the appellees recovered a judgment in the Baltimore City Court against Charles W. Brown for $1,209,80 with interest and costs, and on the same day execution by way of <em>fieri facias </em>was issued and reached the sheriffs hands two days later.. It is clear, that at the time of the issuing of this writ, the title to the stalls was in the administrators of Charles Brown, subject to the lien of George Green on stalls Nos. 5 and 5 in the Lexington Market, and the lien of the Butchers\u2019 Association on all the stalls of the deceased in both markets. On the fourth day of December, 1895, the Orphans\u2019 Court passed an order directing the administrators to make sale of the stalls. The report of the administrators to the Orphans\u2019 Court fails to give the date of the sale made in pursuance of the order. But Mr. Budnitz in his answer states that,, it was made, reported and ratified before the ninth day of December. He also testifies that Brown told him \u201c two or three days before the report of sale,\u201d that Green was to be reported as purchaser, and acting on this he (Budnitz) prepared the report and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>filed it. It was immediately ratified ; and \u201c the appointment was <em>then </em>made for all the parties in interest to meet at his office on the ninth of December.\u201d That the sale was completed before that day is further borne out by a consideration of the purpose and plan Brown had in view. His purpose was to secure the title to himself; his plan, to have Green returned purchaser, so that the latter could hold the legal title until the loan was repaid ; and to effect all this, it was necessary when the time came for Green to advance the money and for the association to release the mortgage, that the title should be safely vested in Green. How long before the ninth of December the sale was made, is not material; because if it was made at any time prior to that day, the lien of the appellant\u2019s judgment fastened upon the property. Nor is it proper to enquire whether upon the facts proved, the title became vested in Charles W. Brown. The Circuit Court by its decree of the sixth of October, 1896, so determined, and with the correctness of that decision, it not having been appealed from, we are not now concerned. <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>17 Md. 242. This appeal having been taken from an order distributing the proceeds of sale, the original decree authorizing the sale is not open to review by this Court. <em>Newbold </em>v. <em>Schlens, </em>66 Md. 590; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>11 G. &amp; J. 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Brown\u2019s title having accrued prior to the return day of the writ, that is prior to the 9th day of December, if it be assumed that market stalls are such property as may be taken in execution, it is clear the appellees acquired a lien, subject to such prior liens as might exist. The fact that the Butchers\u2019 Association held a mortgage, whereby the legal title was in it, with only an equity of redemption in Brown, could not avail to defeat the lien of the execution. It could not be enforced at law, it is true, and because of that it is that the appellant had the right to seek the intervention of a Court of Equity in order that he may be paid his claim, after the prior lien has been discharged. \u201c It is an established legal principle, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>a debtor\u2019s equitable estate in personal property cannot be seized and sold under a writ of <em>fieri facias. </em>The usual mode is, to issue a <em>fi. </em>fa., cause it to be levied or returned, thus showing that his remedy at law has failed ; by which acts of diligence a creditor acquires, in the eye of a Court of Equity, a priority of right from the time his execution was placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands, anda Court of Equity will permit him to redeem the prior incumbrance or grant a decree for a sale.\u201d <em>Myers v. Amey, </em>21 Md. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We are of opinion there is nothing in the nature of the right or estate acquired by the purchaser of market stalls to exempt them from the lien of an execution. Such right is \u201c in the nature of an easement in, not a title to, a freehold in the land ; * * it is limited in duration to the existence of the market and is to be understood as acquired subject to such changes and modifications in the market during its existence as the public needs may require. The purchase confers an exclusive right to occupy the particular stalls, with their appendages for the purposes of the market and none other.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>M. &amp; C. C. of </em>Balto., 51 Md. 270. It is a valuable right, sold by the municipal authorities under the power conferred by the Legislature \u201c to lease, sell or dispose of\u201d it \u201cin any manner and for any term\u201d they may think proper. <em>Public Local Code, </em>Art. 4, sec. 678. It is transferable, may be given and taken as security for debts or sold; and special provision is made in the City Code for the passage of the title. <em>Border State Savings Institution </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>63 Md. 531. It is also an interest issuing out of the realty of determinate duration, such as the term of years for which it may be granted, or during the existence of the market. It is a chattel real and personal property (2 Blackstone, 386); and therefore liable for the debts of the owner and subject to seizure and sale under a <em>fieri facias. </em>2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Practice, </em>1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Subsequently to the sale, by appointment, Mr. Budnitz testifies the \u201cparties in interest\u201d met in his office on the ninth of December. At that time Green was chargeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>with full knowledge of the exact state of the title. He had actual notice of the mortgage and of the fact that the association held the license as collateral security only, for the payment of the debt due to it by Charles Brown. An examination of the records in the Orphans\u2019 Court would have informed him that the administrators had included the market stalls in the inventory of the estate, had obtained an order for the sale and had sold them, and reported him as the purchaser without his knowledge or consent. He knew he was not the owner of the stalls, and inasmuch as it was within his knowledge that Brown wanted to get the stalls free from the claim of the association, and the title in \u201c some individual, where he could pay the money on notes when it came due,\u201d it required no especial astuteness to enable him to infer that whatever was done, was at the instigation of Brown himself. He states in his evidence he asked Brown <em>\u201c </em>if the stalls were all right in his name and he said they were,\u201d and that satisfied him. He seems to have made no examination, either among the Orphans\u2019 Court proceedings or in the Comptroller\u2019s office. It was under these circumstances that on the 9th of December, the claim of the association was paid and its mortgage released. The release recites, \u201cwhereas all covenants, &amp;c., have been performed and the whole sum of money and interest secured thereby has been paid, the said body corporate doth grant and release, &amp;c.\u201d The receipt of the association is for $2,514.34, of which $ 1,086.74 was paid by the check of Green ; the residue was settled for by the receipt of Brown and wife for $1,427.37, the same being the amount to their credit on the books of the association. The amount so paid by Green\u2019s check was part of the $1,200 loaned to Brown and was so paid at Brown\u2019s request; the residue of the loan was paid to Brown. At the same time Green obtained a transfer of the license from the association, and also entered into an agreement with Brown to sell the stalls to Brown\u2019s firm (Brown &amp; Merritt) for $1,200, payable in two years, they to have the possession of them upon payment of that sum with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>interest and the license and all expenses thereon. It is not contended that Green acquired any title or interest in the property by the transfer of the license, superior to the lien of the execution. It is also clear that up to the date of the sale by the administrators the equitable title to the stalls was in Charles Brown or his representatives ; and after that in Charles W. Brown. So that when the mortgage was released, its lien was absolutely destroyed, and the lien of the execution became the first, unless upon some principle of equity Green can be subrogated to the lien of the mortgage. Upon this point the counsel for the appellant have cited many decisions of Courts beyond the State, but we deem it unnecessary to enter upon an examination of them, for the reason that, as to a case of this kind, the proposition involved has been firmly settled by our own Courts, and, we may add, in conformity to the great weight of authority everywhere. <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>43 Md. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It may be premised, in view of the facts as we have stated them, that to hold the lien of the association still exists, would be to defeat the intent of the parties manifested by declarations and acts in the most unequivocal manner. When Brown obtained the loan from Green, it was well understood by both of them that the money was to be used in procuring the release of the association\u2019s mortgage. This was in- fact accomplished by the release from the association. Green, who at the time knew or ought to have known the exact condition of the title, contented himself with taking as his only security a transfer of the license from the association, who, he was well aware, held it only as a security for its claim. Why, it may be asked, should not be applied the rule, than which none is better settled, that \u201c those who enter into contracts must be governed by them as made, according to their true intent and meaning, and must submit to the legal consequences from them ?\u201d <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Parker, (supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Can Green under these circumstances derive any aid /rom the doctrine of subrogation ? That doctrine is not founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>in contract but is altogether a creature of equity, and only resorted to to afford relief to a meritorious creditor. It is never applied when by so doing it will work an injury upon other persons by destroying their legal or equitable rights. In <em>Milholland and Wilcox, Trustees, </em>v. <em>Tiffany, </em>64 Md. 460, the Court says : \u201cIt may be applied on equitable principles in behalf of one who at the instance and request of the debtor pays a lien or incumbrance which he was under no legal obligation to pay, provided it does not interfere with intervening rights and incumbrances. It will not, of course, be applied against superior or equal equities.\u201d <em>Woollen's Extrs. </em>v. <em>Hillen, </em>9 Gill, 185; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>C. &amp; O. Canal, </em>32 Md. 546; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Parker (supra); Clabaugh </em>v. <em>Byerly, </em>7 Gill, 354; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Mowell, </em>66 Md. 538.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b319-7\">(Decided June 23rd, 1897).</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">For these reasons we think Green is not entitled to be subrogated to the lien of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Finding no error in the order of the Court below, it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
