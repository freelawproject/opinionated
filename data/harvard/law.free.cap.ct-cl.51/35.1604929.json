McKee Duncan </em>for the plaintiff. <em>Mr. </em>IF. <em>T. 8. Curtis </em>was on the briefs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-16\">It has been pertinently, and as we contend, correctly said that when a statute commands an act to be done in a certain way or upon certain terms or give a new proceeding or prescribes the manner and form of this proceeding, the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>and form so prescribed by the statute is not merely directory but is an essential condition of a right of recovery and that <em>nothing </em>can dispense with the mandate of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">Besides the general rule of construction that all parts of a statute should be given a meaning, the court must presume that the legislators who framed this act (June 7, 1902) did so on some consistent and rational theory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-7\">If it be conceded for argument that the Government had the right to distrain and sell the distillery for all taxes and that in such case a distraint and sale is legal, then this special act (June 7,1902) excepted from this general rule of legality, a distraint and sale for special taxes and has prescribed for this court a different rule in directing it to ascertain the amount of the special tax and deduct the amount from the damages found and give judgment for the excess damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-8\">If Congress has intended for this court to hold that a distraint and sale of defendant\u2019s distillery and premises was valid and legal the direction to the court in said special act to ascertain the amount of any special tax due by plaintiffs and deduct same from the damages, etc., was entirely superfluous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-9\">If the special tax was due and a distraint and sale of the property was legal and valid, that would be the end of the controversy and necessarily precludes further investigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-10\">It is therefore conclusive, that in these directions in this act, Congress directs the court that if plaintiffs\u2019 distillery and premises were seized and sold by the United States for special taxes, it was unlawfully seized and sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-11\">What, then, are special taxes in the opinion of the law? Manifestly they are all taxes assessed against the distillers from the beginning to the end of his operation, because if any taxes were legally due on whisky produced, or on account of deficiency whether gallon or barrel or capacity tax, they equally would be entitled to be offset under the act against the damage found by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-12\">The act of July 20, 1868, 15 Stat., 149, is the only law by which the validity of the seizure and sale is to be determined. By section 105 it repeals all inconsistent acts. The act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>1868 divorced the subject of distilled spirits, cigars, and tobacco from all other subjects of internal-revenue taxation. Its enactment was the death knell of the long list of burdensome taxes of license, incomes, occupation, and capital in business, and confined the internal-revenue receipts to those three subjects of taxation\u2014distilled spirits, cigars, and tobacco\u2014and completely covers the whole subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-6\">Thirty-sixth Cyc., page 1079, states the rule that if an act covering the whole subject of earlier acts embraces new provisions and plainly shows that it was intended not only as a substitute for the earlier act but to cover the whole subject considered by the legislature and to prescribe the only rules in respect thereto, it operates as a repeal of all former statutes relating to the same subject matter, even if the former acts are not in all respects repugnant to the new act, and cites as the basis of the rule: 186 U. S., 95; 175 U. S., 677; 142 U. S., 459; 134 U. S., 206; 107 U. S., 445; 106 U. S., 395; 97 U. S., 546; 11 Wallace, 86; 3 How., 636; and 91 Fed. Rep., 299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">The only reference in the act of July 20,1868,15 Stat., 125, to legal proceedings to collect taxes is section 56: If distilled spirits are not withdrawn in nine months from warehouse, they should be sold, and if upon removal from an unsafe warehouse the expenses of withdrawal are not paid the whisky shall be distrained and sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-8\">Section 105 gives the remedy by a suit in equity to enforce liens on distillei\u2019y and premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-9\">The Government has fully protected itself under the act of July 30, 1868, to compensate for the supposed advantages of distraint and sale, which remedy has not been granted by that act and has been omitted from its provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-10\">There was no authority under the law then in existence to justify the action of the Government in seizing and selling the plaintiff\u2019s distillery, and the first proposition proposed by the act of July 7,1892, \u201c Was the plaintiff\u2019s distillery unlawfully seized and sold ? \u201d should in all fairness be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-11\">All the internal-revenue laws prescribe the harshest and most unrelenting method of extracting revenue imposed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>certain kinds of business of the citizen and these laws must be construed with the most exacting strictness against the beneficiary thereof\u2014the Government. If the right, or the remedy to enforce the right, is not clearly recognized and provided for by the language of the act, it does not exist. No rights or remedies are, or can be, created by construction of the acts. If the Government takes the property of the citizen ostensibly under the act and appropriates it or its proceeds to its own use when the act does not, in fact, authorize the taking, this taking differs in no essential particular from any other taking of private property for public use for which the fifth section of the Constitution provides compensation. The citizen is powerless to prevent the taking; the only check upon this absolute arbitrary power is the right the citizen has to compensation under the fifth section of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-6\">This liability is fixed by the Constitution and has been frequently recognized, for instance, in the matter of the appropriation of sites for public buildings, as the case of taking from riparian owners land for improvement of navigable rivers, or for national parks, cemeteries, military barracks for soldiers, or the occupancy of a church for the use of the Army, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-7\">The act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat., 505, recognizes this liability and gives to this court in its first clause jurisdiction to hear and determine such matters, as well as claims on contracts with the Government and for damages liquidated or unliquidated not in tort, in respect to which claim the party would be entitled to redress against the United States in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if the Government could be sued.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-8\"><em>Messrs.

L., 1443, under which the action is brought, directs that if claimants\u2019 propei'ty was \u201c unlawfully seized or sold \u201d this court \u201c shall try and determine whether under the then existing law's of the United States the said Thierxnan &amp; Frost sustained any damages by reason thereof, <em>and whether the Government is and was liable wnder such laws for the damages sustained * </em>* The case is required to be \u201c tried and determined under the laws, rules, and regulations governing proceedings \u201d ixx this court and upon the evidence legally admissible, * * * \u201c <em>hereby reserving to the Government the right to interpose any defense, whether legal or equitable, that it may have to said, cause of </em>action, except only the defenses based on the jurisdiction of the court and the statxxte of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">The United States can not be sued without their consent, and, as said in' <em>Price\u2019s case, </em>174 U. S., 373, 375, \u201cits liability in sxxit can not be extended beyond the plain language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of the statute authorizing it * * *. Beyond the letter of such consent the court may not go, no matter how beneficial they may deem or in fact might be their possession of a larger jurisdiction over the liability of the Government.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 182 U. S., 516, 530; <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 155 U. S., 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The jurisdiction to hear and determine actions \u201c for damages sounding in tort\u201d is not granted to this court by the general statute conferring jurisdiction in cases against the United States <em>(Judicial </em>Code, sec. 145). On the contrary, the grant of jurisdiction is to hear and determine claims for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, \u201c not sounding in tort.\u201d There have, however, been cases where Congress has by special acts authorized the court to adjudicate claims for damages sounding in tort, as, for example <em>Waltons </em>case, 24 C. Cls., 372; <em>St. Louis &amp; Mississippi Valley Co. case, </em>33 C. Cls., 264; and where the special act clearly confers purisdiction the court has proceeded to the adjudication under the terms of the special act.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">We may therefore concede that the act conferring jurisdiction in this case authorizes the hearing of the claim though it sounds in tort; but the court is left to determine the question whether the Government is and was liable for the alleged wrongs, and expressly reserves to the Government \u201c the right to interpose any defense,\u201d saving only that of jurisdiction and the statute of limitations. Under \u201c the then existing laws\u201d the United States was or is not liable for the tortious acts of its agents or officers. Thus in <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>8 Wall., 369, it was held that the Government was not liable on an implied assumpsit for the torts of its officers committed while in its service and apparently for its benefit, <em>Whiteside's case, </em>93 U. S., 247, 257; <em>Langford's case, </em>101 U. S., 341; <em>Lee's case, </em>106 U. S., 196, 241; <em>Cumming's case, </em>130 U. S., 452. In the last-named case there was a special act conferring jurisdiction on this court to \u201c pass upon the law and facts \u201d as to the Government\u2019s liability for the acts of its officers \u201c by reason of the seizure, detention, and closing up of the commission houses and bonded warehouses of claimants by a collector of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ternal revenue. The Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Harlan, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201c Did it [Congress] invest the Court of Claims with jurisdiction to render a judgment against the United States upon its appearing that the revenue officers transcended the authority conferred upon them by law, or had exercised their authority in such a manner as made them personally liable in damages to the plaintiffs? There would be some ground for an affirmative answer to these questions if the statute had not required the court to pass upon both \u2018 the law and the facts \u2019 as to the liability of the United States. If the facts disclosed a case of unauthorized wrongs done to the plaintiffs by the revenue officers of the United States, the question, by the very terms of the act, would still remain whether the United States were liable in law for such damages as the plaintiffs had sustained. There would seem to be no escape from the conclusion that Congress intended that the liability of the Government should be determined by the settled principles of law. The only right waived by the Government was a defense based upon the statute of limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The act before us saves all defenses, except as stated, and does not express a purpose of Congress that the United States shall be made responsible for the seizure of said distillery plant if it was not lawfully seized, unless under the then existing law they were liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u201c It is as if the plaintiffs asserted before Congress the liability in law of the Government for the damages they sustained and Congress permitted them to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in order that there might be a judicial determination of the question by that tribunal with the right of appeal.\u201d <em>Cumming\u2019s </em>case, 180 U. S., 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">And we may therefore conclude with the apposite language of said case (p. 455):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">\u201cAccording to this construction of the act the plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment against the United States in any sum, for if the collector * * * and other revenue officers did nothing more than the law authorized them to do, neither they nor the Government would be liable in damages; while if they acted illegally they would be personally liable in damages, not the Government.\u201d See <em>Oakes\u2019s </em>case, 174 U. S., 778, 785.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">For the reasons given, the petition should be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
