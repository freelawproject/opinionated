The defendant appeals from his conviction, following a jury trial, of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a(a) and burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101(a)(2). On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court: (1) abused its discretion by admitting into evidence\n   statements made by the victim pursuant to the spontaneous utterance exception to the rule against hearsay; (2) erroneously admitted into evidence testimonial hearsay in violation of his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the federal constitution by permitting a police investigator to testify as to certain witness statements regarding the defendant's claimed whereabouts on the day of the murder; and (3) committed plain error when it did not dismiss, sua sponte, the burglary in the first degree charge, which had been brought beyond the applicable statute of limitations. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By way of long form information, the state charged the defendant with murder and burglary in the first degree. These charges stemmed from the death of Alexandra Duscay, the victim, whose body was found by her mother, Linda Duscay, in their Milford home at approximately 4:30 p.m. on May 19, 2006. An autopsy revealed that the victim died as a result of blunt force trauma and stab wounds to her head. Following the jury's verdict of guilty on both counts, the trial court sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment of sixty years on the murder conviction and a concurrent sentence of twenty years on the burglary conviction,\n   for a total effective sentence of sixty years to serve. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We begin with the defendant's first claim challenging the trial court's admission of the victim's statements under the spontaneous utterance exception to the rule against hearsay. Specifically, the defendant challenges the testimony of Jermaine Morton, who testified that the victim stated, during a telephone call on May 19, 2006, that her \"ex-boyfriend\" was at the door and \"what are you doing here? You were supposed to call first.\" The defendant argues that the \"nonviolent\" arrival of a former boyfriend is not the type of startling event that would shock and overwhelm the senses and that statements made in relation to that event are not free from the opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following additional facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of the defendant's claim. The victim met the defendant when she was a teenager. The two became romantically involved, and the victim considered the defendant her boyfriend. Although the defendant was sentenced to prison in 1998, he and the victim continued to communicate with one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the defendant's incarceration, however, the victim began to distance herself from him, finding the\n   relationship stressful. She ultimately decided to end the relationship just prior to the defendant's release from prison in 2004. Soon after the defendant was released on August 6, 2004, the victim told her brother, Erik Terranova, that she feared the defendant.\n   Nicole Williamson, a close friend of the victim, also testified that the victim even worried that the defendant might be hiding in the bushes when she returned home at night. According to family and friends, the defendant was the only individual whom the victim referred to as her \"ex-boyfriend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At approximately 12:30 p.m. on May 19, 2006, the victim, while at home in Milford, placed a call to Morton, whom she had been dating for a few weeks. At trial, the state called Morton to testify regarding the statements he overheard the victim make during this phone call. In an offer of proof made outside of the presence of the jury, Morton testified that, during their conversation, \"she told me to hold on, and she said someone was at her door. I could actually hear her in the background say\n   <em>\n    what are you doing here? You were supposed to call first.\n   </em>\n   She got back on the phone. She told me not to-she would call me right back. She called me back about ten to twenty-five to twenty minutes, or whatever, and after that she didn't say anything. She just talked about-we had another regular conversation. She didn't sound hurt or she didn't sound anything like that, so I didn't take alarm of anything, so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) After reviewing the written statement that he gave to police on May 19, 2006, Morton further testified that the victim informed him that her\n   \"ex-boyfriend\" was the individual at the door.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court asked Morton to describe the \"nature\" of the victim's statements, and Morton testified that the victim was \"annoyed\" and \"surprised that [the defendant] was there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over the defendant's objection, the court admitted Morton's testimony recounting the victim's statements, concluding that the statements: (1) followed the startling event of an unannounced appearance of an individual; (2) related to that appearance; (3) demonstrated the victim's direct observation of the individual's appearance; and (4) were reliable because they were made under circumstances during which the declarant did not have time to fabricate her observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before we address the defendant's claim, we set forth the applicable legal principles. \"An out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.... Among the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule is the spontaneous utterance exception, which applies to an utterance or declaration that: (1) follows some startling occurrence; (2) refers to the occurrence; (3) is made by one having the opportunity to observe the occurrence; and (4) is made in such close connection to the occurrence and under such circumstances as to negate the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication by the declarant.... [T]he ultimate question is whether the utterance was spontaneous and unreflective and made under such circumstances as to indicate absence of opportunity for contrivance and misrepresentation....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Whether an utterance is spontaneous and made under circumstances that would preclude contrivance and misrepresentation is a preliminary question of fact to be decided\n   by the trial judge.... The trial judge exercises broad discretion in deciding this preliminary question, and that decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an unreasonable exercise of discretion.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wargo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120127\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/113/#p127\">\n    255 Conn. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127-28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=763%20A.2d%201\">\n    763 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) ; see also Conn.

On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Morton's testimony regarding the statements that he overheard the victim make while on the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Connecticut courts have had numerous opportunities to assess the types of \"startling events\" that can generate the kind of nervous excitement or uncontrolled outbursts captured by the spontaneous utterance exception to the rule against hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the outset, we appreciate the fact that the unannounced presence of an individual at one's door, in and of itself, may not appear to be among the usual set of circumstances envisioned when evaluating whether a statement is, or is not, admissible as a spontaneous utterance.

Thus, whether a statement qualifies as a spontaneous utterance requires a case-by-case assessment of the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the subject statement. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729290\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/361/#p374\">\n    280 Conn. at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=908%20A.2d%20506\">\n    908 A.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, context is crucial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With that in mind, we conclude that the record clearly supports the trial court's finding that the victim's statements were \"made in such close connection to [a startling] occurrence and under such circumstances as to\n   negate the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wargo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120127\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/113/#p127\">\n    255 Conn. at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=763%20A.2d%201\">\n    763 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time that the state proffered Morton's testimony, the state presented ample evidence from the victim's family that the victim feared the defendant. Her close friend, Williamson, testified that the victim was concerned that the defendant might be hiding in the bushes when she returned home. Morton also described the victim as being \"annoyed\" and \"surprised\" when she made the subject statements. Under the circumstances of the present case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the defendant's unexpected and unwanted appearance at the victim's doorstep startled her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, the court heard testimony that the defendant was the only person the victim referred to as her \"ex-boyfriend,\" and the victim made these statements as the defendant was at her door. Thus, the record supports a finding that the victim made these statements as events unfolded, negating the opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.

After his release from prison in 2004, the defendant began a romantic relationship with Charise Trotman. The defendant lived with Trotman and her teenaged daughter, Chamira Trotman-Adams, in Hamden on May 19, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During their inquiry into the circumstances of the victim's death, investigators from the department questioned the defendant about his whereabouts on May 19, 2006. The investigators first questioned the defendant at approximately 5:30 p.m. that evening. In response to their questions, the defendant said that he had been at Chromalloy, his place of employment, all day and denied visiting Milford that day. He later informed the investigators that he left Chromalloy early to check on Adams, who had been suspended from school, arrived home just before 10 a.m., lifted weights until about 11 a.m., and then went car shopping around the greater Hamden, New Haven, and Milford vicinities. Although Adams was at home in Hamden when the defendant claimed to have returned, she did not see or hear him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The state called Steven Wydra, a detective in the department, during its case-in-chief to testify regarding the investigation of the victim's murder. According to Wydra, his team visited various car dealerships and used car lots in the Hamden and New Haven areas, noting that \"[e]veryone we talked to at the car dealerships said that they had no recollection of someone\n   matching [the defendant's] description [visiting on May 19, 2006].\" The state did not call as witnesses the individuals at the car dealerships. Wydra later confirmed the substance of this testimony in response to questions posed by the state regarding a follow-up interview with the defendant that took place on May 26, 2006. Shortly after Wydra testified regarding his discussions with the individuals at the car dealerships, the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Did you also speak with [the defendant] regarding the used car lots that he had been visiting that afternoon?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[Wydra]: Yes. I had explained to him that\n   <em>\n    we had gone to these car lots and they said that they had not seen him.\n   </em>\n   So I asked him again-actually, I asked if he would actually go with us to the car lots and\n   <em>\n    show us which car lots because there were like three or four of them on the corners that he talked about.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: So did he assist you in doing that?

While investigating the crime scene on May 19, 2006, investigators observed black tape on the victim's face. Frank Gall, a detective from the department, determined that a company named \"Permacel\" manufactured the tape found on the victim's face, and described it as being \"somewhat out of the ordinary.\" Notably, Chromalloy used Permacel tape due to its durable qualities. Tests by forensic trace evidence experts also revealed that the tape on the victim's face possessed \"similar physical and instrumental characteristics\" to tape seized from the defendant's residence on May 26, 2006. Of particular significance, prior to the victim's death, the defendant informed his cousin, Anthony Pugh, that he \"wanted to kill [the victim]\" and planned to use tape and other \"stuff from work\" so that there would be no evidence left behind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The state introduced evidence of the defendant's whereabouts prior to the victim's death. Andrew Weaver, a sergeant from the Hartford Police Department, testified for the state regarding \"call data record mapping.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using cell phone data from the defendant's phone records on May 19, 2006, Weaver determined that the defendant was in close proximity to the victim's\n   Milford home hours before her mother found her body. Additionally, Michael Shuckerow, a neighbor of the victim at the time of her death, testified that he saw a vehicle similar to one owned by the defendant parked on the victim's street and driving near her address on May 18 and 19, 2006, between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. on both days. Shuckerow also made an in-court identification of the defendant as the individual operating the vehicle that he observed. Nicholas Yang, a forensic science examiner, also testified as a witness for the state regarding certain DNA evidence taken from the crime scene. Yang testified that the DNA evidence collected from the bathroom sink and toilet in the victim's home was either consistent with the defendant's DNA profile, or that his DNA profile could not be eliminated as a contributor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the challenged testimony was cumulative of Wydra's subsequent testimony and also corroborated other testimony presented to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   testimony that the defendant claims violated his right to\n   confrontation is Wydra's statement that \"[e]veryone we talked to at the car dealerships said that they had no\n   recollection of someone matching [the defendant's] description [visiting on May 19, 2006].\" The defendant does not challenge Wydra's testimony that \"I had explained to [the defendant] that\n   <em>\n    we had gone to these car lots and they said that they had not seen him.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) The challenged testimony is thus essentially cumulative of unchallenged testimony before the jury. Additionally, Wydra's testimony was consistent with the state's theory of the case and the testimony of Adams, Weaver, and Shuckerow, all of which provided a firm basis for the jury to doubt the defendant's version of events on May 19, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the state presented a strong case against the defendant, even if some of the evidence was circumstantial. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489325\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/506/#p137\">\n    325 Conn. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489325\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/506/#p137\">\n    156 A.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"[i]t is immaterial to the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial rather than direct evidence\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Because the victim's autopsy revealed that she died as a result of multiple stab wounds and blunt trauma to her head, the critical issue for the state was to establish the identity of the perpetrator. The state presented a strong case identifying the defendant as the perpetrator by demonstrating that he devised a plan to kill the victim, that he was in the area of or inside her home at approximately the time of her death, and that a distinct type of tape, to which he had access, was used in connection with her death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Having reviewed the record in its entirety, we conclude that Wydra's testimony that \"[e]veryone we talked to at the car dealerships said that they had no recollection of someone matching [the defendant's] description [visiting on May 19, 2006]\" had no discernible effect on the outcome of the trial. This testimony was largely cumulative, not essential to the state's case, and paled in comparison to other evidence connecting the defendant to the victim's murder. We conclude that any impropriety in admitting the challenged testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and, accordingly, the defendant's claim fails under the fourth prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendant's final claim is that the trial court committed plain error when it did not dismiss, sua sponte, the burglary in the first degree charge, which had been brought beyond the applicable statute of limitations. In response, the state argues that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and proven by the defendant at trial. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. The charge of burglary in the first degree stemmed from the victim's murder on May 19, 2006. A warrant for the defendant's arrest issued on August 24, 2012, and the defendant was arrested on September 5, 2012. Because burglary in the first degree is a class B felony, the five year statute of limitations applied and the charge against the defendant should have been brought by May 19, 2011.
