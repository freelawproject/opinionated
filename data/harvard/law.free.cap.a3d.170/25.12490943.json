Kelley sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder and lost control of his automobile, causing it to crash into two vehicles parked nearby.

Additionally, this court held that the petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim was procedurally defaulted because, at the time of trial and his direct appeal, he knew of the existence of the records that he claimed in his habeas petition were unlawfully withheld, and he could have raised the alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation at trial by requesting an evidentiary hearing on the potential\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   evidence or on direct appeal by raising a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim.

The habeas court appointed counsel for him. In his fifth amended petition, the petitioner set forth seventeen counts, four of which are relevant to this appeal. In count one, the\n   petitioner asserted that his habeas counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to allege that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request an evidentiary hearing, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , which would have revealed material, exculpatory impeachment evidence. Additionally, in count fourteen, the petitioner claimed that his habeas counsel\n   provided ineffective assistance by failing to allege that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to object to erroneous jury instructions, which prejudiced the petitioner's case. In count six, the petitioner asserted that his habeas counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to allege that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to \"raise the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation ....\" Additionally, in count seven, the petitioner claimed that his habeas counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to allege that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise a claim of prosecutorial impropriety because the prosecutor misstated evidence during closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 22, 2015, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Cobb, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment denying the petition. As to count one, the court found that the petitioner had failed to establish prejudice by proving that there was a reasonable probability that the result in his criminal trial would have been different. The court determined that further impeachment of Turner would not have added significantly to his cross-examination. On count fourteen, the court found that the jury instruction was appropriate and, therefore, the petitioner had failed to prove that his trial counsel's or his habeas counsel's performance was deficient or that he was prejudiced. As to count six, the court found that there was an inadequate record on direct appeal to raise a previously unraised\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the court\n   had already found that the petitioner failed to prove prejudice regarding the claimed\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation and that appellate counsel's decision to forgo such a claim was a strategic decision. Accordingly, the court denied this claim as to appellate counsel. Finally, on count seven, the court found that there was no evidence that appellate counsel could have satisfied the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   to prevail on a previously unraised claim of prosecutorial impropriety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the habeas court found that appellate counsel's decision to forgo this claim, which she considered weak, was a reasonable strategic decision and that the petitioner failed to establish that he would have prevailed on such a claim. Consequently, the court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Thereafter, the habeas court granted the petitioner certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"We begin with the applicable standard of review and the law governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims.

Specifically, the petitioner argues that the trial court's charge to the jury included the full statutory definition of \"acting intentionally,\" which included\n   the definitions for both specific and general intent. As the petitioner was charged only with specific intent crimes-two counts of assault in the first degree and one count of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree-he argues that the jury was allowed to find him guilty of specific intent crimes while utilizing the lower standard of general intent. Because this improper definition was repeatedly referred to throughout the jury charge, the petitioner argues that the jury was misled. We agree that it was improper for the trial court to have included the full statutory definition of intent but conclude that the petitioner was not harmed thereby or by habeas counsel's failure to raise that claim in the petitioner's first habeas proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim. The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \" Section 53a-59(a)(5) of the Connecticut General Statutes provides that a person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person by means of the discharge of a firearm....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"For you to find the [petitioner] guilty of this charge, the state must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the [petitioner] intended to cause physical injury to another person; (2) that the [petitioner] caused physical injury to that person; and (3) that he caused that injury by means of the discharge of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The state must first prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the [petitioner] intended to cause physical injury to another person. What the [petitioner] intended is a question of fact for you to determine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Our statutes provide that a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After setting forth the trial court's instruction on the elements of assault in the first degree and comparing it to the model jury instruction on the same charge, the habeas court found that the trial court's instruction was appropriate. The court therefore concluded that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proving that trial counsel's or habeas counsel's performance was deficient or that he was prejudiced by any deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The standard of review for claims of instructional impropriety is well established. \"[I]ndividual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. ... The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law....

By quoting the definition of \"intentionally\" contained in \u00a7 53a-3(11), the court gave instructions on both general intent-the intent to engage in conduct-and specific intent-causing a desired result. The court, thus, improperly provided a general intent instruction when the only crimes with which the petitioner was charged were specific intent crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nonetheless, we conclude that, despite the trial court's having improperly given the general intent instruction, it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled. In defining assault in the first degree as to count one, the trial court referred to the specific intent required by the first element. The trial court explained that to be guilty of assault in the first degree as an accessory, the petitioner must have had the same criminal intent required for assault in the first degree-intent to cause physical injury. Additionally, the court instructed that to be found guilty as an accessory, the petitioner must have intended to aid in the commission of assault in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In defining assault in the first degree in the second count, the trial court referred the jury to the elements of that crime and instructed that the state must have proven all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The first element of assault in the first degree, as explained to the jury, includes the intent to cause physical injury-specific intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In defining conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, the trial court explained that the state needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner agreed with one or more persons to engage in conduct constituting a crime. In explaining this first element of conspiracy, the trial court referred the jury to the elements of assault in the first degree. When the trial court instructed the jury on the third element of conspiracy-intent on the part of the petitioner that conduct constituting the crime be performed-the trial court explained that the state must have proven that \"the [petitioner] had the specific intent to violate the law when he entered into the agreement to engage in conduct constituting a crime.\" At this point, however, the trial court referred the jury to its previous instruction \"on the law pertaining to intent in [its] instructions on the first count.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We conclude that this case is akin to those in which our courts have determined that repeated proper instructions mitigated any harm caused by the improper general intent instruction, such that it is not reasonable to conclude that the jury was misled. In its instructions on the intent required for accessory to assault in the first degree, the trial court at least thirteen times referred to the specific intent required for assault and accessorial liability. The trial court referred the jury to its instruction on the elements of assault in the first degree, which included the specific intent to cause physical injury, five times in its instruction on the second count of assault in the first degree. In instructing the jury on\n   conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, the court at least four times explained that the jury must find that the petitioner had the specific intent to participate in a conspiracy and, by reference to the elements of assault\n   in the first degree, the specific intent to commit assault in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The trial court's jury instruction included more than twenty references to the specific intent required for the crimes charged in contrast with two improper uses of a general intent instruction.

In the present case, the court gave the erroneous instruction once and only once referred to it, whereas it gave or\n   referenced proper specific intent\n   instructions on more than twenty occasions.

The petitioner argues that the prosecutor's arguments in summation misrepresented the evidence presented at trial. He asserts that Turner testified that detectives pressured him to identify the petitioner as the driver of the car at the shooting scene. Consequently, the petitioner maintains that the prosecutor mischaracterized the facts in evidence when he argued that there was no evidence that the police pressured Turner into identifying the petitioner. We disagree with the petitioner's characterization of both Turner's testimony and the prosecutor's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. The habeas court found that \"[i]n late [1996],\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the petitioner was arrested and charged with a gang related drive-by shooting that occurred on November 24, [1996].\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Immediately after the shooting, while he was in the hospital, one of the victims, a member of the rival gang that was in the other vehicle, Kendall Turner, identified the petitioner as the shooter and was a key state's witness at the\n   criminal trial.... Due to [a] delay, the trial was not held in this case until December, 2002, six years after the shooting and the petitioner's arrest. Sometime prior to trial, Turner recanted his identification of the petitioner. The state then used his original statement at trial, under the\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The petitioner presented evidence to the habeas court that at his criminal trial, Turner testified as follows. After being shot, he and Kelley exited the car and proceeded on foot to the home of Turner's aunt. Law enforcement officers arrived at his aunt's home shortly thereafter, and he informed an officer who questioned him that there were three or four African-American males in a Sentra from which the shots were fired, but he did not know any of them and was unable to describe them further.

Although Turner's testimony may have indicated that law enforcement officers pressured him to make a statement, it did not indicate that they were feeding him information. His testimony suggested that law enforcement officers were trying to persuade him to give a statement, but Turner did not testify that the police told him\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   to say. His testimony indicated that law enforcement officers presented him with a photographic array and that he identified the petitioner from it. It was, therefore, a reasonable characterization of the evidence, his testimony included, that he was not told to identify the petitioner or that he was fed information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The evidence, thus, supports the habeas court's conclusion that appellate counsel made a reasonable strategic decision in choosing to forgo a meritless or weak claim of prosecutorial impropriety.
