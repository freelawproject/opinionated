Griffin, in her individual capacity, appeal from the judgment of strict foreclosure rendered\n   in favor of the substitute plaintiff, OneWest Bank, N.A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendants claim that the court erred in (1) concluding that the substitute plaintiff established a prima facie case of foreclosure and (2) rejecting their special defense and counterclaim sounding in breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In its December 10, 2015 memorandum of a decision, the trial court set forth the following facts. \"[Angela C.] Griffin [ (decedent) ] was the owner of the real property located at 312 Milton Road, Litchfield, Connecticut (property). On or about July 23, 2008, [the decedent] executed a note and reverse annuity mortgage (mortgage) on the [p]roperty in favor of Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation, [a predecessor in interest to the substitute plaintiff]. ... [The note and mortgage] established an open-ended line of credit not to exceed $692,180 ( [decedent's] loan). At that time, Financial Freedom [Senior Funding Corporation] advanced $378,791 to [the decedent] to pay off a loan from Deutsche Bank, which sought to foreclose on the mortgage it held on the property. Financial Freedom [Senior\n   Funding Corporation] obtained an appraisal at the time that valued the property at $612,709.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"[The decedent] ... entered into the loan so that [she] could remain in the home that she had lived in for thirty years. The property is a private property that includes a colonial residence located on eleven acres of land with a pond. It has a stable and many acres of well-maintained pasture. The home was a central part of [Ann Griffin's] and [the decedent's] lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Since the mortgage is a reverse annuity mortgage, no principal became due until a maturity event occurred. On April 16, 2010, [the decedent] passed away, which constituted a maturity event and rendered the balance of the loan due and payable unless there was an agreement in writing between the [named] plaintiff and certain legal representatives of [the decedent]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   within thirty days to cooperate fully in selling the property. The [named] plaintiff and the [executrix] had no agreement in writing to this effect, and the [executrix] did not pay the balance due upon [the decedent's] death. Thus, the nonpayment constituted a default under the mortgage. ... The [named] plaintiff initiated the present foreclosure action in May of 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"On April 30, 2010, prior to the notice of intent to foreclose, [Ann Griffin] contacted the [named plaintiff] to inform it that she intended to sell the property. The [named plaintiff's] electronic system notes indicate that [Ann Griffin] spoke with ... a maturities administrator .... They discussed repayment of the [decedent's] loan, and [Ann Griffin] indicated she planned to sell the property and use the proceeds of the sale to repay the debt. Subsequent to the conversation, [the maturities administrator] sent a cash account reverse mortgage repayment notice to [Ann Griffin]. The repayment notice informed [Ann Griffin] that the death of [the decedent] constituted a maturity event, that upon\n   the occurrence of a maturity event the loan became due, and that [Ann Griffin] needed to discuss plans with [the named plaintiff] concerning repayment of the loan by sending in the enclosed repayment questionnaire. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"On May 6, 2010, the defendant[s'] counsel faxed a correspondence, attaching the death certificate and will of [the decedent], and informing [the maturities administrator] that he was representing the defendant[s]. [Ann Griffin] was appointed executrix of [the decedent's] estate on May 17, 2010. [Ann Griffin] lacked legal authority to enter into contractual agreements on behalf of the estate until such time as she was appointed executrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"On or about June 17, 2010, the [executrix] entered into a listing agreement with [a realty company] for the sale of the property, with a listing price of $614,900 (listing agreement). On June 23, 2010, the defendant[s'] counsel sent a second correspondence to [the maturities administrator], which included the probate decree admitting the [decedent's] will to probate; a certified copy of the death certificate; a copy of the [decedent's] will; a certified probate certificate reflecting the appointment of [Ann Griffin] as executrix; and a signed copy of the listing agreement. The [named] plaintiff admitted to having received both written communications and attachments. The [named] plaintiff still had not received the repayment questionnaire .... There was no agreement in writing or any other communication that demonstrated a mutual understanding to extend the repayment date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to those facts expressly found by the trial court, the following supplemental facts, which also reasonably could have been found by the court, are relevant. Through a series of assignments and corporate restructurings, ownership of the decedent's loan changed several times. As previously explained, on July\n   23, 2008, the decedent executed a note and mortgage in favor of Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation, making it the original mortgagee and holder of the note. At the time the decedent executed the note in July, 2008, Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation was a subsidiary of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (IndyMac). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had been appointed as receiver for IndyMac prior to the decedent's execution of the note and mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March, 2009, OneWest Bank, F.S.B, through its parent company, IMB HoldCo, LLC, purchased from the FDIC certain IndyMac assets, including the decedent's loan. As part of that transaction, Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation executed an allonge to the note, specially endorsing\n   it to \"OneWest Bank, F.S.B.\" The named plaintiff in this action was formed during this transaction as a subsidiary of OneWest Bank, F.S.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At some point after it was assigned the note, OneWest Bank, F.S.B., executed an allonge to the note, endorsing it in blank. OneWest Bank, F.S.B., then transferred the note to the named plaintiff, which held it until transferring it back to OneWest Bank, F.S.B., around July, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around February, 2014, OneWest Bank, F.S.B., converted from a federal savings bank into a national banking association and, thus, became OneWest Bank, N.A., the substitute plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 3, 2015, which was slightly more than four years after this action was commenced, but before trial had begun, IMB HoldCo, LLC, the holding company of OneWest Bank, N.A., merged with CIT Group, the holding company of a bank called CIT Bank. As part of their holding companies' merger, OneWest Bank, N.A., and CIT Bank also merged. Specifically, \"CIT Bank ... merged\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   OneWest Bank, N.A.\" (Emphasis\n   added.) Although OneWest Bank, N.A., was the surviving entity of the merger with CIT Bank, OneWest Bank, N.A., as part of the merger, changed its name to \"CIT Bank, N.A.\" \"CIT Bank, N.A.,\" was never substituted for OneWest Bank, N.A., as the party plaintiff in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Having outlined the relevant substantive facts, we now review the pertinent procedural history. The named plaintiff commenced this action in May, 2011. As previously explained, the named plaintiff was a subsidiary of OneWest Bank, N.A., which was substituted as the plaintiff in this action on September 22, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to the substitution of OneWest Bank, N.A., for the named plaintiff, the defendants pleaded several special defenses. Relevant to this appeal is the defendants' special defense that the named plaintiff breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendants also filed a counterclaim against the named plaintiff sounding in breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Although the named plaintiff was removed from this action as a plaintiff by virtue of a substitution, it still is a party to the action as a counterclaim defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The case was tried to the court over the course of two days. At trial, the substitute plaintiff introduced the original note into evidence. Accompanying the note was an allonge specially endorsing the note to OneWest Bank, F.S.B., and an allonge wherein OneWest Bank, F.S.B., endorsed the note in blank. The substitute plaintiff also offered the testimony of Dion Kala, a vice president and foreclosure litigation manager employed by CIT Bank, N.A. In addition to working for CIT Bank, N.A., Kala also had been employed by OneWest Bank, N.A., as well as its predecessors in interest, including OneWest Bank, F.S.B., Financial Freedom Acquisition, LLC, and Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation. Kala provided testimony concerning the several\n   assignments and corporate restructurings that eventually brought the note into the possession of CIT Bank, N.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the substitute plaintiff had established a prima facie case of foreclosure and that the defendants had failed to meet their burden of proof on their special defense and counterclaim. The defendants filed a motion for articulation, asking the trial court to identify which plaintiff the court found owns the decedent's loan. In denying that motion, the court stated: \"The defendant[s] rais[e] a specious claim. The plaintiff is OneWest Bank, now known as CIT Bank, N.A., because of a legal name change.\" The court\n   rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure and set a law day. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   PRIMA FACIE CASE OF FORECLOSURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendants' first claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly concluded that the substitute plaintiff established a prima facie case of foreclosure. In particular, the defendants argue that the substitute plaintiff did not produce evidence sufficient to establish that it was the holder and owner of the note. According to the defendants, the substitute plaintiff's own evidence established that a \"separate and different legal entity\" is the owner and holder of the note. That is, as a result of a corporate merger in which the substitute plaintiff was involved after this action commenced, ownership of the note vested in a distinct entity that was never made a party to this action. Thus, the defendants argue, a nonparty entity, \"CIT Bank, N.A.,\" owns the note, and the substitute plaintiff does not. We disagree with the defendants and conclude that their argument is flawed both in fact and in law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review. \"A plaintiff establishes its prima facie case in a mortgage\n   foreclosure action by demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that it is the owner of the note, that the defendant mortgagor has defaulted on the note, and that conditions precedent to foreclosure have been satisfied. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"In order to establish a prima facie case, the proponent must submit evidence which, if credited, is sufficient to establish the fact or facts which it is adduced to prove. ... [W]hether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case [in a foreclosure action] is a question of law, over which our review is plenary.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v.

Thus, we limit our review of the relevant law to the principles governing the possession and ownership of promissory notes. \"Being the holder of a note satisfies the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating that it is the owner of the note because under our law, the note holder is presumed to be the owner of the debt, and unless the presumption is rebutted, may foreclose the mortgage .... The possession by the bearer of a note [e]ndorsed in blank imports prima facie [evidence] that he acquired the note in good faith for value and in the course of business, before maturity and without notice of any circumstances impeaching its validity. The production of the note [endorsed in blank] establishes [the possessor's] case prima facie against the makers and he may rest there. ... It [is] for the defendant to set up and prove the facts which limit or change the plaintiff's rights.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Although Connecticut banking law applies only to banks organized under Connecticut law; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-1 and 36a-2(12) ; it provides guidance for determining the impact of a merger of banking entities. As an initial matter, Connecticut banking law confirms the applicability of the National Bank Act to national banking associations. See\n   General Statutes \u00a7 36a-126(b) (in merger of banks resulting in national\n   banking association, resulting national banking association \"shall be considered the same business and corporate entity as the constituent Connecticut bank ... [and] as to rights, powers and duties [it] shall be a federal bank\"). With respect to a banking merger resulting in a Connecticut bank, Connecticut law provides that (1) \"the corporate existence of the constituent banks shall be continued by and in the resulting bank\"; (2) \"the entire assets ... of each of the constituent banks shall be vested in the resulting bank without any deed or transfer\"; (3) \"[n]o suit, action or other proceeding pending at the time of the merger ... before any court or tribunal in which any of such constituent banks is a party shall be abated or discontinued because of such merger ... but may be continued and prosecuted to final effect by or against the resulting bank\"; and (4) \"[t]he resulting bank shall have the right to use the name of any of the constituent banks ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 36a-125(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With federal and state banking law in mind, we seek additional guidance from the corporate law of this state and other jurisdictions relating to mergers and changes of name of\n   <em>\n    nonbanking\n   </em>\n   entities. In a merger of corporations governed by Connecticut law, \"[a]ll property owned by, and every contract right possessed by, each corporation that merges into the survivor ... vest[s] in the survivor without reversion or impairment.\" General Statutes \u00a7 33-820(a)(4). Furthermore, the \"name of the survivor\n   <em>\n    may, but need not be\n   </em>\n   , substituted in any pending proceeding for the name of any party to the merger whose separate existence ceased in the merger.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 33-820(a)(5). Regarding the effect of a Connecticut corporation's change of name, our law provides: \"An amendment to the certificate of incorporation\n   <em>\n    does not affect\n   </em>\n   ... a proceeding to which the corporation is a party\n   .... An amendment changing a corporation's name\n   <em>\n    does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the corporation in its former name\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 33-803.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Connecticut's corporate law is substantially similar to the provisions of the American Bar Association's Model Business Corporation Act; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Trevek Enterprises, Inc. v.

Indeed, the provisions of the Model Business Corporation Act relating to the effect of corporate mergers and changes of name are nearly identical to Connecticut law. See Model Business Corporation Act, \u00a7 11.07 (a), p. 11-89 (\"[A]ll property owned by, and every contract right possessed by, each corporation or eligible entity that merges into the survivor is vested in the survivor without reversion or impairment .... [Furthermore] the name of the survivor may, but need not be, substituted in any pending proceeding for the name of any party to the merger whose separate existence ceased in the merger ....\"); Model Business Corporation Act, \u00a7 10.09, p. 10-70 (\"An amendment to the articles of incorporation does not affect ... a proceeding to which the corporation is a party .... An amendment changing a corporation's name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the corporation in its former name.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mergers of corporations and mergers of limited liability companies are treated\n   similarly under Connecticut\n   law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Connecticut limited liability companies merge, \"[a]ny property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account ... and all other choses in action ... belonging to or due to each party to the merger ... vest[s] in the survivor without further act or deed.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 34-197(4). Furthermore, any \"proceeding pending by or against any limited liability company that was a party to the merger ... may be prosecuted as if such merger ... had not taken place, or the survivor may be substituted in the action.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 34-197(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Uniform Limited Liability Company Act similarly provides that \"all property of each merging entity vests in the surviving entity\" and that \"the name of the surviving entity may be substituted for the name of any merging entity that is a party to any pending action or proceeding ....\" Unif. Limited Liability Company Act \u00a7 1026 (a) (amended 2013), 6C U.L.A. 189 (2016). The rationale behind not requiring the\n   substitution of the surviving entity's name in a pending proceeding is that \"[s]uch a substitution has no substantive effect because, whether or not the survivor's name is substituted, the survivor succeeds to the claims of any party to the merger whose separate existence ceased as a result of the merger.\" Unif. Limited Liability Company Act \u00a7 1026 (a) (7), comment, supra, 6C U.L.A. 191. Regarding the change of a limited liability company's name, Connecticut law provides that \"amend[ing] the name set forth in [the] articles of organization ...

Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the court's determination was legally and factually correct. At trial, the substitute plaintiff, an entity called OneWest Bank, N.A., produced the decedent's note, which had been endorsed in blank. The note was admitted into evidence during the testimony of Kala, who, at the time, was working for an entity called CIT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Bank, N.A., and who previously had worked for the substitute plaintiff and the named plaintiff. Kala testified that the decedent's note currently was in the possession of \"CIT Bank, N.A.\" According to Kala, \"CIT Bank, N.A.\" was the name of the entity surviving the merger in which (1) CIT Bank merged\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   OneWest Bank, N.A., and (2) OneWest Bank, N.A., changed its name to \"CIT Bank, N.A.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, the evidence presented at trial revealed that the name of the entity holding the note, \"CIT Bank, N.A.,\" did not match the substitute plaintiff's name, \"OneWest Bank, N.A.\" As previously explained, this\n   discrepancy, which is the basis for the defendants' challenge to the substitute plaintiff's ownership of the note, was the result of a corporate merger during the pendency of the present action to which the substitute plaintiff was a party. Kala's uncontroverted testimony established that a bank called \"CIT Bank\" merged\n   <em>\n    into the substitute plaintiff\n   </em>\n   , which had been a national banking association prior to the merger. Thus, the type of entity surviving the merger also was a national banking association. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the substitute plaintiff's name and corporate identity caused by the merger, the trial court concluded that the substitute plaintiff was the holder and owner of the decedent's note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Our comprehensive review of federal and state banking law and state corporate law convinces us that the merger and change of name involving the substitute plaintiff did not affect its status as holder and owner of the decedent's note. Under the relevant federal and state authority, the merger to which the substitute plaintiff was party had the following consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the substitute plaintiff's corporate existence and identity continued in the resulting bank. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20215\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (2012) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.33\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(1) ; General Statutes \u00a7 36a-125(g).

Limited Liability Company Act \u00a7 1026 (a), supra, 6C U.L.A. 189.

See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2032\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-125(g), 33-820(a)(5), and 34-197(6) ; Model Business Corporation Act, supra, \u00a7 11.07 (a), p. 11-89; Unif. Limited Liability Company Act \u00a7 1026 (a) (7), comment, supra, 6C U.L.A. 191. Last, the substitute plaintiff could have substituted the resulting bank in this action, but it was not required to do so. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-125(g), 33-820(a)(5), and 34-197(6) ; Model Business Corporation Act, supra, \u00a7 11.07 (a), p. 11-89; Unif. Limited Liability Company Act \u00a7 1026 (a), supra, 6C U.L.A. 189. Thus, the substitute plaintiff's status as holder and owner of the note and this proceeding were not affected by the merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Similarly, the resulting bank's change of name affected neither this proceeding nor the substitute plaintiff's status as holder and owner of the note. As a matter of law, the change of name did not (1) create a new corporate entity; (2) alter the resulting bank's corporate identity, which merely was a continuation of the substitute plaintiff's corporate identity; (3) end the resulting bank's corporate existence, which merely was a continuation of the substitute plaintiff's corporate existence; or (4) divest the resulting bank of the substitute plaintiff's assets, which had vested in the resulting bank as a result of the merger.

Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly concluded that the substitute plaintiff established a prima facie case of foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   THE DEFENDANTS' SPECIAL DEFENSE AND COUNTERCLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The defendants' second claim is that the trial court erroneously found that\n   the defendants failed to meet their burden of proof with respect to their special defense and counterclaim sounding in breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, the defendants argue that a provision in the note executed by the decedent permitted the decedent's estate to avoid its obligation to repay the loan upon the decedent's death if it cooperated with the named plaintiff in selling the decedent's property. In light of that provision, the defendants contend, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied into the note required the named plaintiff, upon the decedent's death, to communicate with the executrix for the purpose of facilitating the sale of the decedent's property. Thus, according to the defendants, the named plaintiff breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it initiated a foreclosure action and filed a lis pendens instead of communicating with the executrix to facilitate such a sale. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of the defendants' second claim. In response to the named plaintiff's foreclosure complaint, the defendants filed a special defense\n   and a counterclaim alleging that the named plaintiff breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied into the note. In particular, the defendants predicated their theory of the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing on the provision in the note establishing the date on which repayment of the loan was due. That provision, \u00a7 6 of the note, provided in relevant part: \"All amounts owed under this Agreement become due and payable ... upon the first occurrence of a Maturity Event ... unless [the decedent] default[s] .... [The decedent] must repay the outstanding balance in one large or 'balloon' payment upon the occurrence of a Maturity Event or, if sooner, [when the decedent defaults].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Pursuant to that provision, the death of the decedent generally constituted a \"Maturity Event\" requiring immediate repayment of the loan. The provision also permitted, however, the named plaintiff and the decedent's estate to extend the repayment date upon the decedent's death: \"If [the decedent's] administrator, devisees, estate, executors, heirs, legatees or personal representative ... agree[s] with [the named plaintiff] in writing within thirty (30) days after the death of the [decedent] ... then repayment ... will not be due until six months after the death of the [decedent], or such other date as may be provided in that written agreement ....\" In the event that the parties entered such a written agreement, the decedent's estate also would have to promise in that agreement \"to cooperate fully with [the named plaintiff] in selling the Property, including listing the Property for sale, caring for the Property and making any necessary repairs to the Property prior to its sale ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With the relevant contractual provisions in mind, the thrust of the defendants' allegations in their special defense and counterclaim are as follows. Section 6 of the note provided that, upon the decedent's death, the\n   executrix had two options-immediately repay the loan or cooperate with the named plaintiff in selling the decedent's property. If the executrix elected the second option, repayment of the loan would not be due until six months after the decedent's death or on whatever date to which the parties agreed. The executrix elected to cooperate in selling the property. Specifically, she maintained the property, made repairs to the property, obtained appraisals of the property, and listed the property for sale with a real estate agency. Thus, since the executrix chose to cooperate with the named plaintiff in selling the property, the named plaintiff was not entitled to immediate repayment of the loan\n   and it had to communicate with the executrix to facilitate the property's sale. Failing to communicate with the executrix for that purpose, and instead filing a foreclosure action and a lis pendens, the named plaintiff failed to act in good faith and deal fairly with the executrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At trial, the parties introduced evidence of various correspondences that they had with each other following the decedent's death on April 16, 2010. On April, 30, 2010, the named plaintiff sent the decedent's estate a letter informing it that the \"loan is due and payable.\" On that same day, a telephone conversation, the contents of which were disputed by the parties, occurred between Ann Griffin and an employee of the named plaintiff. The testimony of the named plaintiff's employee, which was corroborated by tracking notes of the conversation maintained by the named plaintiff, indicated that she informed Ann Griffin that the estate had three months to repay the loan. Ann Griffin denied that the named plaintiff's employee informed her that the loan had to be repaid within three months. On May 6, 2010, the defendants' attorney sent the named plaintiff a copy of the decedent's death certificate and will. On June 23, 2010, the defendants' attorney sent the named plaintiff a copy of the probate court's decree, a probate\n   certificate reflecting Ann Griffin's appointment as executrix of the decedent's estate, and a copy of an agreement between the decedent's estate and a real estate agent to list and sell the decedent's property. On July 7, 2010, the executrix informed the named plaintiff that she had listed the decedent's property for sale. On July 21, 2010, the named plaintiff sent the executrix a Notice of Intent to Foreclose, requiring that she repay the loan within thirty days. On July 29, 2010, the defendants' attorney sent a letter to the named plaintiff responding to the named plaintiff's Notice of Intent to Foreclose. In that letter, the defendants' attorney warned that initiating foreclosure proceedings \"would constitute a patent breach of the contractual obligations\" because the loan agreement provided that \"repayment of the loan is not required until six months after the death of [the decedent],\" and the defendants \"fully cooperated ... as required by the [loan agreement].\" On August 6 and September 8, 2010, the executrix again called the named plaintiff, informing it that the property still was on the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The trial court concluded that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proof with respect to their special defense and counterclaim sounding in breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, it reasoned that the defendants' \"special defense and counterclaim ... [sought] to enforce nonexistent obligations under the [note].\" Moreover, it found that there was no written agreement between the named plaintiff and the defendants extending the repayment due date and that there was no meeting of the minds between the parties regarding a repayment extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With these additional facts in mind, we begin our analysis of the defendants' second claim by setting forth the relevant legal principles. \"[W]ith any issue of contract interpretation, we begin with the language of the\n   contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Poole v.

In construing that provision, the trial court concluded that it did not\n   <em>\n    obligate\n   </em>\n   the named plaintiff to extend the repayment due date. Our construction of that provision conforms to the trial court's construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Our plenary review of the relevant contractual language reveals the following. The provision first sets out a general rule: The death of the decedent is a maturity event that makes the loan immediately due and payable. It subsequently provides, however, an exception to that general rule: \"If [the decedent's estate] ... agree[s]\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    the named plaintiff\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    in writing\n   </em>\n   within thirty ... days after the [decedent's] death ... to cooperate fully with [the named plaintiff] in selling the Property ... then repayment ... will not be due until six months after the [decedent's] death ... or such other date as may be provided\n   <em>\n    in that written agreement\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the unambiguous language of the provision permits, but does not require, the parties to extend the repayment deadline\n   <em>\n    by entering into a separate written agreement\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The defendants' interpretation of the repayment provision belies the plain, unambiguous meaning of the provision's language. The defendants mistakenly construe the provision as granting the executrix a right to unilaterally extend the repayment deadline and as imposing upon the named plaintiff an obligation to honor the executrix's unilateral decision to extend the deadline. The provision guarantees no such right to the\n   executrix and imposes no such obligation on the named plaintiff. The fact that the provision uses the terms \"agree\" and \"agreement\" with respect to an extension indicates that such an extension can be created only by the parties'\n   <em>\n    mutual assent\n   </em>\n   . See Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) (defining \"agreement\" as \"manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons\" and \"agree\" as act of \"exchang[ing] promises\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thus, in the absence of a written agreement extending the deadline to allow the executrix to sell the decedent's home, the named plaintiff had no obligation to undertake any action facilitating the executrix's sale of the property, e.g., communicating with the executrix regarding the sale. As previously explained, the trial court found that there was no evidence that the parties entered into such a written agreement. After reviewing the record, we conclude that this finding is not clearly erroneous. Indeed, a review of all of the correspondences between the parties reveals that there is no document that fairly can be characterized as a written agreement wherein\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties agree to extend the repayment deadline. The record discloses that the executrix certainly represented to the named plaintiff that she was maintaining the property and planning on selling it, but it does not disclose that the named plaintiff agreed in writing to extend the repayment deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendants' special defense and counterclaim sounding in breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing must fail. The special defense and counterclaim are not predicated on a breach of an express term in the note;\n   <em>\n    Landry v. Spitz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038817\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/102/34/#p47\">\n    102 Conn.App. at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20A.2d%20334\">\n    925 A.2d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and the named plaintiff's conduct did not impair any contractual right of the decedent or her estate.\n   <em>\n    Capstone Building Corp. v.

That is, the note guaranteed no contractual right to an extension to sell the property, and, consequently,\n   the named plaintiff did\n   not breach the terms of the note by never agreeing to such an extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, since it properly never agreed to an extension, the named plaintiff was not obligated to take any action facilitating the executrix's sale of the property pursuant to a\n   <em>\n    nonexistent\n   </em>\n   extension agreement. In doing so, the named plaintiff retained its right under the note to receive immediate repayment of the loan upon the decedent's death. Thus, by initiating foreclosure proceedings and filing a lis pendens, the named plaintiff merely was enforcing\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   contractual rights, not acting in bad faith to impair the rights of the decedent and her estate. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly rejected the defendants' counterclaim and special defense based on a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    A brief explanation of the numerous parties involved in this action is necessary.

The successor in interest to Financial Freedom Acquisition, LLC, OneWest Bank, N.A., subsequently was substituted for Financial Freedom Acquisition, LLC. Although Financial Freedom Acquisition, LLC, was removed from this action as a plaintiff, it still is a party to the action as a counterclaim defendant.
