Finan Center, an in-patient psychiatric facility\n   under the management of the DOH, located in Allegany County. On the evening of March 3, 2015, Finan Center management learned of an incident involving Mihailovich and a patient that resulted in injury to the patient requiring medical treatment at a local hospital. Management determined that Mihailovich engaged in \"misconduct\" by failing to follow DOH-approved de-escalation techniques. On the next day-March 4-Mihailovich was placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation into the incident. The administrative leave extended from March 4 through March 17,\n   when Mihailovich was notified that he was to be suspended for 15 days without pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 30, 2015, Mihailovich noted a timely appeal to the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management. Following an unsuccessful settlement conference, the case was forwarded to the Office of Administrative Hearings. On July 27, 2015, a merits hearing was conducted, following which, on September 9, 2015, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a written decision reversing the suspension, and ordered back pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The DOH moved for reconsideration, challenging the ALJ's interpretation and application of SPP \u00a7 11-106(c), which was summarily denied. The DOH filed a request for judicial review of the ALJ's decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Following a hearing, the circuit court reversed the decision of the ALJ, thus reinstating the suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Within the context of the present appeal, \"[t]he decision of the Office of Administrative Hearings [was] the final administrative decision[,]\" SPP \u00a7 11-110(d)(3), and not that of the DOH or the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management.

It is important to note, however, that the issue presented in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   did not require an analysis of the 5-workday notice requirement; rather, as in\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   , it pertained to the degree of knowledge of misconduct that triggers the counting of those days. Additionally, because White's work schedule was Monday through Friday, inferably the same as the appointing authority, there was no need to address by whose schedule the 5-workday period is to be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Adhering to\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   , and considering the statute as a whole, we conclude that the term \"workday\" was intended to refer to that of the appointing authority for the purposes of calculating\n   the 5-workday notice period. As the Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   , each of the subsections are related, and should be read as such.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/\">\n    371 Md. at 143-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/\">\n    807 A.2d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, subsection (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides the requisite actions that an appointing authority must complete in order to take disciplinary action under either subsection (b) or (c). Subsections (b) and (c) both provide the timeframes within which the appointing authority must complete the actions in subsection (a) as a prerequisite to the imposition of a disciplinary action. Each subsection provides insight to the understanding of the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Of significance is the express language of the first clause in subsection (a): \"[b]efore taking\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   disciplinary action related to employee misconduct ....\" SPP \u00a7 11-106(a) (emphasis added). That language provides a strict limitation on the ability of an appointing authority to impose a disciplinary action, by prefacing any action with five prerequisites. In that regard, subsection (a) requires:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [A]n appointing authority\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   : (1) investigate the alleged misconduct; (2) meet with the employee; (3) consider any mitigating circumstances; (4) determine the appropriate disciplinary action, if any, to be imposed; and (5) give the employee a written notice of the disciplinary action to be taken and the employee's appeal rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Subsection (b) then provides the time frame for imposing any disciplinary actions, other than an unpaid suspension, by limiting the period to \"no later than 30 days after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct for which the disciplinary action is imposed.\" SPP \u00a7 11-106(b). Subsection (c), on the other hand, addresses the significantly shorter time period within which to impose an unpaid suspension, by providing the limitation of \"no later than 5 workdays.\" SPP \u00a7 11-106(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Our conclusion that the legislature intended \"workday\" to pertain to the appointing authority's schedule, not the employee's schedule, is supported by our consideration of the statute as a whole, then comparing the language of subsections (b) and (c). As we have noted, subsection (b) has no limitation on which days can be counted, or excluded from the\n   count, within the 30 day period. It is clear to us that the judicial interpretation that has been given to the 30-day requirements of 11-106(b) is that the 30-day investigatory period is measured in consecutive calendar days. It follows, then, that the 5-workday notice period of subsection (c) should likewise be measured in consecutive calendar days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In contrast, subsection (c) provides, effectively, two additional restrictions beyond the disputed \"workday\" limitation. First, counting does not commence until after the end of the employee's next shift following the appointing authority's knowledge of misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPP \u00a7 11-106(c)(1). Then, the succeeding provision expressly excludes weekends, legal holidays, and employee leave days from the calculation. SPP \u00a7 11-106(c)(2). Those two restrictions can be read in one of two ways; either, to put the focus on the employee's schedule, as DOH argues, or to allow the appointing authority more time to complete the requirements of subsection (a) by excluding days in which it would not be functioning, as well as the days the employee would be unavailable to meet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Additional support for our interpretation is found by examining the statutory history and legislative resources utilized in the drafting and enactment of the statute. Particularly useful in our consideration is the 1996 Task Force to reform the State Personnel Management System's\n   <em>\n    Report to the Governor\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Governor's Report\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    Report\n   </em>\n   \"), which was likewise discussed in part by the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   , as well as the ALJ in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Legislative History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The General Assembly, in 1920, enacted Md. Code, Article 64A-Merit Systems, Section 17 of which provided, in pertinent part: \"The appointing authority may for disciplinary\n   purposes suspend an employee[ ] [and] [e]very such suspension shall be without pay[.]\" 1920 Md. Laws, ch.41. The ostensibly unrestricted original statute regarding disciplinary suspensions has since evolved, as legislative enactments are wont to do, into what is now codified as SPP \u00a7 11-106(c). Article 64 saw many amendments, reorganizations and recodifications when, in 1993, it was repealed and reenacted as the State Personnel and Pensions Article. In the reenacted article, the disciplinary suspensions provisions-then codified under Title 9-added, for the first time, a time restriction on the imposition of a suspension. Section 9-403-Suspension Period-provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a suspension for disciplinary purposes: (1) Shall be served on consecutive days; and (2) Shall begin within 2 workdays from the close of the employee's next shift after: (I) The alleged infraction occurred; or (II) The appointing authority learned of the alleged infraction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   1993 Md. Laws, ch. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In 1994, that provision was further amended to substitute \"2 workdays\" for simply \"2 days\" and added a provision to allow an appointing authority five days for employees who are exempt from the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act overtime provisions. 1994 Md. Laws, ch. 466. The \"workday\" language was reinstated through the 1995 amendments with the introduction of the provision that excludes certain days from the calculation. 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 199. However, the current language of the disciplinary suspensions provisions of the statute did not appear in the statute until 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The codification of the 1996 State Personnel and Pensions-Division I.-State Personnel code was the product of an extensive effort to reform the entire Maryland State Personnel Management System.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   SPP \u00a7\u00a7 1-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The legislation grew out of a thorough investigation by the designated Task Force to Reform the State Personnel Management System that was established by Governor Parris N. Glendening by a June 1995 executive order, which charged the task force to\n   design a \"personnel management system that is more flexible, decentralizes personnel management functions, simplifies and streamlines personnel procedures and provides for the consistent application of personnel policies throughout a diverse State government.\" Exec. Order No. 01.01.1995.15, 46 (June 9, 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The efforts of the Task Force resulted in the enactment of the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996, through cross-filed House Bill 774 and Senate Bill 466, which rewrote and reorganized what are now the existing personnel management statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1996 Md.

That premise was later reinforced in the\n   <em>\n    Highlights of the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996\n   </em>\n   , a comprehensive published guide to understanding the changes in the State Personnel Management System as a result of the newly enacted Reform Act. Task Force to Reform State Personnel,\n   <em>\n    Highlights of the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996\n   </em>\n   (May 8, 1997).

Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and employee leave days do not count when calculating the five work day period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Report to the Governor\n   </em>\n   , 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The proposed legislation included requisite actions an appointing authority must take before a disciplinary suspension can be imposed, which was ultimately codified separately under SPP \u00a7 11-106(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In addition to the\n   <em>\n    Governor's Report\n   </em>\n   being circulated with the cross-filed Bills, the Department of Personnel submitted a written memorandum to the House Subcommittee on Personnel and the Deputy Legislative Officer, Richard A. Montgomery, III, and Acting Secretary of Personnel, Michael A. Glass, submitted written testimony before the Senate Finance and Budget and Taxation Committees (\"Glass and Montgomery testimony\"), in support of the proposed legislation. The memorandum and testimony each explain the key features of the proposed bill and the reasons for the proposed differences from the then-existing statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In particular, the memorandum from the Department of Personnel emphasizes the biggest changes to the disciplinary actions provisions of SPP \u00a7 11-106, by stating that \"[t]his provision provides for the first time that the appointing authority has to conduct its investigation within a certain amount of time for all cases of discipline.\"\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/\">\n    371 Md. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/\">\n    807 A.2d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It goes further to explain that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   imposes the general rule that the appointing authority has 30 days after acquiring knowledge of the misconduct to impose discipline. In cases where suspension is determined to be the appropriate penalty, the appointing authority has 5 work days following the close of business after the employee's next shift after acquiring knowledge to impose the suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The written testimony by Glass and Montgomery provides a more detailed explanation of the changes to the statute. Glass and Montgomery Testimony, Senate Fin. and Budget and Tax. Comms. (1996). The first noteworthy section of the written testimony addresses the proposed definitions and general provisions subtitles of Title 1, in which it \"[d]efines a day to mean a calendar day to eliminate confusion as to whether holidays and leave days are to be considered in calculating\n   time limits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Glass and Montgomery Testimony, 2. When viewing this definition in the context of the current SPP \u00a7 11-106(c), it is apparent that clarification was necessary to implement the express limitation of which days are to be counted, or excluded, under this provision of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The second section of import is the discussion of subtitle 1-Disciplinary Actions-of Title 11, which distinguishes the two types of disciplinary actions as conduct-related and performance-related. The dialogue about conduct-related discipline, as relevant here, provides that \"[i]n cases\n   of conduct related discipline, the proposal establishes a uniform 30 day time period in which management may investigate, meet with the employee, and impose discipline with one exception: to impose a disciplinary suspension, the appointing authority must act within 5 workdays.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As to conduct-related discipline, the testimony outlines the three step process for imposition of discipline by an appointing authority and the sequence of appeal rights of the employee. The first step addresses the appointing authority's obligations, providing that \"the appointing authority will determine the appropriate disciplinary action[,] [however,] [t]he appointing authority must first meet [sic] investigate the alleged misconduct, meet with the employee, and consider any mitigating evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In short, we glean the intent of the legislature to have \"workday\" pertain to the appointing authority's schedule. It is manifest throughout the extensive commentary that such was intended in the proposed bills which, as we have noted, were cross-filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    The Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   With that background, we address the respective positions taken by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   It is undisputed that the incident resulting in Mihailovich's suspension occurred in the evening on March 3, 2015 and that management, as the appointing authority, was immediately made aware of the situation, thus starting the clock. It is also undisputed that, pursuant to SPP 11-106, the commencement of the 5-workday counting period was to begin on March 5, the day following the end of Mihailovich's next shift on March 4. The point of contention rests solely in how the remaining four days are to be counted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mihailovich averred that, although the ALJ erred in counting the employee's workdays and in counting days that are expressly required to be excluded, the same result would have been reached had the count, and the statute, been properly interpreted and applied. He asserts that the \"workdays\" to be counted are those of the appointing authority. His construction of the counting requirement of the statute is that the days ought to have been counted as follows: (1) Thursday, March 5; (2) Friday, March 6; (exclude Saturday, March 7 and Sunday, March 8); (3) Monday, March 9; (4) Tuesday, March 10; (exclude Wednesday, March 11 as an employee holiday/leave day); and (5) Thursday, March 12. Thus, he concludes, the suspension should have been imposed no later than March 12; and, it having been ordered on March 17, was five days beyond the 5-workday limit. Mihailovich supported his interpretation by reference to the\n   <em>\n    Governor's Report\n   </em>\n   , as we have discussed. He proffered that the explanations in the\n   <em>\n    Report\n   </em>\n   focus on the appointing authority's timeframe in which to act, thereby concluding that it is the appointing authority's workday that is to be counted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We agree, as discussed above, and find his calculation to be an accurate reflection of which days were to be counted-or excluded-had the ALJ properly interpreted and applied the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mihailovich also highlights the statutory reference to \"workday\" rather than \"employee shift\" or \"employee workday.\" He elaborated on this point by concluding that the only logical reason for the statutory reference to the employee's work\n   shifts, is the intent that it be the triggering event to start the calculation. He argues that the purpose was so the 5-workday calculation does not commence until the day following the end of the employee's next shift, not the employee's current shift, thereby providing the appointing authority the use of the next full day to initiate the subsection\n   (a) requirements. He further claimed that the legislature's failure to include the term \"employee shift\" or distinguish \"workday\" from \"employee workday\" anywhere within the statute, further demonstrates the limited purpose for that language was to extend the time allotted for the appointing authority to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The DOH, however, argues that the same provision that commences the calculation \"following the close of the employee's next shift,\" places emphasis on the employee's schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPP \u00a7 11-106(c)(1). Further, the DOH points out that the succeeding provision expressly excludes employee leave days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPP \u00a7 11-106(c)(2). Thus, when an employee is on leave, that day should not be counted. The DOH also presented an alternative argument that since Mihailovich was immediately placed on paid administrative leave following the incident, those days should be excluded as \"employee leave\" days, as required for the 5-workday calculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The ALJ also utilized the\n   <em>\n    Governor's Report\n   </em>\n   in analyzing the statute. However, contrary to Mihailovich's understanding, and ours, the ALJ determined that the 5-day count should be based on the employee's workdays. Compounding that error, the ALJ also erroneously counted Saturdays and Sundays as well as the employee holiday of Wednesday, March 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such days are expressly required to be excluded from the count under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-106(c)(2). Those errors resulted in the ALJ's finding that the fifth day to be counted was Wednesday,\n   March 11. However, the ALJ then appears to have added a sixth day by concluding, without explanation, that \"[five] workdays following the close of the Employee's shift on Wednesday, March 4, would have been 11 p.m. on Thursday, March 12, 2015.\" (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the ALJ erred in the interpretation of \"workday\" and its application of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Hence, we hold that, under SPP \u00a7 11-106(c), once the appointing authority acquires knowledge of employee misconduct, it has five of the agency workdays to investigate, meet with the employee in question, consider any mitigating factors, determine the appropriate disciplinary action, and give written notice of the suspension and appeal rights, to the employee. The 5-workday period commences on the day following the end of the employee's next shift after the appointing authority acquires knowledge of the misconduct. The days to be excluded from the calculation are Saturdays, Sundays, employee leave days, and legal holidays as recognized by Maryland law. As in the case of the Thomas B. Finan Center, and other \"24/7\" agencies, the 5-day count would be five consecutive calendar days, subject to any such statutory exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Notwithstanding the ALJ's misinterpretation and misapplication of the statute, the determination that the DOH failed to timely impose an unpaid suspension was correct. Therefore, we reverse the order of the circuit court and remand with instructions that the circuit court issue an order affirming the ALJ's decision on grounds consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED;\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
