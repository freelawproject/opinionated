On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to convict him of one of the two counts of sexual assault in the second degree and all three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order, and (2) certain prosecutorial improprieties at trial deprived him of his right to a fair trial. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim is the defendant's daughter. The victim was born in Guatemala and lived there until July, 2010. In Guatemala, family members raised the victim and four of her siblings (Guatemalan siblings) while their parents, the defendant and A.N., and four younger siblings (American siblings) resided together in Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim remembered meeting the defendant for the first time in 2007, when she was approximately\n   ten years old. During that visit, the defendant began touching the victim in a sexually inappropriate manner. In the summer of 2010, the defendant arranged for two relatives to bring the victim, who was thirteen years old, to Connecticut illegally. Before she left Guatemala, the\n   defendant told her \"to get a shot for pregnancy, to avoid pregnancies ....\" Approximately two weeks after arriving in Connecticut, the defendant resumed his sexual abuse of the victim and compelled her to engage in various sexual acts, including penile-vaginal intercourse and fellatio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June, 2011, the Department of Children and Families (department) conducted an investigation into allegations that the defendant was physically abusing his son, one of the victim's American brothers. In January, 2012, the department conducted another investigation into domestic violence after the victim's brother told someone at school that the defendant had brandished a knife at home, threatened his mother, A.N., and cut A.N.'s leg with the knife. At about this time, the defendant returned to Guatemala for a planned visit. Because the department was concerned about the well-being of A.N. and her children upon the defendant's return from Guatemala, it helped A.N. secure new housing for herself and her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When the defendant learned of these events from relatives, he called A.N. to discuss the situation. Because A.N. was fearful of the defendant coming to her new residence when he returned to Connecticut, on March 2, 2012, she applied for and was issued a two week, ex parte restraining order against the defendant, which protected herself and her children in Connecticut. On March 5, 2012, the defendant received in-hand marshal service of the ex parte restraining order. On March 15, 2012, after a hearing, A.N. was issued a six month restraining order (temporary restraining order) against the defendant, which protected herself and her children in Connecticut. While the ex parte restraining order and the temporary restraining order (collectively, restraining orders) were in effect, the defendant continued to communicate with the victim in a manner that violated these orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the department became involved with the victim's family in January, 2012, it referred the family to Altagracia Lara, an intensive family preservation clinician with Catholic Charities. During her conversations with the victim, Lara became concerned about the victim's relationship with the defendant and called the victim's pastor, Lourdes Lopez, and encouraged her to talk to the victim. On April 8, 2012, Lopez noticed that the victim was crying after church services and approached her to determine what was wrong. When the victim was not being responsive, Lopez brought the victim into her office, encouraged the victim to tell her what was wrong, and reassured the victim that she could trust her. The victim told Lopez that the defendant was physically and sexually abusing her. Lopez drove the victim home so they could speak with A.N. about her disclosure, and she called Lara, who reported the allegation to the department. The next morning, April 9, 2012, A.N. and Lara brought the victim to the police station to report the sexual abuse. After providing a written statement to the police, the victim was examined by a forensic pediatrician. The pediatrician found \"very deep notches\" in the victim's hymen, which was consistent with vaginal penetration and, after a second examination, diagnosed the victim with a sexually transmitted infection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant was subsequently charged in two informations, one alleging, inter alia, that he sexually abused the victim, and one alleging that he violated the\n   restraining orders. In the operative sexual assault information, the defendant was charged with three counts of sexual assault in the second degree and three counts of risk of injury to a child. In the operative restraining order information, the defendant was charged with three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order. After a joint trial on both informations, the jury found the defendant guilty of two counts\n   of sexual assault in the second degree, two counts of risk of injury to a child, and three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order. The jury found the defendant not guilty of one count of sexual assault in the second degree and one count of risk of injury to a child. The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of forty years of imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-five years, followed by twenty-five years of probation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin with the defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to convict him of one count of sexual assault in the second degree based on fellatio and three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support all of the defendant's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"We note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining\n   whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Finally, [a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt ... nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [finder of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal.... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact's] verdict of guilty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crespo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%201\">\n    317 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16-17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%20447\">\n    115 A.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant first claims that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support his conviction of sexual assault in the second degree based on fellatio. In particular, the defendant argues that the state failed to prove that his penis penetrated the victim's mouth because the victim's testimony was too ambiguous concerning whether penetration occurred. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. In count five of the sexual assault information, the state alleged, in relevant part, that \"between July, 2010, and January, 2012, the [defendant] engaged in sexual intercourse with another person, [the victim], by having said person perform an act of fellatio upon him ....\" With respect to the charge of sexual assault in the second degree that was based on fellatio, the state engaged in the following colloquy with the victim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And could you just indicate to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what you remember?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[The Victim]: He asked me to do oral sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And what do you remember about that specific event, if you can just tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[The Victim]: Always with threats.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: The actual incident itself, could you describe the incident itself, could you describe the incident?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[The Victim]: He made me put my mouth in his penis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: I'm sorry.

How about your lips?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[The Victim]: Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"A person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and ... [s]uch other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than three years older than such other person ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71(a)(1). The definition of \"sexual intercourse\" includes \"fellatio ... between persons regardless of sex....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65(2). \"Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete ... fellatio and does not require emission of semen....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65(2). When analyzing our Penal Code's definition of penetration, our Supreme Court has observed: \" 'Penetration' is defined as 'the act or process of penetrating,'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   and 'penetrate' means 'to pass\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   or through' or 'to extend\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    interior\n   </em>\n   of ....' \" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"967044\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/256/517/#p532\">\n    256 Conn. 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=779%20A.2d%20702\">\n    779 A.2d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).

Sexual acts that do not involve the defendant's penis entering the victim's mouth, such as the act of licking a penis, are insufficient to prove penetration because licking \"involves\n   <em>\n    extending\n   </em>\n   the tongue\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   the mouth, not\n   <em>\n    inserting\n   </em>\n   the penis\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   the mouth.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=779%20A.2d%20702\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove that the defendant's penis entered into the victim's mouth to some degree, however slight. The victim testified that the defendant \"asked [her] to do oral sex,\" i.e., \"he forced [her] to put [her] mouth on his penis,\" and she responded affirmatively when the prosecutor asked her if, in doing so, the defendant's penis penetrated her lips. On the basis of this testimony, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the victim performed fellatio on the defendant and that during the course of performing fellatio the defendant's penis passed into her mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendant disagrees, arguing that the victim's testimony that his penis did not penetrate her mouth rendered her testimony concerning penetration too ambiguous as a matter of law to support his conviction. In particular, the defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4745368\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/319/84/#p90\">\n    319 N.C. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20S.E.2d%20424\">\n    352 S.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).

Id., at 89-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20S.E.2d%20424\">\n    352 S.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At trial, the only evidence of anal penetration was the seven year old victim's testimony that the defendant \" 'put his penis in the back of me.' \" Id., at 90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20S.E.2d%20424\">\n    352 S.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although a physical examination of the victim \"revealed a broken hymen and a genital rash that appeared to be a yeast infection\"; id., at 86,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20S.E.2d%20424\">\n    352 S.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the examining physician testified that he found no evidence of anal intercourse.

The North Carolina Supreme Court concluded: \"Given the ambiguity of [the victim's] testimony as to anal intercourse, and absent corroborative evidence (such as physiological or demonstrative evidence) that anal intercourse occurred, we hold that as a matter of law the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=352%20S.E.2d%20424\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendant argues that this case is analogous to\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   because the victim's negative response to the prosecutor's question about whether \"he actually penetrate[d] your mouth\" and affirmative response to the prosecutor's question-\"How about your lips?\"-rendered her testimony concerning penetration too ambiguous as a matter of law to support his conviction. We disagree. The victim, who was testifying with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter, might simply have misunderstood the prosecutor's first question, and her misapprehension might have been apparent in her demeanor, as observed by the jury, when responding to the prosecutor's questions. In reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims, \"[w]e do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record.... Rather, we must defer to the jury's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3145500\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/274/790/#p800\">\n    274 Conn. 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=877%20A.2d%20739\">\n    877 A.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). \"It is ... the absolute right and responsibility of the jury to weigh conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses....

Prior to responding to the prosecutor's questions about penetration, the victim testified that the defendant \"asked me to do oral sex\" and that \"he forced me to put my mouth on his penis.\" The jurors, on the basis of their common sense and life experiences, could have reasonably inferred that the seventeen year old victim understood what oral sex under these circumstances ordinarily involves, i.e., a man's\n   penis entering someone's mouth. The jurors also reasonably could have inferred that when she stated that she put her mouth\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   the defendant's penis-in direct response to the prosecutor's request for specific details about the time she performed oral sex on the defendant-that she did more than simply place the lips of her mouth against the defendant's penis. That is, she placed her mouth on the defendant's penis in a manner that caused his penis to enter into her mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the defendant's conviction of sexual assault in the second degree based on fellatio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support his conviction of three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order because the state failed to prove (1) that the restraining orders applied to the victim or (2) that he knew the parameters of the restraining orders. The defendant further claims that the state failed to prove that he sent the victim a letter while either of the restraining orders were in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to these claims. The defendant was in Guatemala from January, 2012, into early March, 2012. On March 2, 2012, A.N. was issued an ex parte restraining order against the defendant in anticipation of his imminent return to the United States. The ex parte restraining order identified A.N. as the \"Protected Person\" and prohibited the defendant from, inter alia, contacting \"the protected person in any manner, including by written, electronic or telephone contact ....\" With respect to the couple's minor children, the ex parte restraining order (1) stated that \"[t]his order also protects the protected person's minor children\"; (2) awarded temporary custody of the couple's minor children to A.N.; and (3) denied the defendant visitation rights. The order listed the names and birthdays of the couple's five minor children residing in the United States, including the victim. The order also stated that a hearing was scheduled for March 15, 2012, at 9:30 a.m., the same day that the ex parte restraining order expired. The defendant received in-hand marshal service of the ex parte restraining order on March 5, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On March 15, 2012, A.N. was issued a temporary restraining order against the defendant after a hearing. The temporary restraining order identified the protected person as A.N. and prohibited the defendant,\n   inter alia, from contacting \"the protected person in any manner, including by written, electronic or telephone contact ....\" With respect to the couple's minor children, the temporary restraining order stated that (1) \"[t]his order also protects the protected person's minor children,\" and (2) the defendant may have \"[w]eekly supervised visits with [the] children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The terms of the temporary restraining order were reviewed with the parties during the temporary restraining order hearing. Specifically, at the temporary restraining order hearing, the defendant was present and represented by Attorney Thomas Wolff. At the beginning of the hearing, the defendant consented to having an employee from the department serve as a Spanish language interpreter. Additionally, Wolff informed the court that he was fluent in Spanish and that he would ensure that his client, the defendant, understood what was being said during the proceeding. Wolff then stated that he and the victim advocate had reviewed the proposed temporary restraining order with the defendant and that they had answered all of the defendant's questions about the proposed order. Wolff represented that\n   the defendant was no longer contesting the temporary restraining order. Thereafter, the court engaged in the following colloquy with the victim advocate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"The Court: I told you what was going to be the tenor of my orders, and I asked you to see if you could work out particulars just so that I don't enter something impractical for the parties. Were you able to do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. Why don't you tell me the essence of what you've worked out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: What we've agreed upon is that it would be considered a no contact restraining order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"The Court: As far as mom is concerned?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: As far as mom is concerned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"The Court: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate:\n   <em>\n    Contact with the kids\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    be limited to weekly supervised visits.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"The Court:\n   <em>\n    Contact with minor children weekly, supervised.\n   </em>\n   Yes ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: He would like to visit them as soon as possible, so next week would be the only option available. I provided him with the number, and they both agreed on third party contact regarding the children be made through either [S.G.] or [C.T.].\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   After further discussion concerning the terms of the order, Wolff agreed with the terms of the order as summarized by the victim advocate. He also reminded the court that the order would pertain only to the defendant and A.N.'s children who resided in the United States, and the court agreed that it had no jurisdiction over the children in Guatemala. The court then instructed the defendant as follows: \"So, with that in mind, I am going to order a temporary restraining order. Now, as to [A.N.] and the five children, sir, you are not to assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, interfere with or stalk. You are to stay away from the home of [A.N.], or wherever she's residing, and you're not to contact her in any manner. As far as the children are concerned,\n   <em>\n    you can have contact with your children, but for now we need it supervised. It's to be weekly and supervised\n   </em>\n   .... Any contact that you need to have with your wife, or that your wife needs to have with you, will go through a third party, either [S.G.] or [C.T.].\" (Emphasis added.) Thereafter, the defendant began supervised visits with all of his American children except the victim, who refused to attend these visits. The victim testified that\n   the defendant persisted in his attempts to contact her, however, by phone and by sending her messages through her siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In the operative restraining order information, the defendant was charged with three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order. Count one alleged, in relevant part: \"[The defendant] contacted [the victim] in violation of a restraining order .... [The defendant] had knowledge of the restraining order and contacted [the victim] by text message on March 28, 2012 ....\" Count two alleged, in relevant part: \"[The defendant] contacted [the victim] in violation of a restraining order .... [The defendant] had knowledge of the restraining order and contacted [the victim] by text message on April 10, 2012 ....\" Count three alleged, in relevant part: \"[The defendant] contacted [the victim] in violation of a restraining order .... [The defendant] had knowledge of the restraining order and contacted [the victim] by letter between March 5, 2012, and April 10, 2012 ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At trial, the ex parte restraining order, the temporary restraining order, and a redacted portion of the transcript from the temporary restraining order hearing were entered into evidence. The victim testified that after the restraining orders were issued, the defendant continued to call her and send her text messages on a regular basis but she typically ignored his calls and deleted his text messages. She stated that she specifically recalled receiving a text message from the defendant in March, 2012, because she reported that text message to the police. The victim further explained that she eventually changed her cell phone number in order to avoid the defendant's attempts to contact her. In April, 2012, however, the victim stated that one of her brothers brought her a letter and a new cell phone from the defendant. The victim identified the handwriting in the letter as the defendant's handwriting. She also\n   stated that she received a text message from the defendant on the cell phone that he provided her on April 10, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Lara, the family's intensive family preservation clinician, also testified concerning the defendant's efforts to contact the victim while the temporary restraining order was in effect. Lara stated that on March 28, 2012, she went with the victim to the police station to report a text message the defendant sent the victim earlier that day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Lara testified that when she went with the victim and A.N. to the police station to report the defendant's sexual abuse on April 9, 2012, they brought the letter that the defendant sent the victim, which she translated from Spanish into English at the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the translated letter, which was admitted into evidence, the defendant references watching the victim leave church and go to \"Denis dinner\" with her friends. The defendant warns the victim that her church friends are taking advantage of her. He repeatedly pleads with the victim to call him, text message him, or meet with him, and he references providing her with a new cell phone. The defendant also states: \"I don't have any issues with you, all the nice things you used to say and now you are saying other things.\" The defendant proceeds to ask the victim \"to forgive me, if you want to be in God's mercy forgive me, and if not go ahead and live with resentment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To convict a defendant of criminal violation of a restraining order, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a restraining order was issued against the defendant and that the defendant, having knowledge\n   of the terms of the order, contacted a person in violation of the order. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223b(a)(2)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20527\">\n    151 Conn.App. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534-35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20A.3d%201201\">\n    95 A.3d 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), appeal dismissed,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20564\">\n    320 Conn. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20A.3d%20729\">\n    132 A.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (certification improvidently granted). The defendant claims that the state failed to prove that the restraining orders applied to the victim, that he knew that the restraining orders prohibited him from contacting the victim, and that he sent the victim the letter during the effective periods of the restraining orders. We address each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The defendant first claims that the state failed to prove that the restraining orders applied to the victim. We disagree. Although the restraining orders identified A.N. as the protected person, they also stated that the order \"protects the protected person's minor children,\" i.e., the victim\n   and her American siblings. In addition, at the temporary restraining order hearing, the court specifically informed the defendant that, although he could have some contact with his children, that contact was going to be limited to weekly, supervised visits. Viewing this evidence as we must, in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to prove that the restraining orders prohibited the defendant from contacting the victim outside of their weekly, supervised visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The defendant next claims that there was no evidence presented at trial that he knew the terms of the restraining orders because they were in English and he speaks Spanish. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to prove that the defendant knew the terms of the temporary restraining order, and, as a result, there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the defendant's conviction of three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order. At the temporary restraining order hearing, Wolff represented that he was\n   fluent in Spanish and that he and the victim advocate had reviewed the terms of the proposed order with the defendant and answered all of his questions concerning its terms. In addition, the court advised the defendant through the agreed upon Spanish language interpreter that his contact with his children would be limited to weekly, supervised visits for the time being. Finally, the fact that the defendant asked the victim's brother to bring her the letter and new cell phone rather than delivering these items to the victim himself suggests that the defendant knew that he could not have contact with the victim outside of their weekly, supervised visits, which the victim was refusing to attend. As a result, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant knew that the temporary restraining order prohibited him from contacting the victim outside of their weekly, supervised visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   It is unclear, however, whether there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the terms of the ex parte restraining order prohibited him from contacting the victim. On the one hand, the defendant appears to have understood the ex parte restraining order enough to know that he needed to attend the March 15, 2012 hearing; in fact, he brought counsel to that hearing. On the other hand, there was no evidence presented at trial that the defendant, a Guatemalan native, was able to read and write in English. Indeed, throughout the restraining order and criminal proceedings, the defendant required the assistance of a Spanish language interpreter. The defendant's text messages that were entered into evidence were all in Spanish, and the victim testified that the defendant only \"knew a little bit\" of English. In addition, there was no evidence presented at trial that Wolff or anyone else translated the terms of the ex parte restraining order for the defendant. Nevertheless, even if there were an inadequate\n   evidentiary basis for determining that the defendant knew the terms of the ex parte restraining order, we would still conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the defendant's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Counts one and two of the restraining order information pertain to conduct that occurred during the effective period of the temporary restraining order, not the ex parte restraining order. The conduct alleged in count three does encompass the effective periods of both restraining orders, but there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to prove that the defendant sent and the victim received the letter during the effective period of the temporary restraining order. First, the defendant\n   sent the victim the letter through her brother. The defendant was not authorized to visit his children after the ex parte restraining order was issued and before the temporary restraining order authorized supervised visits. Therefore, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the victim's brother obtained the letter from the defendant during one of their supervised visits after the temporary restraining order was issued. In addition, the victim testified that she received the letter from her brother around April, 2012, and the jury could have reasonably inferred from that that the victim's brother, who lived with the victim, provided the victim with the letter shortly after receiving it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also was established at trial that, after the temporary restraining order was issued, the victim refused to attend her supervised visits with the defendant and changed her cell phone number to stop the defendant from contacting her. In his letter, the defendant repeatedly pleads with the victim to contact or meet with him, and, with the letter, the defendant sent the victim a new cell phone. The jury reasonably could have inferred that these pleas were in direct\n   response to the victim's refusal to answer his calls and text messages or to attend their supervised visits. Similarly, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the reason the defendant was providing the victim with a new cell phone was that he was presently unable to reach her by phone because he did not have her new cell phone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mindful as we are that in determining the sufficiency of the evidence we must consider its cumulative effect and construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we determine that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the defendant's conviction of criminal violation of a restraining order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We next address the defendant's claims of prosecutorial impropriety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly bolstered the credibility of two state's witnesses on direct examination and redirect examination. The defendant also claims that during closing argument the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of the victim, attempted to create sympathy for the victim and thereby injected extraneous matters into the trial, and referred to facts not in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We review claims of prosecutorial impropriety under a two step analytical process. \"We first examine whether prosecutorial impropriety occurred.... Second, if an impropriety exists, we then examine whether it deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.... In other words, an impropriety is an\n   impropriety, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial. Whether that impropriety was harmful and thus caused or contributed to a due process violation involves a separate and distinct inquiry.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fauci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951023\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/23/#p32\">\n    282 Conn. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=917%20A.2d%20978\">\n    917 A.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).

The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly asked the victim on direct examination, \"are you making this stuff up,\" and, \"[h]as anybody put you up to testifying the way that you have testified here today in court?\" The defendant also claims that the prosecutor\n   improperly asked Pastor Lopez on redirect examination whether she was telling the truth about why she talked to the victim about her relationship with the defendant on April 8, 2012. We conclude that these claims are evidentiary in nature and, therefore, unreviewable under the prosecutorial impropriety framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to these claims. The defense's theory of the case at trial was that the victim fabricated the sexual abuse allegations because A.N. had a new boyfriend and wanted to divorce the defendant, because the victim resented the defendant asking her to babysit her younger siblings and to perform household chores, and to obtain \"U-Visas\" for herself, A.N., and her Guatemalan siblings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the end of direct examination, the prosecutor engaged in the following colloquy with the victim:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: [\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    re you making this stuff up?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"[The Victim]: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]:\n   <em>\n    Has anybody put you up to testifying the way that you have testified here today in court?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"[The Victim]: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: In your own words, why are you doing it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"[The Victim]: Because I wanted to get out of the life that I had with him.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The following day, Pastor Lopez testified about her relationship with the victim and the victim's disclosure that the defendant was sexually abusing her. On direct examination, Lopez testified that she planned to ask the victim about her home life prior to seeing the victim crying after church on April 8, 2012, because she and\n   her husband were troubled by the victim's behavior. Lopez explained that she specifically chose to approach the victim on\n   April 8, 2012, \"[b]ecause I realized that she was very weak, and I felt that that was the right time to talk to her and see if we could help her out.\" On cross-examination, defense counsel confronted Lopez concerning the reason she decided to talk to the victim about her father. In relevant part, defense counsel engaged in the following colloquy with Lopez:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: And you said this was a decision on your own [i.e., to talk to the victim about her father]?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"[Lopez]: Oh, you're just trying to confuse me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Do you know a woman named Altagracia-Altagracia Lara?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"[Lopez]: Yes.

We conclude that no improprieties occurred during closing argument.\n   The following additional facts are relevant to these claims. During closing argument, both parties focused on the victim's credibility and motivation in making these allegations. In relevant part, the prosecutor made the following remarks during his opening argument, the emphasized portions of which the defendant now challenges: \"So, I'm making the argument to you that the attacks on her credibility fall flat. And this creates a problem for the defense. What it does is sort of this, you have this original statement by her, this story which is a compelling story. And then you look to undermine it. And when you look to undermine it what you find out is that the attacks don't really hold much weight. So we engage this thought exercise assuming that he's-that she's dishonest but we find out she's really not based upon her analysis of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \"So the failure of those-the failure of-we can sort of rule out dishonesty. We've sort of done that. The fabrications-what I'm trying to say is that if we can rule out dishonesty and we can rule out all of those things this sort of strengthening her claim that this [is] a true claim, because that's the only thing that's left. There's an old problem-solving rule it's called Occam's razor, but what it says is, when you have competing hypotheses to try to explain something the simplest explanation is always the best. Why complicate it, why not take [the victim's] words at their face value?\n   <em>\n    She is saying that she is the victim of incest because she was the victim of incest.\n   </em>\n   It's not complicated, it's simple. It is just what it appears to be. We don't have to engage in these convoluted attacks on her credibility in order to establish the basic premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \"Consider this,\n   <em>\n    if a young girl such as\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    the victim\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    wanted to fabricate a lie, is this the lie they would fabricate?

But I think the evidence shows you that [the victim's] testimony has endured, it's remained intact in the core. When the defense was questioning [the victim], and this is important, when they questioned her, and they cross-examined her for [a] long time, they asked her not one question about the events in this house.

And I, remember-I want you to sort of fix in your mind the image of [the victim] and the type of person she was, and the credibility she ejected as a human being. And I want you to fix that in your mind and think about what the judge has to say about the credibility.\n   <em>\n    And while you're reflecting on her as a young lady, I want you to consider her honesty as it appears through her testimony\n   </em>\n   and the way she testified.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defense counsel began his closing remarks by returning to his theme that the victim fabricated these allegations because A.N. had a new boyfriend and wanted to divorce the defendant, because the victim resented the defendant asking her to babysit her younger siblings and to perform household chores, and to obtain U-Visas for herself, A.N., and her Guatemalan siblings. Defense counsel also argued extensively about why, on the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury should not credit the testimony of the victim and other state's witnesses. During rebuttal argument, the prosecutor briefly responded to various points made by defense counsel. He then concluded his argument by making the following remark, the emphasized portion of which the defendant now challenges: \"Fabrication, this is how it works; once again, we get right back to the ultimate issue is, are they [the victim and A.N.] telling the truth or are they fabricating this?\n   <em>\n    I would argue to you that they were truthful when they testified\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    here.\n   </em>\n   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \"[P]rosecutorial [impropriety] of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments....

During his closing argument, the prosecutor argued in detail why the substance of the victim's testimony, her demeanor on the witness stand, and the sum of the evidence presented at trial supported a finding that the victim was not fabricating these allegations as the defendant suggested. In making these arguments, the prosecutor repeatedly admonished the jurors to listen carefully to the court's instruction on credibility and to rely on their common sense, their life experiences, and the evidence presented at trial when making their credibility determinations. When the disputed remarks are viewed in the context of the prosecutor's entire argument, therefore, it becomes clear that the prosecutor was not expressing his personal opinion about the victim's credibility with these remarks but rather was appealing to the jurors' common sense and inviting them to draw the conclusion\n   on the basis of a rational appraisal of the evidence presented at trial that the victim was not fabricating these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor did not express an improper personal opinion concerning the victim's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The defendant next challenges three remarks that the prosecutor made during his opening argument that he claims were improper attempts to create sympathy for the victim and thereby inject extraneous matters into the trial.

Instead, the prosecutor was asking the jurors to use their common sense to infer that the victim's testimony was more credible because of the hardships she has endured as a result of bringing and maintaining her allegations against the defendant, such\n   as invasive medical examinations and embarrassing conversations with strangers and family members about being sexually assaulted on several occasions by her father. Our Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that this type of argument is permissible and does not constitute an improper appeal to emotions.

And after all that, I am arguing to you that this evidence shows she's not fabricating these things. Defense focused on all of the supposed reasons she's fabricating these claims except for one. There's one they left out. And [the victim] was asked about this, she was asked, [the victim], she was sort of asked, you know, why are you saying these things about your father. And here's what she said, I had to get out of the life I had with him. If you were in her position, would you feel the same way?

We first observe that the court never precluded the admission of constancy of accusation testimony; it merely ordered that such testimony had to be admitted in accordance with our rules on the admissibility of constancy evidence. In addition, the state never offered any constancy evidence. Nonetheless, to the extent that the defendant attempts to raise a separate claim of prosecutorial impropriety on the basis of the prosecutor's purported violation of an evidentiary ruling by the court, we conclude that such a claim is inadequately briefed.

I also agree with the result reached in part I B of the majority opinion and generally with the reasoning contained therein, particularly in light of the specific manner in which the defendant, Elmer G., on appeal has challenged his conviction of three counts of criminal violation of a restraining order. I write separately to set forth my concerns regarding the ambiguity created by the court,\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., when it issued the restraining order of which the defendant was convicted of violating, and what I see as an anomaly in our jurisprudence regarding the degree of clarity that such orders must have in order to convict a defendant of violating them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Although the majority opinion adequately sets forth the facts that support the defendant's conviction of the three counts of violating a restraining order, I nevertheless reiterate some of those facts that I believe deserve emphasis. First, both the ex parte restraining order and the later temporary restraining order identified A.N. as the \"protected person\" and expressly prohibited the defendant from contacting \"the protected person\" in any manner, including having no \"written, electronic or telephone contact ....\" Although the orders also awarded temporary custody of the defendant's minor children to A.N., denied the defendant regular visitation rights, and provided that the orders \"also [protect] the protected person's minor children,\" neither\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   indicates that the prohibitions against written, electronic, and telephone contact with the protected person were to apply equally to the minor children, although such an interpretation certainly is not an unreasonable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   To the extent that the written temporary restraining order was clear, the March 15, 2012 hearing on that order created, in my view, uncertainty as to its scope. The order, as described on the record, again identified the protected person as A.N. There is no ambiguity that the defendant was prohibited from contacting \"the protected person in any manner, including by written, electronic or telephone contact ....\" A review of the transcript of the hearing further demonstrates that the court and the parties were in agreement that the order would constitute a no contact restraining order\n   <em>\n    with respect to A.N\n   </em>\n   . The precise scope of the order with respect to the children, however, was far less clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The court engaged in the following colloquy with the victim advocate concerning the parties' understandings as to the scope of the restraining order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \"The Court: I told you what was going to be the tenor of my orders, and I asked you to see if you could work out particulars just so that I don't enter something impractical for the parties. Were you able to do that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. Why don't you tell me the essence of what you've worked out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: What we've agreed upon is that it would be considered a no contact restraining order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \"The Court: As far as mom is concerned?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: As far as mom is concerned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \"The Court: Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \"The Victim Advocate: Contact with the kids [will] be limited to weekly supervised visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \"The Court: Contact with minor children weekly, supervised. Yes ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Everyone agreed that in-person contact with the children was to be strictly limited to weekly supervised visits. There was, however, no clear statement by the court or the parties with respect to whether other, non-in-person contact with the couple's minor children, such as letters, telephone calls, e-mails or text messages, was also prohibited by the terms of the order. Although the court explicitly instructed the defendant and ensured his understanding that he was not to contact A.N. \"in any manner,\" that same language was never used with respect to contact with the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The court's instructions to the defendant provided as follows: \"So, with that in mind, I am going to order a temporary restraining order. Now, as to [A.N.] and the five children, sir, you are not to assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, interfere with or stalk. You are to stay away from the home of [A.N.], or wherever she's residing, and you're not to contact\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   in any manner. As far as the children are concerned, you can have contact with your children, but for now we need it supervised. It's to be weekly and supervised.... Any contact that you need to have with your wife, or that your wife needs to have with you, will go through a third party, either [S.G.] or [C.T.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The defendant was charged with criminally violating the restraining order in three ways. First, he allegedly contacted the victim via a text message on March 28, 2012. Second, he allegedly contacted the victim by text message on April 10, 2012. Third, he allegedly contacted the victim by way of a written letter sometime \"between\n   March 5, 2012, and April 10, 2012 ....\" Although the record establishes that the victim received the letter in April, 2012, there is no direct evidence as to when the letter was written or given to the victim's sibling for delivery. In other words, the third violation may have occurred when the ex parte restraining order was in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In order to convict the defendant of violating the restraining order, the state was obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) a restraining order was issued against the defendant, (2) the defendant had knowledge of the terms of the order, (3) the order protected the victim in this case, (4) the order prevented the defendant from calling or writing to her, and (5) the defendant wrote to and called the victim while the order was in effect.

The second element is that the defendant had knowledge of the terms of the order. This means that the defendant must know of the conditions of the order. A person\n   acts knowingly with respect to conduct which a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of such a nature or that such circumstance exists. An act is done knowingly if done voluntarily and\n   purposefully, and not because of mistake, inadvertence or accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \"Ordinarily, knowledge can be established only through an inference from other proven facts and circumstances. The inference may be drawn if the circumstances are such that a reasonable person of honest intention in this situation of the defendant would have concluded that the defendant had knowledge of the terms of the order. The determinative question is whether the circumstances in the particular case form a basis for a sound inference as to the knowledge of the defendant in the transaction under inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \"The third element is that the defendant violated a condition of the restraining order in that he contacted a person in violation of the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \"In summary, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a restraining order had been issued against the defendant and that the defendant violated a condition of that order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The defendant claims on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he violated either the ex parte restraining order or the temporary restraining order issued to him on March 15, 2012. Specifically, he contends that the evidence was insufficient because it did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the orders protected the victim in this case, and that, even if they did, he knew that they prevented him from text messaging or writing to the victim while in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Because the defendant chose to raise his challenge to his conviction in this manner, we are constrained by\n   the well-worn standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. Under that standard, which requires us to construe all of the evidence in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20527\">\n    151 Conn.App. at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20A.3d%201201\">\n    95 A.3d 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; I agree with the majority that there was sufficient evidence, including the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, to establish that the defendant believed that the temporary restraining order prevented him from text messaging or writing to the victim. In other words, even if the temporary restraining order and the court's explanation of it, taken together, created an ambiguity regarding whether the defendant was permitted to text message or write to the victim while the order was in effect, the jury appears to have resolved that ambiguity in favor of the state by concluding that he had had knowledge of the terms of the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   In several related contexts, however, we require that a court order be sufficiently clear and unambiguous as a matter of law before a litigant is held responsible for violating it. This requirement is particularly important in circumstances in which the conduct that is said to violate the order is otherwise noncriminal conduct.

Instead, this issue seems to be addressed solely as a factual question for the finder of fact as part of its determination regarding whether the defendant had \"knowledge of the terms of the order ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223b(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In sum, I have serious concerns regarding whether the temporary restraining order in this case, as explained to the defendant by the court, was sufficiently clear and unambiguous as a matter of law that the defendant should suffer a loss of liberty for violating it. This is particularly true in light of the fact that the conduct underlying his conviction was otherwise noncriminal conduct but for the existence of the restraining order. Indeed, if this same order was sought to be enforced by way of civil contempt in a family matter, I would have serious doubt about whether it would pass the threshold showing that it was clear and unambiguous under the particular circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Nevertheless, I conclude that the defendant's conviction must be affirmed for several reasons. First, the defendant never moved to dismiss the counts of the information on the ground that they were insufficient as a matter of law and thus should not be submitted to the jury for its consideration. See Practice Book \u00a7 41-8. Second, the defendant has not argued on appeal that, as a matter of law, the restraining orders lacked sufficient clarity and thus could not be enforced under the circumstances of this case. Finally, the defendant did not submit any particular request to charge that would seek even a jury determination regarding the question of whether the restraining orders were sufficiently clear and unambiguous. Instead, the defendant was content to have the jury decide, as a factual question, whether he had knowledge of the terms of the orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The jury resolved this question in favor of the state. On appeal, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as it relates to that question. In light of our standard of review, I am obligated to affirm the defendant's conviction on those counts.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
