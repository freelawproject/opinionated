Blake provided her employer, Laurel Healthcare LLC (Laurel), with two weeks' notice that she was leaving her position to begin working for Alaris Healthcare (Alaris) at an increased hourly wage. Two days before she was to start, Alaris told Blake the position was no longer available. When Blake tried to rescind her resignation, Laurel informed her it no longer required her in a full-time capacity. The Deputy denied Blake's application for unemployment benefits because she left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the work.\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Tribunal affirmed the Deputy's decision, reasoning the Amendment's exception applied only if Blake actually commenced her employment with Alaris.

We disagree. In our view, the plain language of the Amendment fully supports the Board's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The acceptance of a commensurate position with another employer does not trigger the Amendment's exception to disqualification. Rather, it is only the employee's acceptance of \"employment\n   <em>\n    which commences\n   </em>\n   not more than seven days after the individual leaves employment with the first employer,\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   43:21-5(a) (emphasis added), that transforms otherwise disqualifying conduct-tendering a voluntary resignation-into an insignificant event for purposes of eligibility. Interpreting the language of the Amendment by giving the words their \"generally accepted meaning, according to the approved usage,\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   1:1-1, \"which\" refers to something previously mentioned-employment accepted from another employer-and provides further information about that employment-it commences within seven days.\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , www.oed.com/view/entry/228284 (last visited Sept. 18, 2017) (defining \"which\" as, \"[i]ntroducing a clause defining or restricting the antecedent thus completing the sense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Blake would have us read the Amendment to apply whenever an employee resigns to accept employment \"which was intended to commence\" within seven days of the effective resignation date, but never did. Simply put, we will not \"insert language that the Legislature could have included in [the Amendment]-but did not.\"\n   <em>\n    Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Melcar Util.

Obviously, the Legislature did not want the first employer's sudden and unilateral decision to terminate the employee who had given notice to adversely affect her continued eligibility for benefits simply because the second job commenced more than seven days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Blake's interpretation of the Amendment, adopted by the panel in\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   , renders unnecessary this second part of the Amendment. If an employee resigned, yet remained eligible for benefits by accepting a position that was intended to commence within seven days of her resignation date, but never did, she would become eligible for benefits upon the date of her actual termination. Any difference between the anticipated resignation date and the actual termination date would be irrelevant.

We logically assume that most offers of other employment are not reduced to writing. Therefore, an employer who participates in a hearing before the Appeal Tribunal can only testify to what is undisputed, i.e., that the employee quit her position. It is unlikely that the employer could call the second employer, who is not a respondent to the employee's appeal and may be unknown, as a witness to challenge whether the claimant actually had received an offer of employment and what were its terms.

The Board concedes this point.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Without specificity, the Committee statements referenced similar laws enacted by twenty-six states, and regulations enacted in five others, that had the same purpose.\n    <em>\n     Senate Labor Comm., Statement to S. 2082\n    </em>\n    (June 5, 2014). In this appeal, neither Blake nor the Board have cited to the laws of our sister states, but the panel in\n    <em>\n     McClain\n    </em>\n    specifically considered two of them and found the language of those statutes explicitly provided that the employee actually commence work with the second employer.\n    <em>\n     McClain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , op. at 472-73 n. 3. We cannot quarrel with our colleagues' analysis in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    However, contrary to the course taken by our Legislature, a number of other states have included explicit language that adopts Blake's position, i.e., that commencement of employment with the second employer was not necessary for the exemption from disqualification to apply.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Alaska Admin.

Admin. Code\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 R6-3-50365 (2017) (\"A worker who ... quits because he has prospects of other work, but no definite offer, leaves voluntarily without good cause in connection with his work.\");\n    <em>\n     Cal.

Benefits paid under a given benefit determination shall be charged against the account of the employer to whom such determination relates. When each benefit payment is made, notification shall be promptly provided to each employer included in the unemployment insurance monetary calculation of benefits. Such notification shall identify the employer against whose account the amount of such payment is being charged, shall show at least the name and social security account number of the claimant and shall specify the period of unemployment to which said benefit payment applies.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
