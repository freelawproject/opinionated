For the mutual benefit of police and citizen alike, such impounding will routinely be accompanied by an inventorying of the contents of the automobile. This procedure is not necessarily a part of an adversarial \"cops and robbers\" scenario in a typical criminal investigation and trial. It may be, rather, what the Supreme Court has characterized as a \"community caretaking function.\"\n   <em>\n    Cady v.

We heard oral argument on September 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    The Facts In A Nutshell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Other than being a routine traffic stop, the case against the appellee did not begin in any sense as a criminal investigation. On December 13, 2016, Officer Donald Rohsner was on routine traffic duty, using radar to look for speeding violations in the 800 block of Talbot Avenue in Laurel. He observed the appellee's white 2014 Chevrolet Impala traveling at \"a speed of 50\" in a clearly marked \"30 mile per hour zone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   He initiated a stop of the vehicle and relayed the information about the car to \"police dispatch.\" The appellee was the vehicle's driver and sole occupant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Rohsner ran the appellee's information through the Laurel Police Department's communication system and was informed that the appellee's driver's license was \"suspended.\" When the officer further checked the registration status of the vehicle itself, he learned \"that the tags were suspended through the Motor Vehicle Administration (M.V.A.) and that they were to be-there was a pick-up order on them, which means we must remove them and take them-put them into evidence so the vehicle did not have tags.\" During the stop, Officer Rohsner received a further dispatch that \"said 10-0, possibly armed, which is a caution code that he was possibly armed.\" Based on that cautionary alert, \"you would want to have a secondary officer for safety purposes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Officer Nicholas Cahill responded to the traffic stop as that secondary officer. Officer Cahill, who also testified, confirmed that when the police encounter a \"pick-up order,\" they \"have to take the tags off the vehicle and we return them to the M.V.A.\" Officer Cahill went on to describe the written and established procedure of the Laurel Police Department with respect to inventories. He submitted the printed seven-page policy of the Department as State's Exhibit 1. He further testified that he had received \"field training\" on the proper implementation of the inventory procedure. He explained that the \"purpose of an inventory search is to document all items in the vehicle, high value, anything you deem might be in the vehicle that needs to be inventoried.\" His direct examination pointed out:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. Okay. You indicated that [in] your inventory policy, you search for valuables.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. What-what constitutes a valuable item in your-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. It could be a cell phone, hum, any debit cards, money left in the vehicle, clothing, tools.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. Okay. How do you acquire-which items you encounter during an inventory search would require safekeeping?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. We don't take anything for safekeeping. We will usually just leave that valuable in the vehicle. Hum, and it will stay in the vehicle while it's impounded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There was no cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Officer Cahill testified that he would routinely search the glove compartment, the central console area, and the trunk because that is where valuables would likely be found. Officer Cahill went on to explain that the general orders of the Laurel Police Department governing inventories require the use of a motor vehicle tow report form. A copy of that tow report was offered and admitted as State's Exhibit 2. On that form, the inventory in this case listed \"a blue iPhone in the center console\" and \"seven Mac computers in the trunk of the car.\" In the course of making the inventory, the police also discovered and seized 51 grams of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   An overview of the suppression hearing is significant. The appellee did not testify and offered neither witnesses nor evidence on his motion to suppress. With respect to the two officers called by the State, the appellee asked not a single question by way of cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The appellee's argument before the suppression hearing judge referred to Officer Rohsner's body camera which recorded his inventory searching. It showed three pairs of tennis shoes, a spare tire, a jack, and jumper cables that were not listed as part of the inventory. The appellee's argument was that the inventory was thereby flawed\n   because it failed to include all items found in the car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Logically implicit in such an\n   argument is that such a subsequent failure to fill out the inventory listing with the requisite completeness would date back to invalidate the earlier discovery of the items to be inventoried. The search for the items, of course, was already\n   <em>\n    fait accompli\n   </em>\n   when the inventorying officer first puts pen to paper. In extremely summary terms, however, the trial judge's ruling bought the appellee's argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   What the video makes clear is that\n   <em>\n    what the police conducted is not an inventory, because an inventory lists everything\n   </em>\n   that is\n   <em>\n    and is not based on a subjective criteria as to what is quote valuable, unquote\n   </em>\n   . The motion to suppress is granted as to the contents of the trunk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). That is the sum total of the ruling. That is the ultimate constitutional ruling that we shall examine\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    The Supreme Court And Inventory Searches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To keep a proper sense of precedential proportion, we note that we are dealing, of course, with Fourth Amendment constitutional law. The Maryland opinions, which the appellee seems to argue almost exclusively, are but implementary and/or descriptive of that Fourth Amendment law. They are not themselves the core law to be applied. Whenever lawyers start cherry-picking phrases from random cases (as inevitably they must), it is always healthy to be able to go back to the original source instead of relying too heavily on subsequent glosses on that original source. It is always advisable to be cautious when using secondary sources. As a word is changed here or an emphasis is added there in making a gloss, and then a gloss upon a gloss, it is easy for the gloss to stray from the original message. If you want to know what\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v. Opperman\n   </em>\n   holds, therefore, read\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v. Opperman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the law governing the inventorying by the police of the contents of an automobile about to be impounded, the original\n   source is\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v. Opperman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    428 U.S. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    49 L.Ed.2d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). It was and it remains the Fourth Amendment pole star. In\n   <em>\n    Opperman\n   </em>\n   , as here, the police determined that the vehicle in question would be towed to the impounding lot because of a violation of the traffic (parking) law. It had been illegally parked for a number of hours in a restricted zone. As in the present case, no crime other than the illegal parking itself was even suspected. The officer unlocked the car and, \"using a standard inventory form pursuant to standard police procedures,\" inventoried the contents of the automobile, \"including the contents of the glove compartment which was unlocked.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    428 U.S. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a plastic bag in the glove compartment, the police found and seized marijuana.\n   Opperman's motion to suppress the marijuana on the basis of a Fourth Amendment violation was denied and he was convicted of unlawful possession. The Supreme Court of South Dakota, however, reversed the conviction, holding that there had been a Fourth Amendment violation. On that issue, the Supreme Court of the United States then reversed the Supreme Court of South Dakota. The opinion of the United States Supreme Court indisputably placed the phenomenon of the inventory \"search\" in an essentially non-investigative context, referring to it expressly as a \"caretaking procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    When vehicles are impounded, local police departments generally follow a routine practice of securing and inventorying the automobiles' contents.\n   </em>\n   These procedures developed in response to three distinct needs: the protection of the owner's property while it remains in police custody ...; the protection the police against claims or disputes over lost or stolen property ...; and the protection of the police from potential danger ....\n   <em>\n    The practice has been viewed as essential\n   </em>\n   to respond to incidents of theft or vandalism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    These caretaking procedures have almost uniformly been upheld by the state courts\n   </em>\n   , which by virtue of the localized nature of traffic regulation have had considerable occasion to deal with the issue. Applying the Fourth Amendment\n   standard of \"reasonableness,\"\n   <em>\n    the state courts have overwhelmingly concluded that, even if an inventory is characterized as a \"search,\" the intrusion is constitutionally permissible.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    428 U.S. at 369-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This larger philosophical overview of inventorying is important in this case because the appellee, in attempting to erect a procedural obstacle course, is trivializing the phenomenon. The appellee essentially begins with the notion that police credibility is inherently suspect and that the officer must pass a series of procedural tests in order to prove his\n   <em>\n    bona fides\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v. Opperman\n   </em>\n   itself gives off no such emanations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In holding that the inventory \"search\" in that case did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\n   <em>\n    Opperman\n   </em>\n   set out two basic requirements. The first is that the police must be lawfully entitled to impound or otherwise to exert custody over the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The Vermillion police were indisputably engaged in a\n   <em>\n    caretaking search of a lawfully impounded automobile\n   </em>\n   .... The inventory was conducted only after the car had been impounded for multiple parking violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    428 U.S. at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The second requirement is that the inventorying must be conducted pursuant to \"standard police procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [W]e conclude that\n   <em>\n    in following standard police procedures\n   </em>\n   , prevailing throughout the country and approved by the overwhelming majority of courts,\n   <em>\n    the conduct of the police was not \"unreasonable\"\n   </em>\n   under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    428 U.S. at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

In inventorying the contents of the bag, the police discovered amphetamine pills inside a cigarette case. The most important message of the\n   <em>\n    Lafayette\n   </em>\n   opinion is that\n   in carrying out the inventory process,\n   the police are not required to find and to use the \"least intrusive manner.\" Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    The Illinois\n   </em>\n   court held that the search of respondent's shoulder bag was unreasonable because \"preservation of the defendant's property and protection of police from claims of lost or stolen property, '\n   <em>\n    could have been\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    achieved in a less intrusive manner.'\n   </em>\n   [\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Perhaps so\n   </em>\n   , but the real question is not what \"could have been achieved,\" but whether the Fourth Amendment\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   such steps;\n   <em>\n    it is not our function to write a manual on administering routine, neutral procedures of the stationhouse\n   </em>\n   .

A Colorado police officer had arrested Bertine for driving his van under the influence of alcohol. Just before a tow truck arrived to take the van to an impounding lot, one of the officers, in accordance with local police procedure, inventoried the van's contents.

It nonetheless suppressed the evidence, ruling that the Colorado constitution had been violated, even if the United States Constitution had not been.

How, then, does such non-investigatory behavior fit into our more familiar framework of Fourth Amendment analysis? In terms of constitutional algebra, something discovered in the inventory search may trigger the Plain View Doctrine. Analytically, the initial non-investigatory inventory search would qualify as a prior valid intrusion, a critical element of the Plain View Doctrine. When evidence is then spotted in plain view, with the requisite probable cause to believe that it is evidence, a Plain View Doctrine warrantless seizure is quintessentially reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Coolidge v.

The critical question, therefore, becomes that of \"Whether the prior intrusion that leads to the plain view of the evidence is, in truth, a prior\n   <strong>\n    VALID\n   </strong>\n   intrusion?\" For the criminal defendant, the instinctive response is to cry \"Subterfuge!\" The tactical consequences of that instinct have\n   been to come up with as many attacks as possible on the integrity of the inventory. For inventory searches\n   generally, we are called upon to determine whether the ostensibly prior valid intrusion was, indeed,\n   <strong>\n    VALID\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In terms of careful and precise analysis, moreover, footnote 6 of the\n   <em>\n    Opperman\n   </em>\n   opinion,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    428 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   370 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177992\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/364/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , also raises an interesting question with respect to the constitutional algebra. It carefully points out that an inventory \"search,\" in terms of analytic clarity, may not be a \"search\" within the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment at all. It may not be analytically precise, therefore, to call the inventory an exception to or an exemption from the warrant requirement, because the entire warrant requirement (along with all of its exceptions) relates to criminal investigations and depends upon probable cause. The true inventory, by contrast, has nothing to do with either. It is probably more analytically correct, therefore, to think of the inventory as an instance of the \"Fourth Amendment Inapplicable\" rather than as an instance of the \"Fourth Amendment Satisfied.\" In\n   <em>\n    Opperman\n   </em>\n   , however, the petitioner did not pursue this line of reasoning and the Supreme Court was not required to pursue the matter further.

State\n   </em>\n   strongly supports the State's position. At approximately three o'clock in the morning, a Baltimore County police officer noticed a green Lexus in the area of Route 40 and Frederick Road and decided to run a records check on the vehicle's license tag. When the M.V.A. indicated that it could not find a registration for the vehicle, Officer Brown stopped the vehicle. The appellant, Jeffrey Thompson, was unable to produce a driver's license or other state identification. Thompson attempted to produce various insurance documents to prove that the car was properly registered, but the documents referred, counterproductively, to not one, but three different vehicle identification numbers (VINs). Officer Brown testified that led him to suspect some sort of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The officer arrested Thompson for \"failure to provide sufficient identification.\" Officer Brown also called a towing company to impound the vehicle. In the course of a routine inventory\n   search, the officer recovered a nine millimeter pistol in a book bag in the trunk of the car. Before this Court, Thompson argued that his arrest was unlawful and that the gun produced in the search that followed was the fruit of the poisonous tree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The opinion of this Court acknowledged that the arrest issue was a very close question but that it was unnecessary to decide it because of the State's alternative theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Alternatively, the State suggests that the recovery of the handgun occurred during a lawful inventory search.\n   <em>\n    We agree with the State's\n   </em>\n   latter rationale and will affirm the motion court's ruling\n   <em>\n    because it is clear that the vehicle had to be impounded regardless of whether there was probable cause to arrest appellant in this case.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5738549\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/192/653/\">\n    192 Md.App. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5738549\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/192/653/\">\n    995 A.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Judge Wright's opinion explained that even if,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the arrest had been illegal, the unregistered car would have to have been impounded in any event and the attendant inventory would inevitably have led to the discovery of the gun.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   [E]ven if appellant's arrest was illegal,\n   <em>\n    the removal of the unregistered vehicle from the custody of an unlicensed driver was not illegal\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    the handgun would have inevitably been discovered during the subsequent lawful inventory search of the vehicle.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5738549\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/192/653/\">\n    192 Md.App. at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5738549\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/192/653/\">\n    995 A.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The impounding of the vehicle, moreover, was perfectly proper.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   From this, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    it was reasonable for the police to seize the vehicle that appellant was driving based on the totality of the circumstances, including the lack of proper registration, the conflicting VINs, appellant's failure to provide license information\n   </em>\n   on demand, and the fact that appellant's passenger was no longer on the scene and available to drive the vehicle.

In this case, that fact was indisputably established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The stopping officer was on standard highway patrol duty, manning the radar from a fixed position, when he stopped the appellee for doing 50 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. The appellee was the only occupant of the car. A radio check revealed that the appellee's driver's license had been suspended. The appellee himself, therefore, would not have been allowed to drive the car away. In checking the registration status of the vehicle, the officer further learned that the Motor Vehicle Administration had suspended the tags and that there was a pick-up order for them. As a back-up officer testified, when the officers encounter a \"pick-up order,\" they have to \"take the tags off the vehicle and we return them to the M.V.A.\" In this case, no one, therefore, would have been allowed to drive that \"untagged\" automobile away from the 800 block of Talbot Avenue in Laurel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The appellee does not even argue that his vehicle was not in lawful police custody. The suppression hearing court made no finding that the car was not in lawful police custody. We hold that this key requirement was incontestably satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The appellee nevertheless argues that the police were not authorized to tow the car because they did not exhaust all alternatives to towing. The caselaw makes clear, however, that such an exhaustion of alternatives is not required. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986441\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1013/\">\n    777 F.3d 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2015), the argument mirrored the one the appellee mounts in this case. In refuting it, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit had no difficulty in holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   <em>\n    [H]e argues that Officer Loftis's original decision to impound his vehicle,\n   </em>\n   which then led to the search,\n   <em>\n    was unlawful.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    The Tow Policy leaves it up to an officer's discretion whether to tow a vehicle after an arrest. \"The Fourth Amendment permits exercise of such discretion\n   </em>\n   ... 'so long as that discretion is exercised according to standard criteria ... other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.' \" ... These standardized criteria, however, do not need to be part of the written policy itself, so long as \"the officer's residual judgment is exercised based on legitimate concerns related to the purposes of an impoundment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   ...\n   <em>\n    \"[A]n impoundment policy may allow some latitude and exercise of judgment by a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    police officer ....\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986441\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1013/\">\n    777 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The appellee here also specifically claims that the car's lawful owner, his mother, should have been notified and given a voice in deciding how to get the car off of Talbot Avenue. Precisely that argument was made to the 8th Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Arrocha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559440\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1159/\">\n    713 F.3d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2013). The Eighth Circuit held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   \"Nothing in the Fourth Amendment requires a police department to allow an arrested person to arrange for another\n   person to pick up his car to avoid impoundment and inventory.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559440\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1159/\">\n    713 F.3d at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    Standardized Police Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The second of the cardinal requirements for a valid inventory search is that such a search must be carried out pursuant to a standardized police policy. In this case, that requirement was abundantly satisfied. The Laurel Police Department has a seven-page General Order, issued on May 6, 2014, dealing with \"Motor Vehicle Impounding.\" Sect. 4/308.20 D. Impound and Release Procedure b. provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   The contents of all impounded vehicles shall be inventoried and listed on a Motor Vehicle Tow Report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   That entire General Order was introduced at the suppression hearing as State's Exhibit 1. The Tow Report that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , listed the items recorded pursuant to the inventory, was also introduced at the suppression hearing as State's Exhibit 2. In addition to the documentary evidence, Officer Cahill testified about his department's inventory policy, about his familiarity with it, and about his \"field training\" with respect to the proper implementation of the inventory procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   At the suppression hearing, defense counsel did not argue that the police did not have an inventory policy. Defense counsel does not now contend that the General Order was inadequate in any way. We hold that this policy requirement was abundantly satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    Of Spare Tires, Jacks, And Oily Rags\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   With the appellee's acknowledgement that the two key requirements for a constitutional inventory search have been satisfied, what back-up contentions remain to give us pause? As the appellee nips away at the heels of this inventory search, he raises several protests about the manner in which the inventory was executed. The legal theory he advances seems to be that even if an inventory search is initially\n   justified, any imperfection in the later execution of the listing process may date back and invalidate the earlier search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The appellee's major subcontention in this regard concerns the making of the inventory list. The tow report that was State's Exhibit 2 listed the significant or valuable contents of the appellee's car as \"a blue iPhone in the center console\" and \"seven Mac computers in the trunk of the car.\" A body camera, worn by Officer Cahill as he made the inventory search, also shows that, albeit unlisted, there were also in the trunk a spare tire, a jack, jumper cables, and three pairs of tennis shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   It is the appellee's argument that the inventory list is, therefore, fatally incomplete and that this imperfection in the listing should date back and, as a matter of law, invalidate the inventory search that preceded it. This clearly seems to have been the rationale accepted by the suppression hearing judge in ruling that the inventory search was unconstitutional. As the judge ruled, \"[W]hat the police conducted is not an inventory, because an\n   inventory lists everything.\" None of the Supreme Court opinions or the major Maryland opinions on the subject, however, has remotely alluded to any such an invalidating principle, and we are not, as a matter of first impression, about to proclaim such a proposition here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   There would be all sorts of problems with such a rule. Both the appellee and the suppression hearing judge seem to have conflated the inventory\n   <em>\n    searching\n   </em>\n   , on the one hand, and the inventory\n   <em>\n    listing\n   </em>\n   , on the other hand, into a single indivisible and contemporaneous act. They are, however, two acts, separate and sequential. The inventory searching is already a\n   <em>\n    fait accompli\n   </em>\n   when the inventory listing commences. When contraband or other evidence of crime is revealed in the course of the inventory search, the Plain View Doctrine is complete within the blink of the officer's eye. A later event, the making of the list, will not retroactively date back and make the prior valid intrusion invalid. For the appellee and the suppression hearing judge to have ignored this sequence was, at least in microcosm, to rewrite history. It does not logically follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   On the other hand, even if some later imperfection in the making of the inventory list will not, as a matter of law, automatically invalidate what preceded the imperfection, it may, as an alternative theory of relevance, at least be evidence that the searching officer was insincere in his earlier protestations of non-investigative purpose in conducting the search. Subsequent events may, after all, throw light on earlier motivation. At the suppression hearing, of course, there was neither argument nor discussion about such a theory and there was no finding of fact by the judge in that regard. Maybe the officer who is more obsessive about making an exhaustive list will be less likely to have been insincere about his searching motives. Or maybe just the opposite is true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In this case, however, we do not see any imperfection in the inventory list. The Fourth Amendment's key criterion is the adjective \"reasonable.\" Without any elaborate exegesis, \"reasonable\" refers to practical decisions as a matter of common sense. As a matter of common sense, we know instinctively that\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v. Opperman\n   </em>\n   never contemplated that the police should inventory four wheels, four hubcaps, six or eight spark plugs, an aerial, and ten gallons of gas. They, to be sure, are essentially part of the automobile rather than contents of the automobile. Ordinarily, however, even a spare tire may be bolted down in its secure niche so as to be part of the automobile. Instinctively, we also know that other items closely associated with the operation of the automobile, such as a jack or jumper cables are in the same category, whether bolted down or not. In the present case, this leaves us with some unlisted tennis shoes. Curiously, the appellee, with full opportunity to do so, never asked Officer Cahill why he did not list the tennis shoes. This complaint is clearly an appellate afterthought. As our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   independent constitutional determination, we are not about to say that Officer Cahill was guilty of subterfuge because he did not list the tennis shoes. Such a holding would trivialize the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In his insistence on exhaustive listing as a necessary badge of police integrity, the appellee stands alone. He cites neither caselaw nor academic authority to support his position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    A Mixed Motive Is Not A Fatal Flaw\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The appellee emits one last gasp. During Officer Rohsner's communication with the Police Dispatch unit, the officer received a \"10-0\" from dispatch, informing him that the driver he was detaining might be armed. From this lone and unilluminated fact, the appellee, on appeal, leaps to the immediate conclusion that from that moment on, the police motive was necessarily and automatically the investigative motive of gathering evidence of crime. The appellee contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    It is evident that the decision to search the car arose not from genuine need to impound the car\n   </em>\n   and a desire to safeguard the items therein,\n   <em>\n    but rather from a desire to look for incriminating evidence\n   </em>\n   . Even if the officers had followed the standardized procedure contained in the General Order in impounding and searching the car-which they did not-\n   <em>\n    their blatantly investigatory motive for conducting the search\n   </em>\n   would render it invalid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). That is conspiracy theory run rampant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   We are not so quick to read the minds of the officers. Their psyches are not so one-dimensional. The appellee's rationale seems to be that the fact that the appellee might have been armed necessarily tags the appellee as a criminal type and that, when dealing with a criminal type, the officers will automatically conduct a search with an investigative purpose to the exclusion of a community care-taking purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The caselaw, however, does not agree with appellee's facile conclusion that an investigative purpose necessarily animates the search of anyone who may be involved with criminal behavior. In\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Lafayette\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the police were well aware that Lafayette had already been arrested for disturbing the peace and was actually in handcuffs when they conducted what was nonetheless held to have been a valid inventory search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In both\n   <em>\n    Colorado v. Bertine\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Florida v. Wells\n   </em>\n   , the defendants had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol before any inventory was conducted. In\n   <em>\n    Colorado v. Bertine\n   </em>\n   , the inventory was upheld as a valid one. In\n   <em>\n    Florida v. Wells\n   </em>\n   , the inventory was examined as a possibly valid one but was ultimately struck down only because of the absence of a standardized police procedure. A possible connection to crime on the part of the suspect did not lead to the presumption that the police motive in conducting an ostensible inventory would necessarily be an investigative one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sellman v. State\n   </em>\n   , Sellman himself was arrested for driving on a revoked license. In\n   <em>\n    Briscoe v. State\n   </em>\n   , Briscoe was similarly arrested for driving on a suspended license. There\n   was, moreover, an open arrest warrant out for him. In each case, however, it was tentatively accepted that the inventory search had been conducted for a proper non-investigative purpose. In each case, the inventory search itself was accepted as being a proper one and the reason for the ultimate reversals was exclusively because of the lack of evidence of any standardized police policy. The appellee's easy presumption as to police motivation, therefore, does not automatically follow. We note again, moreover, that the appellee had a full opportunity in this case to cross-examine both officers about the cautionary alarm that they had received and about their reaction to it. Not one question, however, was asked. In argument at the close of the suppression hearing, the brief reference to the issue by defense counsel was glibly conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   Your Honor, I would submit that\n   <em>\n    the minute that they heard that he was suspected of being in possession of a weapon this became a purely disguised search for evidence\n   </em>\n   in rummaging through the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).

They are not antagonistic, and the additional presence of an investigative purpose will not erase the establishment of a solid inventory search justification. The undergirding truth is that the contemporaneous possession of two desiderata does not mean that one of them is a subterfuge. That, of course, would be the only reason for invalidating an otherwise valid inventory search. Such a reason does not exist in the present case. Once again, moreover, the appellee cites neither caselaw nor academic authority in support of his inherent cynicism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    An Attitudinal Readjustment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   One further word may be in order about the precedential limits of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .

The attitude of those opinions was extremely cynical about the very institution of the inventory search and overtly editorial in tone. They are cited, moreover, not for any legal analysis, but basically for their adverse comments on the police behavior in those cases. In now distancing ourselves from that tone, we refrain from using a word as harsh as \"repudiate,\" because the actual holdings of those cases were not necessarily incorrect as a matter of law. The attitude and the tone of the opinions, however, reflected a zeitgeist that is diametrically out of harmony with the now prevailing and more balanced understanding of inventory search law that has in more recent decades come of age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   <strong>\n    SUPPRESSION ORDER REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR TRIAL.

Paradoxically, the appellee uses this footage as a part of the inventory. It is the only evidence there is of the \"other items\" that the appellee claims were not inventoried. If what is shown on the film is efficacious to support the appellee's appellate argument, as indeed it was to support the appellee's successful argument at the suppression hearing, then what prejudice has the appellee suffered? Would not the same film of the inventory search be equally efficacious to support a hypothetical claim of theft that the appellee might bring against the police department? Would it not thereby serve to support all of the community caretaking purposes that the inventory of the contents of the impounded vehicle was devised to serve? What then, if anything, is missing? If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck ....\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
