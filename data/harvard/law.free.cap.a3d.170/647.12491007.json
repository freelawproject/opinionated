We agree with both of these contentions, and, therefore, we also agree that the trial court improperly granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the charges. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to that court with direction to deny the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. According to a police report submitted by both parties, on January 20, 2014, police officers responded to 22 Fairlawn Avenue in the city of Danbury to investigate the report of a domestic disturbance at that residence. When they arrived, the officers discovered the thirty-one year old defendant, along with his twenty-two year old brother, Francis Pelella, and their mother, Linda Pelella, all three of whom resided at 22 Fairlawn Avenue. According to all three parties, the disturbance arose out of a disagreement between Francis, who wanted to move into the attic of the house, and the defendant, who had \"some of his stuff up there\" and objected to the move. The\n   defendant told the officers that, faced with their opposition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Francis became angry and started yelling and cursing. The mother added that Francis \"got into her face.\" Francis, meanwhile, reported to the police that the defendant had told him, \" 'if you go into the attic I will hurt you.' \" Francis added that he felt threatened and feared for his safety because the defendant had physically harmed him in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant and the mother admitted that the defendant had said that he would hurt Francis if he moved into the attic, but both claimed that the defendant had made the statement to the mother, not to Francis. The defendant claimed that he felt he had a right to protect his belongings. Both men attempted to\n   play for the officers recordings that they had made of the encounter. Francis played a video recording on his cell phone that showed Francis standing at the top of a staircase and the defendant and the mother downstairs; the mother's voice could be heard, apparently on the telephone with the police, saying that the defendant had threatened to hurt Francis. Although the defendant also attempted to play for the officers an audio recording of the incident on his computer, the recording was unintelligible. Both the defendant and Francis were arrested for their participation in the altercation, the defendant for threatening and Francis for disorderly conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the state filed a substitute information charging the defendant with two counts of threatening in the second degree, the defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence or cause pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 41-8(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of his motion, the defendant claimed that the allegedly threatening statement was merely \"a spontaneous outburst rooted in his anger and frustration with his brother,\" and not an unprotected \" 'true threat,' \" as described by this court in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

The defendant argued that the alleged threat was conditional and not subject to an \"imminent prospect of execution,\" and that it was \"nonspecific as to what would be done,\" including whether the threatened response would be physical in nature. He further maintained, incorrectly, that there was \"nothing to indicate [that] the threat was made directly to Francis.\" In opposing the defendant's motion, the state maintained that the defendant's statement fit squarely within the objective standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , namely, \"whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be\n   interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra, 450. In the state's view, the statement was an explicit threat notwithstanding its conditional nature. The state noted that this court had previously found the statement, \" '[t]his is for you if you bother me anymore,' \" to be a threat.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734112\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/237/#p240\">\n    287 Conn. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240, 255,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=947%20A.2d%20307\">\n    947 A.2d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant was simultaneously brandishing table leg), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20U.S.%20970\">\n    555 U.S. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20S.%20Ct.%20464\">\n    129 S.Ct. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20328\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). The state also asserted that Francis' claim that the defendant had hurt him physically in the past removed any ambiguity about the nature of the threat and distinguished the present case from\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , in which the defendant's relationship with the alleged victim had previously been \"cordial ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 454.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After considering the parties' arguments, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it granted the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court\n   commenced its analysis of the defendant's claim by characterizing the issue as whether the state could establish that the defendant's words amounted to a true threat or \"were instead either part of a discourse, or were merely words uttered as an 'unplanned [and] spontaneous reaction to the upset and anger [he] felt' ... and carried no immediate plan to harm.\" (Citation omitted.) The court then noted that, under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"the state must do more than demonstrate that a statement\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be interpreted as a threat.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Rather, the state must show that \"a reasonable listener, familiar with the entire factual context of the defendant's statements, would be highly likely to interpret them as communicating a genuine threat of violence rather than protected expression, however offensive or repugnant.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court further explained that the statement at issue was \" 'susceptible of varying interpretations, at least one of which [was] nonthreatening,' \" and suggested that it may simply have been \"an expression of how strongly [the defendant] felt about Francis' plan to move into the attic\" or \"an appeal to the mother to arbitrate the dispute.\" In light of the factual context, including the lack of evidence that the defendant approached Francis or took other steps to carry out his threat, the court determined that the state \"would be unable to show that a reasonable listener, fully familiar with the facts, would be '\n   <em>\n    highly likely\n   </em>\n   ' to interpret them as a genuine threat of violence rather than protected expression,\" as\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis in original.) The\n   court\n   finally concluded that, because the state would be unable to sustain its burden of establishing that the statement constituted a true threat, the defendant was entitled to a dismissal of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the state renews its claim that the defendant's statement bore the necessary hallmarks of an unprotected true threat and that the trial court therefore improperly granted the defendant's motion to dismiss on first amendment grounds. The state contends, first, that the trial court incorrectly interpreted\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   as requiring that a threat must be imminent to constitute a true threat. According to the state, the purported imminence requirement in\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   constitutes dictum, runs counter to prior cases of this court that have explicitly relied on the opposite proposition, and ignores the fact that threats may be effective-that is, they may convey a serious intent to cause harm-regardless of whether they will be imminently executed. The state also asserts that the trial court's ruling is flawed because the court improperly viewed the evidence before it in the light most favorable to the defendant and that it should have considered that evidence in the light most favorable to the state. Finally, the state claims that, considering all the relevant circumstances presented to the court in that light, a jury reasonably could find that the defendant's statement constituted an unprotected true threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant maintains that the trial court did not, in fact, rely on an \"imminence requirement\" in dismissing the charges and, instead, considered the threats \"in\n   light of their entire factual context,\" noting only that the imminence of the harm \"must be considered.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant further claims that the trial court correctly concluded, upon consideration of the totality of the evidence presented, that the state cannot prove that the defendant's statement was a true threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because this appeal challenges the propriety of the trial court's decision to grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, we review de novo the trial court's ultimate determination as to whether the defendant's statement constituted a true threat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we need not decide whether the court relied on the imminence of the alleged threat in making its determination. Nonetheless, we take this opportunity to clarify the apparent inconsistency in our precedents. We conclude that imminence, at least in the sense of immediacy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   is only\n   one factor to be considered in determining whether a statement constitutes a true threat under our law, not a requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our plenary review of the state's claim also makes it unnecessary to determine whether the trial court\n   viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant. As we explain more fully hereinafter, for purposes of the present case, the proper analytical approach is to evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to the state. Having considered the evidence in that light, we are persuaded, contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, that a jury reasonably could find that the defendant's statement was an unprotected true threat prohibited by \u00a7 53a-62 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The [f]irst [a]mendment [to the United States constitution], applicable to the [s]tates through the [due process clause of the] [f]ourteenth [a]mendment, provides that 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.'

Thus, the trial court must ask whether the evidence would allow a person of reasonable caution,\n   <em>\n    viewing the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the state\n   </em>\n   , to believe that the statement at issue was highly likely to be perceived by a reasonable person as a serious threat of physical harm. If that evidence would support such a finding-regardless of whether it might also support a different conclusion-then the motion to dismiss must be denied.\n   With these principles in mind, we consider the merits of the state's claim, turning first to the language of the defendant's allegedly unlawful statement. According to Francis, the defendant told him, \" 'if you go into the attic I will hurt you.\" As the trial court recognized, such words are \"clearly capable of being a true threat ....\" Indeed, unlike the precatory statements at issue in\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   -for example, \" 'I'm going to be there [when you get hurt]' \";\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the statement in the\n   present case unambiguously communicated not a wish but an ultimatum. Nonetheless, the defendant and his mother claimed that the defendant's statement about hurting Francis was made not to Francis directly but to the mother. See\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dinwiddie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635230\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/913/#p925\">\n    76 F.3d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 925 (8th Cir.)

As a result, the trial court in the present case determined that, although the statement \"\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have been made with the purpose that [Francis] would hear it and be afraid, the method of delivery equally supports the thesis that the statement was not a true threat but a communication of just how important the issue was to the defendant. It might even have been an appeal to the mother to arbitrate the dispute.\" (Emphasis in original.) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, however, we are required to credit Francis' account-that the defendant made the statement directly to Francis. Considered in that light, the defendant's statement appears less like an entreaty to his mother than the expression of an intention to harm Francis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We must also consider the parties' prior relationship. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]hen the alleged threat is made in the context of an existing or increasingly hostile relationship, courts are more apt to conclude that an objectively reasonable speaker would\n   expect that the statement would be perceived by the listener as a genuine threat\"). In this case, police officers were called to the scene of the dispute, a location to which they previously had responded \"numerous times,\" and Francis told officers at the scene that the defendant's statement had caused him to fear for his safety because the defendant had physically hurt him in the past. At a hearing on his disorderly conduct charges, Francis later stated that he hoped \"that, in other cases, similar to mine, there's more investigation into the civility of the household, as a whole, and the person doing all the antagonizing, like who it really is.\" His attorney confirmed that \"[i]t's a difficult family situation ....\" Viewed in the light most favorable to the state, therefore, we are bound to conclude that at least one previous encounter between the defendant and his brother was physical in nature and sufficiently serious to cause Francis to fear for his safety if he crossed the defendant. This context significantly increases the likelihood that an objective listener would perceive the defendant's statement as a serious threat to perpetrate physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The immediate circumstances surrounding the defendant's statement, including Francis' reaction, are also relevant. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is true, as the trial court observed, that Francis neither fled nor called the police, opting instead to record the encounter. Nor is there any evidence that the defendant approached Francis or otherwise physically engaged him during the altercation. Nonetheless, the very fact that the defendant's mother, who was intimately familiar with the history between the brothers, found it necessary to call the police to the scene, and could be heard on the phone saying that the defendant had threatened Francis, suggests that the defendant's mother believed that the threat might\n   <em>\n    imminently\n   </em>\n   result in physical\n   harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, as we have explained,\n   the mere possibility that a threat will not be executed immediately does not resolve whether it constitutes a\n   <em>\n    true threat\n   </em>\n   .
