On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying certification to appeal and (2) improperly concluded that trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance when advising him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. We agree that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal and that trial counsel rendered deficient performance when advising the petitioner of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. We conclude, however, that the record is inadequate to determine whether the petitioner was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the habeas court and remand the matter for further habeas proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The petitioner was charged under two separate docket numbers with a variety of drug related offenses. On June 7, 2012, the petitioner appeared before the court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J.\n   </em>\n   , and, pursuant to a plea deal, pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell in violation\n   of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b). At that time, the prosecutor recited the following facts underlying this plea. On or about October 13, 2011, a United States Postal Service inspector intercepted a package that contained eighteen pounds of marijuana. Thereafter, a controlled delivery was made to 15 Pinetree Lane in Fairfield. The package was accepted by the petitioner's girlfriend, Tracy Dapp, who, upon accepting it, informed the detectives that the parcel was for the petitioner. Subsequently, the petitioner arrived at Dapp's residence, where he was arrested and made incriminating statements to the police. The record indicates that a search of the petitioner's vehicle revealed the eighteen pounds of marijuana, but it is unclear whether Dapp gave the petitioner the marijuana to put in his vehicle before he was apprehended by the police at her residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The petitioner was represented before the trial court by Attorney Jared Millbrandt, a public defender. During the plea canvass, the court asked the petitioner whether he had discussed with counsel \"the charge he pleaded guilty to, the elements of the offense, maximum penalty twenty years, [and] mandatory minimum five years,\" and whether the petitioner understood that the court could deviate below the mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines, to which the petitioner answered, \"Yes.\" The court then asked whether the petitioner was pleading guilty \"freely and voluntarily.\" The petitioner replied,\n   \"Yes.\" The court asked, \"Are the facts as read by the state essentially correct?\" The petitioner answered, \"Correct.\" Finally, the court asked the following: \"Do you understand [that] if you are not a citizen this can result in deportation from the United States, exclusion from the admission to the United States, [and] denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States?\" The petitioner replied, \"Yes.\" The court then found that the plea was voluntarily and knowingly made with the assistance of competent counsel. On July 30,\n   2012, the court sentenced the petitioner to seven years of incarceration, execution suspended after sixteen months, followed by three years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 30, 2013, the United States Immigration Court ordered that the petitioner be removed from the United States to Jamaica because his conviction of possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell constituted an aggravated felony, for which the consequence is mandatory deportation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May, 2015, the petitioner commenced the present action. On September 8, 2015, the petitioner filed the operative amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which in relevant part alleges ineffective assistance of counsel because Millbrandt did not adequately advise him as to the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court held the habeas trial on February 11, 2016, during which the court heard testimony from, among others: Millbrandt; Justin Conlon, an immigration attorney; Kenneth Simon, a retired public defender with\n   knowledge of the standard of care for criminal defense attorneys; Elisa Villa, a supervisory assistant public defender; and the petitioner. On May 25, 2016, the court issued an oral ruling from the bench. In relevant part, the court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the petitioner's claim that Millbrandt had rendered ineffective assistance: \"Millbrandt was aware of the immigration issues and it is clear from his testimony ... that he did, in fact, investigate, discuss and understand the immigration issues and immigration status of [the petitioner].... Millbrandt [met] the minimal standards of providing advice on the immigration issue to [the petitioner]. It does not, however, appear that [Millbrandt]\n   <em>\n    categorically advised\n   </em>\n   [the petitioner] that he would under any and all circumstances be deported to Jamaica if he accepted this guilty plea. He did, in fact, fall slightly short of that statement....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Nevertheless, [the petitioner] and his counsel did discuss the immigration issues numerous times. [Millbrandt] told [the petitioner]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   to assume that he would be deported.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, when making the decision as to whether to accept the plea bargain, he all but told him it would be ... a virtual certainty [that the petitioner would] be deported. He told him there was a substantial likelihood of deportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"It is clear that [the petitioner] and [Millbrandt] discussed the immigration issues early and often. In fact, [Millbrandt] reviewed the document that [Villa] had prepared, which parenthetically the court notes is a thorough summary of the issue for criminal practitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[Millbrandt] further indicated that he spoke with an immigration lawyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Millbrandt] indicated that he even discussed the immigration issues with the prosecutor, but the prosecutor was not interested or concerned about the immigration issues, nor is there any case law that suggests that a prosecutor has any duty to consider immigration implications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[Millbrandt] told the petitioner that there was a likelihood that he would be deported. It's a bit disingenuous at this point then for [the petitioner] to indicate he wasn't aware that by pleading to this case there could be adverse immigration effects upon his immigration status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"I will specifically find that the advice of [Millbrandt], while perhaps not as thorough as that suggested by [habeas] counsel for the petitioner, did meet the minimal standards of constitutional acceptability and that he did not violate the standard of care required of a criminal defense counsel operating within the state of Connecticut.\" (Emphasis added; footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, the court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus because the petitioner had failed to prove deficient performance, and subsequently denied further the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that because these issues are debatable among jurists of reason, a court could resolve the issues differently, and, therefore, the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Faced with a habeas court's denial of a petition for certification to appeal, a petitioner can obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus only by satisfying the two-pronged\n   test enunciated by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760025\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/178/\">\n    229 Conn. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20601\">\n    640 A.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), and adopted in\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/608/#p612\">\n    230 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%20126\">\n    646 A.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).

As part of his advice to the petitioner in relation to the plea deal and its effect on his immigration status, Millbrandt relayed to the petitioner that \"\n   <em>\n    anything is possible\n   </em>\n   with regard to the federal government that\n   <em>\n    they may decide to not take immigration action against him\n   </em>\n   or actually come and physically remove him but ... my advice to him was that in my opinion convictions of these ... charges would be drug trafficking offenses and [that] they would\n   <em>\n    render him deportable so we should assume that that would be the case\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Emphasis added.)

It is undisputed that a conviction under \u00a7 21a-278 (b) constitutes an aggravated felony and that federal immigration law mandates deportation for aggravated felonies, with limited exceptions that do not apply in the present case. Millbrandt testified that he was aware of this and therefore advised the petitioner that in relation to the immigration consequences he was facing, he should \"assume that he would be deported\" and that there was a \"substantial likelihood and probability\" or \"possibility\" of\n   deportation. He further counseled the petitioner that his conviction would render him \"deportable\" and explained that term to mean that \"deportation proceedings could be carried out against him.\" Millbrandt further testified that he did not advise the petitioner as to whether immigration authorities were mandated to deport him and that he did not advise the petitioner that, as a result of his guilty plea, his subsequent deportation was a virtual certainty and that he would be automatically deportable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On the basis of this testimony, the habeas court found that Millbrandt did not \"categorically [advise the petitioner] that he would under any and all circumstances be deported to Jamaica if he accepted [the] guilty plea.\" The court nonetheless concluded that Millbrandt's advice was constitutionally adequate under\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In light of our Supreme Court's articulation in\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the habeas court incorrectly concluded that Millbrandt's advice was constitutionally adequate. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   , Millbrandt was required to \"unequivocally convey to [the petitioner] that federal law mandated deportation as the consequence for pleading guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 322 Conn. at 512,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486196\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/243/\">\n    142 A.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court acknowledged, Millbrandt's advice \"fell slightly short\" of this. We agree with the petitioner that, instead, Millbrandt's advice inaccurately conveyed to the petitioner that he would have some chance of avoiding deportation after pleading guilty, and therefore counsel's advice did not meet the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   and applied by us in\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We therefore conclude that Millbrandt performed deficiently when he advised the petitioner in regard to the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The petitioner next argues that, as a result of counsel's deficient performance, he was prejudiced because\n   he would not have pleaded guilty had he been properly advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the record is inadequate for us to determine whether the petitioner proved prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As we previously stated,\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   requires that a petitioner prove both deficient performance and resulting prejudice, and thus a court can find against a petitioner on either ground.\n   <em>\n    Small\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960705\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/707/#p712\">\n    286 Conn. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%201203\">\n    946 A.2d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied sub nom.\n   <em>\n    Small\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lantz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20U.S.%20975\">\n    555 U.S. 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20S.%20Ct.%20481\">\n    129 S.Ct. 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20336\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). In the present case, the habeas court concluded that the petitioner had failed to satisfy the performance prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , and, therefore, it did not determine whether the petitioner also had failed to satisfy the prejudice prong. We recognize, as the parties have observed, that the habeas court did make certain factual findings that might be relevant to a prejudice analysis. Nevertheless, the habeas court failed to consider whether, if Millbrandt's performance was constitutionally deficient, \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for [that deficient performance], [the petitioner] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Flomo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , 169 Conn.App. at 278,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487925\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/185/#p278\">\n    149 A.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the question of prejudice presents a mixed question of fact and law, we cannot conclude whether the petitioner was prejudiced by Millbrandt's deficient performance without the habeas court's complete factual findings concerning the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice prong.\n   <em>\n    Small\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 717,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%201203\">\n    946 A.2d 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he application of historical\n   facts to questions of law that is necessary to determine whether the petitioner has demonstrated prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ... is a mixed question of law and fact subject to our plenary review\"); see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Daly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059443\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/111/397/#p400\">\n    111 Conn.App. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20A.2d%201040\">\n    960 A.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (\"it is well established that as an appellate tribunal, we do not find facts\"), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146056,4145164,4145310\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/909/\">\n    292 Conn. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%20108\">\n    973 A.2d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the habeas court abused its discretion when it denied the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal because a court could resolve the issues in a different manner.
