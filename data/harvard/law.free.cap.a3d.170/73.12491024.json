Strouse, Barbara M. Strouse, Mukesh H. Shah, Vibhavary M. Shah, Jai R. Singh, Sonali Singh, Dennis J. McEniry, and Joanne McEniry appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court sustaining in part the appeal of the plaintiffs, St. Joseph's High School, Inc. (school), and the Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp. (diocese), from the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Trumbull (commission) denying the school's request for a special permit pursuant to Article II, \u00a7 1.2.4.4, of the Trumbull Zoning Regulations (regulations).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendants contend that the court improperly concluded that the commission could not deny that request on the basis of noncompliance with general standards contained in the regulations. They further submit that substantial evidence in the record supports the commission's decision. We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At all relevant times, the diocese owned a parcel of land located in the AA residential zone and known as 2320 Huntington Turnpike in Trumbull (property). For more than half a century, the school has operated a private secondary school on the property. Although currently 53.95 acres in size, the property originally was significantly larger. Approximately two decades ago, the diocese sold a sizeable portion of the property to developers, on which neighboring residential homes\n   were constructed. The current owners of those adjacent properties are among those affected by the proposed special permit use at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Article II, \u00a7 1.2.4, of the regulations enumerates various special permit uses in the AA residential zone. Among such uses, as provided in \u00a7 1.2.4.4, are \"[c]hurches and other places of worship, including parish houses and Sunday School buildings;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   non-profit primary and secondary schools; and buildings housing personnel affiliated with said churches and schools.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to Article XVI, \u00a7 3, of the regulations, the commission is authorized \"after public notice and a hearing, to amend, change, or repeal these Regulations ....\" At the behest of the school, the commission, in August, 2014, exercised that authority by amending \u00a7 1.2.4.4 to permit the installation of lighting on athletic fields for nonprofit secondary schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since it became effective on September 10, 2014, that amendment has provided, in relevant part: \"Permanent and temporary light poles for lighted athletic fields on non-profit secondary school property shall be permitted for school related purposes only, provided: (a) The poles, lights and structures supporting such poles do not exceed a combined height of eighty (80) feet. (b) No such light structure shall be within two hundred (200) feet of an abutting residential property line. (c) Applicant shall submit a photometric plan at the time of application. (d) Lights must be shut off no later than 11:00 p.m. and applicant shall install an automated control system to ensure compliance. (e) All requirements of Article XV Special Permit/Special Exception shall be satisfied.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The commission, in enacting that amendment, formally complied with all applicable procedural requirements. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 ; Trumbull Zoning Regs., art. XVI, \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In accordance with \u00a7 1.2.4.4, as amended, the school filed an application for a special permit\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to permit the installation of four light poles, seventy feet in height, to illuminate the school's primary athletic field. In that application, the school stated, in relevant part, that \"[t]he fields and lights are well-buffered with mature landscaping and there will be no negative impact on the adjoining neighborhood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 17, 2014, the commission held a public hearing on the application. Attorney Raymond Rizio appeared on behalf of the school and detailed how the proposal complied with the technical requirements of \u00a7 1.2.4.4. He first noted that the light poles would be ten feet shorter than the maximum height permitted under \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (a), and would be at least 325 feet away from abutting residential property lines, in compliance with \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (b). Rizio also stated that the abutting residential properties were \"very well ... buffered with heavily wooded property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Consistent with \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (c), the school submitted a photometric plan to the commission. It also presented expert testimony on the impact of the proposed lighting by Mark Reynolds of Techline Sports Lighting, who indicated that, although there would be \"some light spillage\" around the athletic field, \"when you get 100 feet away from that field, it's going to be pretty much down to nothing.\" Rizio similarly remarked that \"the\n   readings\n   along the property lines basically measure zero, over 95 percent of the property line is zero or 0.1, which is one-tenth of a footcandle\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the property lines. And that's not taking into account ... all of the ... buffering that's up there with regard to the trees.\" (Footnote added.) The school's proposal also included the installation of an automated control system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rizio then noted certain general standards of Article XV that govern special permit applications, stating: \"[W]e believe that we will have no impact on the neighborhood, we believe that we satisfy all of your special permit standards, that the use is appropriate.... We certainly are willing to put strong conditions on the application to ensure there is going to be minimal impact with regard to lights and activity on the property.\" Rizio also addressed the appropriateness of the proposed use, stating that \"this is ... a high school. [It] has athletic events. The athletic events need ... [lighting on] the field, during minimal times .... We believe there is adequate buffering and controls.... [W]e greatly exceed the required distances from residential properties. The property is already naturally buffered .... [A]ll the light will be directed. The distances are more than adequate. We have given you a photometric plan that shows there will be absolutely no impact, light impact, on the neighboring properties. So, appropriateness of the use, impact on neighboring properties, we believe is absolutely minimal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After reminding the commission that it previously had approved the use of athletic fields on the property, Rizio submitted that the proposal presently before the commission was \"a completely harmonious accessory use [that] complements the current use of the athletic\n   fields.\" With respect to traffic considerations and the impact on residential properties, Rizio stated that \"the intensity of the operations involved\" with respect to \"both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the vicinity will not be hazardous. [There will be] no change in traffic plans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rizio acknowledged that, in granting a special permit, the commission has the authority to place reasonable restrictions on the proposed use. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a) (special permits may be subject \"to conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values\");\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"703029\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/176/581/#p594\">\n    176 Conn. 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20A.2d%201029\">\n    409 A.2d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) ( \u00a7 8-2\"expressly\" provides that \"commissions [are] authorized to impose conditions as a prerequisite to certain uses of land\"). He then articulated nine \"voluntary conditions\" that the school believed were appropriate restrictions on the special permit use in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rizio concluded by noting that\n   the school was proposing those conditions to \"make sure we conform not\n   only with the literal interpretation [of \u00a7 1.2.4.4], but [also] the spirit of the regulation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the public comment portion of the hearing, the commission heard both support for and opposition to the school's proposal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commission also received written correspondence from seventeen additional members of the public, all of whom opposed the proposal. The common thread running through the comments of those who spoke in opposition was a fervent belief that permitting major sporting events on the property at nighttime would adversely affect property values, public safety, the residential character of their neighborhood, and the use and enjoyment of their properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When public comment concluded, the school responded to certain concerns raised therein. It volunteered two additional conditions of approval pertaining to its proposed special permit use. First, it agreed not to play any music when the proposed lights were utilized. Second, the school agreed that use of \"the press box and the public announcement [system] at [night] games would only occur during boys' varsity football and boys' varsity lacrosse ....\" As to traffic concerns, Rizio noted that \"there's no more games being added to the [property]. There's no more games at all being added to [the school]. It's the exact same games. And they are both held at nonpeak hours.\" He thus submitted that \"[w]hether you have a Saturday football game or a Friday night football game, both games\" would have the\n   same impact on the neighborhood in terms of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Arguing that the school had \"satisfied all of the items required to achieve a special permit\" under \u00a7 1.2.4.4, Rizio asked the commission to grant the application, subject to the conditions that the school had proposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The commission then closed the public hearing and began its deliberations on the school's application. Commissioner Fred Garrity spoke first, remarking that he was \"hard-pressed to find things that the applicant did not do in this process or provide this evening.\" He also stated that \"some of the neighbors will never be happy if lights go up. It doesn't matter what we would do. The parking is going to overflow on busy days. They will park in those neighborhoods on public streets, which has occurred over time ... whether we put the lights up or not or allow it.\" Garrity thus opined that the school had met its obligations under \u00a7 1.2.4.4 and encouraged his colleagues to consider conditions of approval on its special permit application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Commissioner Anthony Silber spoke next, reminding the commission that it had \"voted for this text amendment unanimously.\" One commissioner later asked Attorney\n   Vincent Marino, who was in attendance in his capacity as town attorney, about the commission's ability to consider the proposal's compliance with general standards set forth in the regulations, such as the detrimental effect on the quality of life of neighboring property owners. In response, Marino reminded commission members that, while amending \u00a7 1.2.4.4 \"in August, one of the concerns that [was] raised is [whether] there were adequate protections through the special permit process to vote in the negative should the commission wish to vote in the negative because they did not want to find themselves in a position where, now that the regulation change was in place it was just going to be an automatic thing. And we had [an]\n   extensive conversation on the special permit process and specifically Article XV and the protections that are afforded the special permit process through Article XV.\" To accommodate the concerns of neighboring property owners, Silber suggested adding a condition prohibiting night games on Saturdays as well as Sundays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Commissioner David W. Preusch then opined that the central issue raised by the school's application was the impact of football games on the adjacent neighborhood, stating: \"I think what this boils [down to is] how do they handle parking? And where do they park? ... [That] is the real problem here .... That we need to address. And to me, it's not a couple [of] soccer games, it's not a lacrosse game.... [W]hat this boils down to is football games. So, [the] focus [is] on five occurrences in the fall.... So, we have four to five occasions a year in the fall every other week or whatever is the home [football] game.... I'm just wondering if there is something we can do about these games. And the problems that or issues that have been brought up, which, to me, has everything to do with the parking.\" In response, Silber noted that the school had proposed several voluntary conditions \"to try and mitigate\" the impact of the proposed use. He continued: \"[M]aybe there's some more that we could do there.... I am not sure what the right solution is, but I think for us it is about trying to find ways to protect the people who live on these streets and at the same time give the school the lights because I think it is the right thing to do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Commissioner Richard C. Deecken then addressed the proposal, prefacing his remarks with the observation that \"[t]his is a most difficult application ....\" Deecken noted that \"what we have here is, we are transferring the [load], we are transferring the intensity from one time to another, and if we all agree that intensity is no greater during a night game than it is during\n   a day game, then we are in agreement.... But again, what I want to know and what I need to be convinced on is, is the load being transferred from day to night significant enough to warrant a negative vote?\" Deecken also stated that, in his view, \"the problem of light still remains\" because, \"as we know, you can see lights from a long distance,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   whether during games or nightly practices. Silber then proposed restricting lighting for practice sessions to 8 p.m. In response to concerns voiced by neighboring property owners, Silber also proposed a blanket prohibition against the use of the lights on weekends. A motion then was made to amend Garrity's original motion \"to limit practices to 8 p.m. and eliminate weekend lights, flatly.\" That motion was unanimously approved.\n   Discussion then turned to the number of night football games that would be permitted each year. As Preusch noted, \"the varsity football games are the issue. It's not the soccer .... It's not the lacrosse. It's the crowds. It's the football games.\" Silber responded that the school was not increasing the number of football games on the property, but simply \"shifting the intensity\" from day to night. Preusch then noted that \"we are talking about the intensity of use here. And if we can cut the intensity of the expansion of use in half, that's what I am talking about. I am talking about a compromise.\" After further discussion, Deecken moved to amend the pending motion to limit the number of varsity football games to a \"[m]aximum of four games. Period.\" That motion was approved, with all commissioners but Garrity voting in favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At that time, Marino raised \"a point of order.\" Marino reminded commission members that a prerequisite to\n   the granting of a special permit was a specific finding by the commission pursuant to Article XV, \u00a7 4.14 (1), of the regulations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   as to the impact of the proposed use on surrounding residential neighborhoods. Marino further explained that \"you have to incorporate that [finding] into your [primary] motion because it is required by your regulation.... If you vote negatively [on the primary motion] then it's a negative finding [and] if you vote affirmatively it's a positive finding\" as to the impact on surrounding neighborhoods. In what the transcript suggests was a chaotic part of deliberations, commissioners expressed confusion as to the mechanics of implementing such a finding while at the same time discussing the merits thereof. At one point, Silber explained to his colleagues that Marino \"is saying we have to say it explicitly. It's got to be part of the motion.... So, we are amending the motion to include that passage.\" When Anthony G. Chory, as chairman of the commission, ultimately called the question, he stated, \"all in favor to amend the motion?\" That motion to carried by a vote of three to two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chory then called the motion to approve the school's special permit application, as amended several times. Silber and Garrity voted in favor of the motion, while Chory and Preusch voted against. Deecken abstained. As a result, the motion failed by virtue of the tie vote. The commission at that time articulated no reasons for that decision. See\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1574199\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/153/574/#p576\">\n    153 Conn. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=219%20A.2d%20445\">\n    219 A.2d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966) (\"[i]n such a case [as a tie vote] the board, as a body, [can] give no reason for its failure to act although the result [amounts] to a rejection of the application\"). Rather, it immediately adjourned the meeting following the final vote. Both the legal notice subsequently published by the commission and the written notice sent to the school confirmed that the application had been \"denied\" by the commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a timely appeal of that decision with the Superior Court, arguing that the school's application fully complied with all applicable special permit\n   requirements and that the commission's decision was not substantially supported by the record. The defendants filed a motion to intervene as statutorily aggrieved owners of abutting property, which the court granted. Although the plaintiffs and the defendants subsequently filed briefs on the substantive questions before the court, the commission did not do so. Rather, the commission filed a one sentence statement noting that it \"takes no position in favor of the plaintiffs or the intervening defendants in this administrative appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court held a hearing on October 19, 2015, at which all counsel agreed that the school's special permit application satisfied the technical requirements of Article II, \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (a) through (d). Accordingly, the focus of the hearing was on compliance with \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (e), which provides that \"[a]ll requirements of Article XV Special Permit/Special Exception shall be satisfied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During the hearing, the court repeatedly asked counsel to identify the \"known and fixed\" and \"clear and definite\" standards contained in Article XV. In response, all counsel acknowledged that no such specificity was contained therein. Because Article II, \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (e), specifically provides that \"[a]ll requirements of Article XV ... shall be satisfied,\" the defendants' counsel nonetheless argued that the commission could predicate its decision on the general standards set forth in Article XV. The court, however, distinguished that last subsection of \u00a7 1.2.4.4 from its predecessors, stating that \"[i]f there are general guidelines here [in Article XV], they can be the subject of health, safety and welfare conditions.\" The court later expounded on that distinction as follows: \"An appeal could, I think, be sustained in part, to the extent [that the plaintiffs] comply with [the technical requirements of \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (a) through (d) ] and\n   [with respect to \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (e) ]\n   the commission [could be] told to impose conditions related to health, safety and welfare that are site specific and protect the health, safety, welfare and property values ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court did precisely that. It noted that the record of the public hearing \"unambiguously reveals that the applicant's proposal meets the [technical requirements] set forth in Article II, \u00a7 1.2.4.4, subparagraphs (a) through (d).\" The court then turned its attention to Article XV of the regulations, the requirements of which must be satisfied pursuant to \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (e). It stated, in relevant part: \"Article XV, \u00a7 4.14, deals with uses adjacent to or impacting residential areas. Although the section does not contain any specific standards or requirements, it does provide a guidepost for the commission, as it seeks to evaluate conditions which should be adopted, before a special permit application is approved.... A review of \u00a7 4.14 ... demonstrates that certain 'findings' are required of the commission, when considering a special permit application which impacts a residential area. Because every special permit application is site specific, the nature and character of abutting properties must be considered when evaluating a specific proposal. Conditions imposed on a special permit may be designed to limit the impact on surrounding properties, and may be designed to preserve the residential character of a community. However, since Article XV, \u00a7 4.14,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   contains no definite standards with which a prospective\n   applicant must comply, it cannot serve as the sole basis for denying a special permit application, where all of the known and definite standards in the regulation in question have been satisfied. To permit the denial of an application on the basis such as a finding that it is 'detrimental to the character of a residential district' is inconsistent with the administrative nature of the special permit review. When reviewing a special permit, a commission cannot act legislatively, or quasijudicially.... Because the application submitted by the [school] satisfies each of the known and definite standards in the regulation, the plaintiffs' appeal must be sustained.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citations omitted; footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court thus sustained the plaintiffs' appeal in part, concluding that the commission should have granted the special permit due to the school's compliance with the technical requirements of \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (a) through (d). The court remanded the matter to the commission with direction \"to approve the special permit as requested, subject to such conditions as are necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values.\" The defendants thereafter filed a petition for certification to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ), which this court granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Preliminarily, we note that \"[t]he function of a special permit is to allow a property owner to use his property in a manner expressly permitted under the zoning regulations, subject to certain conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience, and surrounding property values.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Whisper Wind Development Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327955\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/32/515/#p525\">\n    32 Conn.App. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=630%20A.2d%20108\">\n    630 A.2d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (\n   <em>\n    Dupont, C.J.\n   </em>\n   , dissenting), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760062\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/176/\">\n    229 Conn. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20100\">\n    640 A.2d 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). \"The basic rationale for the special permit [is] ... that while certain [specially permitted] land uses may be generally compatible with the uses permitted as of right in particular zoning districts, their nature is such that their precise location and mode of operation must be regulated because of the topography, traffic problems, neighboring uses, etc., of the site. Common specially permitted uses, for example, are hospitals, churches and schools in residential zones. These uses are not as intrusive as commercial uses would be, yet they do generate parking and traffic problems that, if not properly planned for, might undermine the residential character of the neighborhood. If authorized only upon the granting of a special permit which may be issued after the [zoning commission] is satisfied that parking and traffic problems have been satisfactorily worked out, land usage in the community can be more flexibly arranged than if schools, churches and similar uses had to be allowed anywhere within a particular zoning district, or not at all.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Barberino Realty &amp; Development Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546484\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/607/#p612\">\n    222 Conn. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%201205\">\n    610 A.2d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).

Accordingly, the only issue before the Superior Court was whether the commission properly could predicate its decision on compliance with general standards contained in Article XV of the regulations, as required by Article II, \u00a7 1.2.4.4 (e). The court answered that query in the negative, stating that those general standards \"cannot serve as the sole basis for denying a special permit application ....\" That determination, the defendants argue, constitutes a departure from established law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, our analysis begins with an overview of the pertinent land use jurisprudence of this state.

Following a public hearing, the commission denied the plaintiff's application, finding, inter alia, that the proposed apartments \"would affect the mode of living in the area by creating problems of safety for children\"; that \"the limitation of privacy due to the increase of traffic would tend to decrease the value of surrounding homes\"; and \"that the proposed use is not in harmony with the intent of\n   the commission which wrote the regulations.\" Id., at 676,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20886\">\n    192 A.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, our Supreme Court upheld the propriety of the commission's decision, stating, in relevant part, that \"[t]he commission's power to stipulate such restrictions as appear to it to be reasonable and the minimum necessary to protect property values in the district as a whole and the public health, safety and welfare, necessarily implies the power to withhold its approval of the proposed use in its entirety if the commission finds that the circumstances warrant that action.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

If, during the exercise of its discretion, the zoning commission decides that all of the standards enumerated in the special permit regulations are met, then it can no longer deny the application.

Strouse, submitted that the noise described previously by many of his neighbors \"will unequivocally erase the peaceful environment and the natural surroundings that we invested in when we made the decision to live here.... It doesn't matter how tall these lights are ... with the lights and the night games comes the noise ....\" Jeffrey W. Strouse implored the commission to remember that the matter before it pertained to the backyards of residential neighbors, stating: \"[W]ho here among us would want that in her backyard? And when I say backyard, again, just to emphasize this. This is not over the hill, across the pond and past grandma's house. This is in my backyard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition to that testimony during the public comment portion of the hearing, the commission received written letters from seventeen other neighboring residential property owners, all of whom expressed the concern that \"nightly practices and football games at [the school] will lead to sound ... pollution ... and an overall deterioration of our quality of life ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   During the rebuttal portion of the public hearing, Rizio proposed two additional conditions regarding \"the\n   noise issue.\" First, the school agreed to a condition prohibiting any music to be played \"while the lights [are] on ....\" Second, the school agreed to a restriction that \"the press box and the public announcement [system] at [night] games would only occur during boys' varsity football and boys' varsity lacrosse ....\" The question, then, becomes whether those additional conditions or others adequately addressed the noise problems detailed at length by neighboring property owners, sufficient to warrant a finding of compliance with \u00a7 4.12.

Access, parking ... shall be designed so as to protect the residential character of surrounding residential neighborhoods or residential zones.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   At the public hearing, multiple residential property owners raised concerns about the detrimental impact that moving the school's major sporting events from daytime to nighttime would have on their neighborhood. The commission heard testimony from many members of the public detailing the parking and traffic issues that frequently arise when major sporting events such as football games are held on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Related to those traffic and parking concerns is the problem of loitering and disruptive behavior within the residential neighborhood, which transpires on a regular basis when major sporting events are held on the property. Multiple neighbors shared their personal experience with youths loitering in the neighborhood following such events at the school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another neighboring property owner told the commission that those parking, traffic, and loitering problems all present safety issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   During his rebuttal on behalf of the\n   school, Rizio acknowledged that \"loitering is a police issue ....\"\n   As our Supreme Court has explained, \"before the zoning commission can determine whether the specially permitted use is compatible with the uses permitted as of right in the particular zoning district, it is required to judge whether any concerns, such as parking or traffic congestion, would adversely impact the surrounding neighborhood.\"\n   <em>\n    Barberino Realty &amp; Development Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546484\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/607/#p612\">\n    222 Conn. at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%201205\">\n    610 A.2d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of the testimony elicited at the public hearing, the commission, in its discretion, reasonably could have concluded that the school had not established (1) that its proposed use adequately avoided nonresidential traffic through residential streets, as required by Article XV, \u00a7 4.12; (2) that nighttime pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from and in the vicinity of the use \"will not be hazardous or inconvenient to, or detrimental to the character\" of the abutting residential neighborhood, as required by \u00a7 4.14; (3) that, with respect to access and parking, the design of the proposed use adequately protected the residential character of surrounding residential neighborhoods or residential zones, as required by \u00a7 4.14; and/or (4) that the proposed use would not exacerbate \"special problems of ... police protection inherent in the proposed use,\" as required by \u00a7 4.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Quality of Life, Character of Neighborhood And Property Values\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Article XV also contains several provisions related generally to the character of nearby residential neighborhoods and the quality of life therein. In setting forth standards as to the appropriateness of a proposed use on a given property, \u00a7 4.12 requires the commission to find, inter alia, that the proposed use \"will not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent\n   properties\" and will preserve \"the character of the neighborhood ....\" Section 4.13 similarly requires the commission, in acting on a special permit application, to consider whether the design of the proposed use will adversely \"impact the character or quality of life on adjoining properties, in the neighborhood ....\" Section 4.14 (1), in turn, requires a finding by the commission as to whether \"[a]ccess, parking ... lighting ... and landscaping [are] designed so as to protect the residential character of surrounding residential neighborhoods ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Article XV also requires the commission to make findings with respect to the impact of the proposed use on neighboring property values. Pursuant to \u00a7 4.12, the commission must find that the proposed use \"will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or impair the value thereof ....\" Section 4.12 further requires the commission to evaluate \"the overall impact on neighborhood property values ....\" Section 4.13 likewise provides that the design of the proposed use \"shall not be detrimental to property values in the neighborhood ....\" Last, \u00a7 4.14 (3) requires the commission to find that the proposed use \"will not hinder or discourage the appropriate ... use of adjacent land ... or impair the value thereof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We have already detailed numerous issues raised by neighboring property owners\n   at the public hearing regarding the impact of noise and light emissions, inadequate buffering, traffic, parking, and special problems inherent in the school's proposed use stemming from the influx of pedestrian and vehicular traffic in their neighborhood during major sporting events at the school. That evidence all bears directly on the quality of life, character of neighborhood, and property value standards contained in Article XV.\n   In addition, the commission heard testimony specifically addressing the character of the abutting residential neighborhood and the quality of life of its residents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Helga Beloin, who stated that she lives across the street from the Shahs, explained to commission members how the proposed use would adversely affect the quality of life for nearby residents. She recounted her firsthand experience with noise emissions, parking problems, loitering, and disruptive behavior in the neighborhood on days when major sporting events are held at the school. Although she tolerated such activity during the daytime, she explained why allowing that activity at night would harm her and other neighbors, stating that when the evening \"rolls around, it's over.... [W]e're all getting ready for bed ... it's quiet [and] we can do it .... We retired for the night, went to bed, started our new day, you know, refreshed from a good night's sleep.

And we do it. I haven't called the police like other people have because it didn't happen so often that I felt like I needed to. But I'm afraid with the lights on a Friday night or Saturday night, [I] will. There's also a lot of traffic with the kids, you know, hanging out longer on the corner, with their blaring music.

Those [six to seven] houses, they also have neighbors, they have houses across the street. You bring the price of one house down, exponentially, the whole neighborhood will go down. People, when they [consider purchasing a home] nowadays, they look at what's the house [values] on each of the lanes. They don't pay attention that this house has a flaw in terms of being exposed, they look at that one price and the whole neighborhood will come down.\" On a similar note, Jeffrey W. Strouse reminded the commission that a principal purpose of the regulations, memorialized in the preamble thereto, was \"to preserve and protect\" property values. Trumbull Zoning Regs., art.
