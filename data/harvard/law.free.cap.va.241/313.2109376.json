Jones conveyed an 18-acre parcel of land, subject to their life estates therein, to their daughter Leola J. Jeffress and her husband, Henry R. Jeffress, as tenants by the entireties, with right of survivorship as at common law. Upon Emma Jones\u2019 subsequent death, Robert Jones became the sole life tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">On May 9, 1986, upon receipt of a United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>vice (ASCS) form signed by Jones purporting to sell the farm\u2019s flue-cured tobacco allotment and quota (collectively the tobacco quota)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Garland Stith, the local ASCS office transferred record ownership of the tobacco quota to Stith. The form indicated that Stith, who had been leasing the farm from Jones and raising tobacco on it, was the \u201coperator\u201d and that Jones was the owner of the \u201cselling farm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The local ASCS office records also listed Jones as the owner of the farm. ASCS personnel are not required to examine the records in the local clerk\u2019s office to verify ownership of the land covered by tobacco quotas. Accordingly, they customarily do not do so, and did not do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Stith paid for the tobacco quota with two checks payable to Jones that were endorsed later by Jones and his daughter, Leola J. Jeffress. The first check bore the notation \u201cFor Payment of tobacco\u201d and the second check, \u201cPayment in full for tobacco allotment Bought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">After Jones\u2019 death in the summer of 1988, the Jeffresses went to the local ASCS office to have the tobacco quota registered in their names because they were then the fee simple owners of the land. They were unsuccessful because Stith, claiming to have purchased the entire tobacco quota and not just a life interest therein, refused to sign the documents necessary to transfer the quota to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Consequently, the Jeffresses filed this suit in equity to \u201cvoid\u201d the sale of their remainder interest in the quota and to obtain a decree compelling Stith to execute the necessary documents to enable them to register the quota in their names. Leola Jeffress died after this suit was filed, but before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Finding that Jeffress was \u201cnot entitled to the allotment purchased by [Stith],\u201d the court entered judgment for Stith. Jeffress appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">A review of the legislation establishing tobacco quotas and authorizing their transfer is necessary to understand the issue. In most cases, flue-cured tobacco quotas are issued to a farm based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>on its past history of raising tobacco. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(b) (1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, as we recently noted, \u201cacreage allotments under the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the applicable regulations run with the land.\u201d <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Peckinpaugh, </em>241 Va. 172, 177, 400 S.E.2d 201, 204 (1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">If a quota is transferred, the \u201cland in the farm from which the entire tobacco allotment or quota has been transferred shall not be eligible\u201d for another allotment or quota for the five years following such transfer. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314d(d) (1988). Any tobacco sold that is \u201cin excess of the marketing quota for the farm on which the tobacco is produced . . . shall be subject to a penalty of 75 per centum of the average market price ... for such kind of tobacco for the immediately preceding marketing year.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314(a) (1988). As one court observed after describing a similar penalty for exceeding a federal rice marketing quota, \u201c[bjecause of the penalty provision, it is economically infeasible to grow rice without sufficient acreage allotment.\u201d <em>First Victoria Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em>443 F.Supp. 865, 867 (S.D. Tex. 1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>620 F.2d 1096 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The statute and regulation permit tobacco quotas to be transferred if \u201cthe owner\u201d of the covered farm signs the appropriate ASCS form. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 723.216(a)(2)(iii)(B) (1990); <em>see 1 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1314b(g) (1988). However, neither the statute nor the regulation mentions remainder interests in farm properties subject to tobacco quotas. Nor do they contain definitions of the word \u201cowner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In the absence of further explanation, we assume that Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture intended to adopt for the word \u201cowner\u201d \u201cits ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used. \u2018Owner\u2019 is a word of general purport, but its primary meaning, as applied to land, is \u2018one who owns the fee and who has the right to dispose of the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Loyola Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc, </em>v. <em>Herndon Lumber &amp; Millwork, Inc., </em>218 Va. 803, 805, 241 S.E.2d 752, 753 (1978) (citations omitted). This construction is consistent with the well-established law in Virginia that a life tenant can transfer no more than his life interest. <em>E.g., Grubb </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>174 Va. 204, 210, 5 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1939); <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>147 Va. 1030, 1040, 133 S.E. 581, 584-85 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>However, Stith contends that because federal law controls this dispute, Jeffress is bound by the local ASCS office personnel\u2019s construction of the word \u201cowner\u201d in the regulation authorizing the sale of the tobacco quota. We do not agree for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">First, any construction of a statute or regulation that would make either unconstitutional should be avoided. <em>See Ocean View Improvement Corp. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., </em>205 Va. 949, 955, 140 S.E.2d 700, 704 (1965) (in construing ambiguous statute, Court should adopt constitutional rather than unconstitutional interpretation). And, a statute that authorized a life tenant to dispose of a remainderman\u2019s property interest in a tobacco quota would be unconstitutional as a violation of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and Article One, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia. <em>See Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976) (Due Process Clause of Federal Constitution protects property interest of recipient of Social Security disability benefits); <em>School Bd. of the City of Norfolk </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>234 Va. 32, 38-39, 360 S.E.2d 325, 328 (1987) (Due Process Clause of Virginia Constitution protects property interest of tort-feasor under statute of repose); <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Hiden, </em>117 Va. 289, 298, 84 S.E. 664, 667 (1915) (if statute authorized court to order sale of entire estate, over vested <em>sui juris </em>remaindermen\u2019s protest, statute would violate Due Process Clause). Therefore, we construe the statute and regulation as requiring that all farm owners, including remaindermen, join in a sale of the entire tobacco quota.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Second, \u201c[i]n most fields of activity [the Supreme Court] has refused to find federal pre-emption of state law in the absence of either a clear statutory prescription, or a direct conflict between federal and state law.\u201d <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>United Technologies, Inc., </em>487 U.S. 500, 504 (1988) (citations omitted). Stith\u2019s construction requires us to find that the federal statute and regulation preempt a long-standing principle of property law in Virginia. We find no such clear statutory prescription, nor do we see a direct conflict between the applicable federal statute and regulation and the law in Virginia. Instead, we think that Congress intended to defer to state property law in determining who could sell an entire tobacco quota. Accordingly, we conclude that a life tenant cannot sell a remainderman\u2019s interest in the quota.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Even so, Stith argues that the Jeffresses lost their remainder interest in the quota by failing to register that interest in the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ASCS office and by Leola Jeffress\u2019 endorsements of the checks to her father. We find no merit in either contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The federal statute contains no provision for recording future interests in real property subject to tobacco quotas. The recordation of the deed from the Joneses to the Jeffresses in the Clerk\u2019s Office of the Circuit Court of Greensville County was sufficient to charge Stith with notice of the Jeffresses\u2019 interest therein. Code \u00a7 55-96; <em>Chavis </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>198 Va. 379, 382, 94 S.E.2d 195, 197 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Nor is Jeffress bound by Leola Jeffress\u2019 accommodation endorsement of her father\u2019s check to enable him to cash it at her bank. Neither check noted that it was given in payment of the entire tobacco quota. Absent such notations, Leola Jeffress could have assumed that her father was selling only his life interest in the tobacco quota.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We hold that Stith acquired nothing more than Jones\u2019 life interest in the tobacco quota. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\"> In general, the allotment for tobacco represents the acreage of each tobacco farm authorized for the quota. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314c(a)(4) (1988). The \u201cfarm marketing quota\u201d is determined by multiplying the maximum number of pounds of tobacco authorized to be grown on each allotted acre by the number of allotted acres. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314c(a)(8) (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> A minimum marketing quota is allocated to qualifying farms upon which tobacco has not been raised in the preceding five years. 7 U.S.C \u00a7 1313(b) (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
