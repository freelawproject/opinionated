[sjhall excuse from attendance at school any pupil who, together with his parents, by reason of bona fide religious training or belief, is conscientiously opposed to attendance at school.\u201d On October 12, 1988, the School Board of Prince William County (the School Board or the Board) denied the application of F. Tracy Johnson and Kathleen Johnson (the Johnsons) for religious exemption from attendance at school for their two sons, Jelfrey, aged six, and Brandon, aged five.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-87, the Johnsons filed a petition for judicial review. On January 16, 1990, the trial court sustained the action of the School Board, and we granted the Johnsons an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Code \u00a7 22.1-254 provides that all children between the ages of five and seventeen shall attend school.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Parents may satisfy the requirement of this Code section by sending their child to \u201ca public school or ... a private, denominational or parochial school,\u201d by having the child \u201ctaught by [an approved] tutor or teacher,\u201d or by providing \u201cfor home instruction of [the] child as described in \u00a7 22.1-254.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\">Code \u00a7 22.1-254.1 outlines the requirements for home instruction and provides that \u201c[w]hen the requirements of this section have been satisfied, instruction of children by their parents in their home is an acceptable alternative form of education.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsection D of \u00a7 22.1-254.1 provides, however, that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall prohibit a pupil and his parents from obtaining an excuse from school attendance by reason of bona fide religious training or belief pursuant to \u00a7 22.1-257 of this Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">As noted previously, Code \u00a7 22.1-257(A)(2) provides that a school board shall excuse from attendance at school \u201cany pupil who, together with his parents, by reason of bona fide religious training or belief, is conscientiously opposed to attendance at school.\u201d But \u201cthe term \u2018bona fide religious training or belief does not include essentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-257(C). Once it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>determined, however, that a child is entitled to a religious exemption under Code \u00a7 22.1-257, \u201c[t]he provisions of [the compulsory school attendance law] shall not apply.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-256(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\">The parties to this appeal agree that the provisions of the compulsory school attendance law control the disposition of the case. In reaching a decision, therefore, we will not consider the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States or art. I, \u00a7 16 of the Constitution of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Johnsons contend the trial court erred in refusing to find that the School Board exceeded its authority, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused its discretion in denying their children religious exemption under Code \u00a7 22.1-257.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Johnsons argue that \u201c[b]y virtue of the legislative policy embodied in \u00a7 22.1-257 (A)(2),\u201d school boards in considering religious exemption claims may only inquire whether the beliefs of the claimants are religious in character and are bona fide.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Continuing, the Johnsons argue that, despite the limited inquiry permitted under the legislative policy embodied in Code \u00a7 22.1-257(A)(2), both the School Board and the trial court applied a two-pronged test. This test, the Johnsons maintain, improperly required them to show not only that their beliefs were religious in character and were bona fide but also that the beliefs could not be accommodated by the alternatives to public school attendance available under the compulsory school attendance law. Application of the second prong was erroneous, the Johnsons maintain, because parents who \u201chome educate their children out of the religious convictions stated in [Code \u00a7 22.1-257] are not subject to government control\u201d and, hence, cannot be required to prove that their \u201cbeliefs are violated by the . . . home school law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The School Board \u201cnever stated its reasons\u201d for denying exemption, the Johnsons say, and this failure is itself evidence of arbitrariness;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> furthermore, any concerns the Board may have had about \u201cthe substantive education\u201d of the Johnson children, while perhaps \u201centirely altruistic, [were] <em>ultra vires </em>nonetheless.\u201d The Johnsons opine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The state legislature has not given local school boards general jurisdiction over the education of all children living within the school district. Children may attend unregulated private religious schools without the advice or consent of the public school board. Children may be home educated in an unregulated religious home education program as well. Particular school boards may wish it were not so, but the legislature has decided otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">Hence, the Johnsons conclude, the sole test for determining entitlement to exemption under Code \u00a7 22.1-257 is whether those seeking exemption are conscientiously opposed to attendance at school by reason of bona fide religious training or belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">We will agree with the Johnsons that the sole test is the bona fides of their religious beliefs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We will also agree that, <em>in the trial court, </em>the School Board\u2019s counsel argued for the two-pronged test. Further, we will agree that the trial court held that the two-pronged test was applicable. We do not agree, however, that, <em>in disposing of the Johnsons\u2019 application for exemption, </em>the School Board applied the two-pronged test. Rather, we think the record shows the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In the trial court, one of the points of discussion was an opinion of the Attorney General of Virginia, dated November 26, 1984, which stated that the two-pronged test was the appropriate standard for determining entitlement to religious exemption under Code \u00a7 22.1-257(A)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the record shows that one week before the School Board held a hearing on the Johnsons\u2019 application, Robert W. Bendall, counsel for the school board staff, forwarded a report on the application to the division superinten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>dent of schools.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In his report, Bendall stated that he found \u201cno statutory basis for the Attorney General\u2019s opinion that a school board must determine whether statutory equivalence of public school attendance meet[s] the needs of parental religious objections.\u201d Counsel stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-3\">Accordingly, based upon the information obtained, I am of the opinion that the request of [the Johnsons] is purely religious, sincere and not based upon essential [ly] political, sociological or philosophical views nor merely a personal moral code. I would suggest that the Superintendent recommend to the School Board of Prince William County that it grant an exemption from compulsory attendance requirements to Jeffrey Johnson and Brandon Johnson, notwithstanding the Attorney General\u2019s opinion which appears, in my opinion, to be in conflict with Section 22.1-254.1 of the Code of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">At the hearing on the Johnsons\u2019 application, the School Board had the benefit of Bendall\u2019s views on the law applicable to the case. More important, at the beginning of the hearing, the chairman made a statement consistent with those views:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">This hearing is being held at your request in order that you may ask the School Board to grant a religious exemption for your child or children. If granted, this action will remove your responsibility of having your child attend public schools in Prince William County. <em>The law requires that the School Board determine whether or not your request is a bona fide religious request. If the School Board determines it is a bona fide religious request, we must grant your exemption. </em>The purpose of the hearing this evening is to determine whether or not it is a bona fide religious request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">(Emphasis added.) In this statement, the chairman fixed the ground rules for the hearing in accordance with the \u201csole test\u201d the Johnsons say the School Board should have applied. Nothing in the record indicates the Board departed from this standard at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>time in its deliberations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence, while the Board gave no reason for its denial of exemption, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the denial was made according to the ground rules and that it was based solely upon the Johnsons\u2019 failure to establish the bona fides of their religious beliefs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, to conclude otherwise would be to charge the School Board with duplicity \u2014 saying one thing and doing another \u2014 and the record would not support that sort of conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">Furthermore, while the trial court applied the two-pronged test, it held that the Johnsons had satisfied neither prong. Necessarily subsumed in this holding is the finding that the Johnsons had failed to satisfy the all-important first prong, <em>viz., </em>the bona fides of their religious beliefs. In these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s application of the second prong was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">With respect to the first prong, the trial court held that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supported the view that the Johnsons\u2019 beliefs were not bona fide religious but, rather, were \u201csociological and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>philosophical [or] political [or] personal.\u201d We agree with this holding, but would make a further observation about the John-sons\u2019 beliefs. From reading the testimony given by the Johnsons at the school board hearing, we have great difficulty in ascertaining what their beliefs really are, let alone in discerning whether, \u201cby reason of bona fide religious training or belief, [they are] conscientiously opposed to attendance at school.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-257(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">It was the Johnsons\u2019 position that, because of their religious beliefs, only they should teach their children and that the children should be taught only in their home. The strongest expressions of these beliefs appear in a letter Mr. Johnson wrote the School Board and in a statement he made at the school board hearing. In the letter, Johnson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">We are very excited to fulfill the command of God as stated in the scriptures. Namely, that we are gifted by God with our children (Psalm 127: 3 &amp; 4), and are to train them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. (See Deuteronomy 6: 4 - 7; 11: 18 - 22; Ephesians 6: 4; and Psalm 78: 5 - 7.) We believe the instruction of our children in any other way [than by the parents at home] would confuse them with conflicting philosophies, and divert their wholehearted devotion to Christ, which only a thorough Christian education can produce. (See Colossians 2: 8-10.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">At the hearing before the School Board, Johnson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">There\u2019s a scripture in Deuteronomy that talks about teaching your children as you are sitting in the home and as you are walking along the way and as you rise up and as you go to bed and we just believe that there is no way that we can accomplish that if the kids aren\u2019t with us and that in order to have a rounded education and Godly based education they must be with us and we must be with them and if they were in another school setting than ours, another school setting than what we could give in the home then it wouldn\u2019t be what the Lord guided and commanded of us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Yet, when given an opportunity to explain how the need to educate his children at home emanated from religious rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>philosophical or personal beliefs, Johnson gave a most unsatisfactory answer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">Furthermore, the Johnsons acknowledged that they had \u201ca physical education specialist teaching [the children] every other week.\u201d Mr. Johnson said he and Mrs. Johnson had \u201cno problem with that\u201d because they had given \u201cthe man special authority\u201d to teach the children physical education. The Johnsons also used the \u201cspecial authority\u201d notion to justify permitting others to instruct the children, \u201cat the proper time,\u201d in subjects such as calculus and physics which the Johnsons themselves would be unable to teach.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Concerning this obvious inconsistency in the Johnsons\u2019 beliefs, the trial judge, in announcing his decision to deny religious exemption, made the following statement directed to Mr. Johnson, who was present in the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">You look at it. To me, the biggest point is that dichotomy, if that\u2019s the correct word, that business about your feeling that it must be done, this home teaching must be done exclusively by you on the one hand, yet on another hand it can be turned over to someone else. It all depends on the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">It really looks to me like the complaint there is not who does the teaching, but whether or not the state can interfere with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">And this anti-state interference, is that a religious doctrine? I have difficulty, personally, deciding whether it is or not, but it seems to me like the School Board could consider that as much a political or a philosophical difference as it is a religious difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">You complain through [out] the transcript of the absence of teaching of godly principles in public schools. Is that a religious, really, a religious complaint or really a preference for the type of subject the school should teach on your part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>But I think [the members of the School Board] could find, and I believe they did find, or at least there is evidence to support it, which is all I have to find, that the basic reasons for wanting to teach your children at home is not based on religious but personal belief that you can do a better job than the public school system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-3\">The record fully supports the trial court\u2019s analysis of the case and its ultimate finding that the Johnsons\u2019 opposition to their children\u2019s attendance at school was not \u201cby reason of bona fide religious training or belief [but, rather, by reason of] essentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-257(A)(2) and (C). Accordingly, we will affirm the court\u2019s action in sustaining the School Board\u2019s denial of religious exemption in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\"> Effective July 1, 1990, Code \u00a7 22.1-254 was amended to require that all children attend school until their eighteenth birthday.

Also, after each school year, the parent must submit \u201ceither (i) evidence that the child has attained a composite score above the fortieth percentile on a battery of achievement tests which have been approved by the Board of Education for use in the public schools or, (ii) an evaluation or assessment which, in the judgment of the division superintendent, indicates that the child is achieving an adequate level of educational growth and progress.\u201d Code \u00a7 22.1-254.1(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Neither of the Johnsons has a baccalaureate degree. Hence, neither can qualify to provide home instruction under classification (i) of Code \u00a7 22.1-254.1(A).

The record discloses nothing, however, about the beliefs of the Johnson children, although the question was raised at the school board hearing on the Johnsons\u2019 application. This omission, we assume, results from the fact the children are of such tender years that they have not developed any religious beliefs one way or the other on the question whether they should attend school or be educated at home by their parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b385-13\"> The Attorney General issued another opinion on the subject under date of November 18, 1988. The opinion appears to reiterate the two-pronged test. Interestingly, however, the Johnsons rely upon the 1988 opinion, saying that in the opinion the Attorney General \u201cwholeheartedly agrees with the analysis which [the Johnsons] have offered to this Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> It should be noted that counsel for the school board staff was not the same person as counsel for the School Board.

Neither letter detracts from the statement made in the text that \u201c[n]othing in the record indicates the Board departed from [the] standard [enunciated by the board chairman] at any time in its deliberations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\"> The Johnsons contend that the School Board \u201cacted contrary to the established principles of constitutional law in evaluating the [Johnsons\u2019] religious exemption claims.\u201d The Johnsons argue that it was improper for the Board to question them in an effort to understand their beliefs and to inquire into the practices and beliefs of other members of their church with respect to home schooling. In support of this argument, the Johnsons cite several First Amendment decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. The John-sons specifically state on brief, however, that \u201cthis is <em>not </em>a First Amendment case.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The Johnsons also argue that the School Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because it was based upon matters they say were irrelevant, such as their ability to instruct the children at home, the curriculum they would employ, and the lack of \u201csocial interchange\u201d in home instruction. The School Board was not bound, however, to accept without question the Johnsons\u2019 bald statement that their beliefs were religious in nature and sincerely held. Rather, the Board could properly test the bona fides of the situation by further inquiry. In determining whether the inquiry was arbitrary and capricious, the issue is not the content of the specific questions posed but whether the Board departed from the appropriate standard in making its decision. As stated by the Board chairman at the outset of the hearing, the appropriate standard for determining the Johnsons\u2019 entitlement to religious exemption was the bona fides of their religious beliefs and, as explained in the text, nothing in the record indicates that the Board departed from this standard at any time in its deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\"> The record shows the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">Mr. Chendorain [a school board member]: [H]ow do you explain to me that this [belief you must teach the children at home] is not simply a philosophy but rather a bona fide religious belief . . .?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">Mr. Johnson: Well, a personal code would involve effort without faith and the scriptures say that without faith it\u2019s impossible to please God and so that would be the difference. Faith is what bona fides the religious content ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\"> The Johnsons make the further contention that the School Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because similarly situated persons have had their religious exemptions recognized. As the School Board points out, however, this point has not been properly preserved for appeal. Hence, we will not consider it. Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b390-5\">JUSTICE STEPHENSON, with whom JUSTICE RUSSELL and JUSTICE HASSELL join,</author>\n<p id=\"Agy\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">I agree with the majority that \u201cthe sole test is the bona fides of [the Johnsons\u2019] religious beliefs.\u201d I do not agree, however, that the record shows that the School Board applied that test in disposing of the Johnsons\u2019 application for exemption. To the contrary, the record clearly shows that the Board applied an erroneous two-pronged test.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">As the majority states, the School Board did not give its reasons for denying the Johnsons\u2019 request. However, following the Board\u2019s October 12, 1988 hearing, Joseph Dyer, the Board\u2019s attorney, wrote a letter, dated October 27, 1988, to the Johnsons\u2019 attorney which stated, in pertinent part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">As School Board attorney, I have been asked to respond to your inquiry for additional information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>[L]et me assure you that the Prince William County School Board members are genuinely concerned about the delicate question of religious exemptions.

The November 18, 1988 opinion of the Attorney General was considered, and it does not appear that [the Johnsons] meet the criteria contained in that opinion or the legal authorities cited therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The record shows that the School Board and its attorney considered and relied upon two Attorney General Opinions, both of which state, erroneously, that the two-pronged test is the appropriate standard for determining entitlement to an exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Moreover, the Board contended in the trial court, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and contends in this appeal, that the two-pronged test applies, and, as the majority concedes, \u201cthe trial court held that the two-pronged test was applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\">In spite of this, however, the majority concludes that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the Board erroneously applied the two-pronged test in disposing of the Johnsons\u2019 application. The majority focuses upon (1) a report by counsel for the school board <em>staff, </em>not the School Board\u2019s counsel, that was sent to the division superintendent of schools, not to the Board, and (2) a remark made by the School Board chairman at the beginning of the October 12, 1988 hearing. It is clear that the Board\u2019s attorney\u2019s opinion did not concur with the staffs attorney\u2019s opinion, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the Board relied upon the staffs attorney\u2019s opinion. Furthermore, it is not reasonable to assume that the other Board members relied upon the chairman\u2019s statement as an interpretation of the compulsory school attendance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">To further support its conclusion that the School Board based its decision solely upon the Johnsons\u2019 failure to establish the bona tides of their religious beliefs, the majority states that \u201cto conclude otherwise would be to charge the School Board with duplicity \u2014 saying one thing and doing another \u2014 and the record would not support that sort of conclusion.\u201d It is the conclusion reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>by the majority, however, that charges the School Board with duplicity \u2014 saying the Board applied the proper test at its hearing while admitting, as it must, that the Board advocated the improper two-pronged test at trial and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">It is clear from the record, therefore, that the School Board applied a more stringent test in making its decision than the one prescribed in Code \u00a7 22.1-257. It is equally clear that the trial court agreed with the School Board, concluding that \u201cit is a two-pronged test,\u201d requiring a \u201cbalancing\u201d of the parents\u2019 beliefs with various alternatives such as home instruction pursuant to Code \u00a7 22.1-254.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, because the School Board applied incorrect law, I submit that it exceeded its authority, acted arbitrarily, and abused its discretion. Code \u00a7 22.1-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Consequently, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case to the trial court with directions that the trial court remand it to the School Board for further proceedings. In the subsequent proceedings, the Board would consider only whether the Johnsons are conscientiously opposed to compulsory school attendance by reason of bona fide religious training or belief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\"> One of the opinions, dated November 26, 1984, states, in pertinent part, the following: A school board should first ascertain . . . that the parents\u2019 objection is based on a \u201c \u2018bona fide religious training or belief\u2019 \u201d and not on political, sociological, philosophical or purely personal views.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Parents who, for religious reasons, seek excusal from school attendance also must show to the local school board that public school attendance <em>and </em>its statutory equivalents, such as home instruction, do not accommodate their bona fide religious beliefs. <em>See </em>1983-1984 Report of the Attorney General at 305. Therefore, after a school board determines that the criteria for a \u201c \u2018bona fide religious . . . belief\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 22.1-257(C) have been met, it must determine whether the statutory equivalents of public school attendance meet the parents\u2019 religious objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">1984-1985 Report of the Attorney General 255, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The other opinion, dated November 18, 1988, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agh\">Section 22.1-257(A)(2) requires that a school board \u201cexcuse from attendance at school any pupil who, together with his parents, by reason of bona fide religious training or belief, is conscientiously opposed to attendance at school.\u201d Section 22.1-257(C) further provides that a \u201c \u2018bona fide religious training or belief does not include essentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>As discussed above, \u00a7 22.1-257(C) requires that a religious belief not be \u201cessentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\u201d Prior Opinions of this Office recognize the further requirement that parents who, for religious, reasons, seek a religious belief exemption from school attendance or home instruction also must show that school attendance <em>and </em>its statutory equivalents, including home instruction, do not accommodate their bona fide religious beliefs. <em>See </em>Att\u2019y Gen. Ann. Rep.: 1984-1985 at 255, 256; 1983-1984 at 305-06. I am in agreement with the conclusions in these Opinions that these are the criteria that should be applied in determining whether a religious exemption is warranted pursuant to \u00a7 22.1-257.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">1987-1988 Report of the Attorney General 330, 331-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"><em> </em>In its brief filed in the trial court, the School Board argued for the application of the two-pronged test and quoted, as supporting authority, the two Attorney General Opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> The majority states, however, that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s application of the second prong was harmless error.\u201d The majority misses the point. The error that cannot be rectified, absent a new hearing, was that committed by the School Board in applying the wrong law \u2014 the two-pronged test. Neither the trial court nor the majority can know whether each Board member rested his decision upon the first prong, the second prong, or both prongs. Thus, the harmless error doctrine cannot be applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b393-5\"> The trial court stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that the home instruction statute would \u201caccommodate [the parents\u2019] needs\u201d because the law \u201callows a parent a great latitude\u201d and is \u201cminimally intrusive [in the parents\u2019] right and their desire to teach their children in the way they think they should be taught.\u201d The trial court further opined that \u201cthe compelling governmental interest certainly allows this minimal intrusion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
