The trial court imposed the death penalty, and this Court affirmed both the conviction and the sentence. <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 314 S.E.2d 371 (1984) <em>(Stockton I). </em>The Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari. <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">On June 18, 1987, the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia found that Stockton had been denied a fair trial. This finding was based upon a prejudicial remark made by a third party in the presence of jurors during a luncheon recess in the sentencing phase of Stockton\u2019s trial. The district judge granted Stockton a writ of habeas corpus and ordered that he either be given a new sentencing hearing or sentenced to life imprisonment. <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>Civil Action No. 86-0106-D (W.D.Va. 1987). This order was affirmed on appeal, <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>852 F.2d 740 (4th Cir. 1988), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari, <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>489 U.S. 1071 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Upon return of the case to the Circuit Court of Patrick County, the court granted a change of venue and ordered that the new sentencing hearing be conducted in the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News. A jury in that court heard evidence both in aggravation and in mitigation and fixed Stockton\u2019s penalty at death. On July 30, 1990, the trial judge imposed the death penalty, and the matter is here for automatic sentence review pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">At the new sentencing hearing, the trial court informed prospective jurors that Stockton earlier had been found guilty of murder for hire and that the function of the new jury would be to determine an appropriate sentence for the defendant. Over Stockton\u2019s objection, a transcript of the testimony given during the guilt phase of Stockton\u2019s original trial was read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In brief, the testimony showed that in June of 1978, Stockton overheard Tommy McBride offer Randy Bowman $1,500 to kill Kenneth Arnder because of the latter\u2019s failure to pay McBride for drugs he had purchased. Stockton said he needed money and would kill Arnder for McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Arnder\u2019s mother last saw Kenneth alive on July 20, 1978, when he left her home with Stockton en route to Kibler Valley in Patrick County. On July 25, Kenneth Arnder\u2019s body was found in a remote area of Surry County, North Carolina. Arnder had been shot once between the eyes, and both his hands had been severed above the wrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Stockton admitted on at least three occasions that he killed Arnder. For example, in an admission to a cellmate during a period of confinement in 1980, Stockton stated that he killed Arnder because the latter \u201chad ripped somebody off for some drugs,\u201d that he had been hired to kill Arnder, and that the killing occurred at Kibler Valley in Patrick County, Virginia. Later, Stockton and the same cellmate \u201cgot in a fight.\u201d Stockton said \u201che\u2019d cut Arnder\u2019s hands off and he\u2019d do [the cellmate] the same way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">I. <em>Shackling of Stockton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Prior to the start of jury selection, Stockton was brought into the courtroom shackled around his ankles. Defense counsel told the trial court that he \u201cthought Mr. Stockton was going to be unshackled.\u201d When the sheriff stated he had been told Stockton \u201cwas an escape risk and security risk,\u201d the trial judge refused to order the shackles removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>After the luncheon recess, defense counsel informed the court that Stockton wished to remain in jail during the remainder of jury selection. Stockton was brought to the courtroom so he could discuss the issue with the court. He complained, among other things, about having to appear before the jury in shackles. During the discussion, he stated he wanted to discharge his counsel and represent himself. When the trial court indicated disapproval, Stockton called the judge a \u201ccrook\u201d and a \u201cvile son-of-a-bitch.\u201d The judge then ordered Stockton removed from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Thereafter, Stockton refused to return to the courtroom unless allowed to appear unshackled. The trial judge repeatedly told defense counsel that Stockton would be allowed to return if he agreed to conduct himself properly. On the second day following his removal, he was allowed to return to the courtroom, and he apparently remained unshackled for the remainder of the resentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Citing <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337 (1970), Stockton contends his appearance in shackles was inherently prejudicial to his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The shackling was especially prejudicial during his sentencing hearing, Stockton asserts, since the jurors would be required to determine whether he posed a future danger to society, and the trial court\u2019s refusal to order the shackles removed \u201cwas tantamount to a declaration . . . of [the court\u2019s] belief that Stockton did pose such a danger.\u201d Accordingly, Stockton says, his shackling in front of prospective jurors was prejudicial error requiring a new sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We disagree with Stockton. The basic reason for our disagreement is that \u201c \u2018a trial judge\u2019s decision to shackle a defendant is not per se unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>899 F.2d 883, 884 (9th Cir. 1990) (quoting <em>Spain </em>v. <em>Rushen, </em>883 F.2d 712, 716 (9th Cir. 1989)). \u201c[T]rial judges confronted with disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Further basis for our disagreement with Stockton is found in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267 (1986). There, on trial for the capital murder of a law enforcement officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Frye was \u201crestrained by chains or handcuffs . . . visible to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 345 S.E.2d at 276. He argued that being so restrained prejudiced him before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In rejecting Frye\u2019s argument, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">While we agree that requiring a defendant to stand trial in physical restraints may create prejudice in the minds of jurors by suggesting that the defendant is dangerous or that his guilt is a foregone conclusion, we also believe that in extraordinary cases such shackling of the defendant is necessary to protect the rights of those present in the courtroom and society at large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">A trial court may consider various factors in determining whether a defendant should be restrained, such as the seriousness of the charge, the defendant\u2019s temperament, age, and physical attributes, his criminal record, and any past escapes, escape attempts, or threatened misconduct. This determination need not be made upon a formal hearing, and the information upon which it is based need not be evidence formally offered and admitted at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 345 S.E.2d at 276 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">This rationale applies with equal force here. Indeed, considering that Stockton stood before the court already convicted of a capital offense, he had an enhanced motive to attempt an escape and, in the process, to injure anyone who stood in his way, be they court officials or spectators. Hence, there was more reason to restrain him. His offense was grave, he had a propensity for violent crime, and he had a record of escape. He also had previously cursed and made disparaging remarks about the trial judge. In short, this was one of those \u201cextraordinary cases [where] shackling of the defendant is necessary to protect the rights of those present in the courtroom and society at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 345 S.E.2d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">II. <em>Refusal to Exclude Prospective Juror for Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Stockton contends that the trial court erred in refusing to exclude for cause prospective juror William H. Savage. On voir dire, Savage stated that, two years earlier, his grandson had been shot and killed and that the killers had not been apprehended. Savage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>also said that he belonged to a group called \u201cFamily and Friends Against Crime Today,\u201d which was formed by Savage\u2019s wife and daughter to publicize the murders of the grandson and other young victims so the group could \u201csolve some of these murders.\u201d When asked if he would like to see his grandson\u2019s killers executed, Savage replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Stockton says that Savage\u2019s voir dire examination showed he was so biased and prejudiced that he was incapable of serving as an impartial juror. Hence, Stockton concludes, the trial court \u201ccommitted manifest error in not excluding [Savage].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We do not agree. Whether a prospective juror stands indifferent to the cause is a matter for the exercise of discretion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">Because the trial judge has the opportunity, which we lack, to observe and evaluate the apparent sincerity, conscientiousness, intelligence, and demeanor of prospective jurors first hand, the trial court\u2019s exercise of judicial discretion in deciding challenges for cause will not be disturbed on appeal, unless manifest error appears in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\"><em>Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 123-24, 360 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Membership in a particular organization does not per se disqualify a prospective juror. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>901 F.2d 846, 849 (10th Cir. 1990) (prospective juror in sexual assault case founding member of MADD). Nor is a prospective juror per se disqualified because a family member has been a victim of violent crime. <em>Mackall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 236 </em>Va. 240, 252, 372 S.E.2d 759, 767 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. 925-26 (1989) (mother of prospective juror in capital murder case recent rape victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">During voir dire, Savage indicated he had no interest in the trial or the outcome of the case, had not expressed or formed an opinion regarding the case, was not sensible of any bias or prejudice, and knew no reason why he could not give the defendant and the Commonwealth a fair trial. On the subject of life imprisonment, the record shows the following colloquy between Ms. Madonick, one of Stockton\u2019s counsel, and prospective jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">MS. MADONICK: How do you feel about life imprisonment as a punishment for murder? Do you think that can be an appropriate punishment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>JUROR ALMQUIST: It could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">MS. MADONICK: And you, Mr. Savage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">JUROR SAVAGE: I\u2019d have to hear the case first. I couldn\u2019t give you a definite answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">MS. MADONICK: But you would be able to consider it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">A JUROR: Yes. I do think it\u2019s a definite possibility and I do think there are cases in which that would be the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">I would also need to hear the information before I make a decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Under these circumstances, we do not think the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to exclude Savage for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">III. <em>Denial of Self-Representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court\u2019s order awarding Stockton a new sentencing hearing, was entered July 22, 1988. On April 11, 1989, the law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter of Washington, D.C., notified the Circuit Court of Patrick County that the firm would represent Stockton in connection with his resentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">On April 28, 1989, Stockton filed in the Circuit Court of Patrick County a Motion for Re-Sentencing Hearing in which he stated that he thereby terminated the representation of Arnold &amp; Porter. In an accompanying letter to the trial judge, Stockton stated that he would direct his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Citing <em>Faretta </em>v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 835-36 (1975), Arnold &amp; Porter wrote the trial judge on May 17, 1989, requesting that the court hold a hearing to determine whether Stockton\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Following a psychiatric examination of Stockton, the trial court conducted a hearing and on September 1, 1989, ruled that Stockton had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. The court appointed J. Grady Monday as standby counsel and set the resentencing hearing for January 9, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">Stockton filed several motions pro se, including motions for a continuance and a change of venue. Then on January 4, 1990, a member of the Arnold &amp; Porter firm advised the trial judge that the firm represented Stockton but would need a continuance. On January 8, 1990, the day before the resentencing hearing was scheduled to begin, Stockton filed a notice stating that he had \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tained\u201d Arnold &amp; Porter to represent him. The firm\u2019s motion for a continuance as well as Stockton\u2019s motion for a change of venue were granted, and the case was scheduled for hearing in the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News on May 15, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">During jury selection on May 15, Stockton told the trial judge he had no confidence in his attorneys. He said he was not \u201casking for a continuance, but if [his] case [went] on [he was] going to represent [himself].\u201d Noting that he had granted Stockton\u2019s earlier request to represent himself but that Stockton later withdrew the request, the judge denied the motion. Stockton then engaged in the name-calling recited previously in this opinion, as a result of which the judge ordered him removed from the courtroom.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel moved for a continuance, and the trial court denied the motion. Counsel then asked leave to withdraw from the case, and the court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Citing <em>Faretta, </em>Stockton contends that a criminal defendant has a right under the Sixth Amendment to waive counsel and represent himself. If the waiver is timely and made knowingly, Stockton says, the right is unconditional and self-representation must be allowed absent a finding that the request therefor is a tactic to secure delay. Stockton asserts that the trial court previously had found him competent to decide whether he wanted to represent himself, his decision was made knowingly, and his request was timely because made before \u201cthe jury had been chosen.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>473 F.2d 1113 (D.C. Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Stockton maintains that the trial court \u201cdid not articulate a rationale for rejecting [his] motion to represent himself.\u201d We find in the record, however, this express statement made by the trial judge: \u201cI feel [Stockton] is deliberately trying to not have [the case] tried.\u201d This represents clear articulation of a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Stockton\u2019s request for self-representation was a tactic to secure delay, and the finding is sufficient alone to justify affirmance of the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit Stockton to represent himself. <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>682 F.2d 782, 784-85 (9th Cir. 1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Furthermore, as noted <em>supra, </em>between April 1989 and May 1990, Stockton shifted back and forth in his position with respect to self-representation. At first, he wanted Arnold &amp; Porter to represent him. Then, he decided to represent himself. Later, he changed his mind and \u201cretained\u201d Arnold &amp; Porter. Lastly, he decided he wanted to represent himself. We think Stockton \u201cforfeited his right to self-representation by his vacillating positions.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>539 F.2d 45, 51 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 925 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">IV. <em>Admissibility of Guilt-Phase Transcript</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Stockton contends that the admission of hearsay evidence, consisting of the transcript of the testimony given at the guilt phase of his original trial, violated \u201cthe Virginia laws of evidence\u201d as well as his \u201crights under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d For his reference to Virginia law, Stockton cites <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Oldfield, </em>195 Va. 544, 79 S.E.2d 660 (1954), and states that \u201c[t]his Court has long recognized that the transcript of testimony at a former trial is hearsay and is inadmissible at a later trial unless the witnesses who gave the testimony in the former trial are unavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0-\">With reference to his right of confrontation, Stockton cites <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page, </em>390 U.S. 719 (1968), where the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201cThere are few subjects, perhaps, upon which this Court and other courts have been more nearly unanimous than in their expressions of belief that the right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>390 U.S. at 721 (quoting <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 405 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Stockton also cites <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56 (1980). There, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">The Confrontation Clause operates in two separate ways to restrict the range of admissible hearsay. First, ... the Sixth Amendment establishes a rule of necessity. In the usual case . (including cases where prior cross-examination has occurred), the prosecution must either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">The second aspect operates once a witness is shown to be unavailable. Reflecting its underlying purpose to augment accuracy in the factfinding process by ensuring the defendant an effective means to test adverse evidence, the Clause countenances only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that \u201cthere is no material departure from the reason [for] the general rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 65 (quoting <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 107 (1934)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Finally, Stockton cites <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 808, 232 S.E.2d 798 (1977), where we applied the <em>Barber </em>test requiring the prosecution to show unavailability as a prerequisite to the admission of the prior testimony of an absent witness. We upheld the admission of the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who was deceased at the time of trial. <em>Id. </em>at 813, 232 S.E.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Stockton says that <em>Barber </em>is \u201ccontrolling.\u201d In <em>Barber, </em>the prosecution sought to introduce into evidence at the defendant\u2019s robbery trial a transcript of the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who at the time of trial was incarcerated in another state. The Supreme Court held that admission of the transcript was error because the prosecutorial authorities had not made a good faith effort to obtain the presence of the witness at trial. 390 U.S. at 724-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Stockton maintains we must reach the same result here because the Commonwealth made no effort to establish the unavailability of the witnesses whose testimony it sought to introduce by transcript. \u201cA demonstration of unavailability, however, is not al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ways required.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65 n.7. Indeed, in <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 89 (1970), the Supreme Court said that \u201cthe mission of the Confrontation Clause is to advance a <em>practical concern </em>for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials by assuring that \u2018the trier of fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 161 (1970)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">If, in application of this \u201cpractical concern,\u201d it appears that \u201cthe utility of trial confrontation [is] . . . remote [the prosecution is not required] to produce a seemingly available witness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65 n.7. And the utility of trial confrontation is remote if \u201cthe possibility that cross-examination . . . could conceivably have shown the jury that [a prior] statement . . . might have been unreliable [is] wholly unreal.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">We think this case presents the sort of situation contemplated by <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Dutton </em>and thus is not subject to the rule applied in <em>Barber. </em>The transcript in <em>Barber </em>was offered to establish the guilt of the accused. Here, Stockton\u2019s culpability had been established conclusively, and guilt was not an issue in the new sentencing hearing. Use of the transcript was appropriate for the purpose of informing the jury of the nature of the offense with which Stockton was charged and the circumstances under which it was committed. In ruling the transcript was admissible, the trial court limited its use to that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We have approved this use of transcripts of prior testimony in several previous cases where we ordered new sentencing hearings after death sentences had been declared invalid. <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 164, 168, 207 S.E.2d 847, 850 (1974); <em>Huggins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 327, 329, 191 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1972); <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 316, 321, 191 S.E.2d 794, 798 (1972); <em>Snider </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>212 Va. 13, 14, 181 S.E.2d 617, 618 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Stockton argues, however, that the guilt-phase transcript was used by the prosecution not only to inform the jury of the nature of the offense with which Stockton was charged and the circumstances under which it was committed but also to establish the vileness and future dangerousness predicates for imposition of the death penalty. Stockton refers us to several places in the record where, he says, the prosecutor made this allegedly improper use of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The first instance occurred during pretrial argument on the question whether the transcript should be admitted into evidence. During this argument, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated that portions of the transcript testimony would be relevant to and probative of the issue of future dangerousness. It suffices to say that this statement was not made in the jury\u2019s presence and, hence, could not have prejudiced Stockton.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The other instances occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument where, in discussing vileness and future dangerousness, the prosecutor referred briefly to the guilt-phase transcript. As noted <em>supra, </em>the trial court limited use of the transcript to the purpose of informing the jury of the nature of the offense charged against Stockton and the circumstances under which it was committed. We think it was incumbent upon Stockton to object when the prosecutor allegedly exceeded the court\u2019s limitation. Stockton failed to object. Hence, we will not notice his argument on this point. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We find that the transcript in question is \u201cmarked with such trustworthiness that \u2018there is no material departure from the reason [for] the general rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65. The incident which tainted Stockton\u2019s sentence did not occur during the guilt phase but during the sentencing phase of the original trial. Stockton was represented by counsel in that trial and was given, and took full advantage of, the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses whose testimony is contained in the transcript that was read to the new sentencing jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Stockton argues, however, that the holding in <em>Barber </em>\u201cdid not turn on whether there was an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the prior proceeding, but rather on the necessity of providing the \u2018occasion for the jury to weigh the demeanor of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d Stockton complains that admission of the transcript denied him the occasion for the jury in his new sentencing hearing to weigh the demeanor of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Stockton applies <em>Barber </em>out of context. As noted previously, the transcript in <em>Barber </em>consisted of the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who was absent at the time of trial. The Supreme Court noted that defense counsel had failed to cross-examine the witness at the preliminary hearing. The Court held that it would reach the same result had defense counsel actually cross-examined the witness at the preliminary hearing. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The right to confrontation is basically a trial right. It includes both the opportunity to cross-examine and the occasion for the jury to weigh the demeanor of the witness. A preliminary hearing is ordinarily a much less searching exploration into the merits of a case than a trial, simply because its function is the more limited one of determining whether probable cause exists to hold the accused for trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">390 U.S. at 725.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Here, the transcript in dispute consists of testimony given, not at a preliminary hearing, but in a trial where the witnesses were cross-examined and the jury had full opportunity to \u201cweigh the demeanor of the witness [es].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence, the trustworthiness of the transcript was established beyond doubt and there was no necessity to provide a second \u201coccasion for [a] jury to weigh the demeanor of the witness [es].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Indeed, paying full deference to the mission of the Confrontation Clause \u201cto advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process,\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 89, we think it is \u201cwholly unreal\u201d to say there was a possibility that cross-examination of the guilt-phase witnesses at the new sentencing hearing \u201ccould conceivably have shown . . . that the [prior testimony] might have been unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in admitting the transcript of the earlier testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">V. <em>Racially Discriminatory Use of Peremptory Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Citing <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79 (1986), Stockton contends that the Commonwealth exercised its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. Stockton points out that the Commonwealth used three of its four peremptory strikes to exclude three of the four blacks from the venire and also struck the only black among the four alternates.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">At the conclusion of jury selection, Stockton moved \u201cto have the proceeding dismissed\u201d on the ground the Commonwealth had exercised its peremptory challenges in \u201ca racially biased way.\u201d The trial judge then called upon the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>state \u201cthe reason for the strikes.\u201d After the prosecutor gave his reasons, the trial judge stated that he did not \u201cfeel [the peremptory challenges] were racially motivated\u201d and overruled Stockton\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><em>Batson </em>holds that \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\u2019s case against a black defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. A defendant makes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing \u201cthat he is a member of a cognizable racial group, . . . that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\u2019s race . . . [and] that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u201cOnce the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97. The prosecutor may not rebut the prima facie case by stating merely that he challenged jurors of the defendant\u2019s race on the assumption \u201cthey would be partial to the defendant because of their shared race.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor may the prosecutor rebut the prima facie case merely by denying he had a discriminatory motive or affirming his good faith in making individual selections. <em>Id. </em>at 98. \u201cThe prosecutor therefore must articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Here, the three black prospective jurors struck by the prosecutor were Ms. Winbush, Ms. Jenkins, and Mr. Wright, and the one black alternate was Ms. Wilson. The prosecutor explained that he struck Ms. Winbush and Ms. Wilson because of their reservations about the death penalty. Stockton then limited his complaint to the two remaining prospective jurors, Ms. Jenkins and Mr. Wright. We will limit our discussion to the same two persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In his explanation, the prosecutor stated that in deciding to strike Ms. Jenkins, he considered her age, her educational background, her employment, and her demeanor during the course of voir dire. The prosecutor also said that he considered Ms. Jenkins\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>suitability as a juror in comparison with \u201ca number of other jurors who [he] felt would be preferable because of their educational background [and] their attentiveness during the course of voir dire examination.\u201d In summary, the prosecutor said Ms. Jenkins\u2019 exclusion was the result of \u201cthe process of elimination\u201d and, among other things, his \u201cobservation of . . . her personal demeanor\u201d during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">With respect to Mr. Wright, the prosecutor stated that he considered the age of the prospective juror who, at 67, would be the oldest member of the jury panel. The prosecutor also said he had noticed that Wright \u201cappeared to have physical problems associated with his eye,\u201d and the prosecutor questioned whether Wright \u201cwould be attentive,\u201d given the stressful nature of the matter on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Because a trial judge\u2019s findings in this context \u201c\u2018turn on evaluation of credibility, a reviewing court ordinarily should give those findings great deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 310, 384 S.E.2d 785, 795 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 US. 1093, 110 S.Ct. 1171 (1990) (quoting <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98 n.21) <em>(Spencer II). </em>We conclude that the present case is not out of the ordinary, that the trial court\u2019s finding of racial neutrality in the prosecutor\u2019s strikes is adequately supported, and that the finding should not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">VI. <em>Admissibility Issues </em>a. <em>Evidence of Unadjudicated Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Stockton contends that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of unadjudicated crimes. Specifically, Stockton complains of evidence that he killed one Ronnie Tate because Tate was \u201crunning [his] mouth\u201d about the murder of Kenneth Arnder. Stockton says that he was \u201cnever tried for, much less convicted of, this crime,\u201d and that evidence of its commission violated his due process rights to a presumption of innocence and an unbiased jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In <em>Spencer II, </em>however, we pointed out that under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C), a sentencing jury shall consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s \u201cprior history\u201d in determining whether he \u201cwould commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d 238 Va. at 317, 384 S.E.2d at 798-99. We said that we have construed this provision \u201cto permit the admission into evidence of unadjudicated misconduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 317, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>384 S.E.2d at 799, and we cited several cases in example. <em>See O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 700, 364 S.E.2d 491, 504, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871 (1988); <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 285, 351 S.E.2d 1, 12 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931 (1987); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 488, 331 S.E.2d 422, 436 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Stockton maintains that the decisions of other states indicate that evidence of unadjudicated crimes is inadmissible, and he cites cases from Indiana, Tennessee, and Washington. Our research discloses, however, a split of authority, with Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, and Texas permitting such evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reaffirm our earlier decisions and reject Stockton\u2019s contention that evidence of unadjudicated crimes is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Stockton argues further, however, that even if this type of evidence is admissible, Virginia\u2019s capital sentencing scheme is unconstitutional because it fails to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the commission of unadjudicated crimes and thus permits the jury to consider unreliable and prejudicial evidence. However, in <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 529, 352 S.E.2d 342, 347, <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1033 (1987), we rejected a contention that evidence of unadjudicated criminal activity is \u201cnot reliable.\u201d And in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 346-47, 356 S.E.2d 157, 175-76, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987), we rejected an argument that such evidence is \u201chighly inflammatory and inherently prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">b. <em>Evidence of Innocence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Stockton contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow admission of evidence and to permit argument suggesting that he did not murder Kenneth Arnder. Stockton says that \u201c[p] reventing the sentencing jury from obtaining this critical information violated notions of fundamental fairness . . . and constituted a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments . . . and the companion provisions of the Virginia Constitution.\u201d The disputed evidence, Stockton submits, was material to the issues of vileness and future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>dangerousness and \u201crelevant to establishing \u2018residual doubt\u2019 as mitigating evidence in sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The trial court excluded the proffered evidence on the ground that Stockton\u2019s guilt had \u201calready been decided.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the trial court cited <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>487 U.S. 164 (1988), and <em>Frye, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In <em>Franklin, </em>the defendant argued that he was entitled as a matter of constitutional right to an instruction telling his sentencing jury that it could consider residual doubt as a basis for mitigation. Rejecting this argument, the Court stated that its prior decisions did not \u201csuggest that capital defendants have a <em>right </em>to demand jury consideration of \u2018residual doubts\u2019 in the sentencing phase\u201d of a capital penalty trial. <em>Id. </em>at 173 (emphasis in original). The Court said further that permitting consideration of residual doubt in the penalty phase \u201cis arguably inconsistent with the common practice of allowing penalty-only trials on remand of cases where a death sentence \u2014 but not the underlying conviction \u2014 is struck down on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Frye, </em>the defendant argued in the trial court that the jury in the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial\u201d should consider the . . . possibility that additional evidence might later demonstrate Frye\u2019s innocence of the crime for which it had convicted him.\u201d 231 Va. at 393, 345 S.E.2d at 283. The trial court ruled the argument impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">We affirmed, stating that \u201cthe trial court would have been remiss if it had permitted defense counsel\u201d to argue that the jury\u2019s verdict \u201cwas wrong, that the Commonwealth had failed to prove its case against Frye.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We stated further that \u201c[t]he issue of guilt had been resolved in the first phase of the trial and could not properly be raised again in the penalty phase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 345 S.E.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">If, as <em>Franklin </em>holds, a defendant is not entitled to an instruction permitting a sentencing jury to consider residual doubt and if, as <em>Frye </em>teaches, a defendant may not argue residual doubt in the sentencing phase, it follows that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit evidence and to allow argument on the subject. Hence, we reject Stockton\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">VII. <em>Aggravating Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 provides that the death penalty may not be imposed unless the court or jury shall find one or both of two ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>gravating factors: First, \u201cthat there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society,\u201d termed \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d in our opinions. Second, \u201cthat his conduct in committing the offense for which he stands charged was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim,\u201d referred to in our opinions as \u201cvileness.\u201d Here, the jury found the existence of both predicates, but based its finding of vileness upon the aggravated battery component alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Stockton argues that the evidence does not support a finding of either future dangerousness or vileness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">With respect to future dangerousness, the evidence shows that Stockton had a long record of felony convictions, including three convictions for discharging a firearm into an occupied building, one conviction for escape,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> two convictions for unlawful possession of firearms, and one burglary conviction. In addition, according to his own admissions to police authorities, Stockton had been hired to kill five people other than Kenneth Arnder, had committed arson for hire, and had stolen a large number of firearms in a breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Then there are the frightening prospects revealed in Stockton\u2019s hired murder of Kenneth Arnder, where the victim was shot and dismembered, and in its aftermath, where Ronnie Tate was killed because he was \u201crunning [his] mouth\u201d about Ardner\u2019s murder. Added to all this is the testimony given at the new sentencing hearing by Dr. Miller Ryans, a psychiatrist at Central State Hospital, who stated that Stockton \u201cpresents a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>As noted previously, the jury based its finding of vileness upon the component of aggravated battery. We have defined aggravated battery as one which, \u201cqualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder.\u201d <em>M. Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Stockton argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s finding of vileness because the Commonwealth offered no evidence that Arnder\u2019s hands were cut off before he suffered the gunshot wound to his head. Stockton quotes <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 427, 448, 323 S.E.2d 554, 565 (1984), <em>cert. denied, 472 </em>U.S. 1012 (1985), where we said that aggravated battery connotes \u201cconduct preceding death of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">What we actually said in <em>Jones </em>was that aggravated battery <em>\u201cordinarily </em>connote [s] conduct preceding death of the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We do not think, however, that this is an ordinary situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Dr. Page Hudson, who was North Carolina\u2019s chief medical examiner at the time of the Arnder murder, testified that he was present when an autopsy was conducted on Arnder\u2019s body. He said that the gunshot wound to Arnder\u2019s head was the \u201cprobable\u201d cause of death, that Arnder would have \u201cbecome immediately unconscious,\u201d and that death would have \u201cfollowed shortly thereafter.\u201d Dr. Hudson testified further, however, that the wounds to Arnder\u2019s hands would \u201ceasily have been fatal\u201d if untreated.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 360 S.E.2d 196 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1036 (1988), addressing the subject of aggravated battery, we said that the Commonwealth is not required to prove the order of infliction of multiple wounds to establish which causes death, provided death does not result instantaneously from the first wound. 234 Va. at 139-40, 360 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>at 203. And in <em>Gray, supra, </em>we held that aggravated battery was established by showing the victim received six gunshot wounds, any one of which would have proved fatal, in rapid succession. 233 Va. at 341, 356 S.E.2d at 173. Further, \u201c[f]or purposes of the \u2018vileness\u2019 determination, it is immaterial whether the decedent remains conscious during the course of several assaults.\u201d <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 501, 521, 331 S.E.2d 407, 421 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1031 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Here, although Arnder would have died \u201cshortly\u201d from the gunshot wound to his head, his death was not instantaneous, and the jury could have found that he was still alive but unconscious when his hands were severed. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of vileness based upon aggravated battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">VIII. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Stockton contends that his due process rights were violated when, in the presence of the jury, the prosecutor referred to disparaging remarks Stockton had directed to the trial judge out of the hearing of the jury. Stockton argues that the prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct requires a new sentencing trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">During presentation of his case, Stockton called William Dent, chaplain of the Powhatan Correctional Center, as a character witness. Dent testified that he had met with Stockton on a number of occasions while Stockton was an inmate at the Correctional Center. The chaplain testified that Stockton had been friendly and respectful to him but that Stockton had said he had not \u201calways been respectful to other people.\u201d In response to a question on cross-examination, Dent said that Stockton could say \u201csome pretty nasty things to people.\u201d The prosecutor then asked Dent: \u201cYou\u2019re not aware of some comments directed to the judge in this case, are you?\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">When defense counsel objected, the trial court sustained the objection, and the prosecutor said he would withdraw the question. Stockton then moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion, stating that the jury had no \u201cknowledge of what the statement was and they\u2019re not supposed to guess, surmise or do anything of that nature, and the Court . . . does not feel that that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>comment tainted the jury in any way.\u201d We agree with the trial judge and reject Stockton\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Stockton also complains about a comment the prosecutor made during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury. In discussing the allegation that Stockton had killed Ronnie Tate, defense counsel argued that Stockton\u2019s culpability for that murder had not been adjudicated or resolved. The prosecutor interrupted and said that Stockton\u2019s involvement in Tate\u2019s death was relied upon by the appellate courts as evidence of aggravating circumstances. Stockton moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Stockton argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments \u201csuggested to the jury that the appellate court had found Stockton guilty of killing Ronnie Tate\u201d and also \u201cinformed the resentencing jury that the previous jury had sentenced Stockton to death.\u201d We disagree. We do not think the jury could possibly have put this strained interpretation on the prosecutor\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">IX. <em>Verdict Form</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Stockton contends that the verdict form prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D) and used by the trial court \u201cdiscouraged the jury from giving effect to . . . mitigating evidence once it found an aggravating factor.\u201d Stockton acknowledges that in <em>Watkins, supra, </em>we held that the form adequately emphasizes mitigating factors. 229 Va. at 490-91, 331 S.E.2d at 438. Stockton \u201crespectfully requests,\u201d however, that we reconsider our decision. We decline the request. <em>See Hoke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 303, 315, 377 S.E.2d 595, 602, <em>cert. denied, </em>491 U.S. 910 (1989); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 213, 257 S.E.2d 784, 791-92 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">X. <em>Validity of Death Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Stockton also requests that we reconsider our decisions, such as <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 254 S.E.2d 116, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 919 (1979), in which we upheld the constitutionality of Virginia\u2019s death penalty statutes, and decisions, such as <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 271 S.E.2d 123 (1980), in which we held that death by electrocution does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. We deny both requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Further, Stockton contends that he \u201ccannot obtain meaningful appellate review of his death sentence because of this Court\u2019s fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ure to apply a standard method to determine \u2018whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u2019 Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 17-110.1 (c)(2).\u201d We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Finally, citing <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242 (1976), Stockton argues that he \u201cis denied meaningful appellate review because the Virginia statutory death sentencing scheme . . . does not require the trial judge or jury to specify the findings that justified imposition of a death sentence.\u201d <em>Proffitt </em>involved Florida\u2019s death penalty statutes. Under those statutes, a jury\u2019s death verdict is advisory only; the trial judge determines the actual sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 248-49. The trial judge is required to weigh the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances and, if the trial court imposes a sentence of death, it must \u201c \u2018set forth in writing its findings upon which the sentence of death is based as to the facts: (a) [tjhat sufficient [statutory] aggravating circumstances exist. . . and (b) [t]hat there are insufficient [statutory] mitigating circumstances ... to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Under Virginia\u2019s statutes, the jury <em>fixes </em>the sentence. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3. As noted previously, a sentence of death may not be imposed unless the jury finds the existence of one or both of the aggravating circumstances of future dangerousness and vileness. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. A Virginia jury\u2019s verdict must be in writing, and it must set forth the statutory aggravating circumstances upon which it is based. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D). The trial judge may \u201cset aside the sentence of death and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life\u201d only \u201cupon good cause shown.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5. Hence, <em>Proffitt </em>is inapposite, and we reject Stockton\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">XI. <em>Passion and Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Under Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (C)(1), this Court must determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Stockton argues that his \u201cdeath sentence was imposed under the influence of prejudice.\u201d He says \u201cthe jury\u2019s ability to fairly sentence [him] was undermined by . . . being shackled in front of the jury . . . and [by] highly prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>We have demonstrated in Part I of this opinion that there was no reversible error in the shackling of Stockton and in Part VIII that there was no reversible error in the conduct of the prosecutor. Neither instance, therefore, can support Stockton\u2019s claim of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Stockton also argues that his death sentence \u201cwas infected by impermissible passion and prejudice\u201d resulting from photographs of Arnder\u2019s decomposed body that were admitted into evidence. As we have said on many occasions, including <em>Stockton I, </em>227 Va. at 144, 314 S.E.2d at 384, the admission of photographs is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not disturb its action unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Stockton also attempts to rely upon issues raised in assignments of error he has not briefed. He seeks to place the blame on this Court for refusing to grant him leave to file a brief in excess of the 50-page limitation set by Rule 5:26. However, we will adhere to the rule that we will not consider any assignment of error that is not briefed. Rule 5:27(e); <em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 41, 393 S.E.2d 599, 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">XII. <em>Excessiveness and Disproportionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2) requires that we consider and determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d In <em>Boggs, supra, </em>we said that \u201c[b]ecause we are directed by Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2) to compare \u2018similar\u2019 cases, we give special attention to those in which the underlying felony, the penalty predicate, and the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime are fairly comparable.\u201d 229 Va. at 522, 331 S.E.2d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">In an earlier murder-for-hire case, <em>Clark, supra, </em>we affirmed the conviction and death sentence of a defendant who, with a cousin, murdered the victim in return for $7,000. In <em>Stockton I, </em>adverting to <em>Clark, </em>we said: \u201cStockton also has not shown any reason why his punishment is excessive or disproportionate. The single gunshot wound between Arnder\u2019s eyes is indicative of a deliberate, execution-type murder which Stockton performed for a purely pecuniary motive. In addition, the mutilation of the victim\u2019s body was shocking.\u201d <em>Stockton I, </em>227 Va. at 152-53, 314 S.E.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>We also made in <em>Stockton I </em>a comparison with other cases in which the sentences of death were imposed upon findings of both dangerousness and vileness. <em>Id. </em>at 152, 314 S.E.2d at 389. We said that, from our review, \u201cwe determine that the sentence of death imposed upon Stockton was not excessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in this jurisdiction for crimes of a similar nature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In the meantime, we have decided several other capital cases where the death penalty was based upon findings of both dangerousness and vileness. <em>E.g., Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 393 S.E.2d 609, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S___ 111 S.Ct. 281 (1990) <em>(Spencer IV); Edmonds </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 303, 329 S.E.2d 807, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975 (1985). A review of pre- and <em>post-Stockton I </em>decisions, as well as capital cases resulting in life imprisonment, convinces us that \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 284, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Stockton submits, however, that his actions do not approach the \u201cheinous behavior\u201d exhibited in some of our decisions. \u201cBut no concept of proportionality requires that each new capital murder case equal in horror the worst possible scenario yet encountered, else the death penalty may not be imposed.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 543, 556, 364 S.E.2d 483, 490, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017 (1988). Besides, by its very name, a murder-for-hire case imports its own special heinousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">XIII. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Finding no error in the record or any other reason to disturb Stockton\u2019s death sentence, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> It is not at all clear that the jurors observed the shackles. The trial judge remarked that he could see the shackles \u201cunder the [counsel] table,\u201d but he made no comment about the jurors\u2019 ability to see them. For purposes of discussion, we will assume the shackles were visible to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> Stockton contends in a footnote to his brief that the trial court \u201ccompounded its error [of refusing self-representation] by . . . excluding [him] from the courtroom entirely.\u201d We disagree. Stockton\u2019s contemptuous conduct justified his removal from the courtroom. Then, as he was led from the courtroom, he told the trial judge: \u201cDon\u2019t call me [back to the courtroom] no more.\u201d The judge repeatedly told defense counsel that Stockton could return to the courtroom if he agreed to conduct himself properly. Typical of the judge\u2019s remarks to counsel are these: \u201cMr. Stockton is welcome to come as long as he conducts himself properly, and the court certainly thinks he should be here. 1 hope you talked to him and advised him of the seriousness of the case and the fact that his presence is needed.\u201d So, the trial court gave Stockton the key to the courtroom, and he cannot fault the court if he did not use the key sooner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\"> Stockton also maintains that the trial court \u201ccould not permissibly have held that [his request to represent himself] was a delaying tactic\u201d because he represented to the court he was \u201cnot asking for a continuance.\u201d We disagree. The trial court had every reason to believe the representation was not made in good faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\"> Continuing, the Court stated that \u201c[w]hile there may be some justification for holding that the opportunity for cross-examination of a witness at a preliminary hearing satisfies the demands of the confrontation clause where the witness is shown to be actually unavailable, this is not . . . such a case.\u201d 390 U.S. at 725-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\"> We will assume, without deciding, that Stockton has standing to question the Commonwealth\u2019s use of its peremptory strikes to exclude blacks. We will also assume, without deciding, that Stockton made out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> <em>Fair </em>v. <em>State, </em>245 Ga. 868, 870-71, 268 S.E.2d 316, 319-20, <em>cert. </em>denied, 449 U.S. 986 (1980); <em>Crump </em>v. <em>State, </em>102 Nev. 158, 161, 716 P.2d 1387, 1388-89, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 871 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Skipper, </em>285 S.C. 42, 48, 328 S.E.2d 58, 62 (1985), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>476 U.S. 1 (1986); <em>Milton </em>v. <em>State, </em>599 S.W.2d 824, 827 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1031 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> Stockton argues that the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce his conviction for escape without showing that the escape was from a road gang rather than a correctional facility. We find this argument frivolous, typical of several Stockton makes. In the first place, other than defense counsel\u2019s statement on brief, nothing establishes the situs of the escape. Second, if the escape did occur from a road gang, the defense could have brought this fact to the jury\u2019s attention. Third, so far as the outcome of this case is concerned, whether the escape was from a road gang or a correctional facility should make no difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> On cross-examination, Dr. Ryans admitted that Stockton would not \u201cpose a future continuing serious threat of violence to either himself or to others\u201d if he \u201ccontinues to be incarcerated in the Virginia correctional system.\u201d Stockton then cites <em>Giarratano </em>v. <em>Com</em>monwealth, 220 Va. 1064, 1076, 266 S.E.2d 94, 101 (1980) where, he says, we \u201cspecifically considered the future dangerousness of a party <em>while </em>incarcerated\u201d in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the appropriateness of a death sentence. (Emphasis in original.) Stockton then argues that \u201c[t]he sentencing court should have focused only on Stockton\u2019s conduct while incarcerated.\u201d This is another example of Stockton\u2019s frivolous arguments. In Giarratano, we cited the opinion of the same Dr. Ryans that Giarratano, while incarcerated, \u201cwould constitute a homicidal threat to himself and to the prison population.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But the trial court did not, and we certainly did not, focus \u201conly on [Giarratano\u2019s] conduct while incarcerated\u201d to paraphrase Stockton\u2019s words. Indeed, we cited other testimony of Dr. Ryans that \u201c \u2018it is probable that [Giarratano] if he were to be released would continue to present a threat to society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>And we quoted the testimony of another psychiatrist that \u201cif [Giarratano] was to be \u2018at large in the community\u2019 in the future, [he] had the \u2018potential\u2019 for violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077, 266 S.E.2d at 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\"> We assume the prosecutor was referring to the occasion during jury selection when Stockton called the trial judge a \u201ccrook\u201d and a \u201cvile son-of-a-bitch.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
