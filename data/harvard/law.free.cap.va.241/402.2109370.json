In the complaint, Amtrak sought recovery of the sum of $910,000 for property damage allegedly sustained by the train in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">In the District Court, Catlett and Miller\u2019s estate filed answers alleging they were immune from liability under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Later, Catlett and Miller\u2019s estate filed motions for summary judgment on the immunity issue. The court granted Catlett\u2019s motion for summary judgment in full. Initially, the court denied the motion filed by Miller\u2019s estate but, upon reconsideration, granted the motion in part, holding that the estate could be held liable only if Miller\u2019s conduct constituted gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Upon appeal to the Fourth Circuit, Amtrak filed a motion for certification of state law questions to this Court pursuant to our Rule 5:42, and Catlett and Miller\u2019s estate filed a response in sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>port of the motion. Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit certified to this Court the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-3\">a. [Is] Catlett . . . immune from suit pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a727-23.6, 1950 as amended?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">b. [Does] Miller [have] qualified immunity and can only be liable if his actions are found to constitute gross negligence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The pertinent facts are set forth in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s order of certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">On September 28, 1989, members of Catlett responded to the scene of a car fire on private property adjacent to Route 28 in Fauquier County, Virginia. Miller, the volunteer fireman who was driving the lead fire truck, discovered through radio communications that he had driven past the driveway leading into the property where the car fire was burning. He then turned around and proceeded back on the same highway towards the driveway entrance. Again, Miller overshot the driveway. He stopped the fire truck just beyond the driveway entrance to his right and backed up in order to make a right turn. He then made a wide right turn into the driveway. The driveway is unpaved and crosses over the railroad tracks. After Miller turned onto the driveway, he drove slowly up the drive\u2019s incline towards the train tracks and proceeded to cross. The truck\u2019s emergency lights and headlights were operating at all times during the response to this call. As the fire truck was crossing the railroad tracks, it was hit by a southbound Amtrak train.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">Prior to the accident, Catlett required its member drivers, including Miller, to undergo extensive in-house training as to the safe operation of the fire company\u2019s vehicles. Clyde M. Lomax, the fire company\u2019s chief, instructed the volunteer firemen of the company that they must obey all traffic laws without exception when responding to a call. Lomax specifically recalls instructing his drivers, including Miller, to stop and look both ways before crossing any railroad tracks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">Catlett is a non-profit corporation that exists independently of Fauquier County (the \u201cCounty\u201d). Catlett\u2019s members are volunteers, whom neither Catlett nor the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>compensates for firefighting. Catlett owns its station house and the vehicles that it uses. The County does not control or supervise the daily operations of Catlett and the County is not involved in the selection of Catlett\u2019s members, officers or drivers. The County provides no direct funding to Catlett. The only cash disbursement that Catlett receives from the County is a one-thirteenth (1/13) share of a lump sum grant that the County makes available to the Fauquier County Fire and Rescue Association (the \u201cAssociation\u201d), an unincorporated association that is comprised of appointed members from the thirteen volunteer fire and rescue companies that operate within the County. The County neither directs the Association as to how this grant should be distributed nor requires the Association to account for how the grant is disbursed. The remaining expenditures that the County makes on behalf of the Association are for the payment of bills that the Association submits to the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Is Catlett Immune from Suit Pursuant to Code \u00a7 27-23.6?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 27-23.6 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">Any county may contract with any volunteer fire-fighting companies or associations in the county or towns therein for the fighting of fire in any county so contracting .... If any contract be entered into by a county the fire-fighting company shall be deemed to be an instrumentality of the contracting county and as such exempt from suit for damages done incident to fighting fires therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Amtrak contends that Code \u00a7 27-23.6 does not exempt Catlett from liability because the statute requires the existence of a contract between Catlett and the County and no contract was entered into between these parties. Amtrak also contends that the statute only applies when property is damaged incident to the actual fighting of a fire and, hence, does not apply to damage caused by the negligent operation of a fire truck en route to the scene of a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">\n<em>The Contract Question</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">In granting summary judgment in favor of Catlett and Miller\u2019s estate, the District Court held that there was no express contract between Catlett and the County but that an implied contract existed between them. Amtrak argues that the District Court correctly found that no express contract existed between Catlett and the County yet \u201cerred in imposing an implied-in-fact contract between them to the detriment of Amtrak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In finding the existence of an implied-in-fact contract, the district judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Where an express contract is not made, but might have been, or in equity and good conscience should have been made, the law will impose the duty and infer the necessary promises to effect a contractual relation between the parties. <em>Virginia Block Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia Mutual Insurance Agency, Inc., </em>16 B.R. 771 (W.D. Va. 1982), quoting from volume 4B Mich. J., Contracts, Section 99).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">After making this statement, the district judge surveyed the Virginia statutes concerning volunteer fire companies, reviewed the evidence supplied by Catlett concerning \u201cthe ongoing [close working] relationship between Catlett and [Fauquier County],\u201d and noted the requirement in Acts 1970, ch. 187, of which Code \u00a7 27-23.6 is a part, that \u201cthe Act shall be liberally construed.\u201d Concluding, the judge said: \u201cLiberally construing Section 27-23.6 in light of the evidence before this court regarding the relationship between Fauquier County and Catlett, the Court finds an implied contract does indeed exist between these two parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">We think the District Court correctly stated Virginia law on the subject of implied contracts. <em>See Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>161 Va. 193, 200-01, 170 S.E. 602, 605 (1933); <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>Norfolk County, </em>120 Va. 356, 361-62, 91 S.E. 820, 821-22 (1917). We also think the Court properly applied that law to the evidence before it. Accordingly, for the purpose of responding to the remaining questions relating to the application of Code \u00a7 27-23.6, we will adopt the District Court\u2019s views as our own and find the existence of a contract between Catlett and Fauquier County.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<em>The Meaning of \u201cIncident To\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">One of the remaining questions relating to the application of Code \u00a7 27-23.6 is whether the exemption from suit for \u201cdamages done incident to fighting fires\u201d encompasses damages resulting from the operation of a fire truck en route to a fire. Amtrak argues that the statute \u201conly exempts a volunteer fire company from suit for property damages \u2018done incident to\u2019 the <em>actual </em>act of fighting a fire.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Amtrak draws this argument from a number of related statutes. Amtrak cites Code \u00a7 27-20, which authorizes a fire chief to destroy property in order to prevent the spread of fire, and Code \u00a7\u00a7 27-21 and -22, which establish a procedure for recovery of such property damage from the city, town, or county involved. Then, Amtrak cites Code \u00a7 27-41, which provides financial relief to volunteer fire fighters killed or injured while fighting fire or \u201cwhile responding to an alarm or returning from the scene of a fire.\u201d \u201cThis distinction,\u201d Amtrak states, \u201cdemonstrates that the drafters of Section 27-23.6 intended for the limited language \u2018incident to fighting fires\u2019 to literally mean fighting fires and to exclude a fire company member\u2019s operation of a fire truck to and from the scene of a fire.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We disagree with Amtrak\u2019s argument concerning the operation of a fire truck en route to the scene of a fire. The word \u201cincident\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">[sjomething dependent upon, appertaining or subordinate to, or accompanying something else of greater or principal importance, something arising or resulting from something else of greater or principal importance. Used both substantively and adjectively of a thing which, either usually or naturally and inseparably, depends upon, appertains to, or follows another that is more worthy. Used as a noun, it denotes anything which inseparably belongs to, or is connected with, or inherent in, another thing, called the \u2018principal.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>762 (6th ed. 1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>We think that both definition and common sense compel the conclusion that the operation of a fire truck en route to the scene of a fire is incident to fighting the fire. Accordingly, we hold that Catlett is entitled to the exemption from suit for damages provided by Code \u00a7 27-23.6, and we answer the first certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\n<em>Does Miller Have Qualified Immunity?</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>2</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Amtrak contends that Miller was not entitled to sovereign immunity because the exemption from suit contained in Code \u00a7 27-23.6 is provided to fire-fighting companies but not to individual members of those companies. Amtrak also contends that even if the exemption provided by Code \u00a7 27-23.6 is applicable, Miller is not entitled to immunity because driving across railroad tracks without stopping is not the sort of discretionary act upon which immunity may be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\n<em>Nature of the Exemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">It is true that Code \u00a7 27-23.6 does not in specific terms extend its exemption from suit to individual members of fire-fighting companies. But that does not end the inquiry. If a contract exists between a fire-fighting company and a county, Code \u00a7 27-23.6 makes the fire-fighting company \u201can instrumentality of the contracting county and as such exempt from suit for damages done incident to fighting fires.\u201d To this extent, the company would be entitled to the cloak of the county\u2019s sovereign immunity and, in turn, the cloak may be available to the company\u2019s members.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Amtrak argues, however, that the exemption provided fire companies by Code \u00a7 27-23.6 is something less than the immunity enjoyed by the county under general law. Amtrak says that Code \u00a7 27-23.6 \u201cis an \u2018exemption from suit\u2019 statute, the effect of which is to limit the remedy of a property owner whose property is destroyed in the course of actual firefighting [and for] this reason, the statute does not bestow sovereign immunity on Catlett.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>We disagree with Amtrak concerning the effect of Code \u00a7 27-23.6. While it does limit a property owner\u2019s remedy, it also has the wholesome effect of encouraging the provision of fire protection services on a voluntary basis in those areas of the Commonwealth where such services might not otherwise be made available. These public policy considerations no doubt prompted the General Assembly to include in the statute the clause granting exemption to fire companies from suits for damages done incident to fighting fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The real question, therefore, is whether the exemption provided by the statute is different from the immunity provided by general law. We perceive no legal difference between the terms exemption and immunity. \u201cExemption\u201d is defined as \u201c[f]reedom from a general duty or service; immunity from a general burden, tax, or charge. Immunity from service of process or from certain legal obligations, as jury duty, military service, or the payment of taxes. <em>See also </em>Immunity.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u201cImmunity\u201d is defined as \u201c[exemption, as from serving in an office, or performing duties which the law generally requires other citizens to perform; <em>e.g. </em>exemption from paying taxes. Freedom or exemption from penalty, burden, or duty. Special privilege. <em>See also </em>Exemption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We have used the terms \u201cexemption\u201d and \u201cimmunity\u201d interchangeably in several of our decisions. <em>See Forst </em>v. <em>Rockingham, 222 </em>Va. 270, 276, 279 S.E.2d 400, 403 (1981); <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Manns, </em>221 Va. 88, 92, 267 S.E.2d 126, 129 (1980); <em>Hospital Association </em>v. <em>Wise County, </em>203 Va. 303, 307, 124 S.E.2d 216, 219 (1962). And a court in a sister state has said that \u201c[a]fter a search of several standard dictionaries, legal dictionaries and other definitions found in numerous cases, the Court finds that the most common synonym for the word \u201cexemption\u201d is the word \u201cimmunity.\u201d <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Beneficial Finance Co., </em>549 S.W.2d 327, 328 (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We, too, think that the terms \u201cexemption\u201d and \u201cimmunity\u201d are synonymous. We hold, therefore, that the exemption provided Catlett as an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of Fauquier County is the equivalent of sovereign immunity to the extent of damages done incident to fighting fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Referring to a statement we recently made in <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Boyden, </em>241 Va. 125, 400 S.E.2d 184 (1991), Amtrak argues that \u201can emergency vehicle operator who is not a governmental employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(such as Miller) may be civilly liable upon a showing of simple negligence for his failure to use reasonable care in the operation of such a vehicle under Code \u00a7 46.2-920.\u201d Consequently, Amtrak says, \u201cno basis exists for Miller\u2019s claim that he is exempt from suit under \u00a7 27-23.6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><em>Colby </em>involved a Virginia Beach police officer who, while pursuing a motorist who had run a red light, himself ran a red light and struck another motorist, causing her serious injury. The trial court sustained the officer\u2019s plea of sovereign immunity and held that the plaintiffs evidence failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of gross negligence. 241 Va. at 127, 400 S.E.2d at 186. We affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Code \u00a7 46.2-920 (formerly \u00a7 46.1-226), mentioned in Amtrak\u2019s argument, figured prominently in the <em>Colby </em>decision. The Code section provides in subsection (A) that the driver of an emergency vehicle, under prescribed conditions, may, without subjecting himself to criminal prosecution, disregard certain traffic regulations such as speed limits. Subsection (B) provides that \u201c[njothing in this section shall release the operator of any such vehicle from civil liability for failure to use reasonable care in such operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The plaintiff in <em>Colby </em>argued that subsection (B) imposes civil liability for acts of simple negligence. In support of her position, she cited our decisions in <em>Pullen &amp; McCoy </em>v. <em>Nickens, </em>226 Va. 342, 310 S.E.2d 452 (1983), <em>Smith </em>v. Lamar, 212 Va. 820, 188 S.E.2d 72 (1972), <em>White </em>v. <em>John </em>Doe, 207 Va. 276, 148 S.E.2d 797 (1966), and <em>Virginia Transit Co. </em>v. <em>Tidd, </em>194 Va. 418, 73 S.E.2d 405 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We said, however, that \u201cnone of [those] cases held that proof of simple negligence was sufficient to impose civil liability for acts covered under \u00a7 46.1-226 [now \u00a7 46.2-920] and its predecessors.\u201d 241 Va. at 131, 400 S.E.2d at 188. We also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Defining the defendant\u2019s duty of care is the first step in determining liability. A second step involves determining whether the conduct alleged . . . amounts to the degree of deviation from that duty \u2014 simple or gross negligence, willful and wanton conduct, or intentional misconduct \u2014 requisite to establish civil liability in the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 131-32, 400 S.E.2d at 188. It was in the next paragraph that we made the statement, cited in Amtrak\u2019s argument, about the status of the operator of an emergency vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Code \u00a7 46.1-226 [now \u00a7 46.2-920] neither establishes nor speaks to the degree of negligence necessary to impose civil liability on one to whom the section applies. The degree of negligence required to impose civil liability will depend on the circumstances of each case. For example, \u00a7 46.1-226 is not limited to governmental officers or employees. Therefore, if the operator of a vehicle in an emergency situation is not a governmental employee, he may be protected under \u00a7 46.1-226 from criminal prosecution, but he may be civilly liable upon a showing of simple negligence because the defense of sovereign immunity is unavailable to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 132, 400 S.E.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Here, however, Miller was a member of a fire company that was made an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of the county with which the company had contracted for the fighting of fire. Further, on the occasion in question, Miller was the \u201cofficer ... in charge.\u201d Given the nature of Miller\u2019s position, we see no legal distinction between his status and that of the police officer involved in <em>Colby, </em>at least insofar as the availability of the defense of sovereign immunity is concerned. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\n<em>Use of Judgment and Discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Amtrak argues that under the fourth factor of the test enunciated in <em>Messina </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>228 Va. 301, 321 S.E.2d 657 (1987), Miller is entitled to invoke the defense of sovereign immunity only if \u201cthe act complained of involved the use of judgment and discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 321 S.E.2d at 663. Amtrak says that \u201cthe act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>complained of [here] is Miller\u2019s act of driving a fire truck across a railroad crossing without first stopping as required by state law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Catlett\u2019s By-Laws, and Catlett\u2019s internal safety policies.\u201d Hence, Amtrak concludes, \u201cMiller\u2019s crossing the railroad tracks without first stopping . . . was a ministerial act, not a discretionary act to which sovereign immunity attaches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">We disagree with Amtrak. In <em>Colby, </em>the plaintiff made an argument similar to Amtrak\u2019s here, <em>viz., </em>\u201cthat [the police officer\u2019s] actions involved in the pursuit of a speeding automobile were not entitled to the protection of sovereign immunity because they were ministerial acts and not acts which involved judgment and discretion.\u201d 241 Va. at 128, 400 S.E.2d at 186. Further, similar to the situation here, the police officer in <em>Colby </em>did not stop for a red light, as required by law. In addition, as Catlett did with its firemen here, \u201c[t]he City exercised administrative control and supervision over [the] activities [of its police officers] through the promulgation of guidelines governing actions taken in response to emergency situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 400 S.E.2d at 187. What we said there is equally pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">[The City\u2019s] guidelines do not, and cannot, eliminate the requirement that a police officer, engaged in the delicate, dangerous, and potentially deadly job of vehicular pursuit, must make prompt, original, and crucial decisions in a highly stressful situation. Unlike the driver in routine traffic, the officer must make difficult judgments about the best means of effectuating the governmental purpose by embracing special risks in an emergency situation. Such situations involve necessarily discretionary, split-second decisions balancing grave personal risks, public safety concerns, and the need to achieve the governmental objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 129-30, 400 S.E.2d at 187. We cannot logically distinguish the act of crossing a railroad track without stopping in order to extinguish a fire from running a red light in order to apprehend a traffic offender. We think both acts involve the exercise of judgment and discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>We hold, therefore, that Miller is entitled to invoke the defense of sovereign immunity and is liable only for gross negligence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we answer the second certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><em>First Certified Question </em>\u2014 <em>Answered in the Affirmative.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><em>Second Certified Question </em>\u2014 <em>Answered in the Affirmative.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\"> Because the damage in this case occurred while the fire truck was en route to the scene of a fire, we do not consider Amtrak\u2019s further argument that Code \u00a7 27-23.6 excludes the operation of a fire truck when returning from a fire scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\"> For an individual governmental official or employee, the defense of sovereign immunity is not absolute. He or she may be held liable, but only for gross negligence. <em>See James </em>v.

Pulling out, he struck the plaintiff\u2019s motorcycle. The jury awarded the plaintiff a verdict, and the deputy appealed. We affirmed, holding that the deputy\u2019s \u201csimple operation of [his] automobile did not involve special risks arising from the governmental activity, or the exercise of judgment or discretion about the proper means of effectuating the governmental purpose of the driver\u2019s employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 400 S.E.2d at 191.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\"> Code \u00a7 46.2-885 provides that, except in cities and towns, whenever a person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing under certain circumstances, he shall stop \u201cand shall not proceed until he can do so safely.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\"> Both sides to this controversy cite <em>Meagher </em>v.

As noted in Colby, 241 Va. 129 n.l, 400 S.E.2d 187 n.l, <em>Meagher </em>did not involve the issue of the applicability of sovereign immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
