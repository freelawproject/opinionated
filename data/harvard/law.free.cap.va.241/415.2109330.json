The sole issue we consider is whether the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence a letter written by the holder of the credit card who did not testify at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In November 1988, Leslie J. Blakeslee was confined in the Augusta County jail on a series of criminal charges pending in local courts. Blakeslee was employed in Georgia managing property owned by a holding company based in Kuwait.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Blakeslee asked appellant Frank A. Mika, an attorney at law, to represent him. Mika was a sole practitioner with an office in Waynesboro. Mika\u2019s only employee was appellant Tammy V. Campbell, who acted as Mika\u2019s secretary and \u201cright arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">On November 16, Mika interviewed Blakeslee at the jail. After discussing the need for Blakeslee to provide funds for bond and for Mika\u2019s fee, Mika agreed to represent Blakeslee. Blakeslee told Mika that he, Blakeslee, was authorized to use a credit card issued to his employer, Mohammed Afif Diab. Diab was a resident of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and was an employee of the Bank of Oman in its Dubai branch. Blakeslee did not possess the card. He suggested to Mika that cash advances be obtained from a local bank to cover the expenses necessary for Mika to undertake the representation. Mika rejected this idea and suggested that Blakeslee contact Diab and that he ask Diab to wire funds to Mika through Western Union in Waynesboro. Blakeslee agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">On November 17, Mika spent the day in Richmond attending a legal education seminar. He instructed Campbell to expect a call from Western Union, to obtain the wired funds, and to deposit the money in his escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">During the day, without Mika\u2019s knowledge, Blakeslee called Campbell, stating that the plans to obtain wired funds had \u201cfallen through.\u201d Blakeslee instructed Campbell to obtain \u201cblank cash advance forms\u201d from a local bank so that sums could be charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>to Diab\u2019s credit card. Stating he was authorized to use Diab\u2019s card, Blakeslee furnished Campbell with the account number for a VISA credit card together with telephone numbers for Diab and the Bank of Oman, which issued the credit card, so that the authorization could be verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Campbell, unfamiliar with the procedure for obtaining credit-card cash advances, went to the main office in Staunton of appellee Planters Bank &amp; Trust Company of Virginia. At the bank, Campbell obtained blank \u201cBankcard Cash Advance\u201d forms, took them to the jail, and Blakeslee completed two forms for cash advances of $2,500 and $4,000. Blakeslee signed the forms and wrote Diab\u2019s name on them. Additionally, he signed a handwritten statement, notarized by Campbell, authorizing her to \u201cpick up cash\u201d on his behalf \u201crelative to 2 VISA cash advances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Campbell returned to Waynesboro and took the documents to a Planters Bank branch. There, the advances were approved and the bank deposited $6,500 to Mika\u2019s escrow account. From those funds, a check for approximately $2,200 was mailed to Atlanta at Blakeslee\u2019s request \u201cto pay his rent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">On November 30, Mika went to the bank\u2019s Staunton office to procure additional cash advances on Diab\u2019s card, pursuant to instructions from Blakeslee, in order to provide funds to cover the amount of bail bonds fixed in connection with the criminal charges. When Mika requested blank cash advance forms to be taken to jail for Blakeslee to sign, a bank employee advised Mika that such blank forms could not be removed from the bank, and that cash advances could not properly be made unless the cardholder was present with his card. Puzzled by the apparent change in procedure by the bank, Mika returned to Waynesboro and asked Campbell to obtain the advances at the Waynesboro branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">On December 1, Campbell went to the branch and, dealing with the same bank employee with whom she had dealt on November 17, obtained two cash advances on Diab\u2019s credit card totalling $8,000 using the same procedure employed for the initial advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Bonds were posted and Blakeslee was released from jail. Subsequently, he personally obtained two cash advances from the bank\u2019s Waynesboro branch on Diab\u2019s card totalling $5,500, making a total of $20,000 charged to the card.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Later, the Bank of Oman notified Planters Bank that all the charges were being refused. Neither Diab nor the Bank of Oman had been reached by telephone by any of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In January 1989, Planters Bank brought the present action against Mika, Campbell, and Blakeslee. Basing the action on actual and constructive fraud, the bank alleged the defendants misrepresented that Blakeslee was authorized to draw cash advances on Diab\u2019s credit card. The bank further alleged that prior to procuring any advances, Campbell and Mika, as well as Blakeslee, were advised by the bank\u2019s main office that, in order to process a cash advance, \u201cthe cardholder had to be present with the credit card, properly identified, and authorization from the Credit Card Center had to be obtained.\u201d The bank further alleged that, notwithstanding this information, defendants proceeded to improperly obtain cash advances from a branch of the bank without presentation of the card and in the absence of the cardholder. Thus, according to the allegations, the defendants, jointly and severally, were liable to the bank for the full amount of the advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Responding, Mika and Campbell denied the bank\u2019s allegations and specifically asserted that the cash advances \u201cwere duly authorized and drawn\u201d on Diab\u2019s credit card. Blakeslee, answering the bank\u2019s allegations, contended that he had verbal authorization to use Diab\u2019s credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">During a November 1989 jury trial, plaintiff's exhibit 11 was offered in evidence. The exhibit includes 15 pages of various sizes joined by a staple. The first page, a printed form with blanks completed by hand, is dated in January 1989 and labelled \u201cCharge-Back/Re-presentation Documentation Transmittal.\u201d At the foot of the page is printed \u201cVISA INTERNATIONAL Operating Regulations.\u201d The form instructs the user to employ \u201cthis form for all Charge-Backs which require documentation and all Representations.\u201d Referring to a charge-back for Planters Bank, the form lists an amount of $4,500. Another such form carrying the same date is included in the exhibit; it refers to a like charge-back for Planters Bank in the amount of $3,500. Both of the forms, within a section titled \u201cSecond Charge-Back Reasons,\u201d contains the following entry written by hand opposite \u201cComments:\u201d \u201cEnclosed cardholder\u2019s letter.\u201d The forms are signed opposite \u201cPrepared by:\u201d by a person whose signature is unintelligible and who is otherwise unidentified on the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Also included in the exhibit are documents labelled \u201cMerchant Advice and Checking Account Entry\u201d showing charges totalling $20,000 against Planters Bank\u2019s account by a bank card center. Also included in the exhibit are completed \u201cBankcard Cash Advance\u201d forms designated \u201cBank Copy,\u201d apparently signed by Blakeslee with Diab\u2019s name also written on the signature lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Additionally, the 15 pages include two machine copies \u00f3f a typewritten letter dated December 17, 1988 written on stationery of the Khor Dubai branch of the Bank of Oman Limited. The letter is addressed to \u201cMr. Sarwar Ali Khan, Centre Manager, Visa Card Centre, Bank of Oman Ltd., Head Office.\u201d The letter purportedly is signed by \u201c(Mohd Afif Diab) Asst. Chief Manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Referring to a specific VISA card number, the letter mentions an earlier letter concerning \u201cerroneous . . . debits to my Visa Card account.\u201d The letter states that during the period of these debits, the writer has \u201cremained in the town\u201d and has not authorized \u201canyone to make transactions against my visa card.\u201d The writer also states that \u201cthe visa card is in my possession\u201d and that it has not been lost or \u201cleft at any place for even a short while.\u201d The letter concludes with a request for cancellation of the card and reissuance of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The trial court admitted the entire exhibit in evidence through the testimony of Planters Bank\u2019s Senior Vice President and Cashier. The witness testified that the documents comprising the exhibit were bank records and \u201cdocuments that were sent back to us stating that these cash advances were not honored; and its the debits coming back that\u2019s advising us that this money is removed from our account.\u201d The witness further testified that he could not verify the authenticity of the Diab letter or state that Diab personally signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Trial counsel for Mika and Campbell, offering to stipulate that the advances had been rejected, objected on hearsay grounds to inclusion of the copies of the letter because the letter contained the reason for rejection, that is, use of the card was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Upon admission, the trial court gave what it called a \u201ccautionary instruction\u201d to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\u201cLadies ... of the jury, this . . . Exhibit Number 11 that we\u2019ve just heard some testimony about, you\u2019ll recall that as an attachment to that exhibit, there is a letter, dated Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ber the seventeenth of 1988, from the Bank of Oman, which gives the reason that they rejected or kicked back this cash advance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">\u201cNow, it\u2019s important that you remember that whether or not the reasons stated in that letter are true or false is irrelevant. It is merely offered to you to show that it was rejected and the reason for the rejection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\u201cSo you should not consider the contents or the information of that letter .... In other words, the truth or falsity of that information should not be considered by you as any substantive evidence in this case. It is merely being offered to show you the reason that the cash advance was rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the court granted the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Blakeslee. Accordingly, final judgment in the amount of $20,000 was entered against him, and it has become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The case proceeded against Mika and Campbell, with the jury finding against both in the amount of $8,000. We awarded them this appeal from the March 1990 judgment in favor of the bank in that amount, limiting the appeal to consideration of the question whether the copies of the Diab letter correctly were admitted and, if so, whether the cautionary instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">On appeal, the bank advances several alternative theories to support the trial court\u2019s action in admitting the letter. The bank argues that the letter is not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of its statements; that admission is authorized by statute; that admission is allowed under the modern Shopbook Rule; that admission was harmless error, if error at all; and that the court\u2019s cautionary instruction eliminated any risk of prejudice to Mika and Campbell. We do not agree with any of the bank\u2019s theories for admission. We hold that the letter was inadmissible for any of the purposes urged by the bank, and that its admission was reversible error. Consequently, we do not reach the question whether the cautionary instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Before addressing the bank\u2019s arguments specifically, we will describe what the letter is, and what it is not. The letter is a personal letter written to a VISA card center about problems the cardholder was having \u201cregarding erroneous . . . debits to my Visa Card account,\u201d in the words of the letter writer. Contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the trial court\u2019s observation in the cautionary instruction, it was not \u201cfrom the Bank of Oman.\u201d It was merely an employee\u2019s personal letter written on his employer\u2019s stationery about a subject personal to the writer, even though Diab\u2019s title as \u201cAsst. Chief Manager\u201d was typed below his signature. The entire text of the letter deals with business personal to Diab, and not with affairs of the Bank of Oman.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Additionally, the letter is grouped with a series of pages tendered as one exhibit, which is described by Planters Bank as a \u201cbatch\u201d of documents received by the bank from a bank card center in Richmond, Virginia. Two of the documents are printed forms apparently used by \u201cVISA INTERNATIONAL\u201d to accomplish \u201cCharge-Backs.\u201d Those forms refer under \u201cComments\u201d to \u201c[ejnclosed cardholder\u2019s letter,\u201d the Diab letter. But it is abundantly clear that, on the question of admissibility as evidence, the letter is not an integral, inseparable part of the forms so that it must be accepted as essential proof of the \u201cCharge-Backs.\u201d Eight of the other documents in the \u201cbatch\u201d establish that the cash advances in issue had been rejected by the credit card network spreading from Oman to Richmond to Staunton. The documents making this clear are the two \u201cCharge-Back\u201d forms and six forms labelled \u201cMerchant Advice and Checking Account Entry.\u201d And, Mika and Campbell did not object to receipt of those documents in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The importance of the Diab letter cannot be overstated. One element of the bank\u2019s fraud case against Mika and Campbell required proof that Blakeslee was not authorized to charge against Diab\u2019s card. The bank attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that its case against Mika and Campbell depended entirely on proof that employees at the Waynesboro branch were duped by Mika and Campbell into approving cash advances when Mika and Campbell knew, because of what they had been told at the Staunton office, that no cash advance could be processed without the presence of the cardholder and his card. The fact remains, however, that if, in fact, the charges were authorized by Diab, as the defendants\u2019 evidence showed, the bank would have had no case against Mika or Campbell, even though Waynesboro bank employees may have disregarded the bank\u2019s own rules pertaining to cash advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Against this background, we consider whether the letter was admissible under the modern Shopbook Rule, adopted in Vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ginia as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, allowing admission in evidence of verified regular entries, without requiring proof of the original observers or record keepers. <em>See Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Phelps, 239 </em>Va. 272, 275, 389 S.E.2d 454, 457 (1990). We conclude that the letter is not the type of \u201cverified regular entry\u201d contemplated by the Shopbook Rule. It was not an \u201centry\u201d in Planters Bank\u2019s records. It was not an \u201centry\u201d in the Bank of Oman\u2019s records. It was merely incorporated by reference in one of a \u201cbatch\u201d of documents gathered together by a credit card center to justify a \u201cCharge-Back.\u201d This incorporation by reference was utterly insufficient as a guarantee of trustworthiness or reliability to warrant admission of this hearsay document.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The bank\u2019s statutory argument relies on Code \u00a7 8.3-510. That statute allows for creation of a presumption of dishonor by introduction into evidence of one of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201c(b) the purported stamp or writing of the drawee, payor bank or presenting bank on the instrument or accompanying it stating that acceptance or payment has been refused for reasons consistent with dishonor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\u201c(c) any book or record of the drawee, payor bank, or any collecting bank kept in the usual course of business which shows dishonor, even though there is no evidence of who made the entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We are of opinion that the statute does not apply under these circumstances.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Diab\u2019s personal letter to a bank card center fails to qualify as a stamp or writing \u201cof the drawee, payor bank or presenting bank,\u201d according to subsection (b) of the statute. Moreover, the letter is not \u201cany book or record of the drawee, payor bank, or any collecting bank kept in the usual course of business,\u201d within the meaning of subsection (c), for the reasons we addressed when dealing with the Shopbook Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Finally, we conclude that the letter was, in fact, submitted to prove the truth of its essential content, and that the error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>admission of the letter was not harmless. The letter comprised the only proof that Blakeslee was not authorized by Diab to charge against the credit card. Hence, its admission was highly prejudicial to Mika and Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Consequently, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed. Because the inadmissible letter constituted the only proof of an essential element of the bank\u2019s case, the claim against Mika and Campbell fails for lack of proof. Thus, final judgment will be entered here in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\"> Parenthetically, we will not discuss the questions (because they have not been debated by the parties) whether a \u201cBankcard Cash Advance\u201d form is an \u201cinstrument\u201d within the meaning of Virginia\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code (\u201c \u2018Instrument\u2019 means a negotiable instrument.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.3-102( 1 )(e)), or whether a \u201cCharge-Back\u201d of a credit card cash advance amounts to a \u201cdishonor\u201d within the meaning of the Code. See \u00a7 8.3-507(1) (\u201cAn instrument is dishonored when . . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
