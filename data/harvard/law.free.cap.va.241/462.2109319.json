Marie Wolfe, administratrix of the estate of Robbie Shawn Wolfe (the administratrix), sued Frederick L. Baube, III, for the alleged wrongful death of the administratrix\u2019s 18-year-old son, Robbie Shawn Wolfe (Wolfe). A jury, finding that both Baube and Wolfe were guilty of willful and wanton negligence, returned a verdict in Baube\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court entered judgment for Baube, and the administratrix appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">Wolfe died from injuries sustained in an automobile collision on Route 50, a limited-access highway in Arlington County. The ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>cident occurred shortly before 1:00 a.m. on November 13, 1986. The portion of the highway where the accident occurred is straight and relatively level and contains six lanes of travel \u2014 three lanes on each side of double, solid yellow lines. The night was clear, visibility was good, the surface of the highway was dry, and traffic was relatively light. The speed limit was 45 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Immediately prior to the collision, Wolfe was driving his automobile eastbound, and Baube was driving his van westbound. Another vehicle, also traveling eastbound, was operated by Michael Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Clark testified that he was driving his automobile in the right, eastbound lane when he observed ahead of him \u201ca dark rectangular object,\u201d without lights, in the left, eastbound lane. Clark thought that the object was traveling eastbound. The object, however, was Baube\u2019s van, traveling westbound in the left, eastbound lane, with no lights on.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Clark then saw Wolfe\u2019s car pass him in the left, eastbound lane. Clark estimated that the Wolfe vehicle was traveling at a speed of 80 to 85 miles per hour. Immediately thereafter, the brakes on Wolfe\u2019s vehicle were applied suddenly, and Wolfe moved to the center, eastbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Baube\u2019s vehicle also moved to the center, eastbound lane where the two vehicles collided almost head-on. Clark slammed on his brakes but was unable to stop his vehicle before it collided with the rear of Wolfe\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">An investigating police officer testified concerning physical evidence discovered at the accident scene. The officer found a yaw, or scuff, mark made by Wolfe\u2019s vehicle that commenced 288 feet before the point of impact. The right, front tire of Wolfe\u2019s car left a skid mark of 126 feet to the point of impact. These marks showed that Wolfe\u2019s car moved in a straight line, diagonally from the left, eastbound lane into the center, eastbound lane, and they corroborated Clark\u2019s recollection of the accident. Over the administratrix\u2019s objection, the officer was allowed to testify that, at impact, Wolfe\u2019s car was traveling at a minimum of 53.67 miles per hour and at a maximum of 60.55 miles per hour.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Baube\u2019s vehicle left no skid marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Baube admitted to a nurse in the hospital to which he was taken that, during a period of several days immediately prior to the accident, he had consumed \u201ca whole lot\u201d of alcohol. When the collision occurred, Baube \u201chad a beer in [his] hand.\u201d After the accident, Baube\u2019s blood alcohol level was 0.18% by volume. Baube stipulated that he had pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Under the general rule, a defendant who is willfully and wantonly negligent cannot rely upon a plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence as a defense. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>162 Va. 654, 660-61, 174 S.E. 837, 840 (1934). This rule, however, is subject to the exception that, when a plaintiff also is guilty of willful and wanton conduct, such conduct bars a recovery. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>227 Va. 317, 322, 315 S.E.2d 210, 213 (1984). Thus, because Baube was guilty of willful and wanton negligence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he cannot rely upon contributory negligence as a defense unless Wolfe\u2019s conduct also amounts to willful and wanton negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In <em>Griffin, </em>we said that \u201c[w]illful and wanton negligence is acting consciously in disregard of another person\u2019s rights or acting with reckless indifference to the consequences, with the defendant aware, from his knowledge of existing circumstances and conditions, that his conduct probably would cause injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 315 S.E.2d at 213. Willful and wanton negligence is greater in degree than gross negligence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cparticularly in the sense that in [willful and wanton negligence] an actual or constructive consciousness of the danger involved is an essential ingredient of the act or omission . . . .\u201d <em>Boward </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>197 Va. 227, 231, 89 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The administratrix contends that the trial court erred in submitting to the jury the issue whether Wolfe was guilty of willful and wanton negligence. Stated differently, she contends that, as a matter of law, Wolfe was not willfully and wantonly negligent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Immediately before Wolfe passed Clark\u2019s vehicle, Clark could discern only a \u201cdark rectangular object\u201d ahead of him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>When it became apparent to Clark, and presumably to Wolfe, that a westbound vehicle (Baube\u2019s), without lights, was approaching in an eastbound lane, Wolfe immediately took evasive actions by applying the brakes and turning his vehicle to the right. Consequently, rather than showing a conscious disregard of the rights of others when he became aware of the condition Baube created, Wolfe did what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances to avoid causing injury to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Unquestionably, the evidence shows that Wolfe was negligent, and perhaps grossly negligent. The evidence, however, does not support a finding that Wolfe\u2019s excessive speed, under the circumstances of this case, constituted negligence so willful, wanton, and reckless as to evince a conscious disregard of the rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">While all degrees of negligence ordinarily are issues for a jury, we conclude that, as a matter of law, Wolfe\u2019s conduct does not amount to willful and wanton negligence. We think that reasonable minds could not differ on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for a new trial limited to a determination of the quantum of damages to which the administratrix shall be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-16\"> Without objection, the trial court directed the jury to return a special verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\"> The administratrix has assigned error to the admission of this evidence. In view of the decision we reach, however, we do not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"> This ruling is not challenged in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> We have defined gross negligence as \u201cthat degree of negligence which shows indifference to others as constitutes an utter disregard of prudence amounting to a complete neglect of the safety of [another]. It must be such a degree of negligence as would shock fair minded men although something less than willful recklessness.\u201d <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>212 Va. 86, 92, 181 S.E.2d 648, 653 (1971) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
