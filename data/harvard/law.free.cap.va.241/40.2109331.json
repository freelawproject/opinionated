The plaintiffs seek damages for the attorney\u2019s alleged \u201cbreach of fiduciary responsibility\u201d to the clients. First, we will address an issue of appellate procedure. Second, we will consider the merits of the trial court\u2019s substantive ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In 1988, appellant William J. Weidman and his brother, appellant Richard C. Weidman, M.D., filed separate and virtually identical actions against appellee William L. Babcock, Jr., Esquire, and his law firm, appellee Ross, Marsh, Foster, Myers and Quiggle. Generally, the plaintiffs alleged in amended motions for judgment that an attorney-client relationship existed between them and Babcock during the period May 1984 to January 1986. The plaintiffs alleged that Babcock rendered various legal services to them during the period in connection with estate and trust matters involving family members, including their mother, who was in ill health, and their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The plaintiffs further alleged that, beginning in September 1987, Babcock undertook to represent their father, a party adverse to them, against their interests in at least seven contested actions pending in the court below. The plaintiffs alleged that, in those proceedings, \u201cBabcock has attempted to exploit to the disadvantage of\u201d the plaintiffs information gained from the plaintiffs during the former attorney-client relationship. Accordingly, the plaintiffs alleged, they have been damaged as the direct and proximate result of \u201cBabcock\u2019s breach of fiduciary responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Subsequently, defendants filed motions to dismiss the present actions. The defendants referred to the \u201cseveral legal disputes\u201d which commenced in 1987 between the plaintiffs and their father \u201cconcerning the estate and trust matters and also the guardianship of the plaintiffs\u2019 mother.\u201d Defendants asserted that in \u201cseveral of these lawsuits, the plaintiffs raised a conflict issue\u201d by moving to disqualify Babcock as attorney for the father on the grounds that he had represented the plaintiffs \u201cduring the drafting of the estate and trust materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Defendants further alleged in their motion to dismiss that, in September 1988, attorneys for the plaintiffs withdrew the motions to disqualify Babcock \u201cin all of the earlier mentioned lawsuits, and those cases proceeded to their respective conclusions.\u201d Defendants also alleged that, in the present lawsuits, the plaintiffs claim to have been damaged by Babcock\u2019s conduct which resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>in \u201cthe unfavorable outcomes in those prior lawsuits.\u201d Concluding, defendants asserted that, \u201cby removing the motions to disqualify in the earlier lawsuits, the plaintiffs have waived their right to allege a breach of an attorney/client relationship in the actions pending before the court today, as well as the alleged damages that the plaintiffs claim from the unfavorable outcomes of the prior lawsuits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">On January 16, 1990, the trial court heard oral argument from counsel for all parties on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Upon consideration of the argument, the court announced from the bench that defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion is granted.\u201d Counsel for the plaintiffs did not voice an objection to this ruling. On February 7, 1990, the decision made during the hearing was memorialized in a \u201cFinal Order,\u201d which recited that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 motion ... to dismiss on the grounds of waiver is sustained and . . . the plaintiffs\u2019 cases shall be dismissed with prejudice.\u201d The order was endorsed \u201cSEEN\u201d by counsel for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">On February 12, 1990, plaintiffs, by counsel, filed a notice that on February 16, 1990, they would move the trial judge \u201cto reconsider his ruling that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims herein are barred by waiver,\u201d citing Rule 1:1 (all final judgments shall remain under control of trial court for 21 days after date of entry, and no longer). On February 16, 1990, plaintiffs filed a nine-page memorandum with the court in support of the motion to reconsider. Following a hearing, the trial court entered an order on February 16 denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel endorsed that order, \u201cSEEN: and <em>all </em>Exceptions noted.\u201d We awarded plaintiffs this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">On appeal, defendants contend that the plaintiffs have not preserved properly their right to appeal. They note that objection was not made on behalf of the plaintiffs to the oral ruling sustaining the motion to dismiss and that the record does not \u201creflect the absence of an opportunity\u201d for plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to object. Further, defendants note that \u201cthe Order memorializing the Court\u2019s ruling was endorsed by appellants\u2019 counsel merely as \u2018seen\u2019 and not \u2018objected to.\u2019 \u201d Consequently, defendants contend, \u201cappellants have thus repeated a fatal error of judgment and law \u2014 not only did they waive their right to proceed against Babcock, but they likewise waived their right to appeal the clear ruling of the trial court.\u201d We do not agree that the appeal is barred procedurally.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Rule 5:25, governing appeals to this Court, provides, in part: \u201cError will not be sustained to any ruling of the trial court . . . unless the objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-384 touches the issue at the trial court level. It provides that formal exceptions to rulings or orders are unnecessary but \u201cit shall be sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objections to the action of the court and his grounds therefor.\u201d And, we have stated that a party\u2019s failure to object to a final order by merely endorsing it as \u201cSeen,\u201d without more, is not sufficient to preserve that party\u2019s right to appeal. <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Meredith, </em>237 Va. 55, 61-62, 376 S.E.2d 519, 522 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In the present case, however, we do not have a bare failure to object to the court\u2019s ruling from the bench followed by endorsement of the final order merely as \u201cSeen.\u201d Instead, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel during the January 16 hearing on the motion to dismiss repeatedly made known to the court his position. Typical of counsel\u2019s argument was the following statement: \u201cThere was no express waiver of my clients\u2019 rights to prosecute an action for a breach of fiduciary duty against their former attorney.\u201d Then, during the 21-day period under Rule 1:1 within which the trial court retained jurisdiction over the final order, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing and a nine-page memorandum contending that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not barred by the doctrine of waiver. Additionally, counsel for the plaintiffs endorsed the order denying the motion for reconsideration entered on February 16, within 21 days of the February 7 final order, as \u201cSEEN: and <em>all </em>Exceptions noted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals. <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Baumgardner, </em>217 Va. 769, 773, 232 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1977). In addition, a specific, contemporaneous objection gives the opposing party the opportunity to meet the objection at that stage of the proceeding. <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Fayen, </em>196 Va. 860, 866, 86 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1955). Those opportunities were afforded both the trial court and counsel for defendants in this case. Consequently, we hold that the plaintiffs preserved their right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Turning to the. merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we will first review the settled principles applicable to the waiver theory ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>vanced by defendants. \u201cWaiver is the voluntary, intentional abandonment of a known legal right, advantage, or privilege.\u201d <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Deese, </em>234 Va. 412, 425, 362 S.E.2d 699, 707 (1987). Essential elements of the doctrine are both knowledge of the facts basic to the exercise of the right and the intent to relinquish that right. <em>Id. </em>A waiver of legal rights will be implied only upon clear and unmistakable proof of the intention to waive such rights; the essence of waiver is voluntary choice. <em>May </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>205 Va. 397, 404, 137 S.E.2d 860, 865 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Measured against the foregoing criteria, the record fails to establish that plaintiffs waived their right to prosecute their present claims against defendants. Specifically, defendants did not clearly and unmistakably prove the required voluntary, intentional abandonment by plaintiffs of their legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The record on appeal pertinent to this issue includes copies of various pleadings, motions, and portions of transcripts, some relating to the prior litigation. This material is properly a part of the record, notwithstanding defendants\u2019 claim to the contrary as to some of the material.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In the litigation begun in 1987 involving their father as an adverse party, the plaintiffs moved in 1988 to disqualify Babcock from his representation of the father. The plaintiffs asserted that because Babcock had received \u201csubstantial confidential information from the Weidman family as the family attorney,\u201d he had \u201ca conflict of interest\u201d in representing the father in intra-family disputes. Responding, Babcock on behalf of the father moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 motion on the ground that \u201cethical standards regarding conflict of interest are administered by the Virginia State Bar, not the Courts.\u201d A judge of the court below ruled that evidence should be heard to determine whether Babcock \u201cmay continue in the cases.\u201d The court stayed the several lawsuits \u201cuntil that determination is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">On September 3, 1988, immediately prior to the taking of a deposition related to the disqualification motions, plaintiffs, by counsel, informed the father\u2019s attorney that the motions to disqualify were being withdrawn in some of the pending lawsuits. Counsel for plaintiffs stated that although \u201cwe still believe the motion was proper and is proper,\u201d his clients had directed him to withdraw the motion in four of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>On September 8, formal pleadings withdrawing the motions to disqualify were filed. On September 12 and 13, the present damage suits were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Subsequently, counsel for the father filed a motion asking the court to direct that the disqualification motions be withdrawn with prejudice. On September 16, during argument on the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d motion, counsel for the plaintiffs stated to the court the reasons for the withdrawal motions. Counsel represented that because the prior litigation was being delayed pending determination of the disqualification motions, his clients desired to proceed with the prior litigation and to \u201cpursue other remedies regarding Mr. Babcock.\u201d Counsel reiterated his clients\u2019 belief that Babcock\u2019s \u201cposition is ethically untenable.\u201d At the conclusion of the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d hearing, the court refused to grant Babcock\u2019s motion, stating that the motions for disqualification \u201care withdrawn.\u201d Defendants do not dispute plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that no order was entered stating that the motions to disqualify were withdrawn with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The foregoing facts and circumstances fail to show that the plaintiffs expressly or impliedly either voluntarily or intentionally abandoned their claims against Babcock when they withdrew the disqualification motions. Rather, the record demonstrates affirmatively that the motions were withdrawn in order to divorce the conflict of interest issue from the prior litigation so that it could be concluded promptly and so that Babcock\u2019s alleged improper conduct could be the subject of \u201cother remedies\u201d in \u201ca different forum,\u201d that is, in the present actions. Furthermore, the withdrawal of the motions to disqualify was a discontinuance of the plaintiffs\u2019 effort to prevent Babcock\u2019s <em>future </em>representation of the plaintiffs\u2019 opponent. Such withdrawal cannot be fairly interpreted as a release of Babcock from liability for damages allegedly resulting from his <em>past </em>conduct up to the time of withdrawal of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court erred in sustaining defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. We will reverse the order of dismissal and remand the actions to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
