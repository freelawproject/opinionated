Burroughs, filed this negligence action against the defendant, Harris-Teeter, Inc., seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained by the plaintiff when she swallowed a plastic ornament used by the defendant to decorate a birthday cake. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $20,000. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict, and we awarded the defendant an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The evidence shows that the defendant operates a grocery store in Danville. On December 27, 1986, the plaintiff\u2019s daughter-in-law, Vicki Burroughs, ordered a sheet cake from the store for her twins\u2019 sixth birthday party, to be held on that evening. She directed the store to place \u201cnothing else\u201d on the cake but \u201cicing . . . with the rainbow design\u201d because she wanted to use her own plastic \u201ccare bear\u201d decorations.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Vicki picked up the cake at the defendant\u2019s store and took it to her home. Upon examination, she found on the cake two plastic birds, whitish in color, resting on the white \u201cclouds\u201d that formed a part of the cake\u2019s design. Vicki left the plastic birds on the cake and added candles and her own \u201ccare bear\u201d ornaments.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">Before serving the cake at the birthday party, Vicki removed the candles and the \u201ccare bears\u201d but not the plastic birds. The participants consumed approximately three-quarters of the cake, leaving the top portion, where the plastic birds were located. The remainder was returned to the box and placed on a counter in Vicki\u2019s kitchen. Vicki served a piece of the cake to her uncle when he visited her the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">Two days after the party, the plaintiff visited Vicki\u2019s home, accompanied by her granddaughter, Annette Pruitt. At Vicki\u2019s invitation, Annette cut two pieces of the cake, placed them on paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>towels, and handed one to the plaintiff. Neither Annette nor the plaintiff saw anything on the cake other than the icing.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The plaintiff put the piece of cake in her mouth and swallowed it whole, without chewing it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> She knew there was a \u201cproblem . . . [a]s soon as she swallowed it.\u201d She said \u201csomething [was] in that cake\u201d and went to the kitchen to get a drink of water. Some three to four weeks later, she consulted a physician. She underwent surgery, and a white plastic bird one inch long and one and one-half inches wide was removed from her colon.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">As noted previously, negligence is the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case is that the defendant was negligent because it \u201ccreated an unreasonably dangerous situation by [furnishing] small, firm plastic ornaments of the same color as [the cake\u2019s] icing to a consumer who had not requested them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">As this quotation indicates, the plaintiff argues that Vicki Burroughs did not request the defendant to decorate the cake with white plastic birds. We cannot conceive, however, of any possible way the outcome of this case would be affected by the fact the defendant furnished the plastic birds of its own volition. Accordingly, we reject this argument as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The plaintiff also argues that a plastic bird was embedded within the cake at the time it left the defendant\u2019s store. But when the plaintiff asked a store co-manager on cross-examination whether it was \u201cconceivable that one of [his] people pushed a bird . . . right through the icing\u201d of the cake, the defendant objected on the ground \u201cno . . . evidence indicates that at all,\u201d and the trial court sustained the objection. The plaintiff has not assigned cross-error to the ruling. Hence, we will not consider the plaintiff\u2019s argument on this point. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">This leaves as the sole question in the case whether it was negligence for the defendant to place plastic birds, whitish in color, on \u201cclouds\u201d formed by icing of the same coloration. With respect to the burden of proof on such a question, we said in <em>Brockett </em>v. <em>Harrell Bros., Inc., </em>206 Va. 457, 462, 143 S.E.2d 897, 901-02 (1965), that where a plaintiff allegedly suffers injury from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>a deleterious substance in food, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the food product contained foreign matter at the time the retailer sold and delivered the product to the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">While <em>Brockett </em>is an implied warranty case, the burden of proof is the same although, as here, the claim is based upon negligence. <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward, </em>216 Va. 425, 428, 219 S.E.2d 685, 687 (1975) (plaintiff injured in explosion of gas stove; evidence insufficient to establish either negligence or breach of warranty). We said in <em>Logan </em>that the burden requires the plaintiff to show \u201c(1) that the goods were unreasonably dangerous either for the use to which they would ordinarily be put or for some other reasonably foreseeable purpose, and (2) that the unreasonably dangerous condition existed when the goods left the defendant\u2019s hands.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We do not think the plaintiff proved either that the plastic birds constituted foreign matter within the meaning of <em>Brockett </em>or that the birds\u2019 placement on the white icing of the cake created an unreasonably dangerous condition within the meaning of <em>Logan. </em>It is clear from the record that the birds were in plain view at the time the cake was delivered to Vicki Burroughs. Hence, at that time, the placement of the birds did not pose a threat of danger to anyone and their presence did not constitute foreign matter any more than the plastic \u201ccare bears\u201d Vicki Burroughs added to the cake\u2019s decorations.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">It was the duty of the defendant to see that the food product it sold and delivered to Vicki Burroughs was free from foreign matter and otherwise fit for human consumption. So far as this record discloses, the defendant\u2019s use of plastic birds in decorating the cake represented nothing more than a normal, every-day practice, devoid of any suggestion of negligent conduct. Hence, under the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the defendant breached any duty it owed Vicki Burroughs or her guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">For the reasons assigned, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, set aside the jury verdict, and enter final judgment here in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\"> The defendant maintains that the piece of cake the plaintiff consumed was two and one-half inches square. However, when asked on cross-examination whether the piece of cake was that size, the plaintiff responded by saying she did not know. When asked whether she had said on deposition the piece of cake was two and one-half inches square, she said she did not \u201cremember saying that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
