Specifically, we decide whether, and under what cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>cumstances, the Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 duty of \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d required the lawyer to investigate information opposing counsel gave him indicating that the lawyer\u2019s client might not prevail in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">On July 8, 1988, Virginia Johnson, a licensing inspector for the Virginia Department of Social Services, accompanied by Barbara Ann Gestwick, the licensing administrator, and William Davidson, a zoning officer of the City of Richmond, sought permission from Ralph M. Montecalvo to inspect his residence in Richmond for possible violation of Code \u00a7 63.1-182. Code \u00a7 63.1-182 prohibits the operation of a home for the care of more than four aged, infirm or disabled adults without obtaining a license therefor from the Virginia Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Upon advice of counsel, Montecalvo refused to permit an inspection. Whereupon, Johnson, Gestwick and Davidson went to a magistrate and got a search warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although allegedly not requested to do so, the magistrate also issued an arrest warrant charging Montecalvo with the statutory violation of interfering with Johnson in the performance of her duties (the interference charge).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The arrest warrant showed that the magistrate found probable cause for the interference charge \u201cbased on the sworn statements of Virginia Johnson . . . Complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Johnson appeared pursuant to subpoena and was the only prosecution witness who testified at the trial of the interference charge. Montecalvo was found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Shortly thereafter, Thomas H. Oxenham, III, Montecalvo\u2019s counsel in the criminal proceeding, filed this malicious prosecution action on behalf of Montecalvo against Johnson because of her alleged instigation of the interference charge. In a pretrial deposition, Montecalvo testified that he had never talked to Johnson, that he had not felt \u201charassed\u201d by Johnson, and that he had no reason to believe she bore him any ill will. Prior to trial, opposing counsel advised Oxenham orally, in responsive pleadings, and in legal memoranda filed in the case, that Gestwick, not Johnson, had executed the affidavit for the search warrant, and that no one had requested the arrest warrant to be issued against Montecalvo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>for interfering with them in the performance of their duties. Nevertheless, Oxenham continued to press Montecalvo\u2019s claim by filing and signing two memoranda of law and his client\u2019s answers to Johnson\u2019s interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">At trial, Montecalvo\u2019s evidence that linked Johnson to the institution of the interference charge consisted of the magistrate\u2019s notation on the warrant and Montecalvo\u2019s testimony that Johnson was the only prosecution witness who appeared at the interference charge trial. Johnson\u2019s evidence confirmed her counsel\u2019s pretrial information to Oxenham. After only 10 minutes\u2019 deliberation, a jury returned a verdict for Johnson and judgment was entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Invoking Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1, Johnson filed a \u201cMotion to Assess Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs\u201d against Oxenham and Montecalvo,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging violations of a duty to make reasonable inquiry regarding Johnson\u2019s role in the issuance of the arrest warrant. As pertinent, Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">The signature of an attorney . . . constitutes a certificate by him that (i) he has read the pleading, motion, or other paper, (ii) to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, <em>formed after reasonable inquiry, </em>it is well grounded in fact . . ., and (iii) it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">An oral motion made by an attorney ... in any court of the Commonwealth constitutes a representation by him that (i) to the best of his knowledge, information and belief <em>formed after reasonable inquiry </em>it is well grounded in fact . . ., and (ii) it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed or made in violation of this rule, the court . . . shall impose upon the person who signed the paper or made the motion ... an appropriate sanction ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"A6Y\">Oxenham\u2019s failure, after being told by opposing counsel that Johnson had nothing to do with the issuance of the arrest warrant, led the trial court \u201cto the inevitable conclusion that the purpose of filing the motion for judgment was not to prevail on the merits but to harass the defendant.\u201d The court also found that Oxenham failed in his duty to \u201ccontinually review and re-evaluate his position\u201d by failing to \u201cfollow up with investigation or . . . conduct any discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Accordingly, the court assessed a sanction against Oxenham in the sum of $4,500, representing a part of Johnson\u2019s counsel\u2019s projected billings of $10,383. Oxenham appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">First, we review some of the policy considerations in sanction cases. The possibility of a sanction can protect litigants from the mental anguish and expense of frivolous assertions of unfounded factual and legal claims and against the assertions of valid claims for improper purposes. And, sanctions can be used to protect courts against those who would abuse the judicial process. Yet the threat of a sanction should not be used to stifle counsel in advancing novel legal theories or asserting a client\u2019s rights in a doubtful case. Finally, courts should take care that the litigation of a sanction issue does not itself defeat one purpose of Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1, that of reducing the volume of unnecessary litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Because of the harm that can be caused by an unjustified imposition of a sanction, Oxenham argues that the standard of review applicable in a sanction case in Virginia is \u201csomewhat deferential . . . [but] appears more closely akin to a <em>de novo </em>review\u201d than to an abuse-of-discretion standard. Oxenham notes that in <em>Cooter &amp; Gell </em>v. <em>Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. _,_, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2461 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201can appellate court should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court\u2019s Rule 11 determination.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Oxenham, however, contends that this Court has adopted a standard \u201csomewhat at odds\u201d with the federal standard, citing <em>County of Prince William </em>v. <em>Rau, </em>239 Va. 616, 620, 391 S.E.2d 290, 293 (1990), and <em>Tullidge </em>v. <em>Board of Sup. of Augusta County, </em>239 Va. 611, 614, 391 S.E.2d 288, 289 (1990). These cases do not support Oxenham\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Tullidge </em>merely held that where the issue underlying the imposition of a sanction \u201cis one of law, and not fact, we do not accord the trial court\u2019s ruling the same weight it would be accorded if reached upon conflicting factual evidence.\u201d 239 Va. at 614, 391 S.E.2d at 289; <em>see Rau, </em>239 Va. at 620, 391 S.E.2d at 293. This holding does not differ in substance from the statement in <em>Cooter &amp; Gell </em>that \u201c[a trial] court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a <em>clearly </em>erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d 496 U.S. at _, 110 S.Ct. at 2461 (emphasis added). Thus, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing a trial court\u2019s award or denial of a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We now turn to this case. To create a factual issue in his malicious prosecution action against Johnson, Montecalvo was required to present credible evidence: (1) that the prosecution was set on foot by Johnson and that it terminated in a manner not unfavorable to Montecalvo; (2) that it was instituted or procured by the cooperation of Johnson; (3) that it was without probable cause; and (4) that it was malicious. <em>See Bain </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>217 Va. 387, 393, 228 S.E.2d 576, 581 (1976). Legal malice, inferred from the circumstances, suffices for an award of compensatory damages, but actual malice must be shown to recover punitive damages. <em>F.B.C. Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>214 Va. 246, 252, 198 S.E.2d 595, 600 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Johnson contends that Montecalvo had no evidence that she instituted the prosecution or that her actions were malicious. According to Johnson, if Oxenham had complied with his duty of \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d and interviewed her witnesses at any time before trial, he would have discovered that he could not have established that Johnson \u201cinstituted or procured\u201d the prosecution or that she acted with malice. Therefore, Johnson argues, Oxenham\u2019s pleadings and oral motions violated Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 because they were frivolous and were filed for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Because no cross-error was assigned to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the initial filing was justified, we are concerned only with Oxenham\u2019s conduct <em>after </em>the action was filed. Although we agree with Oxenham\u2019s contention that Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 imposes no continuing duty upon a lawyer to \u201cupdate his pleadings in light of any new findings,\u201d <em>see Pantry Queen Foods </em>v. <em>Lifschultz Fast Freight, </em>809 F.2d 451, 454 (7th Cir. 1987) (construing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), we reject his contention that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>no </em>further duty to investigate Johnson\u2019s role after filing the motion for judgment. The duty of \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d arises <em>each time </em>a lawyer files a \u201cpleading, motion, or other paper\u201d or makes \u201can oral motion.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1. If Oxenham had filed any paper or made any motion in the case <em>after </em>he knew, or reasonably should have known, that he could not create a factual issue of Johnson\u2019s involvement and malice, the court would have been justified in imposing a sanction against him. <em>See, e.g., Schoenberger </em>v. <em>Oselka, 909 </em>F.2d 1086, 1088 (7th Cir. 1990) (construing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Because different levels of malice are required in the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages for malicious prosecution, we consider first Montecalvo\u2019s claim for compensatory damages. Initially, the trial court found that the documentary and circumstantial evidence of Johnson\u2019s role in the institution of the criminal action against Montecalvo was sufficient to justify <em>filing </em>Montecalvo\u2019s malicious prosecution action. Apparently, the same evidence also justified submission of the case for jury consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the jury may not have believed the three witnesses who, in contradiction to the language in the arrest warrant, denied Johnson\u2019s role in instituting the interference charge against Montecalvo. Juries are not required to accept testimony which is contradicted by credible documentary or circumstantial evidence. <em>See Chaves </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>230 Va. 112, 122-23, 335 S.E.2d 97, 104 (1985) (circumstantial and documentary evidence); <em>Drake </em>v. <em>National Bank of Commerce, </em>168 Va. 230, 243-44, 190 S.E. 302, 308 (1937) (circumstantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Additionally, the appearance of Johnson\u2019s name as the complainant on the arrest warrant sufficed to support an inference that she acted with legal malice in instigating the interference charge against Montecalvo. Whoever caused the arrest warrant to issue had no probable cause to claim an unlawful interference with Johnson\u2019s performance of her duties because Montecalvo had a constitutional right to require a search warrant before such an inspection. This lack of probable cause was sufficient to support an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>inference of Johnson\u2019s legal malice. <em>Giant of Virginia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pigg, </em>207 Va. 679, 685, 152 S.E.2d 271, 276 (1967). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that this claim was frivolous was erroneous and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Next, we consider whether the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Oxenham\u2019s failure to investigate Montecalvo\u2019s claim for compensatory damages demonstrated an intent \u201cnot to prevail on the merits but to harass [Johnson].\u201d Although a number of adverse inferences might be drawn from Oxenham\u2019s failure to make any investigation after filing the motion for judgment, an intent to harass is not one of them. The record contains no evidence of threats or expressions of ill will on Oxenham\u2019s part, no pattern of persistent and harassing pleadings, and nothing to show that Oxenham was not attempting to recover damages for his client. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s inference of an intent to harass from a failure to investigate was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence and, therefore, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in basing its award, in whole or in part, upon Oxenham\u2019s continued assertion of Montecalvo\u2019s claim for compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We now consider whether the sanction might have been justified because of Oxenham\u2019s continued assertion of the punitive damage claim. Johnson\u2019s legal malice in instigating the arrest warrant would not have authorized an award of punitive damages. In malicious prosecution actions, evidence of \u201cmisconduct or actual malice, or such recklessness or negligence as to evince a conscious disregard of the rights of others\u201d is required. <em>Giant of Virginia, </em>207 Va. at 685, 152 S.E.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Montecalvo\u2019s pretrial discovery testimony established conclusively that Johnson was not guilty of misconduct or actual malice. Furthermore, if Oxenham had made \u201creasonable inquiry,\u201d he would have known, or reasonably should have known, that he had no evidence that Johnson had acted in reckless and wanton disregard of Montecalvo\u2019s rights. Therefore, Oxenham should not have asserted Montecalvo\u2019s frivolous claim for punitive damages at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">However, the trial court did not distinguish between the two damage claims in its award of an attorneys\u2019 fee sanction. Attorneys\u2019 fee sanctions have been imposed under Federal Rule 11 for asserting a frivolous claim with nonfrivolous ones, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>defense of the frivolous claim was essentially unrelated to the defenses of the nonfrivolous claims. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>841 F.2d 386, 387 (11th Cir. 1988) (suing a party who had no conceivable liability in a separate count of a multiple count complaint); <em>Frantz </em>v. <em>U.S. Powerlifting Fed\u2019n, </em>836 F.2d 1063, 1067 (7th Cir. 1987) (assertion of baseless legal theory in multiple count antitrust complaint containing other counts with colorable legal theories).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Here, however, any award of damages, compensatory and punitive, would have turned largely upon what inferences a jury might draw from Johnson\u2019s actions in instigating the arrest warrant. Indeed, Johnson\u2019s liability for punitive damages depended upon an award of compensatory damages, <em>Valley Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Glasby, </em>230 Va. 422, 432, 337 S.E.2d 291, 297 (1985), and any such award would have had to bear a reasonable relation to the award of compensatory damages. <em>Philip Morris Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 414, 368 S.E.2d 268, 287 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Here, the elements of Montecalvo\u2019s claim for compensatory damages are subsumed in his claim for punitive damages. Additionally, the sanction requested and imposed was an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Therefore, Johnson\u2019s attorneys\u2019 time spent in defending the punitive damage claim should have been segregated and the sanction based only on the time taken in defending that claim. Although the trial court did not award the full amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees claimed, it based its award upon a projection of the time Johnson\u2019s attorneys spent in defending the entire case. In doing so, it based its conclusion upon an erroneous application of the law and thereby abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We further are of opinion that any effort to segregate the additional expense and anguish occasioned by Oxenham\u2019s continued assertion of a frivolous claim for punitive damages would impose additional and unnecessary burdens upon Johnson and the trial court. Under these circumstances, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s sanction' of the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and enter final judgment for Oxenham on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\"> The inspection confirmed that Montecalvo was operating an adult home without a license, and he later pleaded guilty to a violation of Code \u00a7 63.1-182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> Code \u00a7 63.1-182 provides in part that \u201c[a]ny person who interferes with any authorized agent of the Commissioner [of Social Services] in the discharge of his duties . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\"> Concluding that there was no evidence that Montecalvo had participated in \u201cthe frivolous filing and prosecution of this suit,\u201d the trial court denied the motion for a sanction against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\"> Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 are similar in the respects material here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Citing <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Koulizakis, </em>229 Va. 524, 331 S.E.2d 440 (1985), the trial court said that \u201c[t]he only reason the case survived the motion to strike was the court\u2019s policy against striking the evidence in order to preserve a full record on appeal . . . .\u201d However, in conformity with <em>Brown, </em>the court must have concluded that the evidence did not make it \u201cconclusively apparent that plaintiff ha[d] proven no cause of action against defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 331 S.E.2d at 445 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b288-8\">SENIOR JUSTICE POFF, with whom JUSTICE RUSSELL and JUSTICE HASSELL join,</author>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Because I cannot agree that the trial court abused its discretion, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The resolution of the issue raised in this case requires a <em>thorough </em>comparison of the facts as alleged in the motion for judgment, as revealed in pretrial proceedings, and as developed in sworn testimony at trial. The motion for judgment alleged that Montecalvo \u201crented out rooms to boarders.\u201d Johnson, \u201ca licensing inspector for the Virginia Department of Social Services, presented herself at the plaintiffs residence . . . and requested permission to enter and inspect the premises.\u201d Montecalvo refused permission unless \u201cthe defendant present [ed] a valid search warrant\u201d. A magistrate, \u201c[a]t the initiative of the defendant ... issued a search warrant. . . and an arrest warrant for the plaintiff for interfering with the defendant in the performance of her duties.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arrest warrant \u201cwas so totally lacking in probable cause as to infer a spirit of malice.\u201d After hearing evidence at the criminal trial \u201cconsisting entirely of the testimony of the defendant\u201d, the judge \u201cstruck the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and dismissed the criminal charges\u201d. The motion for judgment demanded compensatory and punitive damages \u201c[d]ue to the malicious prosecution ... set on foot by the defendant\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The record of the pretrial proceedings shows that Johnson, in a memorandum of law filed in support of her demurrer and motion for summary judgment, stated that she \u201cdid not ask for the issuance of the arrest warrant\u201d, that she \u201cassumed they had simply gotten a search warrant\u201d, and that she \u201cwas surprised when Officer Stachura executed the arrest warrant.\u201d In that memorandum, Johnson averred that Oliver Norrell, an assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, \u201cwill testify that the inspectors sought his assistance in securing a search warrant, and that they never mentioned the need for an arrest warrant\u201d. The affidavit in support of the search warrant, attached as an exhibit to Johnson\u2019s memorandum of law, stated that Montecalvo had \u201cacknowledged . . . that he was operating a home for Adults without the required license\u201d. Although Johnson, Gestwick, and William Davidson, a zoning officer, were named (in that order) as those who had heard the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>fession, the affidavit was executed, not by Johnson but by Barbara Gestwick.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Martha Parrish, the assistant Attorney General who represented Johnson in pre-trial proceedings, filed an affidavit declaring that \u201c[o]n at least two occasions during the motions stage of this case, I advised counsel for the plaintiff that Ms. Johnson had no role in instigating the prosecution of the plaintiff. One of these occasions was immediately following our oral argument on the defendant\u2019s demurrer or in the alternative motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On March 6, 1989, Oxenham filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the demurrer and motion. Reaffirming allegations made in the motion for judgment filed four months earlier, Oxenham insisted that it was Johnson who \u201cobtained a search warrant\u201d; that Johnson \u201chad no reasonable grounds to institute these criminal proceedings\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he facts before the Court clearly show that the . . . prosecution for interfering with [Johnson] was \u2018set on foot\u2019 by [Johnson].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">On May 3, 1989, Oxenham signed \u201cPlaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Plea of Sovereign Immunity and Motion to Strike Punitive Damages\u201d. Consistent with the allegations made in the Motion for Judgment, the memorandum asserted that Johnson had \u201ccommitted the intentional tort of malicious prosecution\u201d and had \u201cacted without regard to the plaintiffs legal rights\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In answers signed May 15, 1989 to interrogatories posed by Johnson, the plaintiff said that Johnson \u201cacted without regard for the plaintiffs constitutional rights.\u201d Explaining his allegation that Johnson was the person who initiated the arrest warrant, he said that \u201c[t]he arrest warrant was issued by the magistrate after the defendant complained to the magistrate\u201d and \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s name appears on the warrant as the complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In her grounds of defense, filed May 18, 1989, Johnson repeated her statement that \u201cshe did not in any way initiate the arrest warrant . . . and had no knowledge of the obstruction of justice charge\u201d. In answer to an interrogatory propounded by Montecalvo whether \u201canyone from the Office of the Richmond Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney or the Richmond Bureau of Police contacted [her] prior to the plaintiffs [criminal] hearing and discussed [her] testimony\u201d, Johnson replied that no one had con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>tacted her and that she had testified because she was \u201cunder subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In a pretrial deposition taken by Johnson, Montecalvo testified that he had never held any conversation with Johnson; that it was Barbara Gestwick, Johnson\u2019s superior in the department, with whom he had talked about the search; and that he had not felt \u201charassed\u201d by Johnson and had no reason to believe she bore him any ill will.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The trial court overruled Johnson\u2019s demurrer, special pleas, and motion for summary judgment and seated a jury for trial of the malicious-prosecution suit. The evidence adduced at that trial is relevant to the sanctions issue before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The plaintiffs evidence consisted of Montecalvo\u2019s testimony, that of Johnson, and the two warrants admitted as exhibits. Montecalvo testified that Gestwick, in company with Johnson and Davidson, came to his residence on June 8, 1988. Gestwick requested permission to inspect his home. After conferring by telephone with Oxenham, his attorney, Montecalvo told Gestwick that they could not enter his home without a search warrant. The three inspectors left and returned later with two police officers. Officer Stachura served both a search warrant and an arrest warrant, and the inspectors searched the home. At the criminal trial, Montecalvo pled guilty to the charge of operating a home for adults without a license. The charge of interfering with the discharge of official duties was dismissed. Asked on cross-examination if he had been \u201charassed in any way by Virginia Johnson\u201d and if he had \u201cexchanged any words with her at all\u201d, Montecalvo replied, \u201cNo, sir; just Ms. Gestwick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Johnson, called by Montecalvo as an adverse witness, testified that she had accompanied Gestwick and Davidson on the visit to Montecalvo\u2019s residence; that \u201cMs. Gestwick and Mr. Montecalvo had the conversation\u201d about the request to search; that she attended the meeting at the magistrate\u2019s office when Gestwick executed the affidavit for the search warrant; that she, Johnson, \u201chad no correspondence or conversation with the magistrate whatsoever\u201d; and that she did not know that an arrest warrant had been issued until it was served. Explaining why her name appeared on the face of the arrest warrant as the complaining witness, Johnson said she assumed that the magistrate \u201ctook my name from the search warrant affidavit because it was first in a series of names.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Montecalvo rested, and Johnson moved to strike his evidence. Commenting for the record, the trial judge said, \u201cI can\u2019t comprehend how the jury can come back with a plaintiffs verdict, but let\u2019s see what they do.\u201d Accordingly, pursuant to the \u201cthe court\u2019s policy against striking the evidence in order to preserve a full record on appeal\u201d, the court took Johnson\u2019s motion under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Johnson then called Gestwick to the stand. Gestwick testified that it was she, and not Johnson, who had talked with Montecalvo; that she had contacted the magistrate and consulted with an assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and an assistant Attorney General about a search warrant; that she had executed the affidavit for the search warrant; and that she had never requested or discussed an arrest warrant and was unaware that one had been issued until Officer Stachura served it. Joi Jeter, the assistant Attorney General mentioned by Gestwick, confirmed her testimony that their conversation concerned only the need for a search warrant and that no mention had been made of an arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, Johnson renewed her motion to strike, and the trial court, reaffirming its previous ruling, submitted the case to the jury. As the court noted for the record, the jury \u201crequired just ten minutes to return a verdict for the defendant.\u201d Invoking Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1, Johnson filed a motion for sanctions against Oxenham and Montecalvo. In a letter opinion, the court approved the motion as to Oxenham.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The court rested its decision upon two findings of violations of the duty imposed upon an attorney by the statute: (1) that Oxenham failed to make \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d to determine whether the civil suit against Johnson was \u201cwell-grounded in fact\u201d; and (2) that the suit was brought and maintained \u201cfor an improper purpose\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The court explained the reason for its first finding. Although the court believed that, initially, Oxenham \u201cwas entitled to rely on the information contained in the warrant. . . as a basis for the preparation and filing of the motion for judgment\u201d, the court concluded that Oxenham violated his duty under the statute when he failed to conduct an investigation which would have disclosed that none of the prospective witnesses would testify at trial in support of the facts alleged in the pleading. Specifically, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Plaintiff conducted no investigation nor discovery after the filing of the motion for judgment, notwithstanding being repeatedly told by defense counsel that the defendant was not the source of the issuance of the arrest warrant, that she merely accompanied her supervisor to the magistrate\u2019s office .... At trial there was no evidence to the contrary. In fact, all the evidence was that defendant had nothing to do with the issuance of either warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">In explanation of its second finding, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">To file a motion for judgment and do nothing that was reasonably calculated to produce a favorable result leads the court to the inevitable conclusion that the purpose of filing the motion for judgment was not to prevail on the merits but to harass the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Basing its decision upon these findings, the court entered final judgment confirming the jury\u2019s verdict and imposing a monetary sanction upon Oxenham.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">I agree with the majority that, contrary to Oxenham\u2019s theory, the abuse of discretion standard is the appropriate standard of appellate review in a sanctions case. Oxenham\u2019s chief complaint in this Court is that the trial court erred in construing Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 to impose a \u201ccontinuing duty\u201d upon an attorney or a litigant who signs the initial pleading. As he points out, courts in the federal jurisdiction appear to be deeply divided over the question whether Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contemplates a continuing duty. <em>See, e.g., Blue </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>914 F.2d 525 (4th Cir. 1990) (finding continuing duty); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Capital Sec. Services, </em>836 F.2d 866 (5th Cir. 1988) (en banc) (finding no continuing duty); <em>Herron </em>v. <em>Jupiter Transportation Co., </em>858 F.2d 332 (6th Cir. 1988) (finding continuing duty); <em>Golden Eagle Distrib. Corp. </em>v. <em>Burroughs Corp. </em>801 F.2d 1531, 1536 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding no continuing duty); <em>see also Christiansburg Garment Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422 (1978) (fees assessed against plaintiff under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 when \u201cclaim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or . . . the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>As I read these opinions, the appearance of diversity is largely a matter of semantics, resulting primarily from the disparate use of the term \u201ccontinuing duty\u201d. I do not disagree with the statement Oxenham quotes from <em>Pantry Queen Foods </em>v. <em>Lifeschultz Fast Freight, </em>809 F.2d 451, 454 (7th Cir. 1987) (finding no continuing duty) that nothing in Rule 11 \u201crequires a lawyer to . . . update his pleading in light of any new findings.\u201d Our statute imposes no \u201ccontinuing duty\u201d as the term is used in that sense; nothing in Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 requires an attorney to \u201cupdate\u201d the initial pleading. That is not to say, however, that a lawyer has no duty extending beyond the filing of the initial pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Although his duty to list his address applies only to \u201cthe first pleading filed\u201d, his duty to make a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d does not stop at that point. In the express language of the statute, that duty continues to the signing and filing of \u201c[e]very pleading, written motion, and other paper\u201d and to the making of \u201c[a]n oral motion\u201d, to the end that the lawyer certify, advisedly and creditably, that each such pleading, paper, or motion is \u201cwell-grounded in fact\u201d. <em>See Thomas, </em>836 F.2d at 875 (\u201cRule 11 . . . requires that each filing reflect a reasonable inquiry.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Even if Oxenham\u2019s examination of the arrest warrant bearing Johnson\u2019s name as the complainant constituted an inquiry sufficiently reasonable to avoid sanctions for the signing and filing of the motion for judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> , the record of the proceedings conducted thereafter reflects no such inquiry before the signing of the several \u201cpapers\u201d Oxenham drafted and filed with the court. During the course of those proceedings, Oxenham was advised, verbally and in writing, unequivocally and repeatedly, that Johnson was not the person who obtained the search warrant and instigated the criminal prosecution. While, as the majority says, he was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to accept as truth what opposing counsel, Gestwick, and Johnson had told him, the statute required him, before each new filing, to conduct a reasonable inquiry to determine whether the facts basic to the cause of action asserted were well-grounded. Yet, failing for six months awaiting trial to depose, or simply to interview, any of the several persons present in the magistrate\u2019s office when the arrest warrant was issued, Oxenham persisted in signing and filing papers for the record, reaffirming allegations made in the original pleading. I cannot endorse the majority\u2019s conclusion that this constituted a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Because it was not clearly erroneous, we should uphold the trial court\u2019s first finding of fact. The question then occurs whether the record supports the court\u2019s finding that Oxenham filed and persisted in litigating the malicious-prosecution suit \u201cfor an improper purpose\u201d, that is, \u201cnot to prevail on the merits but to harass the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The majority overrules that finding because the record \u201ccontains no evidence of threats or expressions of ill will on Oxenham\u2019s part.\u201d However, ill will is not the only reason a person might have to harass a defendant. It is an unfortunate fact of life that many defendants, wanting to escape the inherently vexatious nature of litigation, will settle frivolous claims for their \u201cnuisance value\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>an amount approximating the costs necessary to defend against the claim. Although the filing and litigation of such claims once may have been acceptable practice, that practice now is sanctionable under Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The statute authorizes courts to impose sanctions whenever a \u201cpleading, motion, or other paper\u201d is \u201cinterposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.\u201d \u201cIf a complaint is not filed to vindicate rights in court, its purpose must be improper.\u201d <em>In re Kunstler, </em>914 F.2d 505, 518 (4th Cir. 1990). As the trial court said, the only proper purpose of filing papers and making motions in court \u201cwould be to have the trier of fact vindicate [the party\u2019s] position; to support his assertion of rights. How could any reasonable person assume to accomplish this purpose without some investigation into the facts?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Applying the same standard of review, this Court should affirm the trial court\u2019s second finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Finally, Oxenham contends that \u201c[e]ven if sanctions were appropriate, the trial judge failed to consider alternatives to mone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>tary sanctions.\u201d Pursuing the point, he says that \u201cthe public rebuke which he has received [on account of news reports] is more than adequate to deter him from such conduct in the future\u201d. And, he continues, even if monetary sanctions were justified, they were excessive in this case. I find no merit in these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Manifestly, the public policy goal of sanctions statutes is to expedite final adjudication of legitimate causes of actions by eliminating frivolous litigation from the overburdened dockets of <em>nisi prius </em>and appellate courts. The secondary goal, rooted in equity, is to compensate victims of frivolous claims and spurious defenses for the time, trouble, trauma, and expense suffered on account of such vexatious practices. These goals can be achieved only by the imposition of sanctions sufficient to deter such practices. <em>See Cooter &amp; Gell </em>v. <em>Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. _, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2454 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1 provides that, in the event of a \u201cviolation of this rule, the court . . . shall impose ... an appropriate sanction, which may include . . . the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper or making of the motion, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d Thus, our statute vests a trial court with broad discretion; what kind and what quantity of sanctions may be appropriate depends upon the circumstances in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The trial judge made a balanced analysis of the sanctions issue. With measured restraint, he remarked that sanctions are \u201cnot favored by this court [and] are never to be imposed lightly.\u201d Although the evidence showed that $10,383 was a \u201creasonable estimate of the economic losses caused by the filing and prosecution of this frivolous suit\u201d, the trial judge, noting that Oxenham \u201cenjoys a good reputation for professional competence\u201d and that he had not \u201cpreviously engaged in practices such as found here\u201d, concluded that \u201ca sanction of $4,500 would meet the purposes of the law in serving as a deterrent to [Oxenham] and others from filing frivolous suits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Considering the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record of the pretrial proceedings and confirmed by the evidence at trial, and applying the standard of review applicable here, I would hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in.imposing this sanction upon Oxenham and affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> Code \u00a7 63.1-182 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">Any person who interferes with any authorized agent of the Commissioner in the discharge of his duties under this [licensing] article, or . . . any person who engages in the conduct of a home for adults without first obtaining a license . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\"> Rule 11 is substantially identical to Code \u00a7 8.01-271.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\"> It is difficult to see, however, how any inference of malice, one of the essential elements of a malicious prosecution suit, could be gleaned from the face of the arrest warrant, especially when Oxenham knew, or should have learned, that his own client did not believe that Johnson bore him any ill will.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The majority holds that Oxenham was relieved of his duty to conduct a reasonable inquiry on the issue of legal malice by our decision in <em>Giant of Virginia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pigg, </em>207 Va. 679, 685, 152 S.E.2d 271, 276 (1967), where we said that malice \u201cmay be inferred from the want of probable cause.\u201d <em>Giant </em>went on to say that the existence of malice must be determined under <em>\u201call the circumstances </em>of the case. The circumstances <em>must warrant </em>the inference . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis added). Oxenham conducted no investigation into \u201cthe circumstances of the case\u201d and, hence, the inference of malice is not warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-4\"> While I concur fully with the majority\u2019s determination that the punitive-damage claim was frivolous from its inception, I can find no precedent for the refusal to remand this case for further proceedings on that issue. Although the majority\u2019s concern for the \u201cunnecessary burdens upon Johnson and the trial court\u201d is commendable, I believe any additional burdens would be gladly borne by both. Furthermore, even if the trial court found the task of apportioning attorney\u2019s fees between frivolous and non-frivolous claims to be unworkable, a public censure or other \u201cappropriate sanction\u201d could be imposed to \u201cgive effect to the [statute\u2019s] central goal of deterrence.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; </em>Gell, 496 U.S. at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2454.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
