Soden, Inc. (Soden), a building contractor, agreed to sell, and Melvin C. Clevert and Teresa F. Clevert (collectively Clevert) agreed to buy, a lot to be improved by a house that Soden was to construct for Clevert. The purchase price of the house and lot was to be $165,000. Soden later acquired title to the lot for $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The relevant sales and construction agreements were contained in several documents, all of which were printed forms that had been filled out and executed at the same time. One document was a real estate sales contract form that reflected the increased sales price attributable to Soden\u2019s construction agreement. The parties\u2019 construction agreement was detailed on two other forms, each described as \u201can Addendum to the Real Estate Purchase Agreement ... to be attached to said Agreement and made a part thereof.\u201d The printed portion of the real estate sales contract form provided in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">[i]f either party <em>defaults in the performance of this contract, </em>such defaulting party shall be liable for the commission to which the agent would have been entitled if the contract had been performed and any expenses incurred by the non-defaulting party or agent, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with this transaction and the enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>this contract. The parties further agree that in the event purchaser shall default in the performance of this contract after its acceptance by seller, the deposit of [$10,000] shall inure to and become the property of [Soderi\u2019s real estate agent] and shall be applied as credit on the commission due by the defaulting party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Alleging breaches of the construction provisions of the contract, Clevert filed an action at law against Soden, and later recovered a $19,718 judgment. Of this amount, $1,850 represented delay damages, and $17,868 represented damages for defective workmanship and materials. Clevert also sought to recover his reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs expended as a result of Soden\u2019s breach of contract, and presented evidence in support of his claim. The statement of facts, signed by counsel for both parties, recites that Soden did not offer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">any evidence that would controvert whether the attorney\u2019s fees as reflected in the exhibits filed in this action and with the Court were reasonable, but rather the parties did not disagree as to whether the attorney\u2019s fees were reasonable, but whether they were allowed as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The trial court held that although Soden breached the contract, Soden did not default in its performance because \u201cbreach of contract is not default of the contract.\u201d Therefore, the court denied Clevert\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Clevert appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">At the outset, Soden contends that because the contract imposed liability for the non-defaulter\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees incurred \u201cin the enforcement of this contract,\u201d it could be liable for such fees only in an <em>\u201cenforcement </em>of the <em>entire </em>contract . . . [by] seeking judicial aid in having the other party perform\u201d the contract\u2019s essential purpose of selling the real estate. (Emphasis in original.) We disagree. \u201cEnforcement\u201d of a contract includes a recovery of damages for any breach, whether total or partial. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 345(b), 346 comment (a) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Thus, we must decide whether Soden\u2019s <em>defective </em>performance of the construction provisions of its contract was a \u201c[default] in the performance of this contract.\u201d We look first to the dictionary definition of \u201cdefault\u201d because \u201c[w]ords used by the parties are to be given their usual, ordinary and popular meaning, unless it can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>clearly shown in some legitimate way that they were used in some other sense, and the burden of showing this is always upon the party alleging it.\u201d <em>Ames </em>v. <em>American Nat\u2019l Bank of Portsmouth, </em>163 Va. 1, 39, 176 S.E. 204, 217 (1934); <em>also Winn </em>v. <em>Aleda Constr. Co., </em>227 Va. 304, 307, 315 S.E.2d 193, 194-95 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The noun \u201cdefault\u201d is defined as a \u201cfailure to do something required by duty or law.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 590 (1986). And, a building contractor has the implied contractual duty to build a house in a workmanlike manner. <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Clowser, </em>190 Va. 887, 901, 59 S.E.2d 78, 84 (1950). Thus, the building contractor defaults in the performance of his contract if he furnishes defective materials or workmanship, as Soden did.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">A \u201cbreach of contract\u201d is defined as a \u201cfailure, without legal excuse, to perform any promise which forms the whole or part of a contract.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 188 (6th ed. 1990). Hence, ordinarily, a builder\u2019s breach in the performance of his contract, <em>i.e., </em>a <em>defective </em>performance, also would be a \u201cdefault\u201d in that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Next, we decide whether Soden has sustained his burden of showing that the dictionary definition of \u201cdefault\u201d should not be applied in this case. Soden argues that in this contract \u201c[t]he term \u2018default\u2019 clearly contemplates something more than a missed date. The strong penalties . . . indicate that a default was something that the parties considered to be fairly grievous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Here, however, Soden\u2019s default was not limited to his 61-day delay in completing the house. Of Clevert\u2019s damage award, $17,868 was for Soden\u2019s defective workmanship and materials. Moreover, the total damage award was more than 10% of the contract price for the house and lot. Therefore, we regard Soden\u2019s default as \u201cfairly grievous\u201d and a material breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Alternatively, Soden claims that the <em>\u201cessential purpose </em>of the contract [was the sale of the real estate], and default would be the total failure of that essential purpose.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Soden\u2019s premise is flawed for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">First, Soden overlooks the fact that the lot was unimproved when the contract was signed and its apparent approximate value was $25,000, about 15% of the contract price. Soden\u2019s construction obligation, set forth with some particularity in the contract, added about $140,000 to the value of the original contract. Obviously, Soden\u2019s defective performance of that construction obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>tion had a material impact upon an \u201cessential purpose\u201d of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Second, the contract specifically rebuts Soden\u2019s hypothesis that unless we adopt its interpretation of \u201cdefault,\u201d Clevert\u2019s $10,000 deposit would have been forfeited to the real estate agent should Clevert \u201cfail in some collateral duty to the actual closing.\u201d The contract expressly limits the forfeiture to \u201cthe commission to which the agent <em>would have been entitled if the contract had been </em>performed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Assuming that the sale actually was closed despite a \u201ccollateral\u201d breach by Clevert, the agent would have been entitled to no further commission because that portion of the contract giving rise to the agent\u2019s commission \u201chad been performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In sum, Soden\u2019s defective performance of its construction obligation gave rise to litigation \u201cin connection with this transaction,\u201d and subjected Soden to liability for Clevert\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees expended in this litigation. Because Soden does not \u201cdisagree as to whether the attorney\u2019s fees were reasonable,\u201d we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and will enter final judgment for Clevert for $16,799.02, the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees that the plaintiffs incurred in the trial court. We also will remand the case for further proceedings to adjudicate Clevert\u2019s claim for additional attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\n<em>Reversed, final judgment, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b142-8\">JUSTICE LACY,</author>\n<p id=\"AsS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cbreach\u201d are one and the same, I continue to believe that these terms are well understood and widely accepted to reflect separate concepts. Default embraces a failure to perform, while breach contemplates an imperfect performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The contract in issue was one under which Clevert agreed to purchase a house built and sold to them by Soden. That occurred; the contract was performed. The contractual paragraph entitled \u201cDEFAULT\u201d provided that only a \u201cdefaulting party\u201d could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>held liable for attorney\u2019s fees incurred by a \u201cnon-defaulting party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">As stated by the trial court, this litigation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">is a breach of contract, suitability of materials suit and workmanlike manner in which the place was built. That is not a default case and the Court finds no evidence of default from this case. The contract has been performed but not to the satisfaction of the plaintiff, of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">In the Court\u2019s view, breach of contract is not default of the contract, and the Court finds from the language that the attorney fees were from default in the contract and they did not extend beyond that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In my opinion the majority has strained to give the term \u201cdefault\u201d a gloss which was never contemplated by these litigants when they signed this real estate contract and which is not its \u201cusual, ordinary and popular meaning.\u201d <em>Ames </em>v. <em>American Nat\u2019l Bank of Portsmouth, </em>163 Va. 1, 39, 176 S.E. 204, 217 (1934).
