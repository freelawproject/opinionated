On appeal, we determine whether the trial court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">We will consider the plaintiff\u2019s allegations according to \u201cthe settled rule that a demurrer admits the truth of all well-pleaded material facts. All reasonable factual inferences fairly and justly drawn from the facts alleged must be considered in aid of the pleading. However, a demurrer does not admit the correctness of the pleader\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Custis, </em>236 Va. 69, 71, 372 S.E.2d 373, 374 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In an amended motion for judgment, appellant Patricia B. Russo sought to recover against appellee Burton White for his allegedly outrageous conduct. The plaintiff asserted that she is a single parent who lives with her teen-age daughter. She alleged that in the Spring of 1987 she \u201cwent on a date with defendant\u201d and thereafter \u201cdid not date defendant again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">According to the pleading, plaintiff began receiving numerous \u201chang-up\u201d calls from April through June, 1987. She asserted that in August 1987, defendant was convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-429 of \u201c \u2018causing telephone to ring with intent to annoy,\u2019 \u201d a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Plaintiff further alleged that the same type of calls resumed in the Fall of 1987 and she began \u201ckeeping a log.\u201d Between November 25, 1987 and January 28, 1988, she received 340 \u201chang-up\u201d calls, according to the plaintiff. Continuing, she alleged that she contacted the police in January 1988, and, with the aid of the police and the telephone company, \u201cdefendant was observed making 15 phone calls to plaintiff in quick succession from a telephone booth.\u201d She asserted that defendant was served with 15 warrants for committing the same crime for which he had been convicted during the previous August. The charges, she noted, \u201cwere taken under advisement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The plaintiff also alleged that some of the calls were made at times which made \u201cit apparent that defendant was watching plaintiffs house.\u201d According to plaintiff, defendant\u2019s conduct caused her \u201cextreme emotional distress\u201d because \u201cnot knowing defendant very well, she was not . . . aware of his proclivity for violence.\u201d She asserted that this \u201cconsideration\u201d weighed heavily on her, \u201cdue to her vulnerability as a single parent, and since she must leave her minor daughter alone at times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Concluding, plaintiff alleged that, as a proximate result of defendant\u2019s \u201cintentional acts,\u201d she suffered \u201csevere emotional distress.\u201d This resulted, she asserted, in \u201cnervousness, sleeplessness, stress and its physical symptoms, withdrawal from activities which might necessitate plaintiff leaving her daughter at home, [and] lack of concentration at work to the point where she received a reprimand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">In a demurrer to the amended motion, defendant contended that plaintiff failed to sufficiently set forth \u201ceither the legal elements or factual basis\u201d to support a claim of \u201cintentional infliction of emotional harm.\u201d Upon consideration of argument of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>counsel, the trial court sustained the demurrer. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal from the January 1990 judgment order dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In <em>Womack </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>215 Va. 338, 210 S.E.2d 145 (1974), this Court joined a growing number of jurisdictions which explicitly recognized the existence of an independent tort referred to as \u201cthe intentional infliction of emotional distress,\u201d sometimes called the tort of \u201coutrage.\u201d <em>See </em>annot., <em>Modern Status of Intentional Infliction of Mental Distress as Independent Tort; \u201cOutrage.\u201d </em>38 A.L.R.4th 998 (1985). Academics take credit for the development of this modern tort, which was finally defined in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 (1965) (hereinafter Restatement). Givelber, <em>The Right to Minimum Social Decency and the Limits of Evenhandedness: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress by Outrageous Conduct, </em>82 Colum. L. Rev. 42, 42-43 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The tort, however, \u201cdiffers from traditional intentional torts in an important respect: it provides no clear definition of the prohibited conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51. Assault, battery, and false imprisonment \u201cdescribe specific forms of behavior,\u201d but the term \u201coutrageous\u201d \u201cdoes not objectively describe an act or series of acts; rather, it represents an evaluation of behavior. The concept thus fails to provide clear guidance either to those whose conduct it purports to regulate, or to those who must evaluate that conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, we have said recently that such torts are \u201cnot favored\u201d in the law. <em>Ruth </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>237 Va. 366, 373, 377 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Nevertheless, in an effort to establish meaningful standards for adjudication of such claims, we adopted a four-pronged approach in <em>Womack, </em>patterned after the Restatement definition. We stated that emotional distress resulting from a non-tactile tort may be compensated if the plaintiff alleges, and proves by clear and convincing evidence, that: the wrongdoer\u2019s conduct is intentional or reckless; the conduct is outrageous and intolerable; the alleged wrongful conduct and emotional distress are causally connected; and, the distress is severe. 215 Va. at 342, 210 S.E.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">In this case, the defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff\u2019s pleading sufficiently alleges facts to comply with the first and third prongs of <em>Womack. </em>Thus, we will address the remaining two prongs, keeping in mind that the trial court must initially deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>mine whether the facts alleged will support a finding of both outrageousness and severe emotional distress. <em>See </em>Restatement comments h and j; <em>Ruth, </em>237 Va. at 368, 377 S.E.2d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Under the second prong, it is insufficient for a defendant to have \u201cacted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal.\u201d Restatement comment d. Even if a defendant \u201chas intended to inflict emotional distress,\u201d or his conduct can be \u201ccharacterized by \u2018malice,\u2019 or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort,\u201d the requirement of the second prong has not been satisfied. <em>Id. </em>\u201cLiability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The plaintiff contends that for \u201cWhite to call her over a two month period an average of 5.6 times per day is intolerable and offends any sense of decency and morality in a civilized society.\u201d Conceding that defendant did not speak during the calls, plaintiff argues that they nonetheless were \u201cthreatening\u201d because of \u201ctheir frequency and the fact that White was calling a single parent with a young child who had extremely limited contact with him so as not to be able to judge White\u2019s proclivity for violence.\u201d She contends that, given the persistence with which defendant \u201charassed\u201d her with \u201cthese threatening calls, it was more than reasonable for her to feel that White was likely to escalate the matter to the point of violence.\u201d Thus, according to plaintiff, defendant\u2019s conduct constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We will agree with the plaintiff and assume, without deciding, that defendant\u2019s conduct rose to the level of outrageousness required to support the cause of action. Consequently, we will focus on the fourth prong of <em>Womack </em>and decide whether the plaintiffs emotional distress was \u201csevere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The term \u201cemotional distress\u201d travels under many labels, such as, \u201cmental suffering, mental anguish, mental or nervous shock .... It includes all highly unpleasant mental reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame, humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment, worry, and nausea.\u201d Restatement comment j. But liability arises only when the emotional distress is extreme, and only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Here, plaintiff alleged that she suffered \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d and \u201cextreme emotional distress.\u201d But, even on demurrer, the court is not bound by such conclusory allegations when the issue involves, as here, a mixed question of law and fact. This is not a negligence case where, according to Rule 3:16(b), an allegation of \u201cnegligence\u201d is sufficient without specifying the particulars. In the present claim, \u201ca plaintiff must allege all facts necessary to establish\u201d the cause of action. <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Whitlock, </em>238 Va. 670, 677, 385 S.E.2d 893, 897 (1989) (trial court erred in failing to sustain demurrer to count in motion for judgment alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The plaintiff has alleged that she was nervous, could not sleep, experienced stress and \u201cits physical symptoms,\u201d withdrew from activities, and was unable to concentrate at work. There is no claim, for example, that she had any objective physical injury caused by the stress, that she sought medical attention, that she was confined at home or in a hospital, or that she lost income. Consequently, we conclude that the alleged effect on the plaintiff\u2019s sensitivities is not the type of extreme emotional distress that is so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Therefore, we hold that the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer, and the judgment of dismissal will be</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b58-7\">JUSTICE HASSELL, with whom JUSTICE STEPHENSON and JUSTICE LACY join,</author>\n<p id=\"AIa\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">I dissent because I believe that Ms. Russo properly pled a cause of action for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress and, therefore, she should not be deprived of her opportunity to prove her allegations before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Even though the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is a disfavored cause of action, it remains a viable cause of action until it is abolished. This cause of action is certainly appropriate under the facts and circumstances of this case in light of White\u2019s alleged despicable conduct. According to the allegations in the motion for judgment, which we must deem true at this stage of the proceedings, White intentionally embarked upon a course of conduct designed to harass and frighten Russo, a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>parent who lived with her 14-year-old daughter. He placed in excess of 340 \u201chang-up\u201d calls to her home and was arrested and convicted of causing a \u201ctelephone to ring with intent to annoy\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-429.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">White\u2019s alleged conduct was so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to transcend all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Without question, his alleged conduct was absurd, flagrant, intemperate, intentional, malicious, harassing, intimidating, annoying, childish, misguided, and reprehensible. White\u2019s conduct was beyond the \u201cbounds of decency\u201d and should not be tolerated in a civilized community.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Russo\u2019s amended motion for judgment fails because she did not allege facts indicating extreme emotional distress which is \u201cso severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Russo alleges in paragraph 12 of her amended motion: \u201cAs a proximate result of defendant\u2019s intentional acts, plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress resulting in nervousness, sleeplessness, stress and its physical symptoms, withdrawal from activities which might necessitate plaintiff leaving her daughter at home, lack of concentration at work to the point where she received a reprimand.\u201d Certainly, no reasonable person could or should be expected to endure the injuries endured by Russo.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Ely </em>v. <em>Whitlock, </em>238 Va. 670, 385 S.E.2d 893 (1989). In <em>Ely, </em>we held that the trial court erred because it did not sustain a demurrer to a count in a motion for judgment alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress. There, the plaintiffs alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">\u201c[t]he statements and conduct of Rae H. Ely, as set forth in Counts I, II, and III of this Motion for Judgment were made and carried out by her intentionally and/or recklessly, were outrageous and intolerable and offend against generally accepted standards of decency and morality, and have proximately caused severe emotional distress to your plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 677, 385 S.E.2d at 897. We stated that the plaintiffs in <em>Ely </em>failed to allege that the defendant\u2019s acts were undertaken \u201cfor the specific purpose of inflicting emotional distress upon them, and that [the defendant] intended her specific conduct and knew or should have known that emotional distress would likely result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Russo\u2019s amended motion for judgment does not contain these deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Finally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Russo\u2019s motion for judgment contains \u201cno claim . . . that she had any objective physical injury caused by stress, that she sought medical attention, that she was confined at home or in a hospital, or that she lost income.\u201d Russo alleged, as the majority acknowledges, that she suffered \u201cstress and its physical symptoms.\u201d This allegation, in my opinion, is sufficient at the demurrer stage of the proceedings. Furthermore, in certain instances, physical injury is not an element required to establish the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>Naccash </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>223 Va. 406, 415-16, 290 S.E.2d 825, 830-31 (1982); <em>Womack </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>215 Va. 338, 342, 210 S.E.2d 145, 148 (1974). Russo should have been given the opportunity to present medical testimony at trial regarding the nature and extent of her emotional and physical injury. I am not aware of any decision, before this case, wherein we have required a plaintiff to plead in a motion for judgment that \u201cshe sought medical attention\u201d or that \u201cshe was confined at home or in a hospital.\u201d Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a jury trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> Not only does the majority create a new requirement that has not heretofore been articulated by this Court, but it is a requirement that I believe Russo has met. The majority relies upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 comment j (1965) and adopts its requirement that \u201cliability arises only when emotional distress is extreme, and only where the distress inflicted is so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
