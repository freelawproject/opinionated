The Supreme Court, however, did not decide whether its decision in <em>Davis </em>had retrospective application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In these consolidated appeals, the appellants (collectively, Harper) are retired federal employees who receive either civil service retirement benefits or military retired pay. They filed suits in the trial court against the Virginia Department of Taxation (the Commonwealth) in May 1989, seeking refunds, pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-1826, for state income taxes paid for tax years 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988. After consolidating the several suits, the trial court ruled that <em>Davis </em>should be applied prospectively only and, therefore, that Harper was not entitled to the refunds. Harper appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In this appeal, the principal issue is whether <em>Davis </em>should be applied only prospectively, thereby denying the refunds, or retroactively, thereby granting the refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Whether a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court is applied retroactively is a matter of federal law. <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>496 U.S._,_, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 2330 (1990). In the civil context, retroactive application of such decisions is governed by the three-pronged test announced in <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97 (1971). <em>Smith, </em>496 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2331; <em>see U.S. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 563 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court considered a state\u2019s taxing statute that previously had been declared unconstitutional under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. 496 U.S. at _, 110 S.Ct. at 2329. The Court denied the claimant\u2019s request for a refund of taxes paid prior to an earlier decision that invalidated the taxing statute. <em>Id. </em>at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2334. In so doing, a plurality of the Court employed the three-pronged <em>Chevron </em>test and concluded that its earlier decision should not be applied retroactively. The Court found that its earlier decision invalidating an Arkansas highway tax, <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. </em>v. <em>Scheiner, </em>483 U.S. 266 (1987), established a \u201cnew principle of law\u201d under the commerce clause. <em>Id. </em>at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2332. Arkansas\u2019s legislature, therefore, was justified in relying upon existing precedent and had \u201cgood reason to suppose\u201d the enactment of the tax would not violate the Federal Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 2333.</p>\n<p id=\"AHSm\">Harper contends, nonetheless, that \u201cbecause the taxes at issue here . . . constitute [d] an \u2018unconstitutional deprivation,\u2019 . . . Virginia must provide \u2018backward-looking relief\u2019 to the refund claimants.\u201d Harper asserts that such relief is required by the holding in <em>McKesson Corp. </em>v. <em>Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, </em>_U.S__, 110 S.Ct. 2238 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">In <em>McKesson, </em>decided on the same day as <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court held that a \u201cclear and certain remedy,\u201d which could include refunds, was required to remedy Florida\u2019s unconstitutional liquor tax statute. _U.S. at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2252. In so holding, the Court rejected Florida\u2019s contention that its taxing authority implemented the tax preference scheme \u201c \u2018in good faith reliance on a presumptively valid statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 2254. In rejecting that contention, the Court stated that the challenged tax statute \u201creflected only cosmetic changes from the prior version of the tax scheme that itself was virtually identical to the Hawaii scheme invalidated\u201d in <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>468 U.S. 263 (1984). Thus, the Court concluded, Florida \u201c[could] hardly claim surprise\u201d when its later statute was invalidated. <em>Id. </em>at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-19\">In the present case, nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth acted other than in good faith reliance upon a presumptively valid taxing statute. We conclude, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Smith, </em>that the three-pronged <em>Chevron </em>test must be employed to determine whether the <em>Davis </em>decision should be applied prospectively only.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">For a decision to be applied prospectively only, the first prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test requires that the decision \u201cestablish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, ... or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.\u201d 404 U.S. at 106. Satisfaction of this first prong usually has been stated as the \u201cthreshold test\u201d for determining whether or not a decision should be applied prospectively only. <em>Johnson, </em>457 U.S. at 550 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">When <em>Davis </em>was decided, 23 states had statutes similar to the Michigan statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Virginia\u2019s statute had been in effect for almost half a century. <em>See </em>Acts 1942, c. 325. As far as the record shows, the federal pensioners had paid the tax without protest. Not a single federal pensioner had brought an action during that period in a Virginia court seeking a refund of taxes on the basis of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. The absence of such litigation reasonably may be explained by examining the doctrine\u2019s origin and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine had its genesis in <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819). The doctrine was grounded on the proposition that \u201c[s]tates have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>in any other manner control, the operations [of the federal government].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The <em>pre-Davis </em>cases invalidating state taxing statutes were decided on the proposition that the tax had a foreseeable and direct effect on some operation of the federal government. <em>See, e.g., Memphis Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>459 U.S. 392 (1983) (state tax that imposes greater burden on holders of federal obligations than on holders of similar state obligations impermissibly discriminates against securities issued by federal government); <em>Phillips Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Dumas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>361 U.S. 376 (1960) (state tax that imposes greater burden on lessees of federal property than on lessees of other exempt public property impermissibly discriminates against federal government). Indeed, <em>Davis </em>states that intergovernmental tax immunity is based on \u201cthe need to protect each sovereign\u2019s governmental operations from undue interference by the other.\u201d 489 U.S. at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In the present case, therefore, it is difficult to discern how the General Assembly of Virginia should have been expected to perceive that a statutory scheme, exempting state pensioners from state taxation, would have placed any foreseeable and direct burden on some federal operation. Consequently, we conclude that the <em>Davis </em>decision established a new rule of law by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. Thus, the first prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The second <em>Chevron </em>prong requires a court to \u201cweigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\u201d 404 U.S. at 106-07. In applying this factor, we must determine whether the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine will be retarded or furthered by retroactive application of the <em>Davis </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The purpose of intergovernmental tax immunity is not to prevent legitimate state taxation. <em>See Smith, </em>496 U.S. at-, 110 S.Ct. at 2332. Virginia\u2019s taxing statute was legitimate until a new rule was announced in <em>Davis. </em>As soon as the General Assembly became aware of the <em>Davis </em>decision, it acted to correct the defects in its statute. <em>See </em>Acts 1989, Special Session II, c. 3. As a result, the purpose of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine already has been fully served, and applying <em>Davis </em>retroactively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>would do nothing either to retard or to further the doctrine\u2019s purpose. Therefore, the second prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The third prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test requires a court to \u201c[weigh] the inequity imposed by retroactive application.\u201d 404 U.S. at 107. In weighing the equities, considerable deference must be accorded a state\u2019s reliance upon a statute that was presumptively valid. <em>See Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, </em>411 U.S. 192 (1973). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is well established that reliance interests weigh heavily in the shaping of an appropriate equitable remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. As Chief Justice Burger so aptly stated in Lemon, \u201cstatutory or even judge-made rules of law are hard facts on which people must rely in making decisions and in shaping their conduct. This fact of legal life underpins our modern decisions recognizing a doctrine of nonretroactivity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">An important equitable consideration is the effect that retroactive application of a judicial decision may have on a state\u2019s financial stability. As the <em>Smith </em>plurality acknowledged, applying a judicial decision retroactively may \u201chave potentially disruptive consequences for the State and its citizens. A refund, if required by state or federal law, could deplete the state treasury, thus threatening the State\u2019s current operations and future plans.\u201d 496 U.S. at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2333.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In <em>Arizona Governing Committee </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>463 U.S. 1073, 1105 (1983), the Supreme Court held that the State of Arizona\u2019s voluntary pension plan violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Court further held, however, that the state\u2019s liability would be prospective only. <em>Id. </em>The Court found that retroactive liability could cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. As Justice Powell stated, \u201c[i]mposing such unanticipated financial burdens would come at a time when many States and local governments are struggling to meet substantial fiscal deficits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1106-07. Because the illegality of Arizona\u2019s actions had not been declared until <em>Norris </em>was decided, Justice Powell further stated that \u201c[t]here is no justification for this Court ... to impose this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In the present case, the record discloses that retroactive application of the <em>Davis </em>decision would give rise to a potential tax refund liability, inclusive of interest, of approximately $440,000,000. This liability would come at a time when the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>monwealth is already struggling to meet enormous fiscal deficits. The record contains affidavits of Commonwealth officials that support the conclusion that allowing the requested refunds would have a potentially disruptive and destructive impact on the Commonwealth\u2019s planning, budgeting, and delivery of essential state services.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Harper contends, nonetheless, that \u201cit is simply more equitable to place the financial consequences . . . upon the government (and thus the whole body of taxpayers) than upon a small subclass of taxpayers who had unconstitutionally been forced to pay the tax in the first instance.\u201d Thus, Harper asserts, \u201ctaxpayers who have been paying more than their lawful share of taxes should be reimbursed by those who have paid less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Commonwealth counters by pointing out that \u201chundreds of thousands of other Virginia taxpayers have paid taxes on their private pension income but have no claim for monetary relief.\u201d The Commonwealth further asserts that \u201cover 2.5 million Virginians annually have paid their \u2018fair share\u2019 of taxes while only some sixty thousand state and local retirees were excluded from pension income taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The record supports the Commonwealth\u2019s assertions, and we conclude that, on balance, the equities weigh heavily in favor of the Commonwealth. Consequently, the third prong of the <em>Chevron </em>test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Accordingly, we hold that, under the <em>Chevron </em>test, the <em>Davis </em>decision is not to be applied retroactively. <em>Accord Bass </em>v. <em>State, </em>395 S.E.2d 171 (S.C. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Harper contends, nonetheless, that the refunds are due as a matter of state law. He relies upon Code \u00a7\u00a7 58.1-1825 and -1826. Code \u00a7 58.1-1825 provides that \u201c[a]ny person assessed with any tax administered by the Department of Taxation and aggrieved by any such assessment may . . . within three years from the date such assessment is made, apply to a circuit court for relief.\u201d Code \u00a7 58.1-1826 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">If the court is satisfied that the applicant is erroneously or improperly assessed with any taxes, the court may order that the assessment be corrected. If the assessment exceeds the proper amount, the court may order that the applicant be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>exonerated from the payment of so much as is erroneously or improperly charged, if not already paid and, if paid, that it be refunded to him. If the assessment is less than the proper amount, the court shall order that the applicant pay the proper taxes and to this end the court shall be clothed with all the powers and duties of the authority which made the assessment complained of as of the time when such assessment was made and all the powers and duties conferred by law upon such authority between the time such assessment was made and the time such application is heard. The court may order that any amount which has been improperly collected be refunded to such applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">Harper asserts that, even if the <em>Davis </em>decision applies prospectively only, the federal retirees are entitled to refunds under Code \u00a7 58.1-1826. Harper argues that, because the assessments are unconstitutional, they also are \u201cerroneous or improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">We reject this argument. We hold that, because the <em>Davis </em>decision is not to be applied retroactively, the <em>pre-Davis </em>assessments were neither erroneous nor improper within the meaning of Code \u00a7 58.1-1826.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Harper\u2019s state-law contention also fails for another reason. We previously have held that this Court\u2019s ruling declaring a taxing scheme unconstitutional is to be applied prospectively only. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Albemarle </em>County, 214 Va. 240, 198 S.E.2d 626, <em>aff'd and modified on </em>rehearing, 214 Va. 416, 200 S.E.2d 566 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We adhere to our holding in <em>Perkins. </em>In so doing, we follow the criteria stated in <em>Fountain </em>v. Fountain, 214 Va. 347, 348, 200 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 939 (1974), that \u201cconsideration should be given to the purpose of the new rule, the extent of the reliance on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new rule.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>See also Quick </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>214 Va. 632, 634, 202 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 907 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Finally, Harper contends that \u201ceven if <em>Davis </em>were applied prospectively only, refunds for 1988 taxes would nonetheless be due, for they were not assessed, and in many cases were not paid, until <em>after Davis </em>was decided.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Davis </em>was decided on March 28, 1989. The last day for filing individual income tax returns for the 1988 taxable year was May 1, 1989. Harper claims that the last day for filing income tax returns is the date on which income taxes are assessed for the preceding year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Income taxes are \u201cimposed on the Virginia taxable income <em>for each taxable year </em>of every individual.\u201d Code \u00a7 58.1-320. (Emphasis added.) The taxable year ended on December 31, 1988, almost three months before <em>Davis </em>was decided. When the year ended, the 1988 tax was fixed and ascertainable. Only payment of the tax was delayed until May 1, 1989. Code \u00a7 58.1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The Supreme Court rejected a similar contention in <em>Smith. </em>The Court reasoned that tax liability depends upon the \u201c \u2018occurrence of the taxed transaction or the enjoyment of the taxed benefit, not the remittance of the tax.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>496 U.S. at-, 110 S.Ct. at 2335. As Justice O\u2019Conner observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">[a] contrary rule would give States a perverse incentive to collect taxes far in advance of the occurrence of the taxable transaction. It would also penalize States that do not immediately collect taxes, but nevertheless plan their operations on the assumption that they will ultimately collect taxes that have accrued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-11\"><em>Id. </em>at_, 110 S.Ct. at 2336.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">In sum, we hold that, (1) under the <em>Chevron </em>test, the <em>Davis </em>decision is not to be applied retroactively, (2) state law does not require tax refunds, but to the contrary, grants prospective-only application to decisions that invalidate a taxing scheme, and (3) our denial of refunds includes taxes due for the tax year 1988. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Record No. <em>900770 </em>\u2014 Affirmed.
