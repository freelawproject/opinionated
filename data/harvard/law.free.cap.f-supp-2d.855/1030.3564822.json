DAVILA, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Presently before the court is Defendant Apple Ine.\u2019s (\u201cApple\u201d) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">Apple, a Delaware corporation with its headquarters and principal place of business in California, is a leading seller of software applications (\u201capps\u201d) that users can download onto their mobile computing devices. <em>See </em>Complaint, Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14-18, 42. Plaintiffs bring the instant class action on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated parents or guardians who (a) downloaded or permitted their minor children to download a supposedly free app from Apple and (b) then incurred charges for game-related purchases made by their minor children, without the parents\u2019 and guardians\u2019 knowledge or permission. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">On April 11, 2011, Plaintiff Garen Meguerian filed a complaint, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, alleging that Plaintiffs\u2019 minor children were able to purchase \u201cgame currencies\u201d without their parents\u2019 knowledge or authorization while playing game applications (\u201capps\u201d), provided by Apple and advertised as free. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 1. An \u201capp\u201d is a software application that a customer can download from Apple\u2019s App Store onto a mobile computing device. \u201cGame currencies\u201d are virtual objects, such as supplies, that are used in connection with gameplay in certain apps. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">On April 22, 2011, Plaintiffs Lauren Scott, Kathleen Koffman, and Heather Silversmith filed <em>Scott v. Apple Inc., </em>No. 11-1989. On May 26, 2011, Plaintiff Twilah Monroe filed <em>Monroe v. Apple Inc., </em>No. 11-2394. Plaintiffs filed their consolidated Complaint on June 16, 2011. See Complaint, Docket Item No. 28. Subsequently, these actions were consolidated by Judge Jeremy Fogel under the caption \u201cIn re Apple In-App Purchase Litigation.\u201d <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 33. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that minors were able to make in-app purchases of game currency without Plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge or permission. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8-12. The Complaint asserts claims for declaratory judgment, violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\u201cCLRA\u201d), Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1750 <em>et seq., </em>violation of California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d), Cal. Bus. Prof.Code \u00a7 17200 <em>et seq., </em>breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and restitution /unjust enrichment/ money had and received. <em>Id., </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 45-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-13\">The sale of an app or any game currency is a transaction completed directly between Apple and the consumer. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. Apple requires users to authenticate their accounts by entering a password pri- or to purchasing and/or downloading an app or buying game currency. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 21. Until early 2011, however, once the password was entered once, Apple permitted users to buy game currency for up to fifteen minutes without re-entering the password. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b63-4, 21. Plaintiffs claim that they were unaware that purchases could be made without re-entering the password. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. Plaintiffs downloaded and allowed their children to play free or nominal gaming apps, unaware that their children could, for fifteen minutes, purchase game currency without entering a password. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 8-12. Plaintiffs\u2019 minor children were able to charge their parents\u2019 accounts in amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>ranging from $99.99 to $338.72 at a time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">On August 8, 2011, Defendants filed this instant motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 37. Plaintiffs filed a response on September 2, 2011. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 44. Defendants filed their reply on September 21, 2011. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 48. This case was reassigned to Judge Edward J. Davila on September 27, 2011. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">On November 14, 2011 Defendant moved to stay discovery until the August 8, 2011 motion to dismiss is resolved. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 56. Plaintiffs filed a response on November 23, 2011. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 57. After being granted enlarged time, Defendant filed a reply brief on December 5, 2011. <em>See </em>Docket Item Nos. 59, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d) and venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391. Plaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">California substantive law applies to the instant case. Apple account holders agree to a set of Terms and Conditions (\u201cTerms &amp; Conditions\u201d) prior to making any purchases or downloads from Apple\u2019s online store. The Terms &amp; Conditions provide that, \u201c[a]ll transactions on the Services are governed by California law.... You expressly agree that all exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with Apple or relating in any way to your use of the Services resides in the courts of the State of California.\u201d <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6 40. Furthermore, Apple\u2019s headquarters and principal place of business is located in California. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">IV. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint may be dismissed if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recitals of the elements of a cause of action and conclusory allegations are insufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires a plaintiff to plead each claim with sufficient specificity to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, the factual allegations \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\u201d such that the claim \u201cis plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Pursuant to Rule 9(b), when an allegation involves fraud, a heightened pleading standard applies and a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). A motion to dismiss a complaint grounded in fraud under Rule 9(b) for failure to plead with particularity is the functional equivalent of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1107 (9th Cir.2003)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">In considering the sufficiency of a claim, the court must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555-56, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The court must also construe the alleged facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Love v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number><em>States, </em>915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th Cir.1989). However, the court is not required to accept as true legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">If dismissal is granted under either Rule 12(b)(6) or 9(b), leave to amend should be allowed unless the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts. <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1108. If amendment would be futile, however, a dismissal may be ordered with prejudice. <em>Dumas v. Kipp, </em>90 F.3d 386, 393 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">y. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOQ\">A. Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 <em>et seq., </em>seeking a determination that: (a) the action may proceed and be maintained as a class action; (b) the sales contracts between Apple and the minor children of class members, relating to the purchase of in-app game currency, are voidable at the option of the respective class members on behalf of their minor children; (c) if the class members elect to void the contracts, they will be entitled to restitution and interest thereon; (d) an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of suit to Plaintiff and Class is appropriate; and (e) such other and further relief as is necessary and just may be appropriate as well. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">Plaintiffs allege that each in-app purchase constitutes a separate and voidable contract between Apple and Plaintiffs\u2019 minor children, which may be disaffirmed by a parent or guardian on behalf of the minors. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 45-54. Plaintiffs allege that a contract between Apple and minor existed each time that (1) Apple offered to sell game currency to a minor playing an app, (2) the minor accepted Apple\u2019s offer, and (3) the transaction was supported by consideration, or payment made by the Plaintiffs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 46-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">Apple argues that this issue should be dismissed as a matter of law because the relevant contractual relationship governing the in-app purchases is between Apple and Plaintiffs and is based on the original Terms &amp; Conditions signed by Plaintiffs, thus making the individual purchases not voidable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 37, at 14. Apple contends that the Terms &amp; Conditions governs the parties\u2019 relationships, including all subsequent purchases made using the iTunes account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">However, Plaintiffs contend that the Terms <em>&amp; </em>Conditions are not the contracts at issue. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 44, at 14. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that the Terms <em>&amp; </em>Conditions are subject to interpretation and that the court cannot dismiss the declaratory relief claim because Plaintiffs should be permitted to introduce ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>trinsic evidence regarding the meaning of the term \u201cunauthorized use\u201d in their contracts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Apple claims that this term is not relevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim or to Apple\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Additionally, Apple alleges that even if contracts exist between it and minors, Plaintiffs do not have standing to disaffirm any contracts of their minor children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 17. However, Plaintiffs claim that parents may disaffirm contracts on behalf of their minor children, and in the alternative ask this court for an opportunity to cure the complaint. See Docket Item No. 44, at 16 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">At this point, the court must construe the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, resolving any apparent ambiguity in their favor. <em>See Jenkins v. McKeithen, </em>395 U.S. 411, 421, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969). Apple argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action should be dismissed as a matter of law, and yet offers no case law to support its contention that the Terms &amp; Conditions constitute a relational contract and that each subsequent transaction between a minor child and Defendant is governed by the terms of the relational contract. Even the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that \u201ca well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable, and \u2018that a recovery is remote and unlikely.\u2019 \u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (quoting <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974)). Using this standard as a guide, Defendant\u2019s request to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">B. CLRA and UCL Claims</p>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">i. Rule 9(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires that \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.\u201d It is established law that Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement applies to state-law causes of action. <em>Vess, </em>317 F.3d at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">Fraud is not an essential element of either a CLRA or UCL claim, but that does not mean that heightened pleading never applies to such claims. <em>Id. </em>As the Ninth Circuit has previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-12\">\u201cIn cases where fraud is not a necessary element of a claim, a plaintiff may choose nonetheless to allege in the complaint that the defendant has engaged in fraudulent conduct. In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be \u201cgrounded in fraud\u201d or to \u201csound in fraud,\u201d and the pleading of that claim as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>a whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-6\">In other cases, however, a plaintiff may choose not to allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct in support of a claim, but rather to allege some fraudulent and some non-fraudulent conduct. In such cases, only the allegations of fraud are subject to Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1103-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">When averments of fraud are made, the circumstances constituting the alleged fraud must be \u201cspecific enough to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct____\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Vess, 317 F.3d at 1106 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such averments \u201cmust be accompanied by the who, what, where, and how of the misconduct charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). However, in the context of a fraudulent omission claim, a plaintiff cannot plead a specific time or place of a failure to act and may accordingly plead fraud in alternative ways. <em>Washington v. Baenziger, </em>673 F.Supp. 1478, 1482 (N.D.Cal.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-12\">ii. Consumers Legal Remedies Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">As a preliminary matter, Apple argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA claim is proeedurally defective because of Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to attach the required affidavit under CLRA \u00a7 1780(d) and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to give timely notice under CLRA \u00a7 1782(a). Plaintiffs contend that Plaintiff Meguerian filed an affidavit meeting the requirements of \u00a7 1780(d) on April 11, 2011 when Plaintiff Meguerian\u2019s original individual complaint was filed. <em>See </em>Jonathan Shubb Dec\u2019l, Docket Item No. 45; Meguerian Affidavit, Docket Item No. 2. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that Plaintiff Meguerian\u2019s CLRA demand letter satisfied the notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">The CLRA states that \u201c[i]n any action [under the CLRA], concurrently with the filing of the complaint, the plaintiff shall file an affidavit stating facts showing that the action has been commenced in a county described in this section as a proper place for the trial of the action.\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1780(d). If \u201ca plaintiff fails to file the affidavit required by this section, the court shall, upon its own motion or upon motion of any party, dismiss the action without prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court has previously dismissed CLRA claims filed in federal court where plaintiff did not file the required affidavits. <em>In re Apple &amp; AT &amp; T iPad Unlimited Data Plan Litig., </em>802 F.Supp.2d 1070, 1077 (N.D.Cal.2011) (dismissing CLRA claims where no plaintiff filed an affidavit). However, because Plaintiff Meguerian filed an affidavit concurrently with the original complaint which showed that the action was properly commenced in this county, the purpose of the rule has been satisfied. <em>See In re Easysaver Rewards Litigation, </em>737 F.Supp.2d 1159, 1178 (S.D.Cal.2010) (where plaintiff who had filed an affidavit along with the original complaint was no longer a named plaintiff in the consolidat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>ed complaint, the \u201cpurpose of the rule\u201d was still satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Under the CLRA, a plaintiff must also provide a company with thirty days\u2019 notice of the specific alleged CLRA violation by certified registered mail before filing a CLRA claim for damages. Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1782(a). Federal courts have required \u201c[s]triet adherence to the statute\u2019s notice provision ... to accomplish the [CLRA\u2019s] goals of expeditious remediation before litigation.\u201d <em>In re Apple &amp; AT &amp; T, </em>802 F.Supp.2d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">This court has previously dismissed a CLRA claim where plaintiffs argued that the notice requirements were met by an affidavit filed by their attorneys in a previous class action case filed in state court against the same defendants. <em>Keilholtz v. Superior Fireplace Co., </em>2009 WL 839076, at *2-3 (N.D.Cal. March 30, 2009). <em>Keilholtz </em>is distinguishable from the current case, however, because the consolidated complaint at issue is not a separate action from Plaintiff Meguerian\u2019s original complaint. When the demand letter was sent, Defendant was on notice that it was being sued by a putative class, and thus the notice was sufficient \u201cto facilitate pre-complaint settlement,\u201d which is the purpose of the CLRA notice requirements. <em>Id. </em>at *2 (quoting <em>Outboard Marine Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>52 Cal.App.3d 30, 41, 124 Cal.Rptr. 852 (1975)). Furthermore, Plaintiff Meguerian\u2019s original complaint sought only injunctive relief, and such a claim may be commenced without compliance with the notice requirements. <em>Id. </em>at *3. After thirty days have passed, the consumer may amend the complaint without leave of the court to include a request for damages. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff Meguerian sent his demand letter on April 11, 2011, concurrently with filing his original complaint, and amended the complaint to include money damages after more than 60 days had elapsed. Accordingly, the notice requirement has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">Plaintiffs allege that Apple violated the CLRA by actively marketing and promoting certain gaming apps as free or costing a nominal fee with the intent to induce minors to purchase in-app game currency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6\u00b6 55-64. Plaintiffs contend that Apple breached its duty to disclose material facts about the game currency embedded in these gaming apps and the ability to purchase such game currency for a fifteen-minute period without re-entering a password. Apple contends that Plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA claims fail to meet Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 37, at 20-21. Plaintiffs concede that Rule 9(b) applies to their CLRA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">The CLRA proscribes \u201cunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1770(a); <em>In re Actimmune Marketing Litig., </em>2009 WL 3740648, at *16 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 6, 2009). Conduct that is \u201clikely to mislead a reasonable consumer\u201d violates the CLRA. <em>Keegan v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>838 F.Supp.2d 929, 938-39 (C.D.Cal.2012) (quoting <em>Colgan v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., </em>135 Cal.App.4th 663, 680, 38 Cal.Rptr.3d 36 (2006)). CLRA claims sounding in fraud must establish reliance and causation. <em>Buckland v. Threshold Enters., Ltd., </em>155 Cal.App.4th 798, 809, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 543 (2007), overruled on other grounds by <em>Kwikset Corp. v. Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number><em>Court, </em>51 Cal.4th 310, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Omissions are actionable under the CLRA only when the omission is contrary to a representation actually made by the defendant or where a duty to disclose exists. <em>Keegan, </em>838 F.Supp.2d at 939-40. Under California law, a duty to disclose arises in four circumstances: \u201c(1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from plaintiff; or (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smith v. Ford Motor Co., </em>749 F.Supp.2d 980, 987 (N.D.Cal.2010)). In the instant case, Plaintiffs allege that Apple had a duty to disclose because it concealed and/or omitted facts in the advertising, marketing, and promotion of its apps. For a non-disclosed fact to be material, a plaintiff must show that if the omitted information had been available, the plaintiff would have been aware of it and behaved differently. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Oestreicher v. Alienware Corp., </em>544 F.Supp.2d 964, 971 (N.D.Cal.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">Contrary to Apple\u2019s argument, Plaintiffs have alleged with specificity which misrepresentations they were exposed to, their reliance on those misrepresentations, and the resulting harm. Plaintiffs pled specific facts that Apple \u201cactively advertised], marketed] and promoted] its bait Apps as \u2018free\u2019 or nominal.... \u201d <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6 72. The Complaint explicitly states that at least one Plaintiff downloaded a game app and gave it to her son \u201c[b]ecause it said it was \u2018free\u2019 \u201d and another Plaintiff gave her iPhone to her daughter so that she could \u201cplay the \u2018free\u2019 game.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. Plaintiffs further assert that they were not informed by Apple that once an iTunes account holder entered a password, he or she could make purchases for up to fifteen minutes without re-entering the password. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. Plaintiffs contend that, \u201c[h]ad any Plaintiff or other member of the Class known what their children were purchasing and for how much, they would not have permitted the sales transaction from being consummated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 86. Finally, the Complaint alleges that as a result of the fraud, Plaintiffs were charged large sums of money after game currency was purchased without their knowledge. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 8-10,12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Drawing all inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the court denies Apple\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Cause of Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">iii. Unfair Competition Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">As a threshold matter, the parties disagree with respect to whether Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claims are subject to the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). The Ninth Circuit has determined that Rule 9(b) applies to each of the three prongs of the UCL where the claims are based on a \u201cunified course of fraudulent conduct.\u201d <em>See Kearns v. Ford Motor Co., </em>567 F.3d 1120, 1126-27 (9th Cir.2009); <em>In re Facebook PPC Adver. Litig., </em>2010 WL 3341062, at *9 (N.D.Cal. Aug. 25, 2010). Although Plaintiffs argue that the pleading requirements of Rule 8, rather than Rule 9(b), apply to the \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d prongs of their UCL claims because they are premised on Apple\u2019s alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, it appears that their claims, like those in <em>Tietsworth v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>are entirely dependent upon allegations that Defendant made misrepresentations and omissions that are \u201cgrounded in fraud.\u201d <em>Tietsworth, </em>2009 WL 3320486, at *6 (N.D.Cal. Oct. 13, 2009). Accordingly, those claims are subject to the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>The UCL, California Business <em>&amp; </em>Professions Code \u00a7 17200 <em>et seq., </em>prohibits acts of \u201cunfair competition,\u201d defined as: (1) unlawful business acts or practices;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) unfair business acts or practices;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (3) fraudulent business acts or practices;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (4) unfair, deceptive or misleading advertising.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Each of the three prongs of the UCL (\u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cunlawful,\u201d and \u201cfraudulent\u201d) constitutes an independent basis for liability and fraud is not an essential element of a claim for unfair or unlawful business practices. <em>Actimmune, </em>2009 WL 3740648, at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">Plaintiffs allege that Apple engaged in unlawful, unfair, fraudulent and/or deceptive business acts and practices in violation of the UCL by advertising, marketing, and promoting apps as free or at a nominal cost with the intent to lure minors to purchase game currency. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6\u00b6 65-79. Furthermore, Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>tiffs allege that the Class has suffered substantial actual economic harm. As discussed supra, for claims based on fraudulent conduct, where Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard applies, the court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled specific facts to support their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Under the \u201cunlawful\u201d prong, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Apple violated the CLRA. This violation is independently actionable under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Under the test for \u201cunfair\u201d business practices, \u201c[a]n act or practice is unfair if the consumer injury is substantial, is not outweighed by any countervailing benefit to consumers or to competition, and is not an injury the consumers themselves could reasonably have avoided.\u201d <em>Tietsworth, </em>2009 WL 3320486, at *7 (quoting <em>Daugherty v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>144 Cal.App.4th 824, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 118 (2006)). Plaintiffs have shown that they suffered substantial harm by incurring charges that they did not explicitly authorize, ranging from $99 to $338.72 at a time. Plaintiffs contend that no benefit existed and Apple does not claim that there was any benefit to consumers or competition. Plaintiffs also contend that they could not have avoided this harm because they had no way of knowing that for a fifteen-minute window, purchases could be made without reentering a password.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Under the \u201cfraudulent\u201d prong, Plaintiffs must allege with specificity that Defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations: (1) were relied upon by the named plaintiffs; (2) were material; (3) influenced the named plaintiffs\u2019 decision to purchase the product; and (4) were likely to deceive members of the public. <em>Tietsworth, </em>2009 WL 3320486, at *8. Following other California courts and federal courts applying California law, the sufficiency of a plaintiffs UCL fraud claim may be analyzed together with the CLRA claim. <em>Kowalsky v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>2011 WL 3501715 (N.D.Cal. Aug. 10, 2011). As discussed in the analysis of Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Cause of Action, Plaintiffs have pled specific facts to support their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">Accordingly, drawing all inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the court denies Apple\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Third Cause of Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">C. Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">Plaintiffs allege that Apple breached its contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing with Plaintiffs and class.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 28, at \u00b6\u00b6 80-88. Apple argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim fails as a matter of law because under California law the implied covenant cannot be used to negate an express contractual provision. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 37, at 10-12. Apple further argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged any express provision of their contract that relates to their claim, and an implied covenant claim untethered to an express provision fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">It has long been recognized in California that every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will injure the right of the other party to receive the benefits of the agreement. <em>Wolf v. Walt Disney Pictures &amp; Tel., </em>162 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1120, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 585 (2008) (quoting <em>Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>23 Cal.4th 390, 400, 97 Cal.Rptr.2d 151, 2 P.3d 1 (2000)). The covenant protects the express covenants or promises of the contract. <em>Carma </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number><em>Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc., 2 </em>Cal.4th 342, 373, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 826 P.2d 710 (1992). As such, the implied covenant will only be recognized to further the contract\u2019s purpose; it will not be read into a contract to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by the agreement itself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 374, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 826 P.2d 710. However, \u201cbreach of a specific provision of the contract is not a necessary prerequisite [for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 826 P.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">To establish a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Plaintiffs must show that Apple lacked subjective good faith in the validity of its act or the act was intended to and did frustrate the common purpose of the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 372, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 826 P.2d 710. The Terms &amp; Conditions signed by Plaintiffs expressly provide that Plaintiffs are responsible for activity occurring on or through their accounts and Apple may charge them for any such activity. Thus, the implied covenant cannot negate Apple\u2019s ability to charge Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Plaintiffs have failed to show how Apple\u2019s act breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, the claim for breach of the implied covenant is dismissed with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">D. Restitution / Unjust Enrichment / Money Had and Received</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Plaintiffs claim that Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to recover from Apple all amounts wrongfully collected and improperly retained by Apple, plus interest. Apple alleges that no such independent claim exists in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">There is a split between federal courts regarding the viability of unjust enrichment as an independent claim. This court has recognized that a claim for unjust enrichment exists under California law when there is no contractual relationship between the parties. <em>See Sanders v. Apple, Inc., </em>672 F.Supp.2d 978, 989 (N.D.Cal.2009) (\u201cTo plead a claim for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must allege a receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another\u201d); \u25a0 <em>Biennis v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>2008 WL 818526, at *4 (N.D.Cal. Mar. 25, 2008) (\u201c[a] plaintiff can recover for unjust enrichment only where there is no contractual relationship between the parties.... Plaintiffs are entitled to plead an unjust enrichment claim in the alternative\u201d). However, as reiterated by this court, a party may state as many different claims as the party has, regardless of consistency. <em>Blennis, </em>2008 WL 818526, at *4. Therefore, the court will not dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">Money had and received is also a recognized cause of action. California courts held that when a common count is used as an alternative claim seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action based on the same facts, the common count may be dismissed if the cause of action is dismissed. <em>McBride v. Boughton, </em>123 Cal.App.4th 379, 394-95, 20 Cal.Rptr.3d 115 (2004). Because the court has not dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 first, second, and third causes of action, it need not dismiss the claim for money had and received. <em>See 3W s.a.m. tout bois v. Rocklin Forest </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number><em>Products, Inc., </em>2011 WL 489735 (E.D.Cal. Feb. 7, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Accordingly, the court does not dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Cause of Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">For the reasons stated, the court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the first, second, third, and fifth claims for relief is denied. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the fourth claim for relief is granted with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">. Apple argues that there is no legal basis for inferring a contract where the alleged offer is made to one party but accepted by another party, and where the consideration is paid by the original offeree, rather than the party who accepted the alleged offer. <em>See </em>Docket Item No. 37, at 17. Plaintiffs contend that their complaint alleges sufficient facts to establish the existence of a contract and that, pursuant to Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1605, consideration for a contract can be conferred upon the promisor by any person, not only the offeree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1075-14\">.

Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1556 states that minors are not capable of contracting. A minor\u2019s lack of capacity to contract affects only the ability of the other party to enforce the contract against the minor, not the minor's ability to enforce the contract against the other party. Under Cal. Fam.Code \u00a7 6710, minors may avoid liability on contracts, subject to certain exceptions. However, only the minor, and not the other party, may disaffirm a contract. The court has found no cases in California that have decided whether a minor's contract may be disaffirmed by someone other than the minor (such as a parent or guardian), except in the case of minor's death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">. In <em>Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir.2003), the Ninth Circuit found that plaintiff's claims of non-disclosure were not based in fraud. However, the court in <em>Vess </em>derived its elements of fraudulent misrepresentation from the California Court of Appeals case <em>Hackethal v. National Casualty Co., </em>189 Cal.App.3d 1102, 234 Cal.Rptr. 853 (1987) (stating the first element of a fraud claim under California law as \u201cfalse representation\u201d). The elements have since been changed by the Supreme Court of California to encompass false representation, concealment, and nondisclosure. <em>Engalla v. Permanente Med.

The definition of an unfair business practice in consumer cases has been unsettled since the California Supreme Court ruling in <em>CelTech, </em>which provided a definition in the context of an antitrust case, but did not address unfairness in the consumer context. <em>See Cel-Tech Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Tele. Co., 20 </em>Cal.4th 163, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999). After <em>Cel-Tech, </em>California appellate courts applied three different tests to determine \u201cunfairness\u201d in the consumer context, but the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the issue. Where the state\u2019s highest court has not decided an issue, the task of the federal court is to determine how the state high court would decide it. <em>Dimidowich v. Bell &amp; Howell, </em>803 F.2d 1473, 1482 (9th Cir.1986). Accordingly, the federal court must look to decisions of state intermediate appellate courts for guidance as to how the high court would decide. <em>Id.; see also Lyons v.
