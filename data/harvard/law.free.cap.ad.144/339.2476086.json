Hence, a writ of prohibition does not lie to .restrain the board of magistrates from trying such interpreter on a ' charge of irregular attendance upon court. 1 Although the repealing clause of chapter 659 of the Laws of 1910 does not mention said act of 1875, and although the repealing clause did not go into effect on the passage of the statute to which it was appended, the former act was repealed by the latter statute, they being inconsistent.

When the Magistrates\u2019 Courts were formed he was also continued there as interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The question is now raised as to his status in the Magistrates\u2019 Courts created by chapter 659, Laws of 1910, which declares that all interpreters (with deputy clerks, stenographers, etc.) .may be removed by the boards of magistrates \u201cafter an opportunity of making an explanation.\u201d (\u00a7 103.) The relator, however,, urges that this power of removal after explanation (which follows the. wording of section 22 of the Civil Service Law <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>), is not applicable to interpreters already serving in the old Magistrates\u2019 Courts, but affects only those interpreters whom the new boards of magistrates may appoint. The Legislature, however, have met this by section 56,\"which provides that \u201callclerks\u2019 assistants, stenographers, interpreters and other employes of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts shall be continued without reappointment, subject to removal as provided in this act.\u201d And this legislative intent to subject all the court officers to a common uniform power of removal, without discrimination for or against those continued from prior office, is found in other parts of the Inferior Criminal Courts Act. \u2022 Where prior incumbents are continued in office the very provision therefor declares this continuance subject to removal \u201c as provided in this act,\u201d as in the case of police clerks (\u00a7 55), and of officers and employees of the Court of Special Sessions (\u00a7 17). Obviously, such power of removal is not only required for the dignity and efficiency of the court, but a uniform condition for the exercise of the power of removal after an opportunity for explanation becomes a heeded protection for the incumbent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The final repealing clause (\u00a7 120) does not mention this act of 1875, although it may be considered to come within the general reference to acts inconsistent or in conflict therewith. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>repealing clause did.not take effect on the passage of the bill hi June last,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but is declared not to go hito effect until on and after September first.' The relator, therefore, urges that the act of 1875,- under which he was appointed, is still in. force, or was not repealed in August at the time he applied for this. writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In creating the new courts, the Legislature had power to determine the manner of appointment and the method of removal \u25a0\u2014 so far-as not in conflict with the.civil service provisions of the Constitution <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark>\u2014\u2022 and unquestionably the right to change the tenure of office of a court interpreter <em>(People ex rel. McCarthy </em>v. <em>French, </em>10 Abb. N. C. 418), so that he should be given \u201can oppor- - tunity of making an explanation \u201d instead of being subject to removal merely \u201cfor cause, \u201d as by the act of 1875. This change took effect on the passage of the act of 1910, so that when the relator was continued in office he became at once subject to the powers of removal then enacted. Here the point is as to the power of the board of city magistrates, not as to a possible conflict with the authority of some other body. The power to remove any cqurt interpreter in their courts is clearly conferred. Even if the provisions, designed, by repealing inconsistent statutes, to har-\u2019 monize the series of prior acts, have not fully taken effect and a conflict remains, the latest expression of the legislative will controls. <em>(Stack v. City of Brooklyn, </em>150 N. Y. 335, 345.) The power to remove and to try the relator, and to hear and consider his explanation, if any, of the charges against him, was vested in the board of city magistrates of the second division at the time of the relator\u2019s application, and, therefore, the magistrates could not be prohibited from exercising their jurisdiction. The motion for writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\"> See, also, Laws of 1888, chap. 583, tit. 2, \u00a7 22.\u2014 [Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> See Consol.
