Finding a failure to disclose a previously authorized wiretap, the trial court, <em>Levister, J. </em>and <em>Belinkie, J., </em>suppressed the state\u2019s evidence derived from the present wiretap, and rendered a judgment dismissing charges of professional gambling against the defendants Joseph D. Assuntino, Ronald Baia, Nicholas Y. Carrano, John Computaro, Edward Compo, Felix Compo, Albert DiGrazia, Anthony Longobardi and William Murphy, Jr. The state has brought this writ of error to obtain review of the dismissal of these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>It is now clear that the state has a common-law right to bring a writ of error, nnabrogated by statutory limitations on the state\u2019s right to appeal from a judgment of the former Court of Common Pleas, the trial court below. <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>173 Conn. 104, 111-12, 376 A.2d 1091 (1977); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Falzone, </em>171 Conn. 417, 370 A.2d 988 (1976). The scope of our review on a writ of error is, however, narrower than would be our review on appeal, reaching only those matters appearing as of record. <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 217, 223, 175 A. 582 (1934); <em>State </em>v. <em>Muolo, </em>118 Conn. 373, 383, 172 A. 875 (1934); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cray, </em>88 Conn. 141, 143, 89 A. 1123 (1914); <em>Lippitt v.

A writ of error may not assign as error, nor may we review on a writ of error, allegations concerning the conduct of the trial court that contradict the record; <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Matz, </em>supra, 613; see Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 239; or findings of fact as distinguished from conclusions of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Muolo, </em>118 Conn. 373, 383, 172 A. 875 (1934); <em>Montville </em>v. <em>Alpha Mills Co., </em>86 Conn. 229, 232-33, 84 A. 933 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The record in this case includes the trial court\u2019s memoranda of decision on the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s application for authority to intercept the wire communications of the defendant Felix Compo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>reveals the following: In October, 1974, the state obtained an order authorizing a wiretap of two named individuals who are not defendants in the present action. Authorized interception of the telephone facilities of these third parties led the state to overhear conversations of the defendant Felix Compo. When the state subsequently applied in December, 1975, to a three-judge panel for authorization to intercept the wire communications of \u201cFred Como, Felix Compo, aka Felix Campagnuolo and other unknown persons,\u201d at a purported professional gambling operation in East Haven, the state did not report its earlier interception. The wiretapping and electronic surveillance authorized pursuant to the December, 1975 application produced evidence that led to the arrest and the charge by information of the present defendants. After the earlier interception came to light, the defendants successfully moved to suppress the evidence so procured. Judge Levister\u2019s order of suppression was, upon reargument, affirmed by Judge Belinkie. When the case was reached for trial and the state declared that it had no other evidence to present, the court, <em>Belinkie, J., </em>dismissed with prejudice the charges against the defendants and ordered them released. Pursuant to Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7 260 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-231, the state then moved for a special finding detailing the statutory and constitutional basis for the trial court\u2019s decision granting the motion to suppress. In response to the state\u2019s motion, the court specially found only that \u201cthere being no evidence presented by the state, the court dismissed the charges against all defendants with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The judgment of dismissal was a final judgment which is subject to review on the record by a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of error. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cray, </em>88 Conn. 141, 147, 89 A. 1123 (1914); <em>Lippitt </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>87 Conn. 608, 610, 89 A. 347 (1914); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 237. That review necessarily encompasses examination of the trial court\u2019s decisions on motions to suppress, when dismissal is based on lack of evidence after suppression of the state\u2019s evidence before trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 18, 404 A.2d 873 (1978); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cray, </em>supra, 144; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 239. Since the memoranda of decision were, at the request of the state, made part of the judgment file and hence of the record, the trial court\u2019s refusal to make a factual special finding is, in this case, irrelevant to our review and warrants no further comment. The record before us is adequate for present purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Two questions are before us for resolution: (1) Was the wiretap application defective for failure to disclose the prior interception of Compo\u2019s conversations? (2) Was the application defective for failure to contain the oath or affirmation of the state\u2019s attorney? The defendants also urge that we consider whether our action may amount to violation of their right against double jeopardy but, as will appear below, we need not reach that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The authority to wiretap that is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 54-41c (8) requires strict compliance with the requirement that each application shall include \u201ca full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous applications . . . for authorization to intercept, or for approval of interceptions of, wire communications involving any of the same persons, facilities or places specified in the application . . . .\u201d Must a previous application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>be disclosed when it involved a different person, facility or place but resulted in the interception of a communication involving the subject of the present application? We agree with the state that such disclosure is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The language of \u00a7 54-41c (8) requires disclosure of information about prior <em>applications </em>to intercept, not about prior <em>interceptions. </em>By familiar rules of statutory construction, we derive legislative intention from the language of the statute that we must interpret, so long as that language is, in context, plain and unambiguous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1978); <em>Baston </em>v. <em>Ricci, </em>174 Conn. 522, 528, 391 A.2d 161 (1978); <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Heneage, </em>170 Conn. 387, 391, 365 A.2d 1109 (1976); <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>Fusari, </em>163 Conn. 401, 410-11, 311 A.2d 65 (1972); <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>160 Conn. 370, 376, 279 A.2d 561 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>153 Conn. 72, 82, 214 A.2d 362, cert. denied, 384 U.S. 921, 86 S. Ct. 1372, 16 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1965). There is no reason to assume that the legislature intended to use the words \u201capplication\u201d and \u201cinterception\u201d interchangeably, or that application should be construed to have anything other than its ordinary meaning of \u201cpreferring a request or petition to or before a person. The act of making a request for something.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979). The language of the statute affords no basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201capplication\u201d should be read to include \u201cinterception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Federal cases interpreting similar language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 (1) (e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> support our interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>of our statute. They too have held that an application to intercept the conversations of a particular person need not reveal prior interceptions of that person\u2019s conversations authorized by an earlier application directed at a different target. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Easterling, </em>554 F.2d 195, 196 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sklaroff, </em>552 F.2d 1156, 1160 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Florea, </em>541 F.2d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kilgore, </em>518 F.2d 496, 500 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bellosi, </em>501 F.2d 833, 838-40 (D.C. Cir. 1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martorella, </em>455 F. Sup. 459, 460-61 (W.D. Pa. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chiarizio, </em>388 F. Sup. 858, 874 (D. Conn.), aff\u2019d, 525 F.2d 289 (2d Cir. 1975); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowman, </em>352 A.2d 737, 739 (N.H. 1976). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 25, 404 A.2d 873 (1978), and <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartin, </em>171 Conn. 524, 534-45, 370 A.2d 1038 (1976), we noted the close proximity of this federal legislation to our statute and the propriety of looking to federal interpretation for guidance in determining an appropriate state standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Our construction of the statute is not only consistent with federal cases under the federal statute but is also in accord with the articulated standards for protection of privacy under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7 of the Connecticut constitution. The failure to reveal third-party interceptions does not amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>to the \u201cblanket grant of permission to eavesdrop . . . without adequate judicial supervision or protective procedures\u201d that was condemned in <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U.S. 41, 60, 87 S. Ct. 1873, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1040 (1967). The application procedure still requires \u201cdetached scrutiny by a neutral magistrate\u201d ; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 356, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); who is free to inquire into prior interceptions should such an inquiry appear appropriate. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 514-15, 94 S. Ct. 1820, 40 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974); <em>Gelbard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>408 U.S. 41, 46-47, 92 S. Ct. 2357, 33 L. Ed. 2d 179 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The trial court was therefore in error in determining that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s application for permission to intercept the wire communications of the defendant Felix Compo was deficient for failing to disclose prior interceptions of Compo\u2019s conversations with others. The state\u2019s application is, however, vulnerable on another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Subsequent to the proceedings in the trial court, we decided, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 23-24, 404 A.2d 873 (1978), that an application for a wiretap authorization must be made upon oath or affirmation of the state\u2019s attorney applying for the authorization. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>54-41c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant </em>held that the state does not satisfy this requirement merely by having the state\u2019s attorney execute an acknowledgement on the application form, we must inquire into the application before us to determine whether or not the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant </em>has been satisfied. If the application is improper, the statute itself, General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m, provides that unauthorized and hence unlawfully intercepted communications \u201cor evidence derived therefrom\u201d may be suppressed upon the motion of \u201c[a]ny aggrieved person in any trial . . . before any court.\u201d \u201c[T]he failure of the appropriate state\u2019s attorneys to submit their respective applications under oath goes to the heart of the \u2018reviewing or approval functions\u2019 established by the legislature\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 26; so that a motion to suppress can properly be granted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant </em>therefore furnishes an alternative basis for sustaining the judgment of the trial court in this case. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 588, 418 A.2d 939 (1979); <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>174 Conn. 592, 597-98, 392 A.2d 468 (1978); <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>Atlantic Refining Co., </em>132 Conn. 613, 619, 46 A.2d 343 (1946); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Examination of the record compels us to agree with the defendants-in-error that <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant </em>requires affirmance of the dismissal of the charges against them. The wiretap application was appended to the state\u2019s objection to a motion by the defendants to dismiss the writ of error on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The application contains the signature of the state\u2019s attorney over the subscript \u201cAffirming the Above Information.\u201d That language does not make the signature more effective than the acknowledgement that was found wanting in <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant. </em>An oath or affirmation is a solemn and formal declaration that the contents of a declaration, written or oral, are true, and it must be administered in accordance with the ceremony and procedures set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-22 to 1-25. \u201cAn oath . . . signifies the undertaking of an obligation \u2018to speak the truth at a time when . . . testimony may deeply affect the rights and the character of individuals.\u2019 <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Gillet, 2 </em>Conn. 40, 44 [1816]. Consequently, the protection afforded by an application sworn to by the applicant state\u2019s attorney does provide greater protection than an application merely acknowledged, for the oath imposes upon the applicant greater responsibility. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41b and 54-41e mandate that this responsibility be undertaken with every application.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 24. The absence of a formal oath or affirmation is clear from the face of the wiretap application, and hence reviewable on a writ of error. The defendants are not precluded from raising the insufficiency of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s purported affirmation at this time, since the intervention of our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant </em>constitutes an exceptional circumstance under which this court will consider newly raised claims that the trial court did not have the opportunity to consider.
