The trial court held that it was not applicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The plaintiffs, Gloria Dowaliby and Hartford Education Association, brought this action against Hartford Federation of Teachers and the board of education of the city of Hartford, originally seeking to enjoin the defendants from enforcing a provision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the collective bargaining agreement entered into by the defendants which authorized the board to deduct a representation fee from the plaintiff Dowaliby\u2019s salary. The complaint was later amended to seek a judgment declaring that this \u201cagency shop\u201d provision violates General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a and the National Labor Eelations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186 (c) (4). While the action was pending the General Assembly enacted Public Acts 1979, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>No. 79-422, which became effective October 1, 1979. On July 25, 1979, the trial court rendered a judgment declaring that the agency shop clause was illegal when made on July 1, 1979, both under state and federal statutes, and could not be enforced against the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs could not be required to contribute, directly or through withholding, a \u201cservice fee\u201d as a condition of employment during the life of any employment contract entered into prior to October 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The trial court concluded that the agency shop clause violates 29 U.S.C. \u00a7186 (c) (4), which concerns payments, loans and gifts made by an employer to a labor organization including payments so made as a result of deductions from employees\u2019 wages. We need not examine this claim in depth because states and political subdivisions thereof are expressly excluded from the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d as that term is used in the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 141-187. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 142 (3), \u00a7 152 (2). See also <em>Bus Employees Division 998 </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, </em>340 U.S. 383, 398 n.25, 71 S. Ct. 359, 95 L. Ed. 364 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before its amendment by Public Acts 1979, No. 79-422, protected members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of the teaching profession who refused to join or assist any organization for professional or economic improvement. If we assume that this statute operated to bar the enforcement of agency shop clauses in collective bargaining agreements prior to October 1,1979, the question arises whether any such clauses became enforceable upon the effective date of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">If the agency shop clause was illegal in the sense that it was contrary to a deeply rooted public policy, it would be void at its inception. <em>Hanford </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fair Assn., </em>92 Conn. 621, 623, 103 A. 838 (1918). The clause, however, does not offend the public policy of this state. Agency shop clauses have long been a part of collective bargaining in this country. See Hopfl, \u201cThe Agency Shop Question,\u201d 49 Cornell L. Q. 478 (1964). Although the Connecticut Teacher Negotiation Act; \u00a7 10-153a through 153j; does not mirror federal law, resort to the policies underlying federal law is often useful in discerning the contours of our own labor policy. See <em>West Hartford Education Assn. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 578-79, 295 A.2d 526 (1972). The National Labor Relations Act, particularly 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (a) (3), has been construed as allowing agency shop clauses. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>General Motors Corporation, </em>373 U.S. 734, 741, 83 S. Ct. 1453, 10 L. Ed. 2d 670 (1963). In Connecticut, union shop clauses, which are more restrictive than the agency shop provisions, are expressly provided for in the private sector by General Statutes \u00a7 31-105 (5). In light of the foregoing we conclude that, while the clause may have been prohibited by state statute when agreed to, it did not contravene public policy and, therefore, was not a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The clause was, at most, subject to the defense that \u00a7 10-153a barred its enforcement. After October 1, 1979, that defense was no longer available because Public Acts 1979, No. 79-422<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> expressly provided that such clauses were enforceable in teacher contracts. Without that defense the contract is enforceable as the parties undeniably intended it to be, namely, with an agency shop clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The plaintiff questions whether consistent with the impairment of the obligation of contract clause of the United States constitution, article I, section 10, a state statute may validate an invalid provision of a contract. The short answer to this question is, it was ever thus. <em>Satterlee </em>v. <em>Matthewson, </em>27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 380, 413 (1829); <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>30 Conn. 149, 155 (1861). The rights and obligations under the contract remain unchanged by the 1979 public act. The only change wrought by the public act concerns the availability of the defense that the clause violated \u00a7 10-153a. Upon the effective date of this statute, October 1, 1979, the agency clause provision became fully enforceable. See <em>Beckman </em>v. <em>St. Louis County Board of Commissioners, </em>308 Minn. 129, 241 N.W.2d 302 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\"> \u201carticle xiv union RIGHTS (B) : Effective July 1, 1979, all employees shall, as a condition of continued employment, join the Union or pay to the Union a representation fee equal to the amount paid as dues by other employees who are members of the Union except as modified in this Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The Board shall deduct the amount certified by the Union as the annual dues or representation fee from the pay of each employee in equal semi-monthly installments.
