After a stipulated judgment had been rendered which conformed to the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff moved to open the judgment claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. From the denial of that motion, the plaintiff took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the court erred in refusing to grant the motion to open the judgment claiming (1) that the state failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 13b-44 of the General Statutes which require the approval of the town before land can be used for airport expansion, and (2) that there was ineffective representation of counsel resulting from a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The trial referee\u2019s refusal to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion was based on his conclusion that \u00a7 13b-44 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>the General Statutes was not applicable to the five cases before him. The trial referee also concluded that there was no ineffective representation or conflict of interest on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The trial referee\u2019s conclusions are tested by the finding; <em>Brauer </em>v. <em>Freccia, </em>159 Conn. 289, 293, 268 A.2d 645 (1970); and the conclusions must stand unless they are inconsistent with the facts found. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Dunleavy, </em>154 Conn. 100, 105, 221 A.2d 855 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The trial referee found that \u00a7 13b-44 was enacted in 1969, some five years after the disputes which underlie this appeal arose, and that it was not, therefore, applicable to the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The trial referee further found that the plaintiff\u2019s complaints directed against his counsel were without merit; that there was no conflict of interest; and that counsel rendered the highest degree of service and devotion to the plaintiff in securing for him an excellent settlement. These unchallenged findings legally and logically support the conclusions reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"><em> Augustus J.
