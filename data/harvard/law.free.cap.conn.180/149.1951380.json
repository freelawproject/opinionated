On July 1, 1978, because it was merged with the Superior Court, the Court of Common Pleas ceased to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The issue on this appeal is whether the action should have been dismissed as moot. The defendant makes no claim that this ease involves a situation \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d Because the Court of Common Pleas no longer exists, the issue originally presented by this action cannot be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We therefore conclude that by any accepted standard, this action is moot. The trial court acted properly in dismissing the action and its judgment must be affirmed. See <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>177 Conn. 17, 411 A.2d 1 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
