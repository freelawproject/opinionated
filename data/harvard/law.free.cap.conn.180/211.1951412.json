In his appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff claims that the trial court abused its discretion in entering a future order without any evidence of the future financial circumstances of the party. This claim is without merit. The trial court had sufficient financial information before it upon which to base both its present and future alimony orders. In the event of a substantial change of circumstances both present and future alimony orders are ordinarily subject to modification.
