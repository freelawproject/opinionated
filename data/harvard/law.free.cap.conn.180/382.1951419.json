Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A94\">The defendant, Rubin Rodriguez, was indicted by a grand jury for the crime of murder, which charged that on August 28, 1974, with intent to cause the death of Olga Vasquez, he did shoot her and cause her death in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon a trial to the jury, he was found guilty of the crime of manslaughter in the first degree. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">On appeal the defendant claims that the trial court erred: (1) in denying his motion to dismiss the jury panel; (2) in ruling that a child witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Jose Serrano, was competent to testify at the trial; (3) in refusing to allow Carmen Colon, Jose Serrano\u2019s mother, to testify at the trial concerning her son\u2019s character for truth and veracity; (4) in refusing to admit into evidence at the trial the state\u2019s answer to a question contained in the defendant\u2019s motion for discovery; (5) in refusing to allow the defendant to testify at the trial as to what he said to the victim on the morning of her death; and (6) in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the jury array, the denial of which he has assigned as error, was based upon several grounds. The defendant first argues that General Statutes \u00a7 51-217 (Rev. to 1977), which established the qualifications of jurors prior to September, 1977,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unconstitutionally encroached upon the judicial power and, hence, violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The defendant attempts to categorize General Statutes \u00a7 51-217 (Rev. to 1977) with the statute this court invalidated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>166 Conn. 501, 353 A.2d 723 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In <em>Clemente, </em>we said: \u201c \u2018It is the province of the legislative department to define rights and prescribe remedies: of the judicial to construe legislative enactments, determine the rights secured thereby, and apply the remedies prescribed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>supra, 509-10, quoting <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Buck</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>ingham, </em>78 Conn. 423, 428, 62 A. 616 (1905). Statutes relating to the qualification of jurors are part of the machinery created by the legislature to prescribe appropriate remedies for those whose rights have been violated and to protect the rights of those accused of committing a crime. Trial by jury is a long-established and venerated attribute of angloamerican judicial systems. This right is guaranteed in both the state and federal constitutions. See Conn. Const., amend. IV; U. S. Const., amends. VI, VII. General Statutes \u00a751-217 (Rev. to 1977), which implemented that right, was substantive in nature. It was not inconsistent with the independence of the judicial department; see <em>Norwalk Street Ry. Co.\u2019s Appeal, </em>69 Conn. 576, 594, 37 A. 1080 (1897); did not regulate procedure in the Superior Courts; see <em>State ex rel. Kelman </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>161 Conn. 522, 529, 290 A.2d 327 (1971); and did not infringe upon the Superior Court\u2019s traditional exercise of its inherent discretionary power, as did the statute in <em>Clemente. State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>supra, 516. See Kay, \u201cThe Rule-Making Authority and Separation of Powers in Connecticut,\u201d 8 Conn. L. Rev. 1, 4 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The defendant has not been able to present us with any authority for the proposition that legislatively prescribed juror qualifications encroach upon the judicial power. Our examination of the law of other jurisdictions discloses that even in those jurisdictions where the rule-making power resides exclusively in the judiciary, the legislature prescribes qualifications for prospective jurors. See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a713-71-109; Miss. Code Ann. \u00a713-5-1; 17 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1279,1332 (Purdon). We conclude that the power to regulate reasonably the qualification of persons to serve as jurors in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>courts was properly exercised by the legislative branch of our government by the enactment of \u00a7 51-217 (Rev. to 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The defendant also claims that (1) General Statutes \u00a7 51-217 (Rev. to 1977), as it read at the time the members of the jury array, from which his petit jury derived, were summoned,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is unconstitutionally vague and does not provide sufficient \u201cprimary standards\u201d to guide the jury committee members and jury commissioners; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-221; and (2) the statute providing for the selection of persons who make up the jury array from electors\u2019 lists of each town; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-221; deprives the defendant of his right to be tried by a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. We considered and rejected identical claims in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>169 Conn. 692, 696-98, 364 A.2d 186 (1975). See also <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Jury Commission, </em>396 U.S. 320, 332-33, 90 S. Ct. 518, 24 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1970); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>349 F.2d 720, 778 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 947, 86 S. Ct. 1467, 16 L. Ed. 2d 544 (1966).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant has presented us with no reason to depart from our decision in <em>Brown </em>and cites no constitutional authority requiring any such departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in ruling that the witness Jose Serrano was competent to testify. We agree. Jose Serrano, a deaf mute, was the sole eyewitness of the shooting of Olga Vasquez. His testimony was, therefore, critical in this case. At the time of trial he was ten years old, and at the time of the death of Vasquez, he was nine. Upon Serrano\u2019s being offered by the state as a witness, defense counsel asked that the court determine his competency as a witness. At that time the court was informed that Serrano had to testify through interpreters. Two interpreters were qualified and utilized to elicit Serrano\u2019s testimony. Prior to the determination of Serrano\u2019s competency, the defense offered into evidence his school records from the American School for the Deaf, where he had been a student since 1972. Those records disclosed, among other things, that at the time of trial Serrano had the mental age of a six year old, was in the second grade, was profoundly deaf in that he could not distinguish sounds, such as between singing and a cowbell, could not read, and could only write his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In the absence of the jury, the court held a hearing through the interpreters to determine whether Serrano was qualified to testify. Serrano stated his name and age and that he attended and liked school. Upon being asked if he knew what it was to tell the truth, the answer given by the interpreter was: \u201cHe nodded through expression on his face, yes.\u201d He was asked: \u201cWill you promise to tell the truth and not a lie?\u201d to which the interpreter responded: \u201cHe nodded his head, yes.\u201d He was also asked: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cIf yon promise to tell the truth, and you tell a lie, do you understand you can be punished?\u201d He answered \u201cYes.\u201d He also answered yes to the question, \u201cDo you understand that it is your duty to tell the whole truth in this case?\u201d The court then stated: \u201cAsk him what happens if he doesn\u2019t tell the truth.\u201d The interpreter, after communicating with the witness, said: \u201cFrom what I interpreted, it [his response] means that he won\u2019t tell a lie when he knows that he has to be honest.\u201d Thereupon, the court asked: \u201cDoes he understand that he has to tell the truth in this Court?\u201d The interpreter then said to Serrano: \u201cYou know it is important that you have to tell the truth. And you will really tell the truth; you have to tell \u2014 everything you say has to be honest?\u201d The witness answered: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Defense counsel asked if he knew what it meant to be afraid and the interpreter said: \u201cHe said noise.\u201d Upon being asked what \u201cnoise\u201d was, the answer was: \u201cA gun makes noise. When woman died, when she was shot. Q-un.\u201d Upon being asked if he could hear noise in his ears he said: \u201cA little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">After additional inquiry by the court and counsel, the trial court concluded: \u201cJose Serrano understands the oath of the witness and, therefore, is competent to testify.\u201d Defense counsel excepted to the ruling. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in declaring Serrano competent to testify because Serrano could not receive correct sense impressions, did not understand the obligation of an oath, and had no intelligent comprehension of the facts sought to be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The testimonial capacity of a child witness is a matter for the court to determine upon inquiry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 547, 41 A.2d 101 (1945). In Connecticut, the examination to determine the competency of a witness is usually conducted by counsel under direction of the court, except insofar as the court may find it advisable to intervene. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>115 Conn. 672, 676, 163 A. 256 (1932). Because the competency of a witness is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court, its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Siberon, </em>166 Conn. 455, 457, 352 A.2d 285 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>supra, 675; <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>100 Conn. 560, 572-73, 124 A. 226 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In determining the competency of child witnesses, age is not the decisive factor. See <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>supra, 570; McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 62. Instead, the trial court must consider \u201cthe proposed witness\u2019 maturity to receive correct impressions by his senses, ability to recollect and narrate intelligently, and ability to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Siberon, </em>supra, 458. The witness should also have an intelligent comprehension of the facts sought to be developed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>supra, 548; <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>supra, 570; McCormick, loc. cit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The defendant points out that Serrano\u2019s ability to receive correct sense impressions was impaired by his profound deafness. While it is true that the accuracy of the witness\u2019 visual sense impressions was more significant in this case, it is clear from the testimony elicited that Serrano\u2019s audio impressions were also important. Serrano\u2019s testimony was inconsistent at times on the number of shots fired. Thus, Serrano\u2019s inability to receive correct audio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sense impressions had an impact upon the testimony he gave at the trial and upon the ultimate question of his competency as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The defendant also argues that the trial court erred in concluding that Serrano understood the obligation of an oath. The defendant suggests that because Serrano did not know the exact nature of the punishment for not telling the truth, i.e., the punishment for perjury, he could not fully understand the oath of a witness. He relies in this claim upon language of the trial court set out in <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>supra, 569. While it is true that every witness, no matter what his age, must understand the obligation of the oath he takes before testifying in a court of this state, this requirement is satisfied when a child witness \u201cappreciate[s] the moral duty to tell the truth.\u201d See <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>supra, 573; <em>State </em>v. <em>Siberon, </em>supra, 458. This duty is the core of a witness\u2019 oath. Whether a child witness is aware of the potential punishment for perjury is not. We cannot say that the court was required to declare Serrano incompetent to testify on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We agree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the state did not demonstrate at the preliminary hearing to determine competency that Serrano had an intelligent comprehension of the facts sought to be developed or that he could recollect and narrate those facts intelligently. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>supra, 548. At this hearing to determine competency, no inquiry at all was made into Serrano\u2019s comprehension of the facts about which he was to testify. What this court said in <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>supra, 548, bears repeating here: \u201cUnder the most liberal tests, the obligation of the oath and an intel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ligent comprehension of the facts sought to be developed remain a necessary part of the qualifications of a competent witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Our inquiry does not end here, however, for error must be harmful before it will provide the basis for a reversal of a criminal conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Runkles, </em>174 Conn. 405, 413, 389 A.2d 730, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 859, 99 S. Ct. 177, 58 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Annwnziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 524, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 17, 20. In order to demonstrate to this court that the error committed by the trial court was harmful, it was incumbent upon the defendant to include in his brief<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> those portions of the transcript of Serrano\u2019s testimony that evidence Serrano\u2019s actual inability to comprehend intelligently the facts sought to be developed or to recollect and narrate intelligently those facts. This was not done. Such an examination of the testimony given is necessary, for even though a proper foundation had not been laid establishing competency at the preliminary hearing, had the testimony later given satisfied the applicable test, any error in the preliminary ruling would not be considered harmful. We would be inclined to overlook this deficiency; see Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 3060R, 3164; were it not for the fact that the trial court committed harmful error with respect to another claim raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The defendant asserts that the trial court committed reversible error in its ruling preventing the defendant from allowing Serrano\u2019s mother, Carmen Colon, to impeach the credibility of Serrano. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>defendant made a lengthy offer of proof in which he demonstrated that Serrano\u2019s mother knew her son\u2019s character for truth and veracity both personally and in the community in which Serrano lived.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel then asked Carmen Colon whether she was acquainted with Serrano\u2019s character, to which she responded yes. Counsel then asked: \u201cIs his character for truth and veracity equal to that of mankind in general,\u201d to which the witness responded no.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that these questions could not be asked under Connecticut law and ruled that the testimony of Carmen Colon on this issue was inadmissible. Although the state argued before the trial court that the only permissible inquiry of a character witness is his knowledge of an individual\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity in the community, the state now concedes in its brief that error was committed by the court\u2019s refusal to allow any of the witness\u2019 testimony relative to Serrano\u2019s trait of veracity. The state argues, nonetheless, that such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>157 Conn. 99, 104-105, 249 A.2d 232 (1968), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>160 Conn. 366, 368-69, 279 A.2d 552 (1971), this court finally settled the persistent confusion over the proper method of eliciting evidence of character. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>170 Conn. 161, 163, 365 A.2d 104 (1976). Both eases presented the question whether the only method for eliciting character evidence was to inquire of the character witness\u2019 knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>defendant\u2019s or another witness\u2019 reputation in the community for the trait in issue. In both cases this court concluded that character evidence could be elicited either by inquiry into the character witness\u2019 knowledge of the individual\u2019s general reputation in the community for a particular trait or \u201cby the opinion evidence of those who have been shown to have had an opportunity to form, and who have formed, an opinion as to the character of the . . . [individual] with respect to the trait or traits in issue.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>supra, 104-105; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>supra, 368; see <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>96 Conn. 582, 593-97, 115 A. 111 (1921). This rule has been adopted by the federal courts; see Fed. R. Evid. 608 (a); and by the drafters of the Model Code of Evidence in \u00a7\u00a7 306 (2) (a) and 401.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The testimonial foundation laid by the defendant in the lengthy offer of proof justified utilizing either of these methods in establishing the witness\u2019 character for truth and veracity. The court\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant to elicit such testimony of the witness was, therefore, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We do not agree with the state\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s error was harmless. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>262 Cal. App. 2d 790, 798, 69 Cal. Rptr. 269 (1968). The defendant\u2019s right to impeach the credibility of the state\u2019s sole eyewitness to the crime is substantial. It implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses who testify against him. See U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const., art. 1 \u00a7 8. \u201cIn simple language, the defendant has the right to explore every facet of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>relevant evidence pertaining to the credibility of those who testify against him.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Partin, </em>493 F.2d 750, 763 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 903, 98 S. Ct. 298, 54 L. Ed. 2d 189 (1977). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>supra, we ruled that the court\u2019s erroneous exclusion of evidence offered by the defendant bearing on the truth and veracity of the two child complainants could not be harmless because the veracity of these witnesses was crucial to the state\u2019s case. We stated: \u201cUnder the circumstances where a determination of the guilt or innocence of the defendant depended in large measure on the veracity of the children testifying against him it cannot be said that the ruling was harmless error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>supra, 369. Likewise, under the circumstances of this ease, we cannot say that the testimony of the mother of the sole eyewitness to the homicide impugning her son\u2019s character for truth and veracity \u201ccould not reasonably have affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 602, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tropiano, </em>158 Conn. 412, 427, 262 A.2d 147, cert. denied, 398 U.S. 949, 90 S. Ct. 1866, 26 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1969). We must conclude that the error was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Although our conclusion on this issue is dispositive of the appeal, we will consider certain of the defendant\u2019s claims which may have an impact on the new trial we order below.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow into evidence the state\u2019s answer to a question asked in his motion for discovery. The defendant filed a motion, pursuant to Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Book, 1963, \u00a7 2152 (1) (now Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7741 [1]), seeking disclosure of exculpatory information or material, which the court granted. The state\u2019s answer was: \u201cNone contained in the State\u2019s file other than [that] a neighbor stated that the victim may have owned a pistol.\u201d During the trial the defendant offered into evidence this question and answer and the state objected. During the argument on the offer of this evidence it was disclosed that the statement was made by Jose Rivera who lived on the second floor above the apartment where the body of Olga Vasquez was found. The state objected to the offer on the grounds that the answer to the motion was not an admission and that it was not credible evidence. The defendant excepted to the sustaining of the state\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The defendant argues that the statement is admissible because: (1) the state is a party to the action, and hence, its answer to an interrogatory has the same effect as a judicial admission made in a pleading or in open court; and (2) even if the statement is not a judicial admission of the state, it is a hearsay statement made by an unavailable declarant, which, on the basis of <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973), would be fundamentally unfair to the defendant to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The defendant\u2019s first argument, that the answer is admissible as a judicial admission, is based upon the authority of two civil cases. <em>Bochicchio </em>v. <em>Petrocelli, </em>126 Conn. 336, 339-40, 11 A.2d 356 (1940) (action to recover on two promissory notes); <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>Thrall, </em>148 Conn. 202, 207, 169 A.2d 271 (1961) (action to recover damages for personal injuries). These cases stand for the proposition that, in a civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>action, \u201c[a]n answer filed by a party to an interrogatory has the same effect as a judicial admission made in a pleading or in open court\u201d; <em>Bochicchio </em>v. <em>Petrocelli, </em>supra, 339; and that \u201c[a] party is bound by a judicial admission unless the court, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, allows the admission to be withdrawn, explained or modified.\u201d <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>Thrall, </em>supra, 206-207. The defendant has provided us with no reason to extend this rule to criminal actions, and we can conceive of none. Moreover, this \u201cstatement\u201d concedes no fact in issue in this case. The state by its answer does not concede that the victim owned a pistol or that a pistol owned by the victim inflicted the fatal wound. Professor Wigmore has written that a judicial admission is \u201c[a]n express waiver, made in court or preparatory to trial, by the party or his attorney, conceding for the purposes of the trial the truth of some alleged fact, has the effect of a confessory pleading, in that the fact is thereafter to be taken for granted; so that the one party need offer no evidence to prove it, and the other is not allowed to disprove it. . . . It is, in truth, a substitute for evidence, in that it does away with the need for evidence.\u201d 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 2588. He goes on to indicate that \u201c[t]he vital feature of a judicial admission is universally conceded to be its <em>cowclusiveness </em>upon the party making it, i.e. the prohibition of any further dispute of the fact by him, and any use of evidence to disprove or contradict it.\u201d (Emphasis in text.) 9 Wigmore, op. cit., \u00a7 2590.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">An answer to a motion to disclose exculpatory information in a criminal case, unlike the answer to a discovery motion in a civil case, serves only to satisfy the constitutional requirement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>state disclose material which raises a reasonable donbt of the defendant\u2019s guilt that would not otherwise exist. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>172 Conn. 298, 301-303, 374 A.2d 239 (1977). This requirement exists independent of any motion by the defense for disclosure. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>supra, 302. A defendant is thus enabled to investigate the material disclosed to determine whether it leads to evidence that raises a reasonable doubt of his guilt that he may seek to introduce at his trial. The answers to such interrogatories are not in themselves competent evidence of the guilt or innocence of the accused, much less judicial admissions of the state. Moreover, in a criminal prosecution, the state is unlike a party to a civil action with respect to judicial admissions. This is so because the state is not an actor in the transaction or event giving rise to the prosecution as is a party to a civil action, but only exercises the public\u2019s power to vindicate its criminal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the answer to the interrogatory is admissible hearsay under the rule of <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, requires little discussion. The defendant reasons that the \u201cstatement\u201d that was made out of court is admissible because Jose Rivera, the neighbor who evidently was interviewed by police following the death of Olga Vasquez, was unavailable. The short answer to this assertion is that the declarant of the \u201cstatement\u201d in issue was not Jose Rivera, but the individual responding to the discovery motion on behalf of the state. We would be faced with an entirely different situation had the defendant offered into evidence a written statement of Jose Rivera. Under the circumstances of this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>trial court\u2019s refusal to admit this \u201cstatement\u201d into evidence was not error. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, does not require a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred in refusing to allow him to testify concerning what he said to the victim a short time before her death also may be briefly addressed. The statements were excluded on the ground that they were hearsay. The defendant did not offer these statements to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein; see <em>Gyro Brass Mfg. Corporation </em>v. <em>United Automobile Workers, </em>147 Conn. 76, 80, 157 A.2d 241 (1959); McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 246; but only to establish a \u201ctime frame\u201d for the events of the morning on which the victim died. Under this claim of admissibility, however, the content of the conversations was not relevant. On appeal the defendant claims for the first time that these statements were offered to show the defendant\u2019s state of mind. We do not address this claim inasmuch as we order a new trial at which the defendant will have an opportunity to pursue this theory of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">YI</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">We discuss now the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict to the extent that the arguments the defendant makes on this ground have an impact on our disposition and a new trial. As we said in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 99, 384 A.2d 326 (1977), where a defendant is convicted of a lesser offense than that charged, that conviction is an implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>acquittal on the greater offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Price </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>398 U.S. 323, 329, 90 S. Ct. 1757, 26 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1970). Therefore, we do not remand this case for a retrial on the indictment of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The defendant based his motion to set aside the verdict on the ground that there was no foundation either in the law or the evidence at trial to support the verdict of guilty of manslaughter in the first degree. In this regard, he claims that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c) is, in this case, in conflict with the right of a criminal defendant to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him under the federal and state constitutions. See U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 8. He reasons that because he was charged with murder, a crime requiring the element of specific intent to cause the death of another, the court\u2019s charge on manslaughter in the first and second degrees and criminally negligent homicide, which do not require the same state of mind, violated his right to be informed of the crime he is alleged to have committed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c) provides: \u201cThe court or jury before which any person indicted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>mnrder is tried may find him guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged.\u201d As the defendant points out, the same provision as that contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c) was in effect prior to the enactment of the Penal Code in 1969. General Statutes \u00a7 53-9 (Rev. to 1958).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The former statutory scheme applicable to homicides recognized four categories of homicide: Murder in the first and second degrees; General Statutes \u00a7 53-9 (Rev. to 1958); manslaughter; General Statutes \u00a753-13 (Rev. to 1958); and misconduct of railroad employees or motor vehicle operators that causes death. General Statutes \u00a7 53-17 (Rev. to 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The language of \u00a7 53-9 that appears in the present \u00a7 53a-45 (c) has been held to permit four possible verdicts under an indictment for first degree murder: guilty of murder in the first degree, guilty of murder in the second degree, guilty of manslaughter, and not guilty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>McBrien </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>153 Conn. 320, 329, 216 A.2d 432 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomassi, </em>137 Conn. 113, 122, 75 A.2d 67 (1950). In <em>McBrien </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 326, this court said: \u201cOn a trial on an indictment for murder, it was felt desirable, as far back as 1830, to make sure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the petit jury, in accordance with the common-law rule, could return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter if the proof warranted even though only murder would have been charged in the indictment.\u201d Although the 1958 revision did not contain a definition of manslaughter, its common-law definition was applied by the courts. That definition focused on the presence of malice in murder and its absence in manslaughter. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>139 Conn. 89, 91-96, 90 A.2d 905 (1952). Thus, under the homicide statutes in effect prior to 1969, a person indicted for murder could be found guilty of a \u201cwilful, deliberate and premeditated killing,\u201d or a killing perpetrated in the course of committing certain enumerated crimes (murder in the first degree, \u00a7 53-9); \u201chomicide committed with malice aforethought\u201d (murder in the second degree, \u00a7 53-9); see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>160 Conn. 360, 363, 278 A.2d 782 (1971); homicide without malice aforethought (manslaughter, \u00a753-13); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 91-92; or, where applicable, homicide committed under circumstances set forth in \u00a7 53-17 (Rev. to 1958) (wilful misconduct or gross negligence). In the category of manslaughter under \u00a7 53-13 was included the intentional infliction of a wound from which death ensued; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomassi, </em>supra, 119; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bantley, </em>44 Conn. 537, 540 (1877); and engaging in an activity in a \u201creckless manner or with wanton disregard for the safety of others\u201d which causes death. <em>State </em>v. <em>DiLorenzo, </em>138 Conn. 281, 286, 83 A.2d 479 (1951). As these categories disclose, the state of mind of the actor varied according to the degree or grade of homicide involved. Such gradations of the mental state went along the single spectrum of criminal culpability in our former statutory scheme of homicide. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>therefore difficult to understand how the defendant can argue that the statutory language permitting a jury to find a defendant indicted for murder guilty of homicide in a lesser degree than that charged was constitutionally permissible prior to the enactment of the Penal Code in 1969, but not subsequent to that time. In both statutory schemes, the state of mind required for a homicide of a lesser degree than that charged is different from the state of mind for the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomassi, </em>supra, we construed substantially the same language as that appearing in \u00a7 53a-45 (c)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201cthe natural meaning of the . . . provision is that on the theory that the greater offense includes the less, . . . the jury may determine the ease under the original charge by finding the accused guilty of the lesser offense where such a conviction is warranted and is the only one warranted upon the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomassi, </em>supra, 122-23. It is a well-settled principle of constitutional law that where one or more offenses are lesser than and included within the one charged, notice of the one charged constitutes notice of any lesser included offenses. See <em>Paterno </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>334 U.S. 314, 320-21, 68 S. Ct. 1044, 92 L. Ed. 1409 (1948); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 F.2d 1116, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Conklin, </em>115 N.H. 331, 335, 341 A.2d 770 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>223 Kan. 266, 271, 573 P.2d 607 (1977); Barnett, \u201cThe Lesser-Included Offense Doctrine: A Present Day Analysis for Practitioners,\u201d 5 Conn. L. Rev. 255 (1972). Therefore, for purposes of this defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to notice, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>question presented to ns is whether the two sections of the first degree manslaughter statute; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3) ;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the second degree manslaughter statute; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1) ;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and criminally negligent homicide ; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58 ;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are, in this case, lesser included offenses of murder and proper subjects of a jury instruction under the authority of \u00a7 53a-45 (c). Because each of these homicide statutes requires a different state of mind of the actor than that required for murder,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the question is whether one homicide offense can be lesser than and included within another such offense where the state of mind required for the greater is more culpable than the state of mind required for the lesser.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The state of mind of one accused of a crime is often the most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged. This is especially true where a person has caused the death of another person. The death of a person may be caused by a purely accidental act or omission of another, from which no criminal liability may result, or it may come about as the result of long and careful planning, for which the law prescribes severe penalties. Because it is practically impossible to know what someone is thinking or intending at any given moment, absent an outright declaration of intent, a person\u2019s state of mind is usually proved by circumstantial evidence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 579-80, 325 A.2d 199 (1973); and is, except in rare cases, a question of fact. See <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>162 U.S. 313, 314, 16 S. Ct. 839, 40 L. Ed. 980 (1896); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vars, </em>154 Conn. 255, 263, 224 A.2d 744 (1966); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cianflone, </em>98 Conn. 454, 463, 120 A. 347 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Where the state is faced with a homicide prosecution, it may, in good faith and where the circumstances reasonably warrant, assume that an accused acted with the most culpable state of mind. But where the evidence is reasonably susceptible of another conclusion, the jury, or three judge panel, as the case may be; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45(b); should not be bound by that assumption and forced by its verdict to choose only between the offense with the most culpable state of mind and acquittal. Such a result would limit the jury\u2019s function of determining questions of fact and undermine a defendant\u2019s right to a trial by jury. See <em>Keeble </em>v. <em>United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 212-13, 93 S. Ct. 1993, 36 L. Ed. 2d 844 (1973); <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>People, </em>172 Colo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>168, 173-74, 470 P.2d 857 (1970). This reasoning was adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>United States, 162 </em>U.S. 313, 16 S. Ct. 839, 40 L. Ed. 980 (1896). Reviewing a trial court\u2019s refusal in a murder prosecution to instruct the jury on manslaughter, the court there said: \u201cThe evidence as to manslaughter need not be uncontradicted or in any way conclusive upon the question; so long as there is some evidence upon the subject, the proper weight to be given it is for the jury to determine. If there were any evidence which tended to show such a state of facts as might bring the crime within the grade of manslaughter, it then became a proper question for the jury to say whether the evidence were true and whether it showed that the crime was manslaughter instead of murder.\u201d Id., 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Permitting the jury to find the defendant guilty of a lesser charge of homicide than that charged, where the evidence supports such a finding, does not violate the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to notice. By the charge on the greater offense of murder, the defendant is put on notice that he will be put on trial for his action in causing the death of another person. Thus, having been given notice of the most serious degree of culpable intent by the murder indictment, he is implicitly given notice of those lesser included homicides that require a less serious degree of culpable intent. See <em>Walker </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 F.2d 1116, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1969); <em>Mildwoff </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>432 F. Sup. 814, 817 (S.D. N.Y. 1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Conklin, </em>115 N.H. 331, 335, 341 A.2d 770 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In reaching this conclusion we have examined a great deal of case law from other jurisdictions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In none have we discovered, nor has counsel referred us to, a holding that prevents a court from instructing a jury in a homicide case on a lesser degree of homicide than that charged where the evidence so warrants. Rather, courts consistently hold that where the evidence supports an instruction on a lesser degree of homicide than that charged, it is error to refuse to give such an instruction. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>162 U.S. 313, 314-15, 320-23, 16 S.

We note also that the same result we reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>would obtain under the lesser included offense provision of the Model Penal Code. See Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.07 (4) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The defendant relies primarily upon this court\u2019s decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 95-99, 384 A.2d 326 (1977), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 269-72, 368 A.2d 222 (1976), for his argument that the lesser crimes involved here would not have been lesser included offenses of murder. We point out that <em>Ruiz </em>did not involve a prosecution for homicide and that in <em>Troynack, </em>which did, the court was not presented with any claim involving General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c). To the extent that the reasoning employed in those cases is contrary to the analysis we employ here, however, they are no longer controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">By our decision today we do not suggest that an instruction on a lesser degree of homicide than that charged will always be the proper subject of a lesser included offense instruction. The conditions we set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), control. For purposes of the second condition of <em>Whistnant, </em>we conclude, however, that an offense that would be a lesser included offense but for its requirement of a less culpable state of mind than that required for the greater, will be deemed a lesser included offense. Therefore, there must be \u201csome evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense [of homicide]; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d Ibid. Where these conditions are met, an instruction on a homicide of a lesser degree than that charged is appropriate, whether requested by the state or the defendant, or given by the court sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In the light of this conclusion, we examine the offenses upon which the jury were instructed, to determine which of them is a proper subject of a lesser included offense instruction and, therefore, an appropriate charge against the defendant for the purpose of the second trial. Under the conditions set out above, which require that there be some evidence to justify conviction of the lesser offense, it is apparent that the evidence at the first trial as summarized in the briefs could not have justified a jury instruction upon criminally negligent homicide; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-58; manslaughter in the second degree as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1), or manslaughter in the first degree as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). The evidence, as summarized in the briefs, could not have supported a conclusion that the defendant, in causing the death of the victim, acted with criminal negligence; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14); or with recklessness; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13); or with recklessness under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). The evidence summarized in the briefs is reasonably susceptible of a conclusion that the defendant, intending to cause serious physical injury to the victim, caused her death.
