Because we conclude that the duty set forth in MCL 554.139(l)(a) was not violated here because one to two inches of snow did not render the parking lot unfit for the use intended, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Plaintiff fractured his ankle during a fall when he was walking on one to two inches of accumulated snow in the parking lot of his apartment complex. He then noticed ice on the ground where the snow had been displaced. Plaintiff filed suit against defendant AEW Capital Management, doing business as Sutton Place Apartments, alleging negligence and breach of the covenant to maintain and repair the premises, MCL 554.139(1). The trial court granted summary disposition to defendant, concluding that the danger was \u201copen and obvious,\u201d and directed that the pleadings be amended to replace AEW with the proper defendants, Village Green Management Company and BFMSIT, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling on the basis of <em>Teufel v Watkins, </em>267 Mich App 425, 429 n 1; 705 NW2d 164 (2005), which held that MCL 554.139(1) does not control a lessor\u2019s duty to remove snow and ice from a parking lot. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued November 28, 2006 (Docket No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>269021). The panel expressed its disagreement with <em>Teufel </em>and sought a conflict resolution panel. <em>Id. </em>After this request was denied, the panel granted plaintiffs motion for reconsideration and vacated its initial opinion. Unpublished order, entered January-19, 2007 (Docket No. 269021). The panel then reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition, stating that <em>Teufel </em>did not constitute governing precedent because its holding regarding the inapplicability of MCL 554.139(1) was only presented in a footnote. <em>Allison v AEW Capital Mgt, LLP (On Reconsideration), </em>274 Mich App 663, 669-670; 736 NW2d 307 (2007). The panel also concluded that a parking lot constitutes a common area under MCL 554.139(1)(a), that one of a parking lot\u2019s intended uses entails persons walking on it, and that a parking lot covered with ice is not fit for that purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 670-671. Defendants filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court, and we granted leave to appeal. 480 Mich 894 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">This Court reviews de novo the grant or denial of a summary disposition motion. <em>Saffian v Simmons, </em>477 Mich 8, 12; 727 NW2d 132 (2007). Matters of statutory interpretation are also reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>Defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10). A motion under MCR 2.116(C)(8) should be granted if the pleadings fail to state a claim as a matter of law, and no factual development could justify recovery. <em>Maiden v Rozwood, </em>461 Mich 109, 119; 597 NW2d 817 (1999). A motion under MCR 2.116(C)(10) should be granted if the evidence submitted by the parties \u201cfails to establish a genuine issue regarding any material fact, [and] the moving party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120; see also MCR 2.116(C)(10). There is a genuine issue of material fact when reasonable minds could differ on an issue after viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>West v Gen Motors Corp, </em>469 Mich 177, 183; 665 NW2d 468 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Plaintiff asserted two different causes of action in this case: (1) negligence and (2) breach of the covenants to keep the premises and common areas fit for their intended use and to keep the premises in reasonable repair, MCL 554.139(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If defendants had a duty under MCL 554.139(l)(a) or (b) to remove snow and ice from the parking lot, then plaintiff could proceed on his second claim even if plaintiffs negligence claim was barred by the \u201copen and obvious\u201d danger doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCL 554.139 provides a specific protection to lessees and licensees of residential property in <em>addition </em>to any protection provided by the common law. The statutory protection under MCL 554.139(1) arises from the existence of a residential lease and consequently becomes a statutorily mandated term of such lease. Therefore, a breach of the duty to maintain the premises under MCL 554.139(l)(a) or (b) would be construed as a breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the terms of the lease between the parties and any remedy under the statute would consist exclusively of a contract remedy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">A. \u201cCOMMON AREAS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">MCL 554.139 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">(1) In every lease or license of residential premises, the lessor or licensor covenants:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">(a) That the premises and all common areas are fit for the use intended by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">(b) To keep the premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease or license, and to comply with the applicable health and safety laws of the state and of the local unit of government where the premises are located, except when the disrepair or violation of the applicable health or safety laws has been caused by the tenant\u2019s wilful or irresponsible conduct or lack of conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The primary goal of statutory interpretation is \u201cto ascertain the legislative intent that may be reasonably inferred from the words expressed in the statute.\u201d <em>G C Timmis &amp; Co v Guardian Alarm Co, </em>468 Mich 416, 420; 662 NW2d 710 (2003). If the language of the statute is clear, we presume that the Legislature intended the meaning expressed. <em>Id. </em>If the statute does not define a word, we may consult dictionary definitions to determine the plain and ordinary meaning of the word. <em>Koontz v Ameritech Services, Inc, </em>466 Mich 304, 312; 645 NW2d 34 (2002). However, legal terms of art are to be construed according to their peculiar and appropriate meaning. MCL 8.3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">MCL 554.139 does not define the term \u201ccommon areas.\u201d However, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 275, defines \u201ccommon area\u201d as: \u201c[i]n law of landlord-tenant, the portion of demised premises used in common by tenants over which landlord retains control <em>{e.g. </em>hallways, stairs) and hence for whose condition he is liable, as contrasted with areas of which tenant has exclusive possession.\u201d This definition is in accord with the plain and ordinary meaning of the term. \u201cCommon\u201d is defined as \u201cbelonging equally to, or shared alike by, two or more or all in question[.]\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Therefore, in the context of leased residential property, \u201ccommon areas\u201d describes those areas of the property over which the lessor retains control that are shared by two or more, or all, of the tenants. A lessor\u2019s duties regarding these areas arise from the control the lessor retains over them. See, e.g., <em>Williams v Cunningham Drug Stores, Inc, </em>429 Mich 495, 499; 418 NW2d 381 (1988) (stating that \u201ca landlord may be held liable for an unreasonable risk of harm caused by a dangerous condition in the areas of common use retained in his control such as lobbies, hallways, stairways, and elevators\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The issue in this case concerns whether parking lots within leased residential property constitute \u201ccommon areas\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The Court of Appeals answered in the affirmative, relying on <em>Benton v Dart Properties, Inc, </em>270 Mich App 437; 715 NW2d 335 (2006), to conclude that parking lots constitute common areas. In <em>Benton, supra </em>at 442-443, the Court of Appeals held that sidewalks, within an apartment complex constitute common areas under MCL 554.139(l)(a) because they are located within the complex, they are constructed and maintained by the lessor, and they are relied on by tenants to access their apartments and vehicles. In this case, the Court of Appeals adopted this reasoning to conclude that parking lots also constitute common areas because they are located within the complex, they are maintained by the lessor, and tenants must necessarily walk on parking lots to access their vehicles. <em>Allison, supra </em>at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We agree that a parking lot within a leased residential property fits within the meaning of \u201ccommon area\u201d because it is accessed by two or more, or all, of the tenants and the lessor retains general control. Among other things, the lessor controls whether a parking lot is used by members of the public as well as by tenants, the circumstances under which non-tenants can access the lot, the number and size of vehicles that a tenant can park in the lot, the lot\u2019s hours of operation, the means of identification of those entitled to park in the lot, and whether and how particular parking spaces will be allocated. Further, the lessor is responsible for the maintenance and security of the lot. Thus, we believe that parking lots within a leased residential property that are shared by two or more, or all, of the tenants constitute \u201ccommon areas\u201d under MCL 554.139(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>B. LESSOR\u2019S DUTY UNDER MCL 554.139(1)( a)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Because a parking lot within a leased residential property is a common area under MCL 554.139(l)(a), the lessor effectively has a contractual duty to keep the parking lot \u201cfit for the use intended by the parties.\u201d The next question concerns whether this covenant encompasses the duty to keep the lot free from the natural accumulation of snow and ice. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">The intended use of a parking lot is to park cars and other motor vehicles; however, in order to access their vehicles and apartments, tenants must also necessarily walk on the parking lot. A second intended use of a parking lot, therefore, is walking on it. A parking lot covered with ice is not fit for this purpose. <em>[Allison, supra </em>at 670-671.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We agree that the intended use of a parking lot includes the parking of vehicles. A parking lot is constructed for the primary purpose of storing vehicles on the lot. \u201cFit\u201d is defined as \u201cadapted or suited; appropriate[.]\u201d <em>Random, House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Therefore, a lessor has a duty to keep a parking lot adapted or suited for the parking of vehicles. A parking lot is generally considered suitable for the parking of vehicles as long as the tenants are able to park their vehicles in the lot and have reasonable access to their vehicles. A lessor\u2019s obligation under MCL 554.139(1) (a) with regard to the accumulation of snow and ice concomitantly would commonly be to ensure that the entrance to, and the exit from, the lot is clear, that vehicles can access parking spaces, and that tenants have reasonable access to their parked vehicles. Fulfilling this obligation would allow the lot to be used as the parties intended it to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In this case, in construing the meaning of these terms in the contract, neither of the parties has indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>cated that the intended use of the parking lot was anything other than basic parking and reasonable access to such parking. Plaintiffs allegation of unfitness was supported only by two facts: that the lot was covered with one to two inches of snow and that plaintiff fell. Under the facts presented in this record, we believe that there could not be reasonable differences of opinion regarding the fact that tenants were able to enter and exit the parking lot, to park their vehicles therein, and to access those vehicles. Accordingly, plaintiff has not established that tenants were unable to use the parking lot for its intended purpose, and his claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">While a lessor may have some duty under MCL 554.139(l)(a) with regard to the accumulation of snow and ice in a parking lot, it would be triggered only under much more exigent circumstances than those obtaining in this case. The statute does not require a lessor to maintain a lot in an ideal condition or in the most accessible condition possible, but merely requires the lessor to maintain it in a condition that renders it fit for use as a parking lot. Mere inconvenience of access, or the need to remove snow and ice from parked cars, will not defeat the characterization of a lot as being fit for its intended purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We recognize that tenants must walk across a parking lot in order to access their vehicles. However, plaintiff did not show that the condition of the parking lot in this case precluded access to his vehicle. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, under the facts presented, the parking lot in this case was unfit simply because it was covered in snow and ice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Allison, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>supra </em>at 670-671. Further, we take issue with the suggestion of the Court of Appeals that a tenant traversing a parking lot, for any reason, might be able to take advantage of the covenant for fitness for the uses intended. A tenant using a common area for a purpose other than that for which the area is intended is not protected by the covenant for fitness, but would be afforded any protections provided by the common law. The statute does not require any level of fitness beyond what is necessary to allow tenants to use the parking lot as the parties intended. In addition, should this point need clarification, a non-tenant could never recover under the covenant for fitness because a lessor has no contractual relationship with \u2014 and, therefore, no duty under the statute to \u2014 a non-tenant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff has not shown that the lot in this case was unfit for its intended use, and the Court of Appeals erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">C. LESSOR\u2019S DUTY UNDER MCL 554.139(l)(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The final question concerns whether a lessor\u2019s duty to repair under MCL 554.139(l)(b) extends to snow and ice accumulation in a parking lot. We must distinguish the term \u201ccommon areas\u201d from the term \u201cpremises\u201d if we are to give meaning to all the words of this statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The lessor\u2019s duty under MCL 554.139(l)(a) applies to \u201cthe premises and all common areas,\u201d while the lessor\u2019s duty under MCL 554.139(l)(b) applies only to \u201cthe premises.\u201d We must \u201cavoid a construction that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </em>465 Mich 53, 60; 631 NW2d 686 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u201cPremises\u201d is defined as \u201ca tract of land including its buildings\u201d or \u201ca building or part of a building together with its grounds or other appurtenances[.]\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Such a definition would seem to include everything within the boundaries of the apartment complex, including the common areas. However, a statute can give special meaning to a word apart from its everyday use. Under the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>a word is also given meaning in the context of the words around it. <em>Koontz, supra </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In this statute, the Legislature specifically set the term \u201ccommon areas\u201d apart from the term \u201cpremises\u201d by applying the first covenant to both terms and the second covenant only to \u201cpremises.\u201d If we conclude that \u201cpremises\u201d includes \u201ccommon areas,\u201d then the phrase \u201cand all common areas\u201d would be entirely superfluous. The only way to give meaning to the phrase \u201cand all common areas\u201d in this context is to conclude that \u201cpremises\u201d does not encompass \u201ccommon areas\u201d and that the covenant to repair under MCL 554.139(1) (b) does not apply to \u201ccommon areas.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The exclusion of common areas from the covenant to repair imposed by the statute does not necessarily mean that the lessor is free of any duty to repair common areas, because these areas must still be kept \u201cfit for the use intended by the parties.\u201d The Legislature elected to impose two different duties on the lessor, one for \u201cpremises and all common areas\u201d and one for only \u201cpremises,\u201d and differentiated those duties through its choice of language, one covenant requiring \u201cfitness\u201d and the other requiring \u201creasonable repair.\u201d Because both covenants imposed by the statute apply to premises, and only the covenant for fitness applies to common areas, we can reasonably infer that the Legislature intended to place a less onerous burden on the lessor with regard to common areas. Keeping common areas fit for their intended use may well require a lessor to perform maintenance and repairs to those areas, but may conceivably require repairs less extensive than those required by the second covenant. For example, if the lessor has a duty to repair a parking lot under MCL 554.139(l)(b), the lessor arguably may be required to fill a small pothole in the parking lot, even if that pothole did not affect the ability of the tenants to park in that lot. However, because the lessor does not have such a duty with regard to parking lots because they are common areas, the lessor would not necessarily be obligated to fill that pothole under the duties concerning fitness in MCL 554.139(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In <em>Teufel, supra at </em>429 n 1, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">Plaintiff also argues that the trial court erred when it failed to address his argument that [the lessor] had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>statutory duty under MCL 554.139 to keep its premises and common areas in reasonable repair and fit for their intended uses, which negates the defense of open and obvious danger. Any error in the trial court\u2019s failure to address this argument is harmless. The plain meaning of \u201creasonable repair\u201d as used in MCL 554.139(l)(b) requires repair of a defect in the premises. Accumulation of snow and ice is not a defect in the premises. Thus, a lessor\u2019s duty under MCL 554.139(l)(a) and (b) to keep its premises in reasonable repair and fit for its intended use does not extend to snow and ice removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">This is an accurate assessment of the requirement of \u201creasonable repair\u201d in MCL 554.139(l)(b). \u201cDefect\u201d is defined as \u201ca fault or shortcoming; imperfection.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Damage to the property would constitute an imperfection in the property that would require mending. Therefore, repairing a defect equates to keeping the premises in a good condition as a result of restoring and mending damage to the property. The accumulation of snow and ice does not constitute a defect in property, and, therefore, the lessor would have no duty under MCL 554.139(l)(b) with regard to snow and ice, except to the extent that such snow and ice caused damage to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">This conclusion can be analogized to the government\u2019s duty to maintain highways in reasonable repair under MCL 691.1402(1), the highway exception to governmental immunity. In <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm, </em>463 Mich 143, 158; 615 NW2d 702 (2000), this Court held that the \u201chighway exception waives the absolute immunity of governmental units with regard to defective highways under their jurisdiction.\u201d To recover under MCL 691.1402(1), a plaintiff must demonstrate that a defect in the highway was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Haliw v Sterling Hts, </em>464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Mich 297, 309 n 9; 627 NW2d 581 (2001). In <em>Haliw, </em>this Court specifically excluded the accumulation of snow and ice from consideration as a defect. <em>Id. </em>More recently, in <em>MacLachlan v Capital Area Transportation Auth, </em>474 Mich 1059 (2006), this Court held that an accumulation of snow in the roadway did not constitute a \u201cdefect in the roadway rendering it unsafe for public travel at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">We hold that the lessor\u2019s duty to repair under MCL 554.139(l)(b) does not apply to common areas and, therefore, does not apply to parking lots. In addition, MCL 554.139(l)(b) requires the lessor to repair defects in the premises, and the accumulation of snow and ice is not a defect. A lessor has no duty under MCL 554.139(l)(b) with regard to the natural accumulation of snow and ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">D. <em>TEUFEL </em>AS PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The Court of Appeals on reconsideration stated that the holding in <em>Teufel, supra </em>at 429 n 1, was legally flawed for failing to distinguish, or even mention, <em>O\u2019Donnell v Garasic, </em>259 Mich App 569; 676 NW2d 213 (2003), and for failing to conduct a separate analysis of MCL 554.139(l)(a) and (b). <em>Allison, supra </em>at 668-669. The Court proceeded to observe that it was not bound to follow the discussion of MCL 554.139(l)(a) and (b) in <em>Teufel </em>because, \u201c[h]ad [the] Court in <em>Teufel </em>intended to create a rule of law regarding the availability of the open and obvious danger doctrine when a landlord has a statutory duty under MCL 554.139(l)(a) and (b), it would have done so in the body of the opinion rather than in a footnote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669-670, citing <em>Guerra v Garratt, </em>222 Mich App 285, 289-292; 564 NW2d 121 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The Court\u2019s reference to <em>Guerra </em>was misplaced. <em>Guerra </em>did not state that language set forth in a footnote does not constitute binding precedent. Rather, in <em>Guerra, </em>the Court of Appeals was attempting to interpret whether certain language in <em>Lemmerman v Fealk, </em>449 Mich 56, 77 n 15; 534 NW2d 695 (1995), was meant to limit the retroactivity of the opinion\u2019s general holding or to create an exception to that holding. <em>Guerra, supra </em>at 291. The Court engaged in ordinary interpretative analysis, examining the circumstances and the context in order to properly give meaning to the language. The Court of Appeals concluded that, given the fact that <em>Lemmerman </em>repeatedly set forth its general holding without suggesting any exception and specifically made a statement incompatible with such an exception, this Court would have placed any such exception to the general holding, if it had been intended, in the body of the opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 291-292. Therefore, the Court of Appeals determined that the footnote pertained to the retroactivity of the holding, and did not create an exception to that holding.

The language in the <em>Teufel </em>footnote was not dictum; rather, the footnote addressed an alternative argument raised by the plaintiff regarding the applicability of MCL 554.139 and was, therefore, necessary to the disposition of the case.

However, the <em>Teufel </em>footnote held that MCL 554.139(l)(a) and (b) do not apply to snow and ice removal. Therefore, the \u201copen and obvious\u201d danger doctrine could avoid the defendants\u2019 liability in <em>Teufel, </em>and there was no need to refer to, nor was there any inconsistency with, <em>O\u2019Donnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Language set forth in a footnote can constitute binding precedent if the language creates a \u201crule of law\u201d and is not merely dictum. <em>Teufel, supra </em>at 429 n 1, created a rule of law that the Court of Appeals was bound to follow.

Moreover, we believe that the Court of Appeals acted contrary to MCE 7.215(J)(1) in failing to follow the precedent set forth in <em>Teufel </em>and erred in holding that language contained in a footnote cannot be binding precedent.

The majority correctly observes that the parking lot here was \u201cfit for the use intended by the parties\u201d where only one to two inches of snow had accumulated. Yet the majority goes on to state that in \u201cmore exigent circumstances\u201d a natural accumulation of snow or ice could trigger the statutory duty.

This assumption overlooks a fair reading of the statutory text Mmiting the duty of fitness to the <em>physical structure </em>of the premises and common areas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> My analysis of the statutory covenant and its legal background suggests that it is limited to structural defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">While a court may use a lay dictionary to define common words or phrases that lack a unique legal meaning, MCL 8.3a; <em>People v Thompson, </em>477 Mich 146, 151-152; 730 NW2d 708 (2007), I would not assume that the terms used in MCL 554.139 lack an acquired legal meaning. Indeed, it appears that the statute codifies the implied warranty of habitability, and that this warranty does not protect against transient conditions such as ice or snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The duties set forth in MCL 554.139 are directed at ensuring that the premises are habitable. The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>was enacted \u201c \u2018to establish as a matter of law the landlord\u2019s promissory duty <em>to make the premises fit for habitation </em>at the time of taking possession and throughout the term of period of tenancy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rome v Walker, </em>38 Mich App 458, 462 n 3; 196 NW2d 850 (1972), quoting Schier, <em>Draftsman: Formulation of Policy, </em>2 Prospectus, A Journal of Law Reform 227, 233 (1968) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">\u201cAt common law, a landlord generally had no duty to provide a habitable rental property.\u201d 49 Am Jur 2d, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 447, p 455.

This implied warranty extends to common areas. See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 447, p 455.

I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusions under MCL 554.139(1) (a) that a parking lot is a common area, the intended use of a parking lot includes walking to and from parked vehicles, accumulations of ice and snow may be subject to a landlord\u2019s duties under \u00a7 139(l)(a), and the \u201copen and obvious danger\u201d doctrine is inapplicable to the duty created by the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s application of \u00a7 139(l)(a) in this case. While I tend to agree with the majority that one or two inches of snow would rarely make a parking lot unfit for its intended use under \u00a7 139(l)(a), I cannot categorically conclude that an accumulation of one or two inches of snow or ice can never make a parking lot unfit. Specifically, I cannot conclude that the parking lot in this case was fit for its use on the facts presented. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">I believe that plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to survive summary disposition under \u00a7 139(1)(a). Section 139(1) provides that, in every lease or license of residential premises, a landlord has a duty to ensure that premises and common areas are fit for use, to keep the premises in reasonable repair, and to comply with health and safety laws. Review of a claim under \u00a7 139(1) requires a determination of where the claimed injury took place. If the injury occurred in a common area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u00a7 139(l)(a) requires review of the parties\u2019 intended use for the common area and the area\u2019s fitness for that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In this case, plaintiff was defendant\u2019s tenant and suffered injury in defendant\u2019s apartment complex parking lot. The parking lot was a common area. Its intended use included parking vehicles, which includes walking to and from the vehicle. Plaintiff was walking to his vehicle when he slipped and fell; therefore, he was using the parking lot as the parties intended when he was injured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> So the next question is whether the parking lot was fit for its intended use when plaintiff fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The concept of fitness for use includes safety. The Second Restatement of Torts states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">[A]n invitee enters upon an implied representation or assurance that the land has been prepared and made ready and safe for his reception. He is therefore entitled to expect that the possessor will exercise reasonable care to make the land safe for his entry, or for his use for the purposes of the invitation. [2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 343, comment <em>b, </em>p 216.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Specifically in landlord and tenant law, this Court has stated that \u201ca landlord may be held liable for an unreasonable risk of harm caused by a dangerous condition in the areas of common use retained in his control. ...\u201d <em>Williams v Cunningham Drug Stores, Inc, </em>429 Mich 495, 499; 418 NW2d 381 (1988). The <em>Williams </em>Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The rationale behind imposing a duty to protect in these special relationships is based on control. In each situation one person entrusts himself to the control and protection of another, with a consequent loss of control to protect himself. The duty to protect is imposed upon the person in control because he is best able to provide <em>a place of safety.\u201d [Id. </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">So \u00a7 139(1)(a), requiring fitness, imposes a duty on the landlord to ensure that common areas are safe for their intended use. Whether a common area is sufficiently safe to be fit for its intended purpose depends on the condition of the area in question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">There appears to be some confusion about the condition of defendant\u2019s parking lot at the time of plaintiffs injury. The Court of Appeals described the condition as \u201c[a] parking lot covered with ice,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while the majority describes the condition as a lot with \u201cone to two inches of accumulated snow .. .. \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 423. A two-inch sheet of ice ordinarily presents a very different degree of danger from that ordinarily presented by two inches of snow. Typically, the danger associated with snow becomes greater as the snow becomes deeper. But ice may be dangerous at almost any thickness.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Plaintiff testified that when he left his apartment for work on the morning of March 13, 2003, the entire area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>was covered with \u201cmaybe an inch or two\u201d of snow that had accumulated overnight. He stepped down the two stairs of his porch, walked down the sidewalk to the parking lot, and then began walking across the parking lot toward his car. After walking about 20 feet across the parking lot toward his car, plaintiff slipped and fell. In deposition testimony, plaintiff described how he fell: \u201cI just take the step and then my foot falls or slips out from under me, and then I fell and then I \u2014 that\u2019s basically it. My foot slipped. It was the ice that I slipped on.\u201d When asked how he knew that he slipped on \u201cice versus snow,\u201d plaintiff stated: \u201cWell, because the way my foot slipped. It slipped and my leg just went from under me and then when I fell, I saw where my foot slipped, I saw ice.\u201d So, according to the only evidence available to this Court, plaintiff slipped on ice in defendant\u2019s parking lot. I believe that a parking lot covered with ice is not fit for its intended use because it is not safe for walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The majority states that \u201c[mjere inconvenience\u201d does not make a common area unfit for its intended use. <em>Ante </em>at 430. But the ice-covered surface of defendant\u2019s parking lot presented a much greater danger to plaintiff than mere inconvenience. Plaintiffs fall on ice in defendant\u2019s parking lot caused severe injury. Plaintiffs fractured ankle required extensive surgery. Plaintiff was not able to return to work for three months following surgery. In deposition testimony two years after the injury, plaintiff stated, \u201cI always have pain and restrictions... I have pain in my ankle every day.\u201d Further, plaintiff is subject to ankle \u201cre-sprains\u201d three or four times a week. I would not call the condition plaintiff faced a mere inconvenience. And I would not call a common area that presented such a danger fit for its intended use.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The majority states that the parking lot was fit for its intended use because \u201ctenants were able to enter and exit the parking lot, to park their vehicles therein, and to access those vehicles.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 430.1 am unaware of any evidence to support this conclusion. The only fact established on this point is that plaintiff was not able to access his vehicle without injury. The majority concludes that the parking lot was fit for its intended use when plaintiff fell because \u201cplaintiff did not show that the condition of the parking lot in this case precluded access to his vehicle.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 430. But, as mentioned, access to vehicles must be safe in order to be fit. Plaintiff could access his vehicle only by risking serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">A landlord\u2019s duty to provide safe common areas does not preclude a tenant\u2019s duty to take steps within his control to keep himself safe. The trial court intimated as much when it opined on the proper method of walking on ice: \u201cI suggest that \u2014 I call it the Michigan shuffle, but you don\u2019t necessarily walk; you do the skating.\u201d Contrary to the apparent perception of the trial court, plaintiff testified in deposition that he took every reasonable precaution: he was wearing boots specifically made for walking on snow, he watched where he was going, and he proceeded with great care. when crossing the parking lot. Despite his best efforts to attend to his safety by means within his control, he was injured. At this pretrial stage, I believe that plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of fact concerning whether the parking lot was unfit. Thus, summary disposition is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">If a plaintiff is able to show that a common area is not fit for its intended use, the reasonableness of the landlord\u2019s actions to remedy the unfit condition should also be assessed. \u201c[A] contract to keep the premises in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>safe condition subjects the lessor to liability only if he does not exercise reasonable care after he has had notice of the need of repairs. In any case his obligation is only one of reasonable care.\u201d 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 357, comment <em>d, </em>pp 242-243. In this case, if the parking lot is found unfit, there is a valid question whether defendant exercised reasonable care to remedy the unfit condition. I would remand the case to the trial court for further inquiry into these matters under the proper legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">I would also state a clearer standard for a landlord\u2019s liability regarding ice and snow than the majority provides to guide courts facing similar claims in the future. Because fitness for use requires a landlord to take measures to provide safe common areas, and because a landlord\u2019s duty requires exercise of reasonable care, I would apply the standard of <em>Quinlivan v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co, Inc, </em>395 Mich 244, 261; 235 NW2d 732 (1975): the duty owed by a landlord to a tenant regarding ice and snow requires that \u201creasonable measures be taken within a reasonable time after an accumulation of ice and snow to diminish the hazard of injury to the [tenant].\u201d This standard arose in tort law, but it applies to fitness for use as well. It is faithful to the statute and readily applicable for courts in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">I generally agree with the majority\u2019s analysis (if not its application) of \u00a7 139(l)(a), but I believe the majority has unnecessarily reached several issues. These matters are not necessary to the majority\u2019s disposition of the case; thus, they are dicta. Nonetheless, I disagree with several of these extraneous conclusions. First, because the majority holds that defendant is entitled to summary disposition, there is no need to determine plaintiffs potential remedy. However, I would hold that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>plaintiff who proves a claim under MCL 554.139(1) is entitled to full damages for the injury. The Second Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 357, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">A lessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his lessee and others upon the land with the consent of the lessee or his sublessee by a condition of disrepair existing before or arising after the lessee has taken possession if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">(a) the lessor, as such, has contracted by a covenant in the lease or otherwise to keep the land in repair, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">(b) the disrepair creates an unreasonable risk to persons upon the land which the performance of the lessor\u2019s agreement would have prevented, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">(c) the lessor fails to exercise reasonable care to perform his contract. <em>[Id. </em>at 241.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The comments to that section state that \u201cthe duty arises out of the existence of the contract to repair.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment <em>d, </em>p 242. The comments further state that \u201c[t]he lessor\u2019s duty under the rule stated in this Section is not merely contractual, although it is founded upon a contract. It is a tort duty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 357, comment c, p 242. There is no reason this liability should not apply under MCL 554.139(1). Indeed, it should apply because the statute\u2019s very purpose is to provide safety in areas outside the tenant\u2019s control. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 499 (\u201cduty to protect is imposed upon the person in control because he is best able to provide a place of safety\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Also, because this case involves a tenant only, there is no reason to address a landlord\u2019s liability to nontenants under \u00a7 139(1). However, I believe the majority incorrectly asserts that a nontenant could never recover under the covenant for fitness because a lessor has no contractual relationship with a nontenant. The Second Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 357, states that \u201c[a] lessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>his lessee and <em>others upon the land with consent of the lessee </em>. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241 (emphasis added). Additionally, I believe the intended use of a parking lot in an apartment complex will generally include, at minimum, parking (and walking) for a tenant\u2019s guests. An apartment is a tenant\u2019s home. It is likely that both parties to an apartment lease intend the parking lot to be used by guests as well as tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Finally, I believe that MCL 554.139(1) (b) may apply to common areas. Section 139(1) (b) contains two independent covenants. The first is \u201c[t]o keep the premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease.\u201d The second is \u201cto comply with the applicable health and safety laws of the state and of the local government.\u201d The second is independent of the first and is not confined to the \u201cpremises.\u201d Therefore, a landlord may be liable for an injury sustained in a common area due to a condition that does not comply with health and safety laws. I would direct the trial court to examine whether plaintiff has a claim under the second covenant of \u00a7 139(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The trial court in this case found that \u00a7 139(1) did not apply and the open and obvious danger doctrine did apply. The majority determines that \u00a7 139(1) applies and the open and obvious danger doctrine does not. I agree with that determination, but I would affirm the result of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings under the proper legal standards.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> I also agree that placement in a footnote does not, of itself, affect the language\u2019s precedential significance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> The majority states that \u201c[a] tenant using a common area for a purpose other than that for which the area is intended is not protected by the covenant for fitness ....\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 431. I disagree. The statute does not require that the injury occur while the common area is being used as intended. It requires the common area to be fit for the use intended. Thus, if the area is unfit for its intended use, an injured plaintiff may seek recovery for damages regardless of the use that plaintiff was making of the area when the injury occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> The trial court did not inquire into the condition of the common area because it applied improper legal standards. The trial court believed that MCL 554.139(1) did not apply to this case and the open and obvious danger doctrine did apply. Thus, the trial court only needed to know two facts: that plaintiff fell on ice or snow and the ice or snow was open and obvious. Plaintiff attempted to present more facts regarding the condition of the common area at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, but the trial court rebuffed the effort. Inquiry into the condition of the common area was irrelevant to the legal standards applied by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\"> <em>Allison v AEW Capital Mgt, LLP (On Reconsideration), </em>274 Mich App 663, 671; 736 NW2d 307 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
