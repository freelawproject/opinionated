We cure this deficiency and revise that definition to encompass information of an embarrassing, intimate, <em>private, </em>or <em>confidential </em>nature. We conclude that employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers are information of an embarrassing, intimate, private, or confidential nature. Disclosure of this information would constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d in this case primarily because the core purposes of FOIA would not be advanced by its disclosure to plaintiff. With both prongs of the privacy exemption satisfied, we hold that the Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>versity of Michigan employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers are exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendants is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Plaintiff Michigan Federation of Teachers submitted a FOIA request to defendant University of Michigan\u2019s chief FOIA officer, seeking numerous items of information that defendant possessed regarding every University of Michigan employee. The information sought included first and last names, job title, compensation rate, and work address and telephone number. Two additional items of information sought by plaintiff, which are the subject of this appeal, are the employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Defendant timely responded to the FOIA request and provided nearly all the information plaintiff sought. With respect to the home addresses and telephone numbers, defendant released the information of 20,812 employees who had given defendant their permission to publish their home addresses and telephone numbers in the University of Michigan\u2019s faculty and staff directory. Defendant did not turn over the home addresses and telephone numbers of the remaining 16,406 employees who had withheld permission to publish that information in the directory. Thus, defendant denied the FOIA request in part, relying on the privacy exemption and stating that the information\u2019s release would constitute an unwarranted invasion of these employees\u2019 privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Plaintiff filed suit in the Washtenaw Circuit Court, seeking to compel the release of the remaining home addresses and telephone numbers. The parties filed cross-motions for summary disposition. Defendant at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tached to its motion six affidavits from employees who did not want their home addresses and telephone numbers released to the public. Some of the affiants attested that the release of this information would threaten their own or their family\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. It ruled that the employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers were information of a personal nature and that \u201cone would be hard pressed to argue that disclosure \u2018contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court in an unpublished opinion per curiam.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Bradley, </em>the panel held that home addresses and telephone numbers were not \u201cinformation of a personal nature\u201d because they did not reveal intimate or embarrassing details of an individual\u2019s private life, even when considered against the \u201ccustoms, mores, or ordinary views of the community.\u201d It also held that no caselaw supported the proposition that public employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers were items of personal information,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that in those reported cases where home addresses were held to be exempt from disclosure under the privacy exemption, the plaintiffs had sought disclosure of addresses to access other information that was personal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The panel, however, recognized that certain employees might have legitimate reasons to avoid disclosure of their personal information. Relying on <em>Tobin v Civil Service Comm, </em>it ruled that on remand defendant \u201cmay determine whether any of its employees not included in the directory have demonstrated \u2018truly exceptional circumstances\u2019 to prevent disclosure of names, addresses, and telephone numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Judge Wilder concurred with the majority\u2019s decision under <em>Bradley, </em>but raised two points. First, he suggested that <em>Bradley\u2019s </em>reading of the statutory language was inconsistent with its plain meaning and was worthy of reexamination. Second, he questioned whether the advent of the national do-not-call registry<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the rising nationwide problem of identity theft had significantly altered the \u201ccustoms, mores, or ordinary views of the community\u201d concerning the disclosure of personal identifying information since the <em>Bradley </em>Court decided the issue in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Defendant filed an application seeking leave to appeal, which this Court granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">This Court reviews de novo the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court reviews de novo as a question of law issues of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And as we stated in an earlier FOIA case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">[b]ecause our judicial role precludes imposing different policy choices than those selected by the Legislature, our obligation is, by examining the statutory language, to discern the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words expressed in the statute. If the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute reflects the legislative intent and judicial construction is not permitted. We must give the words of a statute their plain and ordinary meaning.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">1. BACKGROUND TO FOIA AND THE PRIVACY EXEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Consistent with the legislatively stated public policy supporting the act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Michigan FOIA requires dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>closure of the \u201cpublic record[s]\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of a \u201cpublic body\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to persons who request to inspect, copy, or receive copies of those requested public records.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, \u00a7 13 of FOIA<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> sets forth a series of exemptions granting the public body the discretion to withhold a public record from disclosure if it falls within one of the exemptions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the event a FOIA request is denied and the requesting party commences a circuit court action to compel disclosure of a public record, the public body bears the burden of sustaining its decision to withhold the requested record from disclosure.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The FOIA exemption at issue in this case is the privacy exemption, MCL 15.243(l)(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">(1) A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">(a) Information of a personal nature if public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">This Court has attempted to construe this provision on many occasions since the enactment of the Michigan FOIA in 1976 and struggled for nearly as many years to reach a consensus regarding its proper interpretation. <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State Univ,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>marked the first occasion that this Court interpreted the privacy exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tion. The plaintiff, for purposes of political mailings, requested a computer tape containing the names and addresses of the university\u2019s students. He sued when Michigan State denied the request. An equally divided Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision that the tape was exempt.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Chief Justice Fitzgerald\u2019s opinion held that the release of the computer tape would violate the privacy exemption. Focusing on the statutory requirement that \u201cthe public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy,\u201d Chief Justice FITZGERALD opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">there has remained throughout this country\u2019s legal history one recognized situs of individual control \u2014 the dwelling place. Without exception, this bastion of privacy has been afforded greater protection against outside assaults than has any other location.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">He reasoned that disclosure of the magnetic tape would constitute an invasion of privacy because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">any intrusion into the home, no matter the purpose or the extent, is definitionally an invasion of privacy. <em>A fortiori, </em>the release of names and addresses constitutes an invasion of privacy, since it serves as a conduit into the sanctuary of the home.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Further, where the student information would be distributed in electronic rather than print form, Chief Justice FITZGERALD argued presciently that this invasion was \u201cclearly unwarranted\u201d because \u201cthe pervasiveness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>of computer technology has resulted in an ever-increasing erosion of personal privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Justice Ryan\u2019s opinion would have ordered the release of the computer tape. Examining the privacy exemption, Justice RYAN argued for a two-part inquiry to analyze MCL 15.243(l)(a). First, the requested information must be \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d Second, if the information is of a personal nature, its disclosure must constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d Justice RYAN argued that the information sought was not \u201cof a personal nature\u201d because he was \u201csatisfied that names, addresses, telephone numbers, and other standard identifying information simply are not embarrassing information \u2018of a personal nature\u2019 for the overwhelming majority of students at Michigan State University.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> He took the view that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">[m]ost citizens voluntarily divulge their names and addresses on such a widespread basis that any alleged privacy interest in the information is either absent or waived. People applying for employment reveal their names and addresses on their resumes; cashing a check or using a credit card requires the release of one\u2019s address; and ordering magazines or otherwise communicating through the mail reveals one\u2019s address. Being a licensed driver, a car owmer, a property owner or taxpayer, an officer of a corporation, an applicant for a marriage license, or a registered voter requires revelation, at a minimum, of one\u2019s name and address, information which is often routinely made available to the public. While some people might <em>prefer </em>that their names and addresses not be known to certain individuals such as advertisers, bill collectors, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>freeloading relatives, that preference is simply not based on the fact that one\u2019s address is a \u201cpersonal\u201d, intimate, or embarrassing piece of information. We leave for another day the question whether, in certain unusual circumstances, ordinarily impersonal information might take on an intensely personal character.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Justice RYAN concluded by arguing that even if the information was \u201cof a personal nature,\u201d its disclosure was not a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of privacy\u201d because the students had ways to avoid unwanted mailings and because \u201cthe public benefits of voter registration and political campaigning contemplated in this case clearly outweigh any minimal invasion of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">After <em>Kestenbaum, </em>this Court decided several cases without being able to provide a majority rule for the proper construction of the privacy exemption. In <em>Tobin v Civil Service Comm,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a \u201creverse\u201d FOIA case,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> this Court unanimously held that FOIA \u201cauthorizes, but does not require, nondisclosure of public records falling within a FOIA exemption.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The plaintiffs challenged the defendants\u2019 decision to release the names and addresses of all classified civil service employees. Even though the parties agreed that the privacy exemption was applicable, this Court declined to consider whether the names and addresses were exempt under FOIA because it rejected the plaintiffs threshold argument that the Michigan FOIA affirmatively prohibited their disclosure. In <em>Int\u2019l Union, United Plant Guard Workers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>of America v Dep\u2019t of State </em>Police,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> another evenly divided Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision ordering the release of reports containing the names and addresses of guards employed by certain security guard agencies.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Two years later, this Court issued another fractured decision in <em>State Employees Ass\u2019n v Dep\u2019t of Mgt &amp; Budget.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Five members of this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, which had ordered disclosure of the home addresses of certain state civil service bargaining units; one member dissented, and another did not participate.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\">In <em>Swickard v Wayne Co Med Examiner,</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court finally reached a majority result and rationale applying the privacy exemption.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In <em>Swickard, </em>the plaintiff sought the autopsy report and toxicology test results of a judge who was found shot to death in his mother\u2019s home. Rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the privacy exemption protected their disclosure, Justice RlLEY\u2019s majority opinion concluded, first, that the records were not \u201cinformation of a personal nature.\u201d To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>define \u201cpersonal,\u201d the majority consulted a dictionary and discovered that it meant \u201c[o]f or pertaining to a particular person; private; one\u2019s own .... Concerning a particular individual and his intimate affairs, interests, or activities; intimate . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The majority also approvingly noted that Justice RYAN, in his <em>Kestenbaum </em>opinion, had defined that statutory phrase as something \u201cpersonal, intimate, or embarrassing.\u201d The majority further reasoned that it would look to the common law and constitutional law to determine if disclosure would violate a privacy right protected under FOIA.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It held that the scope of the privacy exemption would be gauged by reference to \u201cthe customs, mores, or ordinary views of the community ... .\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> After concluding that the deceased judge and his family had no common-law or constitutional right to privacy with respect to the records after his death, the majority concluded that the records were not \u201cinformation of a personal nature\u201d and thus their disclosure was not an invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Univ of Mich Bd of </em>Regents,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the plaintiff newspapers sought travel records created in conjunction with the university\u2019s search for a new president. The university argued that the records were exempt under the privacy exemption. This Court held that this information was not \u201cof a personal nature\u201d because there were no customs, mores, or ordinary views of the community that warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>a finding that the travel expense records of a public body constituted information of a personal nature.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In <em>Bradley, </em>the central case under consideration in the present appeal, this Court decided whether the personnel records of public school teachers and administrators were exempt from disclosure under the privacy exemption. The <em>Bradley </em>Court affirmed that this exemption contains two elements: first, that the information sought is \u201cof a personal nature\u201d and, second, that the disclosure of the information would be a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d With respect to the first element, the majority observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">In the past, we have used two slightly different formulations to describe \u201cpersonal nature.\u201d The first defines \u201cpersonal\u201d as \u201c[o]f or pertaining to a particular person; private; one\u2019s own .... Concerning a particular individual and his intimate affairs, interests, or activities, intimate .... \u201d We have also defined this threshold inquiry in terms of whether the requested information was \u201cpersonal, intimate, or embarrassing.\u201d Combining the salient elements of each description into a more succinct test, we conclude that information is of a personal nature if it reveals intimate or embarrassing details of an individual\u2019s private life. We evaluate this standard in terms of \u201cthe \u2018customs, mores, or ordinary views of the community\u2019 ____\u201d[<footnotemark>40</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Using this new definition, the majority concluded that the personnel records sought in <em>Bradley </em>were not \u201cof a personal nature\u201d because they did not contain any \u201cembarrassing, intimate, private, or confidential\u201d matters.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>Bradley </em>has since served as the template for the first prong of the privacy exemption. This Court decided two cases involving this exemption after <em>Bradley. Mager v Dep\u2019t of State </em>Police<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and <em>Herald Co v Bay City.</em><footnotemark><em>43</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Mager, </em>the plaintiff made a FOIA request for the names and addresses of persons who owned registered handguns. The State Police denied the FOIA request pursuant to the privacy exemption. Relying on the <em>Bradley </em>definition that \u201c \u2018information is of a personal nature if it reveals intimate or embarrassing details of an individual\u2019s private life,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> this Court held in a unanimous per curiam decision that the records fell within this first prong because gun ownership was information of a personal nature as an intimate or perhaps embarrassing detail of one\u2019s personal life.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The <em>Mager </em>Court then moved to the second prong of the test \u2014 whether \u201cdisclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d \u2014 and devised what has since been labeled the \u201ccore purpose test.\u201d <em>Mager </em>took guidance from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Defense v Fed Labor Relations Auth,</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the Court employed a balancing test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>under the federal FOIA\u2019s privacy exemption.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Under that test, \u201c \u2018a court must balance the public interest in disclosure against the interest Congress intended the exemption to protect,\u2019 \u201d and the \u201c \u2018only relevant public interest in disclosure to be weighed in this balance is the extent to which disclosure would serve the core purpose of the FOIA, which is contributing significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> This Court, like the Court in <em>Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>also quoted approvingly the statement that \u201c \u2018disclosure of information about private citizens that is accumulated in various governmental files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency\u2019s own conduct\u2019 \u201d would not advance the core purpose of FOIA.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In addition, this Court noted that, like the United States Supreme Court, it was \u201c \u2018reluctant to disparage the privacy of the home, which is accorded special consideration in our Constitution, laws, and traditions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Applying these principles, the <em>Mager </em>Court concluded that, under any reasonable balancing, disclosure of the gun-ownership information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy because it was entirely unrelated to any inquiry regarding the inner working of government or how well the Department of State Police was fulfilling its statutory functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\">In <em>Herald Co, </em>this Court unanimously held that the defendant, Bay City, violated FOIA when it refused to disclose public records concerning the final candidates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>for the position of Bay City fire chief, in particular the candidates\u2019 names, current job titles, cities of residence, and ages. Citing the <em>Bradley </em>definition, this Court stated the test for \u201cinformation of a personal nature\u201d that \u201c \u2018information is of a personal nature if it reveals <em>intimate or embarrassing details of an individual\u2019s private life. </em>We evaluate this standard in terms of \u201cthe \u2018customs, mores, or ordinary views of the community\u2019. ... \u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> This Court concluded that \u201cthe fact of application for a public job, or the typical background information one may disclose with such an application, is simply not \u2018personal\u2019 within the contemplation of this exemption.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Moreover, this Court held that the community\u2019s mores, customs, and views would not support that this information was of a personal nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Although the records failed to satisfy the first prong of the privacy exemption, this Court went on to discuss why the records would also fail the second prong. Citing the <em>Mager </em>core-purpose test, this Court noted that disclosure of the information concerning the final candidates for fire chief would serve the policy underlying FOIA because it would facilitate the public\u2019s access to information regarding the affairs of their city government. Thus, the invasion of privacy, assuming there was one, was not \u201cclearly unwarranted.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Thus, the privacy exemption, as currently interpreted, has two prongs that the information sought to be withheld from disclosure must satisfy. First, the information must be \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d Second, it must be the case that the public disclosure of that information \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d We analyze whether the home addresses and telephone numbers in this case satisfy both prongs, particularly the tests for both that we articulated in <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Mager.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">2. \u201cINFORMATION OF A PERSONAL NATURE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In answering the first question whether the home addresses and telephone numbers of university employees are \u201cinformation of a personal nature,\u201d we also reconsider whether Bradley's exposition of that phrase fully captures its intended meaning. The concurring judge on the Court of Appeals suggested, and defendant argues, that the <em>Bradley </em>articulation is too narrow.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We hold that the <em>Bradley </em>formulation, as far as it goes, is a correct description of what information is \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d Thus, we continue to hold that \u201cintimate\u201d or \u201cembarrassing\u201d details of an individual are \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d However, a case such as this leads us to conclude that \u201cintimate\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d do not exhaust the intended scope of that statutory phrase. Indeed, the <em>Bradley </em>Court itself noted, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>inadvertently or not, that \u201cinformation of a personal nature\u201d includes more than \u201cintimate\u201d or \u201cembarrassing\u201d details of a person\u2019s life. After articulating its \u201csuccinct test,\u201d the <em>Bradley </em>Court expanded it by concluding that \u201cnone of the documents [sought in that case] contain information of an embarrassing, intimate, <em>private, </em>or <em>confidential </em>nature.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> After careful consideration, we conclude that the observation from <em>Bradley </em>that intimate, embarrassing, private, <em>or </em>confidential information is \u201cof a personal nature\u201d more accurately and fully describes the intended scope of the statutory text as assessed in the first prong of the privacy exemption. Indeed, the words \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d are largely synonymous.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Thus, private or confidential information relating to a person, in addition to embarrassing or intimate details, is \u201cinformation of a personal nature.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">With the test thus clarified, the next question is whether employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers reveal embarrassing, intimate, private, or confidential details about those individuals. We hold that they do. Where a person lives and how that person may be contacted fits squarely within the plain meaning of this definition because that information offers private and even confidential details about that person\u2019s life. As Chief Justice FITZGERALD noted in <em>Kestenbaum, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201cthe release of names and addresses constitutes an invasion of privacy, since it serves as a conduit into the sanctuary of the home.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The potential abuses of an individual\u2019s identifying information, including his home address and telephone number, are legion. For example, some of the affiants in this case attested that they do not want their information added to mass mailings, perhaps seeking to avoid the inevitable harassing telephone calls of telemarketers or deluge of junk mail. On a more serious level, other affiants stated that their physical safety or the safety of their families would be jeopardized if their identifying information fell into the wrong hands, such as those of an ex-spouse or a disgruntled patient. These realistic concerns illustrate in practical ways why an individual\u2019s home address and telephone number are \u201cinformation of a personal nature.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>And, although the federal FOIA privacy exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>contains language different from Michigan\u2019s FOIA privacy exemption, the United State Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of that provision is useful to our analysis.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In <em>Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>the Court unanimously rejected a union\u2019s federal FOIA request seeking the home addresses of federal civil service employees. Addressing the employees\u2019 interest in the nondisclosure of their home addresses, it opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">It is trae that home addresses often are publicly available through sources such as telephone directories and voter registration lists, but \u201c[i]n an organized society, there are few facts that are not at one time or another divulged to another.\u201d The privacy interest protected by [the federal exemption] \u201cencompass[es] the individual\u2019s control of information concerning his or her person.\u201d An individual\u2019s interest in controlling the dissemination of information regarding personal matters does not dissolve simply because that information may be available to the public in some form.[<footnotemark>61</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The Court astutely recognized that an individual\u2019s control over his identifying information is essential where the information regards such personal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">An individual\u2019s home address and telephone number might be listed in the telephone book or available on an Internet website, but he might nevertheless understandably refuse to disclose this information, when asked, to a stranger, a co-worker, or even an acquaintance. The disclosure of information of a personal nature into the public sphere in certain instances does not automatically remove the protection of the privacy exemption and subject the information to disclosure in every other circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Finally, while it is not critical to our holding that home addresses and telephone numbers are \u201cinformation of a personal nature,\u201d the fact that in this case certain university employees actively asserted control over their identifying information by <em>withholding </em>their home addresses and telephone numbers from publication in the university faculty and staff directoxy undoubtedly lends credence to that conclusion.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Particularly in this case, then, the argument that this information is not \u201cof a personal nature\u201d reaches its nadir.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>3. \u201cPUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION WOULD CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY UNWARRANTED INVASION OF AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S PRIVACY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Having reached this conclusion, we must move to the second prong of the privacy exemption and determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>whether disclosure of the information at issue would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy. We conclude, under <em>Mager\u2019s </em>core-purpose test, that it would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. Simply put, disclosure of employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers to plaintiff would reveal \u201c \u2018little or nothing\u2019 \u201d about a governmental agency\u2019s conduct,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> nor would it further the stated public policy undergirding the Michigan FOIA.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Disclosure of employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers would not shed light on whether the University of Michigan and its officials are satisfactorily fulfilling their statutory and constitutional obligations and their duties to the public. When this tenuous interest in disclosure is weighed against the invasion of privacy that would result from the disclosure of employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers, the invasion of privacy would be \u201cclearly unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">We hold that information is \u201cof a personal nature\u201d if it constitutes intimate, embarrassing, private, or confidential details about an individual. In this case, employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers are information \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d Moving to the second prong of the privacy exemption, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>disclosure of employees\u2019 home addresses and telephone numbers does not further a core purpose of FOIA by shedding light on whether the University of Michigan is functioning properly and consistently with its statutory and constitutional mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant summary disposition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-5\">Taylor, C.J., and Cavanagh, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\"> MCL 15.243(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\"> 455 Mich 285; 565 NW2d 650 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> <em>Michigan Federation of Teachers &amp; School Related Personnel, AFT, AFL-CIO v Univ of Michigan, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 22, 2007 (Docket No. 258666).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\"> <em>Michigan Federation, supra </em>at 3, citing <em>Tobin v Civil Service Comm, </em>416 Mich 661, 671; 331 NW2d 184 (1982), and <em>State Employees Ass\u2019n v Dep\u2019t of Mgt &amp; Budget, </em>428 Mich 104, 124; 404 NW2d 606 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\"> <em>Michigan Federation, supra </em>at 3, citing <em>Mager v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>460 Mich 134; 595 NW2d 142 (1999); <em>Detroit Free Press, Inc v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>243 Mich App 218; 622 NW2d 313 (2000); <em>Clerical-Technical </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>Union of Michigan State Univ v Michigan State Univ Bd of Trustees, </em>190 Mich App 300; 475 NW2d 373 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\"> PL 108-82, \u00a7 1, 117 Stat 1006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> 480 Mich 902 (2007).

Plaintiff contends that the express exemption of this identifying information in the law-enforcement exemption suggests that the Legislature intended the disclosure of identifying information of other public employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Plaintiffs reliance on <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>is misplaced. It overlooks the fact that each FOIA exemption, by its plain language, advances a separate legislative policy choice. We do not necessarily infer from the express exemption of law-enforcement-related identifying information in one FOIA exemption that the Legislature intended to make the remaining FOIA exemptions unavailable to exempt identifying information of non-law-enforcement public employees. The different policies underlying these exemptions manifest themselves in differently worded standards for disclosure. The Legislature defined the scope of the privacy exemption generally and did not articulate each and every instance where information would be \u201cof a personal nature\u201d and when its disclosure \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d By contrast, the Legislature specifically targeted the law-enforcement exemption to exempt from disclosure specific public records originating from law-enforcement agencies \u201c[u]nless the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in nondisclosure in the particular instance.\u201d Simply because the Legislature saw fit to enact a specific provision to protect law-enforcement-related information from disclosure, it does not follow that non-law-enforcement-related identifying information <em>can never </em>be exempt.

The majority decides that it does. I agree that the unlisted<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> home addresses and telephone numbers of employees who refused to give the university permission to publish that information are exempt from disclosure. But I believe that information that individuals allowed to be published is not exempt. Thus, I dissent from the majority opinion insofar as it holds that the home addresses and telephone numbers of <em>all </em>the defendant\u2019s employees are exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Plaintiff Michigan Federation of Teachers and School Related Personnel, AFT, AFL-CIO made a FOIA request to defendant University of Michigan. Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>sought numerous items, including the home address and telephone number of each of defendant\u2019s employees. Defendant provided all requested information except for the addresses and telephone numbers of those employees who had withheld permission to have this information published in the faculty and staff directory. Defendant claimed that the information was exempt from disclosure under the privacy exemption to FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Plaintiff brought suit in Washtenaw Circuit Court seeking disclosure of this information. Both parties moved for summary disposition. In support of its motion, defendant included affidavits from six employees detailing their reasons for withholding consent. The reasons were wide-ranging. One employee was concerned that an ex-spouse could use the information to locate and hurt her. Another simply believed it would be unfair to disclose unlisted addresses and telephone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The circuit court granted summary disposition to defendant. It reasoned that the home addresses and telephone numbers of employees who had refused to give permission to publish that information was information of a personal nature. The court added that disclosure of this information would not contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In an unpublished opinion per curiam, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The privacy exemption does not generally include home addresses and telephone numbers, it reasoned, because they do not reveal intimate or embarrassing details of an individual\u2019s private life. However, the majority also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>held that defendant had persuasively argued that some employees could be exposed to harm if this information were disclosed. Accordingly, it remanded the case to the trial court to consider which of defendant\u2019s employees had demonstrated exceptional circumstances sufficient to exempt their addresses and telephone numbers from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal to \u201creconsider its construction of [the privacy exemption].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">THE PRIVACY EXEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The privacy exemption to FOIA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">(1) A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">(a) Information of a personal nature if public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">For years this Court has struggled to give meaning to this statutory provision. The Court arrived at its most recent interpretation in <em>Bradley v Saranac Community Schools Bd of Ed.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\">The privacy exemption consists of two elements, both of which must be present for the exemption to apply. First, the information must be of a \u201cpersonal nature.\u201d Second, the disclosure of such information must be a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d In the past, we have used two slightly different formulations to describe \u201cpersonal nature.\u201d The first defines \u201cpersonal\u201d as \u201cof or per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tabling to a particular person; private; one\u2019s own.... Concerning a particular individual and his intimate affairs, interests, or activities; intimate ....\u201d We have also defined this threshold inquiry in terms of whether the requested information was \u201cpersonal, intimate, or embarrassing.\u201d Combining the salient elements of each description into a more succinct test, we conclude that information is of a personal nature if it reveals intimate or embarrassing details of an individual\u2019s private life. We evaluate this standard in terms of \u201cthe \u2018customs, mores, or ordinary views of the community.\u2019 \u201d[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Defendant asks us to overrule Bradley\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cof a personal nature,\u201d arguing that <em>Bradley </em>incorrectly interpreted the statutory language. The majority partly accepts the invitation, holding that the <em>Bradley </em>formulation of the phrase is overly narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">INFORMATION \u201cOF A PERSONAL NATURE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">I did not join the majority opinion in <em>Bradley. </em>Instead, I joined Justice Boyle\u2019s partial dissent. Justice BOYLE took issue with the majority\u2019s constricted interpretation of the phrase \u201cof a personal nature,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> preferring the definitions arrived at in <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State </em>Univ<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <em>Swickard v Wayne Co Med Examiner.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Kestenbaum, </em>Justice RYAN concluded that information is of a personal nature if it is \u201c \u2018personal,\u2019 intimate, or embarrassing.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Swickard </em>defined the phrase \u201cof a personal nature\u201d as \u201c \u2018[o]f or pertaining to a particular person; private; one\u2019s own ....

When one combines the definitions in <em>Kestenbaum </em>and <em>Swickard, </em>information is \u201cof a personal nature\u201d if it reveals private, intimate, or embarrassing information about a particular person. The majority holds that \u201cintimate, embarrassing, private, or confidential information is \u2018of a personal nature . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s interpretation of the privacy exemption is consistent with my position in <em>Bradley, </em>and I agree with it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">But <em>Bradley, </em>being precedent of this Court, should be followed unless weighty reasons exist for abandoning it. As the United States Supreme Court recently recognized, \u201cconsiderations [of stare decisis] impose a considerable burden upon those who would seek a different interpretation that would necessarily unsettle. . . Court precedents.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I am confident that substantial reasons exist for expanding <em>Bradley\u2019s </em>interpretation of the privacy exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>Bradley </em>was decided 10 years ago. Since that time, society has come to recognize that identity fraud poses a major problem.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because of it, individuals are encouraged not to make public their personal information for fear it could be used to victimize them.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And individuals have taken notice of this trend and are now more vigilant in protecting their personal information.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Accordingly, it appears that, since <em>Bradley </em>was decided, increasing incidents of identity fraud have caused a change in behavior. When the facts underlying a court decision drastically change and render the decision outdated, a reexamination of the decision is required.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The changes that have occurred since <em>Bradley </em>was decided illustrate that individuals have an interest in preventing the disclosure of more than intimate or embarrassing information. They reasonably wish to prevent the disclosure of other information they keep private. These changes in fact make it appropriate for us to overrule <em>Bradley </em>to the extent it holds that private information is not \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">As a consequence, I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to expand Bradley\u2019s interpretation of the privacy exemption. But I part company from the majority in its application of the new interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">APPLICATION OF THE NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIVACY EXEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">I differ in two respects with the majority\u2019s application of the law to the facts of this case. First, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>has already given plaintiff the home addresses and telephone numbers of those employees who consented to the publication of that information in the faculty and staff directory. Thus, to resolve this case, the majority need not decide whether the home addresses and telephone numbers of <em>all </em>of defendant\u2019s employees constitute information \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d It need only decide whether the home addresses and telephone numbers of employees who refused to allow publication of this information in the school directory are exempt from disclosure. The majority overreaches by unnecessarily deciding the case on a broader basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Second, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision insofar as it holds that the home addresses and telephone numbers of <em>all </em>defendant\u2019s employees are exempt. Merely because some of defendant\u2019s employees keep their addresses and telephone numbers private does not mean that the addresses and telephone numbers of <em>all </em>the employees is information \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Employees whose addresses and home telephone numbers are unlisted and who refused to allow defendant to publish them in the school directory have done everything possible to keep that information private. And, by taking action to protect their addresses and telephone numbers from mass dissemination, these individuals have indicated that they consider the information private. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the home addresses and telephone numbers of those employees is information \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Under the privacy exemption, information that is \u201cof a personal nature\u201d is exempt if disclosure of it would constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The disclosure of the addresses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>telephone numbers of employees who have made efforts to keep this information private would constitute an unwarranted invasion of their privacy. Therefore, I would hold that this information is exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">But it does not follow that the home addresses and telephone numbers of all defendant\u2019s employees is information \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Employees who either have a listed telephone number or who have given defendant permission to publish their information have released their information for mass viewing. By so doing, they have allowed the information to become public.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Individuals who have allowed their information to be made public cannot be heard to argue that the information is private. It is illogical to decide that information pertaining to an individual is private information if the individual himself or herself does not treat it that way. Therefore, the home addresses and telephone numbers of those employees who either have a listed telephone number or who have allowed defendant to publish their information is generally not \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d If information is not \u201cof a personal nature,\u201d the privacy exemption does not apply to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Of course, public information could be \u201cof a personal nature\u201d if disclosure of it reveals something intimate or embarrassing about an individual. For instance, in <em>Mager v Dep\u2019t of State </em>Police,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the plaintiff requested the addresses of persons who owned registered handguns. The information sought in <em>Mager </em>is an example of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>information that is \u201cof a personal nature\u201d regardless of whether the individual allows it to be made publicly available. Disclosing that information would reveal something intimate about the individual: that he or she owns a handgun. The information requested in the case on appeal would reveal that the employee works for defendant, not an intimate or embarrassing fact. Thus, I would hold that defendant must turn over the home addresses and telephone numbers of employees who have not taken steps to keep that information private.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">I agree with the decision to expand Bradley\u2019s interpretation of the privacy exemption to provide that private information is \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d But unlike the majority, I do not believe that the home addresses and telephone numbers of <em>all </em>defendant\u2019s employees come within the terms of the privacy exemption. I would hold that the home addresses and telephone numbers of employees whose telephone numbers are unlisted and who have not allowed defendant to publish this information are exempt from disclosure. But defendant must disclose the home addresses and telephone numbers of its other employees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-6\">WEAVER, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\"> MCL 15.243(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-10\"> MCL 15.231 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b771-11\"> When I use the term \u201cunlisted\u201d in this opinion, I am referring to information that is not published in the public telephone directory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\"> <em>Michigan Federation of Teachers &amp; School Related Personnel, AFT, AFL-CIO v Univ of Michigan, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 22, 2007 (Docket No. 258666).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\"> 480 Mich 902 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b773-12\"> MCL 15.243(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b773-13\"> <em>Bradley v Saranac Community Schools Bd of Ed, </em>455 Mich 285; 565 NW2d 650 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b774-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 294.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b774-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 306-307 (Boyle, J., dissenting in part).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b774-11\"> <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State </em>Univ; 414 Mich 510; 327 NW2d 783 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b774-12\"> <em>Swickard v Wayne Co Med Examiner; </em>438 Mich 536; 475 NW2d 304 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b774-13\"> <em>Kestenbaum, </em>414 Mich at 547 (opinion of Ryan, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\"> <em>Swickard, </em>438 Mich at 547, quoting <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Second College Edition </em>(1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\"> <em>Ante </em>at 676 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\"> The majority\u2019s interpretation differs from those of <em>Kestenbaum </em>and <em>Swickard </em>in that neither case defined the phrase \u201cof a personal nature\u201d to include confidential information.
