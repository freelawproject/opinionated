Therefore, in this particular case, Berrien County\u2019s outdoor shooting ranges do not have priority over the township ordinances that plaintiffs rely on because they are land uses that are not indispensable to the normal use of the county building. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">This case involves a piece of property that is located in Berrien County and Coloma Township. The property consists of a 14-acre parcel of land. The property is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>controlled by defendant, Berrien County, under a 20-year lease from a party that is unrelated to this case. The county entered into the lease in March 2005. The county leased the property with the intention of using it for a firearms training facility, which various law enforcement agencies would use for training exercises. Accordingly, in May 2005, the county contracted with DLZ Michigan, Inc., to design a master plan and conduct a feasibility study for the proposed facility. This master plan included constructing a building of more than 3,000 square feet at the center of the parcel to serve as a training and support building. This building would have a parking lot with 24 standard parking spaces (and three handicapped spaces), multiple outdoor light poles, and a driveway. The facility would also have numerous outdoor shooting ranges. The ranges were to be set up like the spokes of a wheel that require the shooter to fire out from the center of the parcel. The center of the parcel is where the building would be located. See aerial photograph <em>infra </em>at note 4. The county initially planned on building the ranges first and erecting the building later.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the course of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>litigation, construction of both the shooting ranges and the building was started and is now completed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Operation of the county\u2019s shooting ranges would contravene several local ordinances. First, under the township\u2019s zoning ordinance, the shooting ranges are not a permitted land use given the property\u2019s current zoning status (primary agricultural). Additionally, gun clubs are not permitted in this zoning status unless the Coloma Charter Township Board has issued a special land use permit, which the county has not received. Finally, the gun ranges produce noise levels that purportedly exceed the township\u2019s anti-noise ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The shooting range facility has been the topic of a hotly contested public debate. Its supporters note that it provides an invaluable public service by simulating real-life conditions that law enforcement officers encounter in the field, preparing them to better serve the citizenry. Further, the supporters argue that indoor shooting ranges are simply inadequate to properly mimic field conditions. Opponents of the shooting ranges raised myriad concerns relating to the proximity of the ranges to other civilian land uses:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">(1) Annually, 221,000 rounds will be fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">(2) Automatic guns, semi-automatic guns, handguns, shotguns, and rifles are used. One type of gun used, the .308 caliber rifle, can fire a bullet 2.4 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">(3) The ranges all point outward from the property\u2019s center, toward the surrounding privately owned parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">(4) There are children\u2019s sports fields within one mile of the ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">(5) The ranges are within 2.4 miles of the Coloma schools and within one mile of over 50 homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">(6) Seasonally, up to 200 farm workers and their children are within range of the .308 rifle, and four migrant-worker residences are within 1,500 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">(7) The sheriff estimates that 25 percent of the training events will be conducted after dark.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">(8) Property values within one mile of the range are estimated to have declined by an aggregate of $2.5 million; real estate agents report difficulty selling homes in close proximity to the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Apparently having been persuaded by the local residents\u2019 concerns, in October 2005, the Coloma Charter Township Board voted unanimously not to support the facility. However, in November 2005, the county approved the facility, and construction on it proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Plaintiffs are a group of individuals who own property-located in close proximity to the shooting ranges. In late November 2005, plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action that aimed to stop operation of the facility. The complaint alleged that the county\u2019s facility was prohibited by the township\u2019s zoning ordinance; and the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint additionally alleged that the facility violated the township\u2019s anti-noise ordinance. After various circuit court proceedings, the parties filed cross-motions for summary disposition. The trial court, relying on <em>Pittsfield, supra, </em>simultaneously granted the county\u2019s motion for summary disposition and denied plaintiffs\u2019 dispositive motion. Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in a published, split decision. <em>Herman v Berrien Co, </em>275 Mich App 382; 739 NW2d 635 (2007). The Court of Appeals majority also relied on <em>Pittsfield, </em>holding that the county is exempt from the township\u2019s regulations because they conflict with its express legislative authorization to site county buildings, which includes the county\u2019s shooting ranges. <em>Id. </em>at 384, 388-389. We granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal. <em>Herman v Berrien Co, </em>480 Mich 961 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The case involves interpretation of the CCA. \u201cQuestions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which will be reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 413; 596 NW2d 164 (1999); see also <em>Cardinal Mooney High School v Michigan High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>437 Mich 75, 80; 467 NW2d 21 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We are again called on to analyze a purported conflict between the powers given to intermediate government entities and the powers given to local government entities. Specifically, this case involves the relationship between a county\u2019s power, under the CCA, to site county buildings and the powers given to local governments under the TZA and the Township Ordinance Act, MCL 41.181 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">While this particular case includes novel nuances, the broad question is one that we have previously encountered. In <em>Dearden v Detroit, </em>403 Mich 257; 269 NW2d 139 (1978), we analyzed a conflict between the Michigan Department of Corrections, in its attempts to use a building as a criminal rehabilitation center, and the city of Detroit\u2019s zoning ordinance, which precluded such land use. At that time, we acknowledged that \u201c[n]o Michigan case has resolved, with finality, the question of whether our state or its agencies are inherently immune from local zoning ordinances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262. Yet, we held that \u201cthe legislative intent, where it can be discerned, is the test for determining whether a governmental unit is immune from the provisions of local zoning ordinances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The holding in <em>Dearden </em>continues to be the appropriate test for these particular conflict cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In <em>Northville Charter Twp v Northville Pub Schools, </em>469 Mich 285; 666 NW2d 213 (2003), we examined whether the authority of the state superintendent of public instruction to control site plans of schools under the Revised School Code (RSC)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had priority over the restrictions of a local zoning ordinance. Relying on the rule in <em>Dearden, </em>we held that the state superintendent\u2019s decision to build and operate a school was immune from the local zoning regulations because the Legislature evinced its intent to give the superintendent such priority by stating that the superintendent had \u201c \u2018sole and exclusive jurisdiction over . . . site plans for those school buildings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northville, supra </em>at 290, 295, quoting MCL 380.1263(3)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (emphasis omitted). The opinion also pointed out that the Legislature need not use the exact phrase \u201csole and exclusive jurisdiction\u201d to bestow priority; but, when that phrase is used, it signifies a grant of priority. <em>Id. </em>at 291-292. In <em>North-ville, </em>we also wrestled with the scope of priority in defining the RSC\u2019s phrase \u201csite plan.\u201d The plurality opinion held that the phrase extended the priority of the superintendent\u2019s power in locating and operating schools to \u201ceverything on the property, i.e., the entire project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>Dearden </em>and <em>Northville </em>make it clear that whenever the legal question of priority is presented, it must be resolved by thorough analysis of the statute that purportedly gives the government entity priority over local regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case, that statute that potentially gives the county priority over the township\u2019s ordinances is the CCA. Thus, following <em>Dearden </em>and Northville, we must analyze the CCA to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent regarding any priority that that act may give to counties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The CCA states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">A county board of commissioners, at a lawfully held meeting, may do 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(a) Purchase or lease for a term not to exceed 20 years, real estate necessary for the site of a courthouse, jail, clerk\u2019s office, or other county building in that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">(b) Determine the site of, remove, or designate a new site for a county building. The exercise of the authority granted by this subdivision is subject to any requirement of law that the building be located at the county seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">(d) Erect the necessary buildings for jails, clerks\u2019 offices, and other county buildings, and prescribe the time and manner of erecting them. [MCL 46.11.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">This is not the first time we have conducted a priority analysis of the CCA. Indeed, we first applied <em>Dearden\u2019s </em>rule to the CCA in <em>Pittsfield, </em>a case in which a township wanted to stop Washtenaw County from constructing a homeless shelter because the shelter violated the township\u2019s zoning ordinance. We held that under the CCA, the county\u2019s authority to site and erect county buildings superseded the township\u2019s authority under its zoning ordinance. <em>Pittsfield, supra </em>at 710-712. We reasoned that if a county were required to follow local use regulations, the CCA\u2019s grant of power to site and erect county buildings would be effectively \u201csurplusage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713-714. Thus, since <em>Pittsfield, </em>it has become accepted that the CCA gives counties priority over local regulations that inhibit a county\u2019s power to site and erect county buildings under the CCA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>In this case, we are not asked to disturb <em>Pittsfield\u2019s </em>holding; both parties and both lower courts accept <em>Pittsfield </em>as controlling. Yet, <em>Pittsfield </em>does not answer the question presented here because that case did not examine the scope of priority that the CCA gives counties. That scope question is the pivotal issue in this case. In other words, while there is no dispute in this case regarding whether the CCA gives the county priority to site and erect county buildings, there is a dispute regarding whether that priority extends to the county\u2019s land uses \u2014 the shooting ranges \u2014 that are ancillary to its buildings. In that regard, the Court of Appeals majority correctly noted that the true issue is the definition of the GCA\u2019s term \u201csite.\u201d Indeed, it is this definitional analysis that will answer the true question in this case: When a county erects a building pursuant to its authority under the CCA, what land uses, if any, are encompassed in the definition of \u201csite\u201d such that they also have priority over local regulations? Thus, as that question applies to this case, if building the outdoor shooting ranges is included in the county\u2019s power to \u201csite\u201d buildings, those land uses will have priority over the township\u2019s ordinance; whereas, if they are not included in the definition of \u201csite,\u201d they will not have priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On that issue, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">\u201cSite\u201d is not defined in the statute, so resorting to a dictionary is necessary to determine the ordinary meaning of the word. <em>Northville [supra at </em>292]. In <em>Northville </em>... the Supreme Court looked to the dictionary to define \u201csite\u201d when determining the meaning of \u201csite plan\u201d under the [RSC]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u201cThis leaves to be determined the definition of \u2018site plan.\u2019 The dictionary defines \u2018site\u2019 as \u2018The place where something was, is, or is to be located,\u2019 <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1982), or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>similarly, \u2018[T]he area or exact plot of ground on which anything is, has been, or is to be <em>located...' Random, House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). <em>[Id.]\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">Using these same definitions, it is clear that when designating a new \u201csite\u201d for county buildings, the \u201csite\u201d includes the entire area of ground on which the building is to be located. In other words, it is the \u201csite\u201d or, in real terms, the entire parcel where the buildings will be located, that is not subject to local regulation. Hence, the uses on the site of the building are not subject to the township\u2019s ordinances. <em>Pittsfield Twp, supra </em>at 711. <em>[Herman, supra, </em>275 Mich App at 386-387.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The Court of Appeals used this analysis to hold that the county\u2019s shooting ranges had priority over the township\u2019s ordinances. We disagree with this conclusion and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Initially, we note that the definition of \u201csite\u201d from <em>Northville </em>is not controlling because it derives from a different priority-giving statute. <em>Northville </em>involved the RSC, while the present case involves the CCA. In comparing these two statutes, it is clear that they serve different purposes and, accordingly, bestow different powers on their respective government entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The RSC gives the superintendent \u201csole and exclusive jurisdiction over the review and approval of plans and specifications for the construction, reconstruction, or remodeling of school buildings used for instructional or noninstructional school purposes and... of <em>site plans </em>for those school buildings.\u201d MCL 380.1263(3) (emphasis added). Hence, the RSC gives the superintendent unlimited authority over the entire site plan of school buildings. Also notably, the RSC defines one such building very broadly: \u201c[a]s used in this section: \u2018High school building\u2019 means any structure or facility that is used for instructional purposes, that offers at least 1 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>grades 9 to 12, and that includes an athletic field or facility.\u201d MCL 380.1263(8)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In contrast, the CCA gives counties the power to \u201c[determine the site of, remove, or designate a new site for a <em>county building,\u201d </em>and to \u201c[e]rect the necessary <em>buildings </em>for jails, clerks\u2019 offices, and other <em>county </em>buildings....\u201d MCL 46.11(b) and (d) (emphasis added). Thus, a county\u2019s power under the CCA is limited to the siting of county buildings, which does not equate to the power to review and approve site plans. Further, that power is limited because it does not apply when that particular county building is required by law to \u201cbe located at the county seat.\u201d MCL 46.11(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In sum, the RSC gives nearly unlimited power (\u201csole and exclusive\u201d) regarding entire site plans of schools, whereas the CCA gives a power that is limited in certain circumstances and only applies to siting county buildings. Accordingly, the CCA\u2019s limited term \u201csite\u201d does not carry the same meaning as the RSC\u2019s expansive phrase \u201csite plan.\u201d Thus, the Court of Appeals incorrectly relied on <em>Northville, </em>which dealt with the RSC, to equate \u201csite plan\u201d with \u201csite\u201d as used in the CCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">However, simply noting that <em>Northville </em>does not adequately define \u201csite\u201d under the CCA does not complete our analysis. We must still give meaning to that term by adopting a test that determines whether and which land uses are encompassed in its definition. On that score, the County proffers that \u201csite\u201d applies to any use of land that is reasonably connected to the county building thereon. Plaintiffs do not suggest an alternative test. Instead they rely on the CCA\u2019s limited grant of authority to site buildings, which, it argues, omits the power to site ancillary land uses. Neither party is wholly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>In this analysis, we are mindful of <em>Dearden\u2019s </em>overarching maxim: \u201clegislative intent, where it can be discerned, is the test for determining whether a governmental unit is immune from the provisions of local zoning ordinances.\u201d <em>Dearden, supra </em>at 264. We also note that, in statutory interpretation, if the language of the statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995). Also, \u201c[a]s far as possible, effect should be given to every phrase, clause, and word in the statute. The statutory-language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (internal citations omitted). Finally, in defining particular words in statutes, we must \u201cconsider both the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Bailey v United States, </em>516 US 137, 145; 116 S Ct 501; 133 L Ed 2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The CCA is an unambiguous statute. In pertinent part, it gives counties the power to \u201c[djetermine the site of, remove, or designate a new site for a county building\u201d and to \u201c[ejrect the necessary buildings for jails, clerks\u2019 offices, and other county buildings ....\u201d MCL 46.11(b) and (d). A plain reading of this language leads to the conclusion that the Legislature intended to give counties the power to \u201csite\u201d and \u201cerect\u201d \u201ccounty buildings.\u201d Each time the CCA grants the power to site, it invariably relates that power to \u201cbuildings.\u201d Notably, the Legislature never semantically links the power to site with any nonbuilding activity or land use. In other words, the CCA does not give counties the power to site a county \u201cactivity\u201d or county \u201cland use\u201d; rather, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>always relates its grant of siting power to \u201cbuildings.\u201d This leads to the conclusion that the siting power is limited to buildings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This conclusion is supported by the contextually derived purpose of the CCA. The CCA was expressly promulgated \u201cto define the powers and duties of the county boards of commissioners....\u201d Title of 1851 PA 156, as amended by 1978 PA 51. Accordingly, in \u00a7 11, the act clearly and descriptively articulates the numerous powers it gives to counties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The power to site county activities or land uses is conspicuously absent from that list.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Also, the CCA\u2019s continued use of the term \u201cbuilding(s)\u201d must have significance. That term would be rendered nugatory if the CCA\u2019s power to \u201csite\u201d was meant to extend to other county acts, such as siting land uses, because those other acts are never listed in the CCA. In essence, if those unlisted acts were actually included in the power to site buildings, then the CCA\u2019s express inclusion of the power to site buildings would be superfluous. This cannot be.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, the CCA\u2019s continued use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>term \u201cbuilding(s)\u201d must place significant limitations on the meaning of the act\u2019s term \u201csite\u201d by omitting the power to do other acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">However, we are mindful that the power to site a building is worthless if the entity that sites the building cannot make normal use of the building. Just as <em>Pitts-field </em>recognized that the power to site a building would be \u201cmere surplusage\u201d if the siting entity had to comply with zoning ordinances, <em>Pittsfield, supra </em>at 713, we too acknowledge that the power to site a building would be meaningless if the siting entity could not conduct ancillary land uses in order to make normal use of the building. For instance, the normal use of most county buildings would require sidewalks, parking lots, and light poles. Thus, while defining the power to \u201csite\u201d as being limited to buildings, we simultaneously accept that some ancillary land uses must be included in the county\u2019s siting power.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Next, we must articulate a standard to test whether a particular ancillary land use is encompassed in the use of the building such that it is given priority under the CCA. To answer that question, a court must ask whether the ancillary land use is indispensable to the building\u2019s normal use. \u201cThe TZA vests townships with broad authority to enact zoning ordinances to regulate land development and to \u2018insure that the use of land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships ....\u2019\u201d <em>Pittsfield, supra </em>at 707-708, quoting MCL 125.271(1). As stated, the priority given to the county in MCL 46.11(b) and (d) is significantly limited to siting a building. Because the county\u2019s authority is limited, the encroachment on a township\u2019s broad authority must be limited to that needed to effect the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 11(b) and (d). Thus, we hold that the scope of the CCA\u2019s priority over the TZA is limited to ancillary land uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that are indispensable to the building\u2019s normal use. Accordingly, the ancillary land use will only have priority over local regulations if it is indispensable to the building\u2019s normal use.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This standard will invariably require a case-by-case analysis in future applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Turning to the present case, the ancillary land use in question is the outdoor shooting ranges on the county\u2019s leased property. Using the \u201cindispensable\u201d test, we must decide if that ancillary land use has priority over the township\u2019s zoning and anti-noise ordinances. In order to decide if this ancillary land use is indispensable to the normal use of the county\u2019s building, we must define the normal use of the county\u2019s building. The county\u2019s building is located in a complex that is called the \u201cBerrien County Sheriffs Department Firearms Training Facility.\u201d The county\u2019s feasibility study for the facility describes the purpose of the building as being \u201cfor training and support.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the building\u2019s nor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>mal use is for firearms training and support. More specifically, the building\u2019s normal use is for conducting classroom firearms training. While it may be true that this normal use works in concert with, or aids, the broader purpose of total firearms training, which includes using outdoor shooting ranges, the normal use of the building is to conduct classroom (or <em>indoor) </em>training, which is different from the outdoor firearms training that occurs in the shooting ranges. This distinction is of great import when recalling that the CCA\u2019s grant of power hinges on siting and erecting \u201cbuildings.\u201d In other words, a county may not expand a building\u2019s normal use simply because that building\u2019s use aids or complements another distinct use. For purposes of CCA priority, a building\u2019s normal use only extends to the actual uses of that particular building because, again, that is the extent of the power granted to the county by the CCA. Therefore, despite the county\u2019s use of the building to support the broad arena of firearms training, which conceivably includes the outdoor shooting ranges, the building\u2019s normal use is limited to conducting indoor \u201ctraining and support.\u201d In other words, the normal use of the outdoor shooting ranges is for outdoor shooting practice and training, while the normal use of the building is for indoor classroom training and practice, despite both uses falling under the broad category of firearms training.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Accordingly, the final question is whether the outdoor shooting ranges are indispensable for the building\u2019s indoor training and support. We hold that they are not indispensable because the indoor training and sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>port can be conducted without the outdoor shooting ranges being located next to the building. Therefore, under the CCA, the shooting ranges are not given priority over the township\u2019s ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The county\u2019s shooting ranges do not have priority over the township\u2019s ordinances because those local regulations do not conflict with the county\u2019s powers under the CCA; as they apply to the shooting ranges, the regulations do not stop the county from exercising its limited power to site buildings. However, the county building, its parking lot, its driveway, and its lighting poles do have priority over the local regulations because they are indispensable to the normal use of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

However, we find <em>Burt </em>distinguishable from the instant \u201cpriority\u201d analysis for several reasons. First, <em>Burt </em>is only helpful regarding the general precepts of the priority analysis because it was applying a different power-granting statute, and it did not expand on the general guidance <em>Dearden </em>had already given. Second, any general aid to the priority analysis that <em>Burt </em>may have given is inapplicable because, since <em>Burt, Pittsfield </em>has decided the instant priority question of the CCA versus local regulations.
