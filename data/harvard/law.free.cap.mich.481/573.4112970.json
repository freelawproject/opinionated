We hold that it does apply and that a UFTA claim is not an impermissible collateral attack on a divorce judgment. However, property owned as tenants by the entirety is not subject to process by a creditor holding a claim against only one spouse. Such property is not an \u201casset\u201d under the UFTA. Therefore, its distribution in a divorce judgment does not constitute a \u201ctransfer\u201d for purposes of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Because the trial court refused to apply the UFTA in this case, it never addressed whether plaintiff stated a valid cause of action against Julie Swabash under the act. Thus, the question whether plaintiff raised issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>of material fact concerning Jeff Titus\u2019s actual intent to defraud her was not properly before the Court of Appeals. Hence, we vacate the portion of the Court of Appeals judgment that discusses the factual sufficiency of plaintiffs claim of a transfer made with an actual intent to defraud. We affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The relevant facts of this case are as follows. On September 23, 2002, plaintiff Jan Estes filed a wrongfiil death action against defendant Jeff Titus, the incarcerated murderer of plaintiffs husband.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Not long after, Titus\u2019s wife, now known as Julie Swabash, filed for divorce. A divorce judgment entered on March 23, 2003, providing Swabash with nearly all the marital assets pursuant to the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment explained that the property distribution was unequal because Titus was serving a life sentence in prison and was relieved of any child support obligation for the couple\u2019s 17-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">On March 24, 2003, plaintiff sought to intervene in the divorce action. She challenged the distribution of assets to which Titus was entitled, in anticipation of obtaining a recovery from him in her wrongful death action. The divorce court denied the motion, and plaintiff did not appeal the denial. Instead, on January 20, 2005, after obtaining a wrongful death award, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>moved under MCL 600.6128 to join Swabash in the wrongful death action in an effort to collect the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Plaintiff contended that the Tituses\u2019 property settlement had been a fraudulent transfer within the meaning of the UFTA. The trial court held that it lacked the authority to amend the judgment entered by the divorce court. It declined to add Swabash as a party, dissolved the restraining order, and quashed the discovery subpoena it had issued earlier. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Judge MAMEY, writing for the majority in the Court of Appeals, joined by Judge WHITE, held that the UFTA applied to property transfers in divorce cases. The Court of Appeals majority went further, holding that plaintiff had sufficiently established a claim under the UFTA by demonstrating an actual intent to defraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court remanded the matter to the trial court so that Swabash could be added as a party defendant to the supplemental proceedings in the wrongful death case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge O\u2019CONNELL dissented in part in the belief that the Court of Appeals majority was allowing a collateral attack on the divorce judgment. We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">This appeal presents jurisdictional issues, which we review de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The interpretation of statutes and court rules is also a question of law subject to de novo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>review,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as is the application of legal doctrines, such as res judicata and collateral estoppel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">III. THE UFTA\u2019S APPLICATION TO PROPERTY SETTLEMENTS IN DIVORCE CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In her appeal, Swabash argues that the Legislature did not intend to include property distributions in divorce cases within the purview of the UFTA. We note initially that the language of the act does not exempt from its reach property transferred pursuant to divorce judgments. However, the definition of \u201casset\u201d in the UFTA does exempt some properly held as tenants by the entirety.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hence, in a UFTA action, marital property held by the entirety is exempt from the creditor of only one spouse when the property is transferred pursuant to a divorce judgment. But property transferred pursuant to a property settlement agreement incorporated in a divorce judgment is subject to a UFTA action if it meets the definition of an asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">A. TRANSFER</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">We reject Swabash\u2019s claim that the UFTA can never reach the transfer of properly in divorce actions. The UFTA defines \u201ctransfer\u201d at MCL 556.31(7) as \u201ceveiy mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset, and includes payment of money, release, and creation of a hen or other encumbrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">A court may provide for the distribution of property in a divorce judgment, and, when it enters, the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ment has the same effect as a deed or a bill of sale.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A property settlement agreement incorporated in a divorce judgment disposes of the parties\u2019 interests in the marital property. As part of the judgment, it effectuates a transfer for purposes of the UFTA when the divorce judgment enters.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We conclude that plaintiff may challenge the Tituses\u2019 property settlement agreement incorporated in the divorce judgment as a transfer within the purview of the UFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">B. PROPERTY HELD AS TENANTS BY THE ENTIRETY</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Swabash\u2019s argument that the Legislature did not intend that the UFTA reach property transferred in a divorce action pursuant to a property settlement agreement is correct only with respect to some property held as tenants by the entirety. Only spouses can hold property in that fashion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">A UFTA action will not reach such property unless both spouses are debtors on the claim that is the subject of the action. This is because a \u201ctransfer\u201d under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>UFTA includes \u201cdisposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cAsset\u201d is defined in the act as including the \u201cproperty of the debtor.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One important exception is \u201c[a]n interest in property held in tenancy by the entireties to the extent it is not subject to process by a creditor holding a claim against only 1 tenant.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Property held as tenants by the entirety is exempt from the claims of the creditors of only one spouse and is not an asset. Hence, a distribution of such property in a divorce judgment is not a transfer for purposes of the UFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\u201cA judgment lien does not attach to an interest in real property owned as tenants by the entirety unless the underlying judgment is entered against both the husband and wife.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Legislature extended that same protection to \u201c [a]ll bonds, certificates of stock, mortgages, promissory notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness\u201d held by a husband and wife.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[property described in section 1 of 1927 PA 212, MCL 557.151, or real property, held jointly by a husband and wife as a tenancy by the entirety is exempt from execution under a judgment entered against only 1 spouse.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Therefore, real estate and the financial instruments described in MCL 557.151 held as tenants by the entirety cannot be the subject matter of a UFTA claim if only one spouse is the debtor. This conclusion fits into the larger statutory purpose of avoiding fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>transfers because it is difficult to comprehend how disposing of property that a creditor cannot reach could \u201cdefraud\u201d that creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">This rule applies when property held as tenants by the entirety is disposed of in a divorce judgment, despite the fact that the divorce ends the tenancy by the entirety.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This is because the spouses hold the property as tenants by the entirety until the marriage is dissolved. Under the UFTA, such property is not an asset, and its distribution pursuant to the divorce judgment is not a transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">IV UFTA RELIEF AND COLLATERAL ATTACKS ON DIVORCE JUDGMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals opined that plaintiff was precluded from using this case to collaterally attack the Tituses\u2019 divorce judgment. According to the dissent, plaintiffs proper remedy was to appeal the divorce court\u2019s denial of her motion to intervene in the divorce proceedings.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The dissent\u2019s position is faulty because it presumes that the divorce court had the authority to determine a creditor\u2019s property rights within a divorce proceeding. If that had been the case, plaintiff would have been required to appeal the divorce court\u2019s denial of her motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">A. THE EFFECT OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S FAILURE TO APPEAL THE ORDER DENYING HER MOTION TO INTERVENE</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">This Court has long recognized that the jurisdiction of a divorce court is strictly statutory and limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>determining \u201cthe rights and obligations between the husband and wife, to the exclusion of third parties ... .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> When fraud is alleged, third parties can be joined in the divorce action only if they have conspired with one spouse to defraud the other spouse of a property interest.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In this case, plaintiff does not allege that one of the Tituses defrauded the other. She alleges instead that the property distribution was fraudulent only with respect to her, a third party to the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Plaintiffs motion to intervene was based on MCR 2.209(A)(3), which allows an intervention of right in cases in which the intervenor\u2019s interests are not adequately represented by the parties.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court rule would otherwise have applied in the divorce because neither of the Tituses adequately represented plaintiffs interest as a potential creditor. However, the rule did not apply because the creditor sought to intervene in a divorce action in which the court did not have statutory jurisdiction to decide the intervenor\u2019s rights. Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>rules cannot establish, abrogate, or modify the substantive law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In <em>Yedinak v Yedinak, </em>we addressed this same issue in the context of the court rules of permissive and necessary joinder. The majority in <em>Yedinak </em>found that nothing in these rules gave the divorce courts \u201cpower to disregard statutory provisions pertaining to divorce and to litigate the rights of others than the husband and wife.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The same reasoning applies here. The divorce court properly denied plaintiffs motion to intervene in the divorce proceedings, and plaintiff correctly concluded that an appeal from the denial order would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">When it denied plaintiffs motion to intervene, the divorce court opined that the Tituses\u2019 property settlement was not fraudulent because it achieved an equitable division between the spouses. The judge opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">The problem with the Intervenor/Petitioner\u2019s position is that it presumes fraud due to what may appear to be an uneven or inequitable distribution of marital assets to the Divorce/Plaintiff. If the husband were not incarcerated, and/or not incarcerated for a significant period of time, then the argument of fraud may have more weight. However, in the present case, it is very likely that had the divorce case gone to trial, that this Court would have granted most of the property to Ms. Titus simply based on the fact that her husband will be incarcerated for a significant period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Swabash argues that plaintiffs failure to appeal the denial of plaintiffs motion caused the divorce court\u2019s decision that no fraud existed to have the preclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>effect of either res judicata or collateral estoppel. But these doctrines are inapplicable here. The creditor\u2019s right to relief under the UFTA was not raised in plaintiffs motion to intervene in the divorce proceeding, nor could it have been granted if raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The doctrine of res judicata bars a subsequent action when \u201c(1) the first action was decided on the merits, (2) the matter contested in the second action was or could have been resolved in the first, and (3) both actions involve the same parties or their privies.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The doctrine bars all matters that with due diligence should have been raised in the earlier action.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Plaintiff did not raise her claim for UFTA relief in her motion to intervene, nor was she required to do so, given that the divorce court lacked the authority to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Collateral estoppel is also inapplicable. That doctrine requires that (1) a question of fact essential to the judgment was actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, (2) the same parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue, and (3) there was mutuality of estoppel.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The essential issue in the motion to intervene was whether a third party could be allowed to claim that fraud was perpetrated against her in the divorce proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Once the divorce court decided that it had no jurisdiction to grant the motion to intervene, it could not reach the merits of plaintiffs claim. Thus, plaintiff had no opportunity to litigate the issue of fraud. Because no hearing was held on this issue, it cannot be said that the issue was fully and fairly litigated. Moreover, the issue whether relief under the UFTA was available, the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>issue relevant to this appeal, was not even raised in the motion to intervene. Consequently, the divorce court did not resolve the issue whether the Tituses\u2019 property distribution was inequitable with respect to plaintiff under the UFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In summary, we hold that plaintiffs failure to appeal the order denying her motion to intervene in the Tituses\u2019 divorce had no preclusive effect on her claim for relief under the UFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">B. THE LIMITED NATURE OF UFTA RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that MCR 2.613(B) prevented the trial court in the wrongful death case from setting aside or voiding the divorce judgment entered by the family division of the circuit court.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It accurately noted, as well, that MCR 2.613(B) does not prevent a court such as the court in the wrongful death case from granting relief under the UFTA.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The dissenting judge concluded that the Court of Appeals in effect allowed plaintiff to \u201crecover any \u2018marital assets\u2019 by way of a collateral attack on a valid divorce judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The UFTA specifically provides for avoiding a fraudulent transfer or attaching a particular fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>lently transferred asset.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Relief under the UFTA determines only the creditor\u2019s right to fraudulently transferred property.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The court in a UFTA action would transfer directly to the creditor any property interest that would have been awarded to the debtor in the divorce action but for the parties\u2019 fraud. Hence, the relief granted would not affect the validity of the divorce judgment or provisions of the judgment such as child custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">C. UFTA RELIEF DISTINGUISHED FROM A COLLATERAL ATTACK ON THE VALIDITY OF THE DIVORCE JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Relief under the UFTA should be distinguished from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>a collateral attack on the validity of the divorce judgment itself. Challenges to the validity of a divorce typically are premised on alleged violations of the various statutory requirements for divorce, such as the residency requirement and the waiting period.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> These are jurisdictional requirements.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Judgments may be attacked both directly and collaterally for lack of jurisdiction. However, this Court has been loath to invalidate divorce judgments on the urgings of third parties when neither spouse challenged the validity of the divorce in a direct appeal.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Court has refused to invalidate divorces on the basis of third-party allegations of nonjurisdictional irregularities in the divorce proceedings.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">This line of cases is distinguishable from the instant case because relief under the UFTA does not invalidate the divorce judgment itself. Furthermore, an independent action for relief under the UFTA is not premised on any irregularity in the divorce proceedings. It is premised on the divorce court\u2019s lack of statutory au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>thority to conduct a UFTA analysis within the divorce proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">D. UFTA RELIEF DISTINGUISHED FROM A COLLATERAL ATTACK ON A LIFE INSURANCE PROVISION IN THE DIVORCE JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The decision on which the Court of Appeals dissent relied when stating that divorce judgments are not generally subject to third-party collateral attacks<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> derived from a different line of cases. Those cases dealt specifically with life insurance provisions in divorce judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Prominent among them is <em>Kasper v Metro Life Ins Co.</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> Kasper </em>involved a dispute over life insurance proceeds between the decedent\u2019s father and the decedent\u2019s ex-wife as guardian of the couple\u2019s son. The ex-wife contended that, under the divorce judgment, the couple\u2019s son was to be the designated beneficiary of the decedent\u2019s life insurance policy. After the divorce judgment was entered, the decedent had named the decedent\u2019s father as the policy\u2019s beneficiary. The father argued that the divorce court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of the couple\u2019s son, a third party, within the divorce proceeding. We held that, although the divorce court could not make a third party the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, it could ratify the parties\u2019 agreement to that effect.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus, it was not the divorce court but the parties to the divorce who decided their son\u2019s right to receive life insurance proceeds under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In denying the right of the decedent\u2019s father to claim the proceeds as a later-designated beneficiary in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>Kasper, </em>we noted that the court\u2019s authority to enforce the spouses\u2019 agreement was \u201cpredicated upon our settled rule that one who has partaken of the fruits of a divorce decree cannot be heard to question the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We also quoted the following passage from the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Krueger v Krueger, </em>which dealt with the life insurance provision in a divorce judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">It is also important to note that the person challenging the divorce judgment and the underlying agreement was not a party to it. Under the circumstances it would be improper to allow this divorce settlement to be collaterally attacked after the husband has accepted all the benefits which he could obtain under it, but relieving him of his obligation.[<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The proposition that a third party cannot collaterally attack a divorce judgment also occurred in earlier Court of Appeals cases dealing with life insurance provisions in divorce judgments. One of these, <em>White v Michigan Life Ins Co, </em>is the case cited in the Court of Appeals dissent.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Viewed in context, the prohibition against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>third-party attacks on life insurance provisions in divorce judgments is based on the premise that they are an improper means of challenging the provisions\u2019 validity. The spouse who was ordered, or who promised, to designate a certain beneficiary was a party to the divorce proceedings. That spouse could have challenged the validity of the judgment\u2019s life insurance provision on direct appeal. A third-party collateral attack on the provision would be inappropriate for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">This line of cases should be distinguished from cases involving a creditor\u2019s right to relief under the UFTA. A creditor is not a party to a divorce proceeding and cannot directly appeal a divorce judgment. A creditor\u2019s right to relief under the UFTA is not affected by the fact that the debtor can appeal the property distribution in the divorce judgment. If a debtor agrees to a transfer of substantially all the marital assets in order to defraud a creditor, he or she cannot be expected to appeal that transfer. Neither can a creditor appeal in such a case. Given that a creditor is precluded from intervening in a divorce proceeding, the only way in which the creditor can raise a UFTA claim is in a separate action.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>creditor\u2019s request for relief under the UFTA in a separate proceeding is not an impermissible collateral attack on the divorce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that Swabash should be joined in the wrongful death action. She is both a \u201cperson claiming adversely to the judgment debtor\u201d in that action under MCL 600.6128(2) and a necessary party to plaintiffs claim for UFTA relief under MCR 2.205(A).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We hold that the UFTA applies to the transfer of property in a divorce judgment that incorporates a property settlement agreement. Property that is held as tenants by the entirety is not subject to process by a creditor holding a claim against only one spouse. Such property is not an \u201casset\u201d under the UFTA. Therefore, the distribution of such property in a divorce judgment is not a \u201ctransfer\u201d for purposes of the UFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Because the validity of the UFTA claim in this case was not properly before the Court of Appeals, we vacate that portion of the Court\u2019s judgment discussing the badges of fraud listed in MCL 566.34(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The trial court should have granted plaintiffs motion to join Swabash in the supplemental proceedings to the wrongful death action. Swabash is a person claiming adversely to the judgment debtor, Titus, under MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>600.6128(2) and a necessary party to plaintiffs claim for UFTA relief under MCR 2.205(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Plaintiffs claim for relief under the UFTA brought in the wrongful death action does not constitute a collateral attack on the divorce judgment. The relief plaintiff sought in the wrongful death action could not vacate the divorce judgment. It could only affect plaintiffs right to property fraudulently transferred to Swabash pursuant to the judgment. It could allow avoidance of a fraudulent transfer or attachment of a fraudulently transferred asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We also hold that the divorce court properly denied plaintiffs motion to intervene in the Tituses\u2019 divorce action. An appeal of that denial would have been futile. Plaintiff was a third party to the action. A third party can be joined in a divorce action when fraud is alleged only if he or she has conspired -with one spouse to defraud the other of a property interest. That did not occur here.

In <em>Greeninger v Cromwell, </em>140 Or App 241, 246; 915 P2d 479 (1996), the court reasoned that a fraudulent transfer under the UFTA constitutes extrinsic fraud because it is collateral to the merits of the case. The court held that an attack on such a transfer fell under the extrinsic fraud exception to collateral attacks on judgments. In <em>Dowell v Dennis, </em>998 P2d 206, 212 (Okla Civ App, 1999), the court relied on select sections of Corpus Juris Secundum to hold that a third party whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>interests have accrued beforehand may attack a divorce judgment on the ground of fraud \u201cregardless of whether such attack is labeled \u2018collateral\u2019 or \u2018direct.\u2019 \u201d We take no position on the validity of this alternative approach. Rather, we conclude that a creditor\u2019s claim under the UFTA is not an impermissible collateral attack on a divorce judgment because (1) the divorce court has no jurisdiction to determine the rights of a creditor and (2) a creditor cannot appeal a divorce judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b680-11\"> <em>Estes, </em>273 Mich App at 383-386.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b681-9\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGNP\">(concurring). I write separately to address the concern expressed during this appeal that our decision will leave a great many divorce judgments subject to attack by creditors, thus robbing them of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>finality. I believe the concern is unfounded. As I will explain, relatively few creditors will be incentivized to bring actions under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA) against newly divorced individuals as a result of the Court\u2019s opinion in this case. This is because of the difficulty creditors will encounter in surviving a motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Difficulties for creditors will exist on several fronts. First, to maintain a UFTA action, creditors must identify one or more property interests that qualify as \u201cassets\u201d under the act. As the unanimous opinion describes, property held as tenants by the entirety when the judgment is entered is not an asset under the UFTA unless the creditor\u2019s judgment covers both divorced individuals. Normally that property will include real estate, stocks, bonds, and promissory notes, among others. Hence, much of the marital estate will not be subject to a UFTA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">A second difficulty creditors will encounter is stating a prima facie case alleging a transfer made with an actual intent to defraud. To state such a case, creditors must allege at least one badge of fraud under MCL 556.34(2). In the instant case, the creditor alleged several, including (1) that before the transfer was made, the debtor had been threatened with suit, (2) that the transfer the debtor made was of substantially all his assets, and (3) that the debtor become insolvent after the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">By contrast, regarding most divorce cases, the only badge of actual fraud that might plausibly be alleged is that the transfer took place while the parties were \u201cinsiders\u201d under the act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my opinion, this allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>will not survive a motion for summary disposition. For the UFTA to apply, the transferee must be an insider when the transfer occurs. Although a husband and wife are insiders while married, they normally cease to have that status when the divorce judgment is entered. And it is only when the judgment is entered that the transfer of property takes place, assuming, of course, that the individuals do not exchange the property beforehand.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">A more thorough analysis follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">AUTOMATIC INSIDER STATUS UNDER THE MICHIGAN UFTA</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The UFTA\u2019s definition of \u201cinsider\u201d includes a relative of the debtor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The definition of \u201crelative,\u201d in turn, includes a spouse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, spouses are automatic insiders under the UFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>A transfer to an insider is one of the relevant factors for determining whether the transfer was made with an actual intent to defraud a creditor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCL 566.34(2), which supplies a list of such factors, states that any one may be considered to establish the intent to defraud.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Because insider status alone can automatically establish fraudulent intent, if all newly divorced spouses were automatic insiders under the UFTA, creditors could jeopardize the finality of many divorce judgments. I agree with the argument of the Family Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan in its brief amicus curiae that this could not have been the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">It is interesting to note that the application of the badges of fraud listed in the Michigan UFTA differs from that allowed in other states\u2019 versions of the UFTA. For example, the UFTA as adopted in New Jersey, Oregon, and Illinois does not expressly allow the use of only one factor to establish the intent to defraud.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>surprisingly, in these states, courts require a \u201cconfluence\u201d of factors indicating an actual intent to defraud.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">As a practical matter, a creditor will normally allege multiple badges of fraud to establish an actual intent to defraud under the Michigan version of the UFTA as well. Multiple factors were present in <em>Szkrybalo v Szkrybalo, </em>in which the Court of Appeals originally rejected the creditor\u2019s claim on the ground that it was based solely on insider status.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to review several other badges of fraud alleged under MCL 566.34(2), specifically under subdivisions c, d, h, g, and j.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On remand, the Court of Appeals ruled for the plaintiff. The plaintiff raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the debtor-husband had made a transfer to his wife during the marriage with an actual intent to defraud his creditors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In this case, plaintiff did not base her cause of action solely on the allegation that Jeff Titus made fraudulent transfers to an insider. On remand, the trial court can consider the other badges she alleged, those in subdivisions d, e, and f, in determining whether any transfer was made with an actual intent to defraud plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Thus, in this case, whether a transfer was made to an insider is not dispositive. However, because our UFTA allows a creditor to allege a single factor, it is important to know whether a divorce judgment may be attacked solely on the ground that spouses are automatic insiders.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">NEWLY DIVORCED INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT AUTOMATIC INSIDERS UNDER THE UFTA</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In determining whether a transfer under the UFTA was to an automatic insider, it is necessary to consider the parties\u2019 status at the time of the transfer. Under MCL 552.401, the transfer of property interests in a divorce judgment occurs when the judgment is entered.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is also at that time that the marriage is dissolved. The simultaneity of the two events makes it impossible for the parties to be still married at the time the transfer occurs. Because the spousal relationship evaporates at the same moment that the transfer occurs, the parties to the divorce are not automatic insiders under the UFTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">A question arises about what importance to accord to the parties\u2019 status during the negotiation of the property settlement agreement incorporated into the divorce judgment. Virtually every property settlement agreement is negotiated while the parties are still married. However, the UFTA is concerned with the transferee\u2019s status at the time of transfer, not while the terms of the transfer are being negotiated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The settlement agreement in itself is not a transfer. It is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>conditional promise to transfer that has no effect until the divorce judgment is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">I believe that the great majority of divorce judgments will not be subjected to a UFTA action. A creditor will encounter difficulty sustaining a UFTA action against a newly divorced individual (1) if the property that the creditor seeks was held as tenants by the entirety at the time of divorce or (2) if automatic insider status is the creditor\u2019s only available basis for alleging fraud.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\"> Creditors might also seek to avoid the dismissal of their UFTA actions by alleging only that the property distribution under a divorce judgment was not for a reasonably equivalent value. This refers to factor h under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the act, MCL 566.34(2)(h). The lack of a reasonably equivalent value may be indicative of both actual and constructive fraud. MCL 566.34(l)(a) and (2), MCL 566.34(l)(b), and MCL 566.35(1). But I do not believe that UFTA actions will succeed in altering many property distributions on the basis of this factor alone. The courts have not developed standards for determining what constitutes a reasonably equivalent value in divorce cases. Clearly, many intangible or indirect benefits are involved in the property distributions in these cases. It is usually very difficult to show that the value of the consideration received by the debtor was not reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred. Until standards are developed, creditors will be hard-pressed to demonstrate actual fraud using this factor by itself. Moreover, most property settlements are unlike the one in this case, in which the debtor agreed that Julie Swabash should have virtually all the marital property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\"> MCL 566.31(g) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-11\">\u201cInsider\u201d includes all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-12\">(i) If the debtor is an individual, all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-13\">(A) A relative of the debtor or of a general partner of the debtor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-14\"> MCL 566.31(k) states: \u201c \u2018Relative\u2019 means an individual related by consanguinity within the third degree as determined by the common law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>a spouse, or an individual related to a spouse within the third degree as so determined, and includes an individual in an adoptive relationship within the third degree.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> MCL 566.34(1) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor\u2019s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation ... :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">(a) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">The term \u201cinsider\u201d also appears in MCL 566.35(2), the UFTA provision that deals with preferential transfers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-13\">A transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made if the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt, the debtor was insolvent at that time, and the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">In the instant case, plaintiff did not argue that this provision applies to a transfer of property in a divorce.
