However, because defendant insurance company lacks statutory standing to challenge plaintiffs corporate status under MCL 450.1221, which grants the power to challenge corporate status solely to the Attorney General, the above questions are not properly before us. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in plaintiffs favor, albeit on alternative grounds, and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">William Miller was injured in separate car accidents on February 27, 2002, and September 13, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Miller was diagnosed with whiplash; his doctor prescribed physical therapy and referred Miller to plaintiff PT Works, Inc. Miller was treated by PT Works from April 2, 2003, through August 28, 2003, incurring a bill for $29,150.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Miller was insured with defendant Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate). PT Works billed Allstate for $29,150, hut Allstate refused to pay. Miller then filed this lawsuit against Allstate for no-fault benefits, and subsequently assigned his claim to PT Works, who then filed a claim against Allstate as cross-plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Allstate moved for summary disposition, arguing that PT Works was unlawfully incorporated under the BCA, because PT Works was required to incorporate under the Professional Services Corporations Act (PSCA), MCL 450.221 <em>et seq. </em>Allstate argued that, because it was obligated to pay no-fault benefits only for treatment \u201clawfully\u201d rendered, MCL 500.3157, PT Works could not recover no-fault benefits if it was unlawfully incorporated. The trial court denied Allstate\u2019s motion, concluding that physical therapy did not constitute \u201cprofessional services\u201d under the PSCA, and hence PT Works could incorporate under the BCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Allstate appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Miller v Allstate Ins Co, </em>272 Mich App 284; 726 NW2d 54 (2006). The Court of Appeals held that, regardless of whether PT Works was lawfully incorporated under the BCA, the treatment rendered to Miller was \u201clawful\u201d under MCL 500.3157 because it was rendered by properly licensed physical therapists. <em>Id. </em>at 286-287.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Allstate then filed an application for leave to appeal with this Court, and, in lieu of granting leave, we vacated the initial Court of Appeals judgment and remanded to the Court of Appeals to consider whether PT Works was lawfully incorporated and, if PT Works was unlawfully incorporated, to reconsider whether treatment was lawfully rendered. 477 Mich 1062 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">On remand, the Court of Appeals again affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary disposition. <em>Miller v Allstate Ins Co (On Remand), </em>275 Mich App 649; 739 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>NW2d 675 (2007). The Court of Appeals held that PT Works could have incorporated under the PSCA, and thus was unlawfully incorporated under the BCA, citing MCL 450.1251(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 654. In particular, the Court of Appeals noted that physical therapy constituted a personal service to the public, and required a license under Michigan law. <em>Id. </em>However, the Court of Appeals adopted its prior analysis and concluded that the improper incorporation under the BCA did not render the treatment \u201cunlawful\u201d under MCL 500.3157. <em>Id. </em>at 655-658.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">PT Works appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals that it was unlawfully incorporated. In a separate application, Allstate appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals that, despite the unlawful incorporation, the treatment was \u201clawfully rendered.\u201d This Court granted both applications for leave to appeal. 480 Mich 938 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>Lash v Traverse City, </em>479 Mich 180, 186; 735 NW2d 628 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Our constitution requires that a plaintiff possess standing before a court can exercise jurisdiction over that plaintiffs claim. <em>Rohde v Ann Arbor Pub Schools, </em>479 Mich 336, 346; 737 NW2d 158 (2007). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>constitutional standing doctrine is longstanding and stems from the separation of powers in our constitution. <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co, </em>471 Mich 608, 612; 684 NW2d 800 (2004). Because the constitution limits the judiciary to the exercise of \u201cjudicial power,\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, the Legislature encroaches on the separation of powers when it attempts to grant standing to litigants who do not meet constitutional standing requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Rohde, supra </em>at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Although the Legislature cannot <em>expand </em>beyond constitutional limits the class of persons who possess standing, the Legislature may permissibly <em>limit </em>the class of persons who may challenge a statutory violation. That is, a party that has constitutional standing may be precluded from enforcing a statutory provision, if the Legislature so provides. This doctrine has been referred to as a requirement that a party possess \u201cstatutory standing.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Graden v Conexant Sys, Inc, </em>496 F3d 291, 294 (CA 3, 2007). Statutory standing \u201csimply [entails] statutory interpretation: the question it asks is whether [the Legislature] has accorded <em>this </em>injured plaintiff the right to sue the defendant to redress his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>In this case, plaintiff asks this Court to conclude that, under the express terms of the BCA, defendant may not bring any challenge against plaintiffs corporate status. That is, defendant\u2019s lack of statutory standing would act as a jurisdictional bar to defendant\u2019s affirmative defense that plaintiff was unlawfully incorporated. If the BCA categorically bars defendant\u2019s claim, then the lower courts should not have considered the substance of defendant\u2019s claim, as they each did in different ways; rather, they should have simply determined that defendant may not raise the affirmative defense that plaintiff was unlawfully incorporated. Accordingly, before considering whether an entity is lawfully incorporated under the BCA, a court must consider whether the party challenging corporate status has statutory standing to raise that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Statutory standing, which necessitates an inquiry into whether a statute authorizes a plaintiff to sue at all, must be distinguished from whether a statute permits an individual claim for a particular type of relief. See <em>Steel Co v Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>523 US 83, 92; 118 S Ct 1003; 140 L Ed 2d 210 (1998) (distinguishing between \u201cwhether [a statute] authorizes this plaintiff to sue\u201d and \u201cwhether the scope of the [statutory] right of action includes past violations\u201d and stating that the latter \u201cgoes to the merits and not to statutory standing\u201d). The statutory-standing inquiry is generally jurisdictional; the claim-for-relief inquiry is non-jurisdictional. <em>Lerner v Fleet Bank, NA, </em>318 F3d 113, 127 (CA 2, 2003); see also <em>Steel Co, supra </em>at 92 (stating that the claim for relief inquiry is non-jurisdictional and contrasting that inquiry with the statutory-standing inquiry); <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc v Kent Co, </em>510 US 355, 365; 114 S Ct 855; 127 L Ed 2d 183 (1994) (\u201cThe question whether a. .. statute creates a claim for relief is not jurisdictional.\u201d). But see <em>Canyon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>Co v Syngenta Seeds, Inc, </em>519 F3d 969, 975 n 7 (CA 9, 2008) (rejecting the proposition that statutory standing is jurisdictional). We acknowledge that the line dividing these inquiries is not always susceptible to easy demarcation; as <em>Steel Co </em>points out, \u201cthe merits inquiry and the statutory standing inquiry often \u2018overlap.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steel Co, supra </em>at 97 n 2, quoting <em>Nat\u2019l R Passenger Corp v Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of R Passengers, </em>414 US 453, 456; 94 S Ct 690; 38 L Ed 2d 646 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">An example illustrates the distinction. This Court considered during its last term whether an individual plaintiff \u201cmay maintain a private cause of action for money damages against\u201d a public employer for a violation of MCL 15.602.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Lash, supra </em>at 191. We held that, based on the text of the statute, \u201cthe Legislature did not intend to create a private cause of action for violation of this particular provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196. We further noted that the plaintiff could seek enforcement of the statute through a claim for injunctive relief or a declaratory judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 196-197. Thus, an individual plaintiff could bring <em>some </em>cause of action to enforce MCL 15.602, thereby indicating that an individual plaintiff has statutory standing. However, an individual plaintiff could not bring every <em>particular </em>type of action, namely in that case an action for money damages. This latter question goes to the scope of the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Two conclusions should be drawn from this. First, a determination that a plaintiff lacks statutory standing to assert a cause of action is essentially the equivalent of concluding that a plaintiff cannot bring <em>any </em>action in reaction to an alleged legal violation. Second, an inquiry regarding statutory standing and an inquiry regarding the merits of a particular claim for relief both follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>same method: both analyze the statutory language to determine legislative intent. However, the two inquiries ask different questions: the former asks whether any plaintiff may ever assert a violation of the statute, whereas the latter asks whether the plaintiff may assert a particular cause of action for the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Here, the initial question is whether defendant Allstate may challenge the incorporation of PT Works under the BCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Because the relevant question is whether the BCA authorizes defendant to make such a challenge, the issue presented is properly characterized as one of statutory standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">MCL 450.1221 of the BCA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">The corporate existence shall begin on the effective date of the articles of incorporation as provided in [MCL 450.1131].[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Filing is conclusive evidence that all conditions precedent required to be performed under this act have been fulfilled and that the corporation has been formed under this act, except in an action or special proceeding by the attorney general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>This statute indicates that once articles of incorporation under the BCA have been filed, such filing constitutes \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that (1) all the requirements for complying with the BCA have been fulfilled and (2) the corporation has actually been formed in compliance with the BCA. Thus, the statute generally creates an irrebuttable presumption of proper incorporation once the articles of incorporation have been filed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute then creates a single exception to this general rule by granting the Attorney General the sole authority to challenge whether a corporation has been properly incorporated under the BCA. That is, only the Attorney General is not affected by the irrebuttable presumption in favor of legality. By naming only the Attorney General in this respect, the Legislature has indicated that the Attorney General alone has the authority to challenge corporate status, under the principle <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>that is, \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u201d <em>Miller v Chapman Contracting, 477 </em>Mich 102, 108 n 1; 730 NW2d 462 (2007). Thus, the filing of the articles of incorporation serves as \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that PT Works has been properly formed, and this Court cannot, under the terms of MCL 450.1221, conclude otherwise, except as a consequence of a suit brought by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In essence, MCL 450.1221 prevents any person\u2014 other than the Attorney General \u2014 from bringing any challenge to corporate status under the BCA: every such challenge would be doomed to failure, because the mere filing of articles of incorporation constitutes <em>\u201ccon-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>elusive </em>evidence\u201d of the corporation\u2019s legality. Because the Legislature has expressly forbidden Allstate from raising the affirmative defense asserted in this litigation, Allstate lacks statutory standing to challenge the corporate status of PT Works.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Moreover, MCL 450.1221 presents a jurisdictional bar to defendant\u2019s affirmative defense. Because MCL 450.1221 indicates that only the Attorney General may pursue a claim that a corporation such as plaintiff is improperly incorporated under the BCA, the lower courts should not have considered the merits of Allstate\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Allstate argues that MCL 450.1221 sets forth a general rule that only the Attorney General may challenge corporate status under the BCA, but that the no-fault act, MCL 500.3157, provides a specific exception to that general rule. MCL 500.3157 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\">A physician, hospital, clinic or other person or institution <em>lawfully </em>rendering treatment to an injured person for an accidental bodily injury covered by personal protection insurance, and a person or institution providing rehabilitative occupational training following the injury, may charge a reasonable amount for the products, services and accommodations rendered. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\u201c[S]pecific provisions ... prevail over any arguable inconsistency with the more general rule. ...\u201d <em>Jones v Enertel, Inc, </em>467 Mich 266, 271; 650 NW2d 334 (2002). The question raised by Allstate is how to ascertain which provision is more specific and which is more general. As with any question of statutory interpretation, we examine the language of the statutes to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Fluor Enterprises, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>477 Mich 170, 174; 730 NW2d 722 (2007). In order to determine which provision is truly more specific and, hence, controlling, we consider which provision applies to the more narrow realm of circumstances, and which to the more broad realm. MCL 500.3157 grants a right to insurers to refuse payment for treatment that is unlawfully rendered. This right encompasses all forms of unlawfulness, and hence would seem to apply to the challenge made here. However, MCL 450.1221 applies to one specific form of unlawfulness \u2014 improper corporate formation. Because MCL 450.1221 applies to one form of unlawfulness, and MCL 500.3157 applies to all forms, MCL 450.1221 is the more specific provision and, therefore, prevails over MCL 500.3157.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Contrary to Allstate\u2019s argument, MCL 500.3157 does not specifically grant an insurer the right to challenge <em>all </em>forms of unlawfulness, regardless of other statutes that impose limitations or exceptions upon such an ability. Rather, MCL 500.3157 sets up a general ability to challenge lawfulness, but neither states nor implies that a right has been established that trumps any other statutory limitation on an insurer\u2019s ability to contest the lawfulness of treatment. Hence, Allstate\u2019s argument fails, and we conclude that MCL 450.1221 prevents an insurer from challenging the corporate status of a corporation formed under the BCA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Although our analysis rests solely on our interpretation of the relevant statutes, we note that MCL 450.1221 encapsulates at least 100 years of common-law practice in Michigan. In <em>Int\u2019l Harvester Co of America v Eaton Circuit Judge, </em>163 Mich 55; 127 NW 695 (1910), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">This brings us to the doctrine, founded in public policy and convenience and supported by an almost unanimous consensus of judicial opinion, which is that rightfulness of the existence of a body claiming to act, and in fact acting in the face of the State, as a corporation, cannot be litigated in actions between private individuals, or between private individuals and the assumed corporation, but that the rightfulness of the existence of the corporation can be questioned only by the State; in other words, that the question of the rightful existence of the corporation cannot be raised in a collateral proceeding. <em>{Id. </em>at 67 (quotations and citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Indeed, Michigan courts have long held that the state possesses the sole authority to question whether a corporation has been properly incorporated under the relevant law. See, e.g., <em>Flueling v Goeringer, </em>240 Mich 372, 375; 215 NW 294 (1927) (stating that a particular taxicab company \u201cis a corporation, and its right to be such under the provisions of the act authorizing corporations ... , if questioned, must be at the instance of proper State authority\u201d); <em>Allied Supermarkets, Inc v Grocer\u2019s Dairy Co, </em>45 Mich App 310, 317; 206 NW2d 490 (1973) (\u201cOnly the state may challenge the validity of an incorporation.\u201d); see also OAG, 1981-1982, No 5893, pp 167-168 (May 8, 1981) (\u201cThe validity of an incorporation can be questioned only by the state in a proper proceeding and cannot be questioned collaterally.\u201d), citing <em>Besson v Crapo Toll Rd, </em>150 Mich 655; 114 NW 924 (1908). Moreover, a party cannot raise an argument challenging a corporation\u2019s corporate status in a collateral proceeding; rather, such an argument may only be brought in a direct proceeding to challenge such status. <em>Attorney General v Lapeer Farmers Mut Fire Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>297 Mich 174, 184; 297 NW 232 (1941); <em>Cahill v Kalamazoo Mut Ins Co, </em>2 Doug 124, 141 (Mich 1845). Thus, in historical context, MCL 450.1221 codifies Michigan\u2019s longstanding common-law practice of only permitting the state to challenge corporate status, and to do so only in a direct proceeding on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">One need not look far to ascertain the merits of this limitation. As one treatise states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">It would produce endless confusion and hardship, and probably destroy the corporation, if the legality of its existence could be drawn in question in eVery suit to which it was a party.... [18A Am Jur 2d, Corporations, \u00a7 208, p 88.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Indeed, if the legality of every Michigan corporation were subject to continual assault by any person, it would be difficult to see how a stable economic climate could ever exist. Relevant to this case, no insured person could obtain medical treatment without undertaking a laborious inquiry into whether the entity providing treatment has complied with every applicable corporate statute and regulation. Whether an insured person could obtain benefits would largely depend on the ingenuity of lawyers in ferreting out aspects of corporate non-compliance with applicable statutes. However, the Legislature has deemed it fit that residents of Michigan may depend on the corporate status of any corporation formed under the BCA and approved by the state, and we do nothing more here than enforce that policy decision \u2014 a decision rooted in relevant statutes and in longstanding judicial practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Because Allstate lacks statutory standing to assert that PT Works was improperly incorporated, the Court of Appeals correctly held that summary disposition should be granted to PT Works, albeit on alternative grounds. Accordingly, we affirm the conclusion of the Court of Appeals, but vacate its rationale, and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b704-7\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b704-8\">CAVANAGH, J. I concur in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\"> Although William Miller is the named plaintiff in this case, he is no longer involved in the litigation; hence, all references to \u201cplaintiff\u201d are to cross-plaintiff PT Works, Inc., and all references to \u201cdefendant\u201d are to cross-defendant Allstate Insurance Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\"> MCL 450.1251(1) of the BCA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">A corporation may be formed under this act for any lawful purpose, except to engage in a business for which a corporation may be formed under any other statute of this state unless that statute permits formation under this act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-5\"> To establish constitutional standing, a plaintiff must satisfy three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u2018actual or imminent, not \u201cconjectural\u201d or \u201chypothetical.\u201d \u2019 Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be \u2018fairly... traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not... the result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019 Third, it must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation, supra </em>at 628-629 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\"> This statute restricts a public employer\u2019s ability to impose residency restrictions on employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> Ordinarily, statutory standing questions involve a challenge to a <em>plaintiffs </em>standing. Here, however, plaintiff challenges defendant\u2019s ability to assert plaintiffs allegedly unlawful incorporation under the BCA as an affirmative defense. If the BCA prevents defendant from bringing an original action against plaintiff based on unlawful incorporation, then it would be illogical to permit defendant to assert the same grounds as an affirmative defense. See, e.g., <em>Cinema North Corp v Plaza At Latham Assoc, 867 </em>F2d 135, 139 (CA 2, 1989) (stating that ordinarily a guarantor who has been sued does not possess standing to assert, as an affirmative defense, a claim that inheres in a principal); <em>United States v Dunifer, </em>997 F Supp 1235, 1239 (ND Cal, 1998) (\u201cWhere the defendant asserts an affirmative defense requiring the litigation of issues not encompassed in the plaintiffs case-in-chief, the defendant is in a similar situation on those issues to a plaintiff who is invoking the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d). Accordingly, we must inquire into whether defendant has statutory standing to assert this particular affirmative defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\"> MCL 450.1131 establishes general procedures for filing articles of incorporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b699-5\"> In contrast with the irrebuttable presumption established in MCL 450.1221, the Legislature has on other occasions created rebuttable presumptions. See, e.g., MCL 333.17031(3) (filing a written statement regarding educational history creates a \"rebuttable presumption\u201d that statement was filed \u201cin good faith\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b700-5\"> This conclusion is bolstered by other provisions of the BCA that limit the authority of certain individuals to challenge improper incorporation. The BCA, MCL 450.1821, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">(1) The attorney general may bring an action in the circuit court of the county in which the principal place of business or registered office of the corporation is located for dissolution of a corporation upon the ground that the corporation has committed any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">(a) Procured its organization through fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">(b) Repeatedly and willfully exceeded the authority conferred upon it by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">(c) Repeatedly and willfully conducted its business in an unlawful manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">(2) The enumeration in this section of grounds for dissolution does not exclude any other statutory or common law action by the attorney general for dissolution of a corporation or revocation or forfeiture of its corporate franchises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Thus, MCL 450.1821 vests authority in the Attorney General to pursue dissolution of a corporation. Similarly, MCL 450.1823 permits the shareholders and directors of a corporation to pursue dissolution under certain circumstances. See also MCL 450.1488(l)(g) (allowing shareholders to dissolve a corporation by agreement). Because the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another, <em>Chapman </em>Contracting, <em>supra </em>at 108 n 1, these statutes indicate that an outside party may not pursue dissolution, and thus reflect a general legislative intent to prevent outside parties from challenging an entity\u2019s corporate status under the BCA</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\"> We emphasize that in no way are we passing judgment on the lawfulness of plaintiffs incorporation. Because a court cannot entertain an individual\u2019s challenge to corporate status under MCL 450.1221, plaintiff must be presumed to he lawfully formed until its incorporation has been successfully challenged by the Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b704-9\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6f\"><em>{concurring in the result only). </em>I concur in the result of the majority opinion because defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Allstate Insurance Company lacks the authority to challenge the corporate status of cross-plaintiff PT Works, Inc.
