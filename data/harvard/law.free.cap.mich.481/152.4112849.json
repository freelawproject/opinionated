Therefore, we remand the case to the trial court to reconsider whether to assess 15 points for predatory conduct under OV 10 and to resentence defendant if it assesses no points.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Defendant entered a Burger King restaurant in the city of Saginaw. His codefendants, Maurice Mayes and Larry Hibler, immediately followed him inside. At the time, there were four employees on duty and no customers in the restaurant. Mayes and Hibler went into the bathroom while defendant approached the counter. Defendant, appearing nervous, stood near the counter, but did not place an order. Mayes and Hibler then emerged from the bathroom with bandannas covering their faces. They jumped over the counter and attempted to gather the restaurant employees into one place. Hibler displayed a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Defendant did not appear surprised by their actions. He moved closer to the front of the restaurant, pulled a hood over his head, and began pacing back and forth, looking out the windows. While Mayes and Hibler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ordered the restaurant manager to open the safe and the cash registers and removed the cash, one employee escaped into the freezer and called the police. Defendant, Mayes, and Hibler fled as the police approached. All three were apprehended shortly afterwards. In the parking lot of a nearby business, the police found a stolen pickup truck with an open door and three coats in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the guidelines range was being calculated at sentencing, the prosecutor asserted that 15 points should be assessed under OV 10 for engaging in predatory conduct. The prosecutor argued that the predatory conduct consisted of waiting in a truck at a neighboring business until no customers remained in the restaurant, then committing the robbery. According to the prosecutor, the three men had targeted the restaurant and planned their actions to victimize the restaurant employees. Defense counsel objected, arguing that these actions did not constitute predatory conduct under the statute. The trial court agreed to assess points for predatory conduct. It reasoned that defendant\u2019s conduct was predatory because defendant could have signaled Mayes and Hibler to stop the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed that decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">The evidence suggests that defendant and his coconspirators selected a time, place, and manner in which to commit this robbery to maximize the vulnerability of the victims and minimize their chances of getting caught. The trial court heard evidence that the offenders planned the crime in advance, parked their car alongside the restaurant in a separate parking lot where they would not be seen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>selected defendant to act as the lookout, and waited until the restaurant was devoid of customers so that the employees were alone, in order to facilitate the commission of the offense. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s acts satisfied the criteria for predatory conduct within the meaning of the statute. Defendant thus fails to show that the trial court commit [sic] clear error in scoring fifteen points against defendant on OV 10. <em>[People v Cannon, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued July 25, 2006 (Docket No. 259532), p 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We granted leave to appeal to consider the scope of predatory conduct as defined in OV 10 and whether the trial court properly assessed 15 points for predatory conduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">EXPLOITATION OF A VULNERABLE VICTIM IS A PREREQUISITE TO THE ASSESSMENT OF POINTS UNDER OV 10</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The proper interpretation and application of the legislative sentencing guidelines are questions of law, which this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our analysis begins with the language of MCL 777.40:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">(1) Offense variable 10 is exploitation of a vulnerable victim. Score offense variable 10 by determining which of the following apply and by assigning the number of points attributable to the one that has the highest number of points:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">(a) Predatory conduct was involved...............15 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">(b) The offender exploited a victim\u2019s physical disability, mental disability, youth or agedness, or a domestic relationship, or the offender abused his or her authority status .................................................................................10 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">(c) The offender exploited a victim by his or her difference in size or strength, or both, or exploited a victim who was intoxicated, under the influence of drugs, asleep, or unconscious..............................................................5 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(d) The offender did not exploit a victim\u2019s vulnerability..............................................................................0 points</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">(2) The mere existence of 1 or more factors described in subsection (1) does not automatically equate with victim vulnerability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">(3) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">(a) \u201cPredatory conduct\u201d means preoffense conduct directed at a victim for the primary purpose of victimization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">(b) \u201cExploit\u201d means to manipulate a victim for selfish or unethical purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">(c) \u201cVulnerability\u201d means the readily apparent susceptibility of a victim to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">(d) \u201cAbuse of authority status\u201d means a victim was exploited out of fear or deference to an authority figure, including, hut not limited to, a parent, physician, or teacher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Reading this statute as a whole,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that the central subject is the assessment of points for the exploitation of vulnerable victims. The statute applies when exploitive conduct, including predatory conduct, is at issue. The statute does not use the word \u201cvulnerable\u201d in the subsections directing the assessment of points for particular circumstances. Nor does the subsection specifically directing the assessment of 15 points for predatory conduct refer to exploitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">However, the Legislature\u2019s focus is clearly stated by subsection 1, which provides that \u201c[o]ffense variable 10 is exploitation of a vulnerable victim.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The intent to assess points for the exploitation of vulnerable victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>is also demonstrated by the fact that the statute assigns zero points when the \u201coffender did not exploit a victim\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Subsection 3(c) defines victim \u201cvulnerability,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and subsection 2 clarifies that the \u201cmere existence of 1 or more factors described in subsection (1) does not automatically equate with victim vulnerability.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These subsections would be meaningless if vulnerability of the victim were not necessary for the assessment of points under OV 10. \u201cWhenever possible, every word of a statute should be given meaning. And no word should be treated as surplusage or made nugatory.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Thus, we conclude that points should be assessed under OV 10 only when it is readily apparent that a victim was \u201cvulnerable,\u201d i.e., was susceptible to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Factors to be considered<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in deciding whether a victim was vulnerable include (1) the victim\u2019s physical disability, (2) the victim\u2019s mental disability, (3) the victim\u2019s youth or agedness, (4) the existence of a domestic relationship, (5) whether the offender abused his or her authority status, (6) whether the offender exploited a victim by his or her difference in size or strength or both, (7) whether the victim was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, or (8) whether the victim was asleep or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>unconscious.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The mere existence of one of these factors does not automatically render the victim vulnerable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The same statutory language that led us to conclude that the victim\u2019s vulnerability is a requirement under the statute also leads us to conclude that exploitation is required. Points are assessed under OV 10 for \u201cexploitation of a vulnerable victim.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the Legislature had not intended that exploitation be shown for the assessment of points under OV 10, it would not have expressly stated that zero points are to be assessed when the \u201coffender did not exploit a victim\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The subsections of the statute directing the assessment of 5 and 10 points explicitly require the sentencing judge to determine if the offender \u201cexploited a victim.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The subsection directing the assessment of points for \u201cpredatory conduct,\u201d however, does not explicitly require the sentencing judge to determine if the offender exploited a victim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, the sentencing judge must determine if there was \u201cpreoffense conduct directed at a victim for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nonetheless, preoffense conduct directed at a victim for the primary purpose of victimization inherently involves some level of exploitation. Thus, we conclude that points may be assessed under OV 10 for exploitation of a vulnerable victim when the defendant has engaged in conduct that is considered predatory under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>PREDATORY CONDUCT DEFINED</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In determining whether to assess 15 points for \u201cpredatory conduct,\u201d the sentencing judge must first determine whether there was \u201cpreoffense conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The use of prefix \u201cpre\u201d in the term \u201cpreoffense\u201d indicates that, to be considered predatory, the conduct must have occurred before the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In addition, the conduct must have been \u201cdirected at a victim\u201d before the offense was committed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A lion that waits near a watering hole hoping that a herd of antelope will come to drink is not engaging in conduct directed at a victim. However, a lion that sees antelope, determines which is the weakest, and stalks it until the opportunity arises to attack it engages in conduct directed at a victim. Contrast that with an individual who intends to shoplift and watches and waits for the opportunity to commit the act when no one is looking. The individual has not directed any action at a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v </em>Kimble<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is instructive on this point. There, the defendant and his accomplices were looking for a vehicle to steal so they could remove and sell the wheel rims. To that end, they drove for an hour searching for a vehicle with valuable wheel rims.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Once they spotted one, they followed the driver, watched as she entered her driveway at home, then shot her and stole her vehicle.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Once the defendant in <em>Kimble </em>targeted the vehicle\u2019s owner, his act of following her and waiting for the opportunity to strike was conduct directed at a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>In addition, preoffense conduct must have been directed at a victim \u201cfor the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cVictimize\u201d is defined as \u201cto make a victim of.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, the statute mandates that preoffense conduct not be considered predatory if its main purpose is other than making the potential victim an actual victim. \u201cVictim\u201d is defined as \u201c1. a person who suffers from a destructive or injurious action or agency .... 2. a person who is deceived or cheated . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cPredatory conduct\u201d under the statute is behavior that precedes the offense, directed at a person for the primary .purpose of causing that person to suffer from an injurious action or to be deceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We find the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>People v </em>Apgar<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> particularly helpful in illustrating this point. In <em>Apgar, </em>the defendant and his accomplices invited the victim to accompany them to a store.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> They drove around for more than two hours while forcing the victim to smoke marijuana.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> They then took her to an unfamiliar house, where the defendant sexually assaulted her.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Clearly, the preoffense conduct of driving the victim around while forcing her to smoke marijuana was undertaken to make the victim an easier target for the sexual assault. Thus, it was done for the primary purpose of victimization.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">To aid lower courts in determining whether 15 points are properly assessed under OV 10, we set forth the following analytical questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>(1) Did the offender engage in conduct before the commission of the offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">(2) Was this conduct directed at one or more specific victims who suffered from a readily apparent susceptibility to injury, physical restraint, persuasion, or temptation?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">(3) Was victimization the offender\u2019s primary purpose for engaging in the preoffense conduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">If the court can answer all these questions affirmatively, then it may properly assess 15 points for OV 10 because the offender engaged in predatory conduct under MCL 777.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In this case, neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals properly analyzed whether defendant engaged in preoffense conduct directed at a vulnerable victim for the primary purpose of victimization.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">In drafting OV 10, the Legislature did not intend that 15 points be assessed for preoffense conduct involving nothing more than run-of-the-mill planning to effect a crime or subsequent escape without detection. Rather, the focus of OV 10, including the assessment of points for predatory conduct, is on the exploitation of vulnerable victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Because the lower courts failed to properly apply OV 10 to the facts of this case, we vacate that portion of the Court of Appeals judgment concerning the scoring of that offense variable. We remand this case to the trial court to reconsider whether defendant engaged in predatory conduct as defined in OV 10 and for resentencing if he did not.</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-5\">Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Corrigan, Young, and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-10\"> MCL 777.40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"> MCL 750.157a; MCL 750.529.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-15\"><em> People v Morson, </em>471 Mich 248, 255; 685 NW2d 203 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-12\"> To ascertain legislative intent, we read the statutory provisions to produce a harmonious whole. <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 209; 501 NW2d 76 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\"> MCL 777.40(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> MCL 777.40(l)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> MCL 777.40(3)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"> MCL 777.40(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b246-10\"> <em>Apsey v Mem Hosp, </em>477 Mich 120, 127; 730 NW2d 695 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"> MCL 777.40(3)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\"> The absence of one of these factors does not preclude a finding of victim vulnerability when determining whether it is appropriate to assess 15 points for predatory conduct.
