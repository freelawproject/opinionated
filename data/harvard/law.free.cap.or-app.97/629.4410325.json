J.</author>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">1. In this declaratory judgment action, plaintiff seeks reversal of the trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs judgment against defendants Burton for fraud is not binding on the Burtons\u2019 assignee, defendant Administrative Services Co. (ASC). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In August, 1981, plaintiffs purchased a motel in John Day from the Burtons for $1,100,000. The transaction was memorialized in a land sale contract and a covenant not to compete. In May, 1982, the Burtons assigned their vendors\u2019 interest to ASC as security for a loan. The assignment was recorded. On March 1, 1983, plaintiffs filed an action against the Burtons for fraud in the sale of the motel. Plaintiffs prevailed, and their damages in the amount of $360,000, plus $75,000 attorney fees, were allowed as a setoff against the balance of the purchase price due under the contract. After the jury verdict was received, but before judgment was entered, ASC moved to intervene. The motion was denied. Defendants and ASC appealed and, in response to ASC\u2019s appeal, we held that it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to deny ASC\u2019s leave to intervene. We reasoned that the fraud judgment against the Burtons would not be binding on ASC and that, therefore, it was not an indispensable party. <em>Gerke v. Burton Enterprises, Inc., </em>80 Or App 714, 723 P2d 1061 (1986). We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201cMoreover, ASC, as the assignee for security of the sale contract, was not an indispensable party to plaintiffs\u2019 action for damages <em>for fraud, </em>ORCP 33, because that was a personal action against defendants which affirmed the validity of the contract. Accordingly, regardless of the merits of the court\u2019s ruling granting a setoff to plaintiffs against the contract balance, plaintiffs\u2019 judgment cannot determine their rights against ASC\u2019s interest. Whether plaintiffs\u2019 right to a setoff can affect or prejudice ASC\u2019s rights to proceeds of the contract cannot be adjudicated in this litigation to which ASC is not a party.\u201d 80 Or App at 722. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">2. Plaintiffs filed this action for declaratory relief in January, 1987, requesting a determination, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>things,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the amount that they owe ASC on the contract so that they could purchase clear title to the property. ASC has foreclosed its security interest in the contract and purchased the vendor\u2019s interest at a sheriffs sale. The trial court held that the offset that had been allowed against the Burtons in the fraud action was not binding on ASC and that, until plaintiffs establish the sellers\u2019 fraud in an action in which ASC is allowed to litigate that issue, plaintiffs are indebted to ASC for the entire balance due on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">ORS 43.130(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cIn other cases, the judgment, decree or order is, in respect to the matter directly determined, conclusive between the parties, their representatives and their successors in interest by title <em>subsequent to </em>the commencement of the action, suit or proceeding, litigating for the same thing, under the same title and in the same capacity.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Because ASC\u2019s interest was acquired <em>before </em>commencement of the fraud action against the Burtons, the judgment against the Burtons was not binding on it. It is true that an assignee takes subject to all defenses to a contract, including fraud, and that, if the sellers\u2019 assignee sues the buyer for money due under the contract, the buyer may defend on the ground that he was induced to enter into the contract by the seller\u2019s fraud. <em>United Finance Co. v. Kliks, </em>210 Or 288, 310 P2d 1103 (1957). The defense, however, must be proved in a proceeding that binds the assignee. <em>See Beers v. Beers, Administratrix, </em>204 Or 636, 639, 283 P2d 666 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\"> The complaint also sought a determination of all claims against the sums determined by the court to be due from plaintiffs to defendants Burton, their respective priorities and to whom the sums are payable. In response to ASC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs relied solely on their judgment against the Burtons and did not allege facts that would constitute fraud. The judgment entered determined all of the issues that were presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
