It contends that the evidence concerns the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior and should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Defendant was charged in a single indictment with three counts of sexual abuse in the first degree involving a girl who, at the time of trial in 1986, was 11 years old. He offered twelve items of evidence concerning the victim\u2019s past behavior. The court held a hearing and issued an order admitting evidence to establish the following:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">(1) The victim and her sister had claimed that a person other than defendant molested them in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">(2) The victim, her sister and mother discussed the 1982 alleged molestation and contrived a plan to spread rumors about the perpetrator\u2019s reputation and to run him out of town.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">(3) In 1982, the victim wrote a sexually explicit note to a boy at school and repeated that behavior in the past year.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">(4) The victim had received special sex counseling before her accusations against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">(5) Before the charged incident, the victim had watched pornographic films and had described oral copulation to a CSD worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">(6) On the basis of his interview with the victim, defendant\u2019s attorney concluded that the victim speaks freely about sex and is pre-occupied by the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>(7) According to CSD records, the victim had been molested twice before this alleged incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In its order, the court explained that items (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (7) are admissible under OEC 412 and \u201cgeneral rules of evidence\u201d and that item (6) is admissible under OEC 412 and as impeachment of the victim. The state argues that the trial court should have prohibited those seven items from being introduced under OEC 412,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Rape Shield Rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>which is designed to provide some protection to victims of sexual crimes from the disclosure of degrading and embarrassing details of their private lives by limiting the introduction of evidence concerning past sexual behavior. <em>See State v. Wattenberger, </em>97 Or App 414, 776 P2d 1292 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">1. When presented with an offer of such evidence, a trial court must follow a three-step analysis under OEC 412(1) and (2). First, it must determine whether the evidence concerns a victim\u2019s \u201cpast sexual behavior.\u201d If it does not, it is not appropriate for it to make further inquiry under OEC 412. Second, if the evidence does concern past sexual behavior, and is offered in the form of opinion or reputation, the court must deny its admission under OEC 412(1). If it is offered in some other form, then the court must determine whether the purpose of the offer fits within one of the exceptions in OEC 412(2)(b)(A), (B) or (C). If it does not, then the court may not admit the evidence. Third, if it does fit within an exception, the court must balance the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">2. Defendant initially contends that the state may not appeal the pretrial order, because the evidence does not concern the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior. Under OEC 412(3)(c), however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201c[a]n order admitting evidence under this subsection may be appealed by the government before trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The court\u2019s order cites OEC 412 as the basis for admitting the evidence. The state may appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The court\u2019s first step under OEC 412 is to determine whether the evidence concerns the victim\u2019s \u201cpast sexual behavior.\u201d On appeal, the state apparently assumes that the evidence falls into that category. Defendant contends that the facts alleged in his offer of proof involve acts that are either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>not behavior of the victim or are not sexual. OEC 412(4) provides only that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">\u201c[f]or purposes of this section, the term \u2018past sexual behavior\u2019 means sexual behavior other than the sexual behavior with respect to which rape, sodomy or sexual abuse or attempted rape, sodomy or sexual abuse is alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">3,4. We consider the meaning of the term in the context of the Criminal Code. <em>See </em>ORS 163.305(1), (6) and (7). We hold that \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d means a volitional or non-volitional physical act that the victim has performed for the purpose of the sexual stimulation or gratification of either the victim or another person or an act that is sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse or sexual contact, or an attempt to engage in such an act, between the victim and another person. Accordingly, items (3), (4, (5) and (6) do not concern \u201cpast sexual behavior.\u201d The trial court erred in addressing admissibility of those items under OEC 412; we need not decide whether they are otherwise admissible. Finally, items (1) and (2), at least to the extent that they concern previous sexual molestation of the victim, and (7) fall within the term \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d and must, therefore, be reviewed in the second step of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Under OEC 412(2)(b), evidence of a victim\u2019s past sexual behavior, offered in a form other than opinion or reputation, is admissible if it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">\u201c(A) Relates to the motive or bias of the alleged victim; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201c(B) Is necessary to rebut or explain scientific or medical evidence offered by the state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">\u201c(C) Is otherwise constitutionally required to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The trial court did not specify the particular subsection that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>requires admission of the evidence. Defendant argues that, if the evidence is of past sexual behavior, it is admissible under all three exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">5. Defendant argues, first, that it can be inferred that the victim has a motive to accuse him falsely, given her independent basis of knowledge of sexual matters and the sympathy and praise that she receives from reporting sexual molestations. However, motive or bias in the context of OEC 412 denotes a particularized motive or bias against the person offering the evidence. <em>See State v. Bass, </em>69 Or App 166, 169, 683 P2d 1040, <em>rev den </em>298 Or 238 (1984). Although the proffered evidence <em>might </em>show a <em>generalized </em>bias or motive, it does not address any <em>particularized </em>motive or bias that would lead the victim to fabricate the charge made against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">6. Defendant next argues that the evidence is relevant to rebut or explain the state\u2019s \u201cquasi-scientific\u201d or \u201cquasi-medical\u201d evidence that the victim is only aware of sexual matters because defendant allegedly abused her. However, the state\u2019s evidence is not \u201cscientific or medical evidence\u201d of the sort that a defendant may rebut under OEC 412(2)(b)(B). <em>See State v. Nab, </em>245 Or 454, 458, 421 P2d 388 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">7. Defendant argues, finally, that evidence of the victim\u2019s previous abuse must be admitted under the Oregon and federal Confrontation Clauses, so that he may show that the victim had a bias or prejudice to accuse him and that she had an alternative basis of knowledge about sexual matters. The Confrontation Clauses only require the admission of relevant evidence, <em>State v. Bender, </em>91 Or App 420, 423, 755 P2d 151, <em>rev den </em>306 Or 527 (1988), after the court has balanced its probative value against its prejudicial effect. <em>See State v. LeClair, </em>83 Or App 121, 129, 730 P2d 609 (1986), <em>rev den </em>303 Or 74 (1987). We have already determined that the evidence is not probative of any particularized motive or bias against defendant. Moreover, during the hearing, the state presented evidence that children of the victim\u2019s age would have some knowledge about sexual matters. Consequently, the state had not advanced the theory that defendant wished to rebut.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-12\"> The item numbers in this opinion correspond to the item numbers in the offer of proof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">Opinion Number Offer of Proof Number</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-14\">1 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">2 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-16\">3 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-17\">4 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-18\">5 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-19\">6 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUQ\">7 12</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-27\">The court reserved all questions of competency and ruled that the five other items of evidence are not admissible.

None of the changes from FRE 412 in OEC 412 is relevant to the scope of the term \u201cpast sexual behavior.\u201d <em>Commentary to Oregon Rules of Evidence </em>Rule 412 (1981). <em>Former </em>ORS 163.475 used the term \u201cprevious sexual conduct\u201d rather than \u201cpast sexual behavior.\u201d The legislative history of that statute indicates that the legislature did not mean that behavior would be \u201csexual\u201d just because it conceivably might have sexual connotations, such as swimming in the nude. Tape recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, April 23, 1975, Side 2. In adopting OEC 412, it does not appear to have been the intent of the legislature to change what had been the scope of the earlier statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> Because the evidence does not fall within an exception, we need not balance its probative value against its possible prejudicial impact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
