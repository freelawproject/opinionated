We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Generally, holiday pay is not considered earnings in determining the amount of unemployment benefits payable to a claimant. ORS 657.150(7). However, ORS 657.150(9) provides that holiday pay is considered as earnings in the determination of unemployment benefits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201cif the individual is away from work for a designated vacation period:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">&lt;&lt;* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201c(b) By reason of an employer custom, practice or policy established by prior experience * * *.\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The question in this case is whether petitioner\u2019s yearly holiday season closure is a \u201cdesignated vacation period\u201d under ORS 657.150(9). Petitioner argues that EAB erred in interpreting the pertinent statutes and that its conclusion that the closure is not a \u201cdesignated vacation period\u201d is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">1. For the last ten years, petitioner has shut down for one or two weeks during the Christmas holiday season. Employes received holiday pay for December 25, 26 and 29, 1986, and January 1 and 2,1987, and the entire plant was shut down from December 25, 1986, to January 3, 1987. Some departments closed December 22 through December 24,1986; others did not. Employes received holiday pay for December 25 and 28,1987, and January 1,1988, and the entire plant was shut down from December 20, 1987, to January 2, 1988. Employes had the option to take vacation pay or leave without pay for the non-holidays during the closure period or, if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>were not entitled to any paid vacation days, they could \u201cborrow\u201d vacation hours.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claimants here chose to take unpaid days of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">EAB concluded that petitioner\u2019s Christmas closure did not come within the exception of ORS 657.150(9) (b) for designated vacation periods \u201cby reason of an employer custom, practice or policy established by prior experience.\u201d The reasons for EAB\u2019s decision were that the employer had not designated the time period as \u201cvacation,\u201d employes were not required to take the time off as paid vacation and the dates of the shutdown varied among petitioner\u2019s departments. Further, EAB concluded that the shutdown was principally for the convenience and economic benefit of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Petitioner argues that EAB erred as a matter of law in concluding that, in order for a period to be a \u201cdesignated vacation period\u201d under ORS 657.150(9)(b), an employer must require its employes to take <em>paid </em>vacation. ORS 657.150(9) does not define a \u201cvacation period\u201d as a paid vacation; it does not define the phrase at all. Instead, it states that, <em>if </em>an employe is given vacation pay during a period designated by the employer, the payment will be considered earnings. In <em>Allard v. Employment Div., </em>79 Or App 665, 669, 719 P2d 1325 (1986), we held that \u201c[t]here is nothing in ORS 657.150(9) and (10) which requires that a claimant receive vacation pay in order for a period away from work to be considered a \u2018designated vacation.\u2019 \u201d Further, the legislative history indicates that the purpose was to distinguish between layoffs and customary shutdowns with unemployment benefits being made available only when layoffs were involved, but not for regular, customary shutdowns. Minutes, House Committee on Labor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>February 7, 1983, 8-11. In the legislative discussions, petitioner\u2019s holiday closure was used as an example of a customary shutdown. Minutes, House Committee on Labor, January 21, 1983, 3; Minutes, House Committee on Labor, February 7, 1983, 7, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">2. The other principal rationale relied upon by EAB was that the holiday closure was motivated by the company\u2019s concerns and was not primarily for the employes\u2019 benefit. However, ORS 657.150(9) and (10) do not require that the shutdown be primarily for the benefit of employes in order to be considered a \u201cdesignated vacation period.\u201d The fact that petitioner\u2019s customary closure occurred at a time when business was otherwise typically slow does not compel the conclusion that it is not a \u201cdesignated vacation period\u201d by reason of the employer\u2019s custom or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">3. EAB also relied on the fact that there were variations in the closure dates among petitioner\u2019s different departments. Again, neither the language of the statute nor the legislative history requires that closures be precisely the same every year. <em>See Bergun v. Employment Division, </em>81 Or App 580, 726 P2d 1202 (1986). Minor variations between department closures in a particular year do not support the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s closures were not customary and regular.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">4. Finally, EAB relied on the fact that petitioner did not specifically label the closures as \u201cvacation.\u201d The employe policy handbooks apparently did not label the period \u201cvacation,\u201d but called it \u201cChristmas week closure\u201d or \u201ccalendar year-end closure.\u201d However, nothing in ORS 657.150(9) or ORS 657.150(10) requires that a \u201cdesignated vacation period\u201d be called a \u201cvacation\u201d by the employer. Petitioner\u2019s yearly closure is a time designated by custom and policy for employes to be off work and is a vacation in the common usage of the word, even if not technically labeled \u201cvacation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">5. Petitioner\u2019s holiday closure was a \u201cdesignated vacation period\u201d by reason of an \u201cemployer custom, practice or policy established by prior experience.\u201d ORS 656.150(9)(b). Therefore, holiday pay for that time must be considered as earnings in determining claimant\u2019s unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Reversed and remanded for reconsideration not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-11\"> ORS 657.150(10) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-12\">\u201cNotwithstanding subsection (7) of this section, payment which has been, is or will be paid to an individual for a holiday which occurs within a vacation period designated pursuant to subsection (9) of this section shall be considered as earnings in the determination of the amount of benefits payable as provided in subsection (6) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> The 1984 Tektronix Employee Handbook, which was effective for the 1986-87 closure, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201cEach year at Christmas time most Tek locations close for a week.
