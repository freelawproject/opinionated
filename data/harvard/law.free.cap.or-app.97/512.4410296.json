We review for substantial evidence and errors of law. ORS 656.298(6); <em>Armstrong v. Asten-Hill Co., </em>90 Or App 200, 206, 752 P2d 312 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Claimant injured his left knee in October, 1986, when he jumped approximately five feet to the ground from a loading dock of employer. The injury occurred as claimant was leaving work to go home after completing his shift. He jumped from the dock rather than use a nearby flight of stairs. The issue is whether his injury is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">To be compensable, an injury must arise out of and in the course of employment. <em>Former </em>ORS dSd.OOS\u00cdSRa).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cIf the injury has sufficient work relationship, then it arises out of and in the course of employment * * <em>Rogers v. SAIF, </em>289 Or 633, 643, 616 P2d 485 (1980). An on-premises injury has sufficient work relationship if it occurs while the employe is leaving work, unless the employe was engaged in conduct not expressly or impliedly allowed by the employer. <em>Clark v. U.S. Plywood, </em>288 Or 255, 260-61, 266-67, 605 P2d 265 (1980); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>also Bailey v.

U.S. Plywood, supra, </em>does not apply to an employe who is engaged in \u201cgoing and coming activities.\u201d <em>Clark </em>is not so limited.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board made an error of law in failing to apply <em>Clark.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Because the Board did not apply the standard contained in <em>Clark, </em>it also did not make all of the necessary findings. Claimant\u2019s on-premises injury occurred as he was leaving work. Therefore, whether his injury is compensable turns on whether employer expressly or impliedly allowed him to jump from the dock.
