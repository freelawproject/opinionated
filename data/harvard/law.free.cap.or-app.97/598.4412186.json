He contends that the court erred in admitting hearsay testimony and in not granting his motion for a mistrial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Defendant was indicted for rape in the first degree, ORS 163.375, and sodomy in the first degree, ORS 163.405, arising from conduct involving his daughter, who was then six years old.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of trial, she was eight years old. She testified that, while she was visiting defendant at his home in the summer of 1985,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he took her into his room, made her undress, took off his clothes, touched her \u201cprivate spot\u201d and put his penis in her mouth. She also testified that she did not report the incident to her mother until March, 1986, because defendant had threatened to kill her mother if she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">After the victim had testified, two physicians testified about their interviews with and examinations of her. Both physicians recounted her identification of defendant as the person who had abused her and her statements concerning the incident. Their recitation of what the victim had said was similar to her testimony. The court allowed the doctors\u2019 testimony over defendant\u2019s pretrial objection and his objection during the first doctor\u2019s testimony that it was inadmissible hearsay. The jury found defendant guilty of first degree sodomy and not guilty of rape in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">1. Defendant objected to the physicians\u2019 testimony only on the ground that it was hearsay. The state argued that the testimony was admissible as a statement for medical diagnosis or treatment. OEC 803(4). That rule provides that certain statements are not excluded as hearsay, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201cStatements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain or sensations, or the inception or general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>character of the cause of external source thereof in so far as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The state argues that, under <em>State v. Vosika, </em>83 Or App 298, 731 P2d 449, <em>clarified </em>85 Or App 148, 735 P2d 1273 (1987), the evidence is admissible, despite the fact that it identified defendant as the perpetrator. <em>See </em>OEC 803(18a). In <em>Vosika, </em>we adopted an interpretation of OEC 803(4) that paralleled the interpretation of FRE 803(4) in <em>United States v. Iron Shell, </em>633 F2d 77 (8th Cir 1980), <em>cert den </em>450 US 1001 (1981). First, the declarant\u2019s motive in making the statement to the medical provider must be to promote treatment or diagnosis and, second, the content of the statement must be such as the provider would reasonably rely on in treatment or diagnosis. We held that the three-year-old declarant was too young to understand the purposes of her statements to the physician and that his testimony regarding her statements was not admissible under OEC 803(4). We did conclude, however, that the child\u2019s statements to the doctor met the second part of the <em>Iron Shell </em>test. It was, we said, important for diagnosis and treatment for the physician to know, <em>inter alia, </em>the identity of the victim\u2019s abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">2. Unlike in <em>Vosika, </em>the record here supports a finding that the victim understood that she was being interviewed and examined by the doctors for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. At the time of the physical examination, the victim was seven years old. The child\u2019s mother accompanied her to the doctor\u2019s offices for the examination. She testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201cQ. Did you go into the room where the medical examination was done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>In the beginning, yes. But not while the exam was taking place; I wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201cQ. How long were you in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201cA. <em>Just long enough to introduce [the victim] and tell her what she was there for and she was a doctor and I went out in the waiting room.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">\u201cQ. And what did you say during the time you and Dr. Bays and [the victim] were together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\"><em>\u201cA. Just she was a doctor and she had to examine her like any other doctor had, and that she could trust her, and be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>honest with her. And if she asked questions, to answer questions. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Dr. Bays also testified about her first encounter with the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">\u201cQ. Would you describe what [she] said to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201c[Objection raised and overruled].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201cA. I asked her, usually ask the children, <em>\u2018Do you know why you came to see meV And she said, \u2018Because I have been </em>abused.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">There is no basis to conclude that a seven-year-old child cannot or that this child did not understand that the purpose of the interviews was for diagnosis or treatment related to child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Here, as in <em>Vosika, </em>the victim\u2019s statements were such as a physician would reasonably rely on for diagnosis or treatment. Dr. Bays, one of the examining physicians, testified that she needed a complete history, including the name of the abuser, in order to diagnose child abuse properly and to treat the resulting physical and psychological harm. The court did not err in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">3. Defendant also contends that the court erred in denying his motion for mistrial. The mother of the victim had been married to defendant at the time of the crime, but the marriage had been dissolved before trial. The mother testified that she and defendant had separated a number of times during the marriage and that the last separation was in January, 1983. The prosecutor then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">\u201cQ. Without telling me the specifics, what were your feelings toward [defendant] at the time of that separation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">\u201cA. Very afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">\u201cQ. Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-14\">\u201cA. Very afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-15\">\u201cQ. Why were you afraid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-16\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: She can testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-18\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, she is not on trial. These aren\u2019t allegations regarding her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: She can testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201cBY [Prosecutor]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">\u201cQ. Please answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cA. Because I had been beaten and raped and because he was starting to abuse the children, Scott specifically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Defendant again objected and subsequently moved for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Defendant\u2019s first objection to the testimony was not comprehensible, but he finally argued to the trial court that the witnesses\u2019 statements were evidence of other \u201cbad acts\u201d that should be excluded. The court struck the testimony after ruling on defendant\u2019s objection but denied the motion for mistrial. It instructed the jury to disregard the statements. Defendant argues that the evidence was so damaging that the cautionary instruction was not sufficient to remove the taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">If there was a trial disaster, defendant was, in part, its architect. He intended to introduce evidence that the victim\u2019s mother had made an allegation that he had raped her during the time when they were separated. The state asked for a pretrial ruling on the admission of that evidence. The court did not rule on the matter precisely. During his opening statement, defendant\u2019s counsel said that the evidence would show that the mother claimed that defendant had raped her on two occasions. He presented such evidence and discussed it in closing argument. The trial court was understandably confused as to why defendant would object to evidence that he had intended to offer. In the context of the evidence, the arguments and the court\u2019s instruction, we conclude that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\"> Another charge stemming from the incident, sexual abuse, ORS 163.425, was dismissed before trial. Defendant was separately indicted for sodomy of his son. The court dismissed that charge during the consolidated trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\"> At the time of the incident, defendant and the children\u2019s mother were separated. However, the couple\u2019s three children visited defendant throughout the summer of 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
