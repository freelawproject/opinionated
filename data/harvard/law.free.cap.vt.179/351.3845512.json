Contractor Ernest Salo appeals from a superior court order awarding him only a portion of his attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to Vermont\u2019s prompt payment act, 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 4007(c), against owners George Charos, John Charos, and Patricia Costello. The case arises out of a contract under which contractor was to remodel owners\u2019 house. Contractor prevailed below on his claims for breach of contract and conversion, and on owners\u2019 claims for defective workmanship, but the superior court did not award him all of his attorneys\u2019 fees. On appeal, contractor argues that the trial court erred when it: (1) separated out the percentage of the total verdict that represented the payment-withholding claim from the claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>breach of contract and conversion, and awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under the prompt payment act only for that portion of the fees associated -with the payment-withholding claim; and (2) specifically disallowed attorneys\u2019 fees associated with unsuccessful mandatory and voluntary mediation. We reverse and remand for imposition of a new attorneys\u2019 fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b6 2. In the spring of 2001, contractor entered into an oral contract with owners to expand owners\u2019 vacation home in Jamaica, Vermont. Contractor was to construct a one-story addition with two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a loft over an existing garage. The parties did not enter into a single, written contract regarding the construction, but instead made plans through a series of conversations and e-mail correspondence. Contractor began work on the project in early summer 2001. As work progressed, owners made periodic payments by check or cash, and contractor used the funds to buy supplies and pay employees. In September 2001, contractor requested additional funds from owners in order to complete the construction. At one point he left owners a ledger sheet marking expenses and payments received, and indicating that his unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses were $2,600. Owners responded by leaving a message demanding that contractor stay away from the property or risk being arrested for trespass. As a result, contractor was unable to retrieve ladders and building materials he had left on the premises before the falling-out. On January 2, 2002, contractor\u2019s lawyer sent owners a letter detailing the amount contractor claimed was owed to him. The letter claimed a total of $7,231: (1) $3,218 for unreimbursed materials; (2) $3,040 for unreimbursed labor; and (3) $973 for three ladders owned by contractor but kept by owners. Owners paid no additional funds to contractor and eventually hired a new contractor to complete the project with modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b6 3. Due to the lack of payment by owners, contractor was unable to pay an electrical subcontractor who had worked on the home addition. Subcontractor, who is not a party in this appeal, eventually sued owners for the amount owed and filed a mechanics\u2019 lien on owners\u2019 property. Owners then impleaded contractor as a third-party defendant alleging breach of contract, among other reasons, for defective construction, and claiming compensatory and punitive damages. Contractor answered the third-party complaint and counterclaimed for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, and violation of Vermont\u2019s prompt payment act, 9 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4001-4009. He sought the amount due under the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>payment for extras, sums for the value of materials and business equipment left on site, as well as interest and attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b6 4. Prior to trial, the parties engaged in both court-ordered and voluntary mediation, but neither led to a settlement and there was no agreement that either party would bear the costs associated with the mediation attempts. The case was tried to a jury, and the verdict was for contractor on each of his claims and against owners on each of theirs. The jury awarded contractor $1,000 for breach of contract, $600 for money wrongfully withheld by the plaintiffs in violation of the prompt payment act, and $4,941 for conversion of property, for a total award of $6,541.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b6 5. In accordance with the favorable verdict, contractor filed a motion seeking attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 4007(c), prejudgment interest on the damages awards for breach of contract and conversion, interest under \u00a7 4002(d), penalties under \u00a7 4007(b), and attorneys\u2019 fees for bad faith litigation if statutory attorneys\u2019 fees were not awarded. After receiving subsequently ordered affidavits, the trial judge awarded prejudgment interest on the breach-of-contract award, but not on the conversion claim, and declined to award attorneys\u2019 fees based upon bad faith litigation. The court found contractor to be the \u201csubstantially prevailing party\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4007(c), but limited its award of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest under the statute to an amount in proportion to that part of the overall judgment that represented recovery of the wrongfully-withheld contract payment. Finding that the contractor received a total judgment award of $6,541, of which $600, or about 10 percent, was for sums wrongfully withheld in violation of the prompt payment act, the court awarded contractor attorneys\u2019 fees only in the amount of $3,745, or approximately 10 percent, of his claimed $37,445.91 total for attorneys\u2019 fees. The court also noted that part of the attorneys\u2019 fees contractor claimed were for legal services in connection with the mediations and ruled it \u201c[in]appropriate to award costs or fees for mediation to [contractor] because both parties are required to participate in mediation per Court order.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court did not award attorneys\u2019 fees for contractor\u2019s breach-of-contract claims and defenses, or for his conversion claim. Contractor now appeals this limitation on attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 4007(c), and appeals the trial court\u2019s specific decision to deny attorneys\u2019 fees for mediation-related expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u00b6 6. Contractor bases his claim for attorneys\u2019 fees on the prompt payment act, which in relevant part provides that \u201cthe substantially prevailing party in any proceeding to recover any payment within the scope of this chapter shall be awarded reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount to be determined by the court or arbitrator, together with expenses.\u201d 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 4007(c). The statute creates an exception to the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d which generally provides that parties to litigation are responsible for their own attorneys\u2019 fees regardless of the litigation outcome. <em>Galkin v. Town of Chester, </em>168 Vt. 82, 91, 716 A.2d 25, 31 (1998). Under the statute, if a party has substantially prevailed as specified in the statute, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is mandatory. <em>Fletcher Hill, Inc. v. Crosbie, </em>2005 VT 1, \u00b6 12, 178 Vt. 77, 872 A.2d 292. We review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b6 7. Contractor argues that he is entitled to an award of all the attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred, including the fees necessary to meet and defeat owners\u2019 third-party claims, because the wording of \u00a7 4007(c) requires it, and because it is impossible to separate the dispute into component parts by cause of action as the trial court attempted. In general, we agree and begin our analysis with the second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b6 8. Although the jury separated its verdict into three components in response to the jury charge and interrogatories, it had substantial flexibility in how it labeled the award, especially because the contract between contractor and owners was oral, with little specificity in its terms. Under the prompt payment act, the contractor is entitled to submit periodic invoices to the owner for progress payments, and the owner must pay invoices within twenty days. 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 4002(b), (c). Contractor claimed that his lawyer\u2019s letter of January 2002 was an invoice under the statute, and it sought a progress payment covering both labor and materials. Under the jury charge, the labor component could be covered in the verdict as breach-of-contract damages, damages for failure to make prompt payment on the invoice, or both. The materials component could be covered under breach of contract, failure to make prompt payment, or conversion. Only contractor\u2019s claim that owners kept some of his tools and equipment could not fit easily under the prompt-payment count.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b6 9. We addressed a very similar situation in <em>L\u2019Esperance v. Benware, </em>2003 VT 43, \u00b6\u00b6 22-25, 175 Vt. 292, 830 A.2d 675. In that case, the tenants made eight claims against their landlords, including consumer fraud for renting a house that was known to be in violation of health and safety codes. The jury awarded compensatory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>punitive damages on this claim. The trial court awarded the tenants all of their attorneys\u2019 fees under the Consumer Fraud Act, 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 2461(b), even though they prevailed on other claims, including claims that the landlords failed to return a security deposit and were negligent in renting the house with unsafe water. In response to the landlords\u2019 argument that attorneys\u2019 fees could not be awarded for time spent on non-Consumer-Fraud-Act claims, the court held that all of the claims involved a common core of facts that justified awarding fees for all time spent on the case. We affirmed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit is not one which can be viewed as a series of discrete claims so that the hours expended can be divided on a claim-by-claim basis. In the practice of law, it is quite common to have several claims arise out of a common core of facts____The court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the cases involved a common core of facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 24 (citations and quotations omitted). In reaching this conclusion, we relied particularly on <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424 (1983), an attomeys\u2019-fees case under the federal Civil Rights Act in which the plaintiff had prevailed on some issues and not others. In response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff could receive fees only for the claims on which plaintiff prevailed, the Court in <em>Hensley </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">Much of counsel\u2019s time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis. Such a lawsuit cannot be viewed as a series of discrete claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 435. The Court also rejected the approach of comparing the number of issues on which plaintiff prevailed to the number of issues overall. <em>Id. </em>at 436 n.11 (\u201cSuch a ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable fee in light of all relevant factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">\u00b6 10. Here, as in <em>L\u2019Esperance, </em>the claims at issue share a common core of facts and multiple theories of recovery. Virtually all of the evidence is relevant to all of the claims. The lawsuit cannot \u201cbe viewed as a series of discrete claims.\u201d <em>L\u2019Esperance, </em>203 VT 43, \u00b6 24. Apportioning the fee award based on the recovery on each claim was an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">\u00b6 11. We also agree with contractor\u2019s second point, that allowing full attorneys\u2019-fees recovery where there is a common core of facts is consistent with the language of the statute. The statute authorizes contractor to recover attorneys\u2019 fees if he is the substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>prevailing party \u201cin <em>any </em>proceeding to recover <em>any </em>payment within the scope of this chapter.\u201d 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 4007(c) (emphasis added). Nothing in the statute limits attorneys\u2019-fees recovery to representation associated with a payment-withholding claim, to the exclusion of recovery for representation for other claims, such as breach of contract, arising out of the same controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b6 12. There are practical and policy reasons to apply the statute relatively broadly. A claim of failure to pay will virtually always be met with some defense that reflects a breakdown in the working relationship between the owner and the contractor \u2014 for example, as here, a defense of breach of contract or defective workmanship. In fact, the prompt payment act specifically contemplates owners withholding payments in good faith on grounds such as \u201cunsatisfactory job progress, defective construction, disputed work or third-party claims.\u201d 9 V.S.A. \u00a7 4007(a). It will always be possible to use different labels and theories to describe claims and defenses. The purpose of the prompt payment act is to provide protection against nonpayment to contractors and subcontractors. See <em>R.W. Sidley, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>319 F. Supp. 2d 554, 560 (W.D. Pa. 2004) (decided under virtually identical Pennsylvania statute). If the statute\u2019s attorneys\u2019-fees authorization is read narrowly, as the trial court read it here, contractors and subcontractors will not be able to recoup collection costs even when they are found to have fully complied with their contractual obligations. Similarly, owners who demonstrate that they should not have to pay a contractor\u2019s bill because of nonperformance or poor-quality work may end up, through a narrow reading of the attorneys\u2019 fee provision, paying attorneys\u2019 fees that exceed the amount of their nonpayment. We believe that the Legislature intended a more effective remedy provision than the trial court allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b6 13. Significantly, our most relevant precedent, <em>DJ Painting, Inc. v. Baraw Enterprises, Inc., </em>172 Vt. 239, 776 A.2d 413 (2001), supports a broad reading of the attorneys\u2019-fee authorization consistent with its remedial purpose. In <em>DJ Painting, </em>a painting subcontractor brought a breach of contract and wrongful termination action against the general contractor and the owner. The subcontractor made no claim under the prompt payment act. On summary judgment, the claims against the general contractor were dismissed because the subcontractor failed to submit them to arbitration as required by the contract. We affirmed the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the contractor under \u00a7 4007(c) because the contractor was the substantially pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>vailing party \u201cin a \u2018proceeding to recover any payment\u2019 due under a construction contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 776 A.2d at 420. It made no difference to this conclusion that the subcontractor\u2019s theories of recovery were based on the common law \u2014 breach of contract and wrongful termination \u2014 and the contractor made no claim under the prompt payment act. <em>Id. </em>Nor was the contractor\u2019s recovery reduced because of the nature of the subcontractor\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>For the exact reason that the contractor was able to recover all of his attorneys\u2019 fees in <em>DJ Painting, </em>the contractor should be able to recover all of his fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b6 14. Before addressing the relief appropriate for the trial court\u2019s general error in addressing the attorneys\u2019-fee award, we turn to contractor\u2019s additional argument that the court erred in failing to award fees related to mediation. The trial court ruled that it would not award attorneys\u2019 fees associated with mandatory or voluntary mediation in this case because \u201cboth parties must participate in such mediation.\u201d This rationale for refusing to award attorneys\u2019 fees in mediation activity is cryptic and, with respect to the voluntary mediation, partially inaccurate. Many of the steps in litigation are mandatory; we do not understand what differentiates mediation in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b6 15. Our main difficulty with the court\u2019s reasoning, however, is that instead of justifying its denial of attorneys\u2019 fees for participation in mediation, its rationale speaks to why we should in fact allow such recovery. Mediation has become an important part of litigation in this state. See <em>Gates v. Gates, </em>168 Vt. 64, 72, 716 A.2d 794, 800 (1998) (acknowledging crucial role of alternative dispute resolution in settling disputes). Our civil rules now require parties to attempt alternative dispute resolution in many types of civil cases, see V.R.C.P. 16.3(a)(2); usually this is mediation. The purpose of alternative dispute resolution in most cases is to achieve a voluntary settlement of the litigation without a trial and with as little litigation expense as possible. See <em>New Eng. Educ. Training Serv., Inc. v. Silver St. P\u2019ship, </em>148 Vt. 99, 101, 528 A.2d 1117, 1118 (1987) (\u201c[Cjompromises of disputed liability are favored by the courts as a matter of public policy.\u201d); <em>Dutch Hill Inn, Inc. v. Patten, </em>131 Vt. 187, 192, 303 A.2d 811, 814 (1973) (\u201cPublic policy ... strongly favors settlement of disputed claims without litigation.\u201d). To the extent we deny recovery for attorneys\u2019 fees for participating in mediation on prompt payment act disputes, we discourage parties from voluntary participation or encourage only minimal participation. For this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>reason, other courts have held that attorneys\u2019 fees can be awarded for representation in mediation. See <em>Paris v. Dallas Airmotive, Inc., </em>2004 WL 2100227, at *8 (N.D. Tex.) (awarding fees for services of lawyer who specialized in mediation and noting that although no settlement resulted, decision to put special resources into mediation was reasonable); <em>E.M. v. Millville Bd. of Educ., </em>849 F. Supp. 312, 315 (D.N.J. 1994) (allowing attorneys\u2019 fees for work related to mediation). We agree that, absent an agreement between the parties that provides otherwise, attorneys\u2019 fees may be recovered for the-participation in mediation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b6 16. We also find no support in the statutory language for the court\u2019s decision with respect to representation in mediation. Section 4007(c) states that \u201cthe substantially prevailing party in <em>any proceed</em>ing\u201d shall recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). To the extent that the language suggests dividing litigation into stages, mediation is clearly a \u201cproceeding\u201d and falls within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b6 17. For the above reasons, we hold that the court erred in both limiting contractor\u2019s attorneys\u2019-fee award to reflect the proportion of the recovery for violation of the prompt payment act and in denying recovery for legal fees related to mediation. Ordinarily, we would remand for the trial court to exercise its discretion and fashion an award in light of the considerations we have announced in this opinion. For example, the determination of whether there is a common core of facts, and to what extent, is normally entrusted to the trial court in the first instance. See <em>L\u2019Esperance, </em>2003 VT 43, \u00b6 24 (affirming trial court\u2019s finding of a core of operative facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b6 18. Nevertheless, we conclude that such a remand is unnecessary. The court found that contractor was the substantially prevailing party, so an award of attorneys\u2019 fees was mandatory. Contractor\u2019s fee request was supported by a lengthy and detailed affidavit of an experienced commercial litigator. The court did not question the reasonableness of the fees charged by contractor\u2019s counsel or the time expended in the litigation, and based its calculation on those fees. Neither the trial court nor the parties sought the kind of adjustment discussed in <em>L\u2019Esperance. </em>Contractor apparently received close to the damages he sought, defeated all third-party claims, and recovered on every theory he raised. While the trial court may have indicated that the case was close and that owners\u2019 \u201cclaims were not meritless,\u201d a fee award is compensatory, so owners\u2019 good faith in pursuing their claims is not a significant factor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Perhaps most importantly, we hold as a matter of law that there was a common core of facts shared among every claim on which contractor recovered. Thus, consideration of this question by the trial court is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b6 19. The affidavits of contractor\u2019s counsel and the commercial litigator who served as contractor\u2019s expert witness on fees indicate that contractor incurred attorneys\u2019 fees of $43,244, some of which was for expenses. Contractor is entitled to an award of fees in this amount. In addition, contractor has sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees for representation on appeal in accordance with Vermont Rule of Appellate Procedure 39(f). On appropriate motion in accordance with that rule, contractor is entitled to additional fees because he has prevailed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
