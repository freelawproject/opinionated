Lynda L. FRANKLIN</parties>\n<citation data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b541-8\">[883 A.2d 783]</citation>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b541-9\">No. 03-280</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AmA\">August 2, 2005.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\">\u00b6 1. Defendant, Lynda Franklin, was convicted of perjury pursuant to 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 2901 based on her testimony given during a prior prosecution for driving while intoxicated (DWI), that she had not operated a vehicle while she was intoxicated. Defendant appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">\u00b6 2. Defendant and Garth Ely were living together when police responded to Ely\u2019s telephone call informing police that defendant was drunk and had driven a vehicle while intoxicated. That day, Ely gave a statement to the police that defendant drove a truck to her parent\u2019s house. Three criminal proceedings arose out of this one incident. First, the State charged defendant with DWI. During the DWI trial, the State asked defendant if she had operated the vehicle on that day. She answered, \u201cNo I did not. I didn\u2019t operate it.\u201d Contrary to statements he gave earlier, Ely testified during defendant\u2019s DWI trial that defendant had not operated the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">\u00b6 3. Second, Ely was charged with and convicted of perjury based on the statement he made during defendant\u2019s DWI trial. This charge resulted from an investigation of a domestic assault complaint made by defendant against Ely. During the investigation, a police officer videotaped Ely making a statement concerning the facts surrounding the DWI charge against defendant. Ely\u2019s statement conflicted with his testimony at defendant\u2019s DWI trial, and resulted in his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">\u00b6 4. Third, the State charged defendant with perjury, and she was convicted. Defendant appeals her perjury conviction, which was based on her testimony during the DWI prosecution where she denied operating a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">\u00b6 5. Defendant argues on appeal that: (1) it was plain error to admit Ely\u2019s h&gt; court testimony, Ely\u2019s videotaped statement, and Ely\u2019s perjury conviction; (2) without Ely\u2019s testimony, insufficient evidence existed to convict defendant of perjury; and (3) the court committed reversible error when it did not rule on defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">\u00b6 6. At trial, defendant failed to object to the admission of Ely\u2019s testimony. As a result, we review for plain error only. Plain error occurs when there is glaring error so grave that it strikes at the very heart of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights or it affects the fair administration of justice. <em>State v. Oscarson, </em>2004 VT 4, \u00b6 27, 176 Vt. 176, 845 A.2d 337; <em>State v. Ladabouche, </em>146 Vt. 279, 281, 502 A.2d 852, 854 (1985). To reverse for plain error, we must find not only that the error seriously affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights, but also that it had an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>Oscarson, </em>2004 VT 4, \u00b6 27; <em>State v. Mears, </em>170 Vt. 336, 341, 749 A.2d 600, 604-05 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">\u00b6 7. In the present perjury case against defendant for lying under oath during her DWI trial, the State introduced Ely\u2019s perjury conviction, Ely\u2019s in-court testimony regarding defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle, and Ely\u2019s statements given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>during a videotaped interview with a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b6 8. The trial court properly admitted Ely\u2019s perjury conviction of February 25, 2002. Section 2907 of Title 13 prohibits a court from receiving \u201c[t]he oath of a person convicted of perjury ... in a proceeding in court.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, \u00a7 2907 does not require exclusion of evidence of a perjury conviction because its admission does not depend upon the perjurer\u2019s oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b6 9. The trial court erred, however, by admitting Ely\u2019s in-court testimony because earlier Ely had been convicted of perjury for statements he made during defendant\u2019s DWI trial. He was, therefore, not a competent witness under \u00a7 2907. He was also incompetent to testify pursuant to 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1608, which states that a person convicted of perjury is incompetent to testify in court. Consequently, the court was not permitted to accept his oath.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Even though this testimony added context for the perjury conviction, the Information and Criminal Charge Disposition Report filed against Ely and admitted into evidence reflects that Ely lied under oath at defendant\u2019s DWI trial. Thus, the perjury conviction is relevant without Ely\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">\u00b6 10. We conclude that defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by the admission of Ely\u2019s testimony because the record reveals that, on balance, Ely\u2019s live testimony actually supported the defense and not the prosecution. Moreover, even if the videotaped statement was inadmissible, we conclude that the admissible evidence supported defendant\u2019s conviction. We, therefore, find no glaring error requiring reversal under our plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">\u00b6 11. During trial, the State called Ely to testify, but his testimony largely supported defendant\u2019s claim that she did not lie when she denied driving while intoxicated. First, Ely repeatedly testified that defendant did not drive the truck. He testified that he lied when he told the police that defendant had driven the truck, and testified that defendant never started the truck. Ely also testified that he lied when he gave the statement to police on the day of the incident because he was upset, and he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have said she drove the truck,\u201d but that a police officer \u201ctold [him] to write that down\u201d in his written statement. He further explained that he \u201cwas pissed off,\u201d and he was \u201ctrying to get back at her,\u201d when he lied to the police during the domestic assault investigation. We therefore conclude that Ely\u2019s testimony during defendant\u2019s perjury trial benefitted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">\u00b6 12. Defendant contends that \u201c[w]ithout [Ely\u2019s] testimony ... the evidence was necessarily insufficient to sustain a conviction for perjury.\u201d We disagree. In a prosecution for perjury, previous inconsistent statements given by the defendant standing alone are not sufficient to support a perjury conviction. But a defendant\u2019s conflicting statements are competent evidence of perjury if corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses. <em>State v. Woolley, </em>109 Vt. 53, 57, 62, 192 A. 1, 3-5 (1937) (\u201c[T]he testimony of one ... witness, corroborated by the testimony of another or by circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>stances, is sufficient, if thereby the crime is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>State v. Tonzola, </em>159 Vt. 491, 497-98, 621 A.2d 243, 246 (1993) (relying on <em>Woolley). </em>We have further explained that: \u201c\u2018[T]he independent corroborating evidence must be equal in weight to the testimony of another witness, and it must be, by itself, inconsistent with the innocence of the defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>Tonzola, </em>159 Vt. at 497, 621 A.2d at 246 (quoting <em>People v. Fueston, </em>717 P.2d 978, 980 (Colo. Ct. App. 1985)). \u201c\u2018[E]aeh witness or piece of corroborating evidence[, however,] need not independently prove false every aspect of the allegedly perjured testimony.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497-98, 621 A.2d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b6 13. In the present case, independent evidence tending to corroborate the State\u2019s case was introduced to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant committed perjuiy; thus, no plain error occurred. Defendant gave a number of inconsistent statements. Defendant\u2019s previous inconsistent statements were offered and properly admitted as competent evidence supporting the perjury charge. See <em>Woolley, </em>109 Vt. at 62, 192 A. at 5 (stating that defendant\u2019s conflicting statements are competent evidence if corroborated by other witnesses). A police officer testified that soon after the incident defendant stated on two different occasions that she had driven the truck. She told the officer at her home that \u201cshe had dr[u]nk ten beers ... and she had .. .[driven] the vehicle to her parent\u2019s house.\u201d Further, the officer testified that on the way to the police barracks defendant stated that she had driven the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b6 14. Despite defendant\u2019s admissions that she drove the truck, she testified during her DWI trial that she had not driven the vehicle. At the perjury trial, this evidence was admitted through a State witness who read defendant\u2019s testimony from her DWI trial. During the DWI trial, the State asked defendant if she told the officer that she had driven the vehicle. She said, \u201cI did, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014\u25a0 it was more like in the sarcastic way.\u201d Shortly after she made this statement, she testified that she did not drive the vehicle. Her previous admissions, together with her testimony at her DWI trial, create two conflicting statements. See <em>id. </em>at 62-64, 192 A. at 5-6 (relying on two of defendant\u2019s conflicting statements, one after the incident and the other under oath, to conclude that defendant committed perjury); see also <em>Tonzola, </em>159 Vt. at 498, 621 A.2d at 246 (relying on defendant\u2019s false statement under oath and corroboration from testimony by other witness as evidence of perjury).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b6 15. In addition, independent, corroborating evidence was introduced at defendant\u2019s perjury trial demonstrating that defendant lied during her DWI trial when she denied operation. Court records reflecting that Ely lied under oath at defendant\u2019s DWI trial were admitted, including the Information filed against Ely and the Criminal Charge Disposition Report. These records show that Ely was convicted following his testimony at the DWI trial for lying under oath when he testified that defendant did not operate the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b6 16. Moreover, a witness, whose credibility is not questioned, provided circumstantial evidence tending to show that defendant lied during her DWI trial. See <em>Woolley, </em>109 Vt. at 63, 192 A. at 5 (relying on witnesses\u2019 credibility to support peijury conviction). A police officer testified that, when he arrived at the scene, defendant was outside and next to the vehicle that was parked in defendant\u2019s driveway, and the vehicle\u2019s headlights were on. The officer testified without objection, based on his experience, that \u201cyou get into a vehicle, you start it, you turn on your headlights, you drive off, you shut the vehicle off,\u201d and that he concluded that defendant had driven the vehicle and had forgotten to turn off the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>headlights. Cumulatively, defendant\u2019s conflicting statements, Ely\u2019s conviction for lying under oath about defendant not driving the vehicle, and the officer\u2019s observations, were enough to support defendant\u2019s perjury conviction. We recognize that the State did not present the strongest ease against defendant, but we find no obvious error so grave to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b6 17. Defendant also argues that the court committed reversible error when it failed to decide defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the State\u2019s case. The trial court declined to rule on defendant\u2019s motion because it wanted to \u201cmull it over for a while,\u201d and explained that this decision was permitted under Vermont Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. Defendant did not object. The trial court later denied the motion after the jury returned the guilty verdict concluding that sufficient evidence existed to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant contends on appeal that had the court decided the motion on the evidence admitted at trial when the motion was filed it would have granted it because the State failed to establish a prima facie case. Defendant argues that she was prejudiced because the trial court considered testimony admitted after the State rested its case, and there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. Because defendant failed to make this objection at trial, we again review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b6 18. Rule 29 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">(a) Motion Before Submission to Jury ... The court on motion of a defendant or of its own motion shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment or information after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The reporter\u2019s notes explain that \u201c[a] motion made at the end of the state\u2019s case must be decided at that time because defendant should know the court\u2019s ruling before he decides whether to rest or put in his evidence.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Notes, V.R.Cr.P. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b6 19. Based on the statute\u2019s language and the reporter\u2019s notes, the trial court erred when it did not rule on defendant\u2019s Rule 29 motion made at the close of the State\u2019s case. We conclude, however, that when the State rested its ease there was sufficient evidence in the record to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Rule 29 (State\u2019s evidence must be insufficient for court to grant motion). At the end of the State\u2019s case, upon reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that the State produced evidence fairly and reasonably tending to show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Carrasquillo, </em>173 Vt. 557, 559, 795 A.2d 1141, 1145 (2002) (mem.) (setting out appellate court\u2019s standard when reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal). Thus, defendant has not demonstrated that the failure of the trial court to rule on her motion at the close of the State\u2019s case amounted to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Motion for reargument denied September 6,2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\"> Vermont is one of the few states that retains the per se incompetence rule for convicted perjurers. Most state statutes and the Federal Rules of Evidence provide that all persons are permitted to testify to relevant facts within their knowledge. F.R.E. 601; <em>Fuselier v.
