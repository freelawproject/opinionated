This appeal arises from the issuance of a water quality certification by the Vermont Water Resources Board for operation of the Clyde River Hydroelectric Project in northern Vermont. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and the Northeast Kingdom Chapter of Trout Unlimited (appellants) contend the Board\u2019s decision: (1) violates provisions of the Vermont Water Quality Standards; (2) is unsupported by the evidence; and (3) contravenes the Public Trust Doctrine and the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution.

In support of its request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for relicensure of the Clyde River Hydroelectric Project, applicant Citizens Communications Company submitted a water quality certification application to the Agency of Natural Resources. See 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 1004 (designating the Agency of Natural Resources as the state\u2019s certifying agency for purposes of \u00a7 401 of the Federal Clean Water Act). The Agency granted the certification, which was then appealed to the Board for de novo review. The Board received extensive prefiled testimony, conducted a site visit, and held an evidentiary hearing over several days in April 2003. In July 2003, the Board issued a written decision, granting the certification with certain added conditions. In response to appellants\u2019 subsequent motion to alter, the Board amended its decision but otherwise denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">\u00b6 3. To better understand and evaluate the underlying facts and claims on appeal, a brief preliminary review of the regulatory backdrop is useful. Vermont\u2019s Water Quality Standards (hereafter \u201cStandards\u201d) were enacted under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71251-1387, commonly known as the Clean Water Act (Act), to implement the Act\u2019s principal goal of \u201crestor[ing] and maintaining] the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1251(a), including the attainment of \u201cwater quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1251(a)(2). The Act permits each state, subject to federal approval, to adopt comprehensive water quality standards establishing designated uses and water quality criteria for all navigable intrastate waters. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1311(b)(1)(C), 1313(c)(2)(A); <em>PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Wash. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, </em>511 U.S. 700, 704 (1994); <em>In re Town of Sherburne, </em>154 Vt. 596, 601, 581 A.2d 274, 277 (1990). Under \u00a7 401 of the Act, an applicant for a federal permit to conduct activities that may result in a discharge into state waters must present to the federal agency (in this case the FERC) a certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cation from the state \u201cthat any such discharge will comply with the applicable provisions of\u201d the state\u2019s water quality standards. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a). Thus, Citizens, as an applicant for relicensure of its hydroelectric facility on the Clyde River, was required to obtain a \u00a7 401 certificate from the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">\u00b6 4. Consistent with its mandate under the Act, the State of Vermont has adopted comprehensive water quality standards under which all waters above 2500 feet and all waters used for public drinking water are Class A waters, 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 1253(a), and all other waters are Class B unless otherwise reclassified by the Board. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1253(b). The Clyde River has been designated as Class B under the Standards. Vermont Water Quality Standards \u00a7 4-17(B). Designated uses for Class B waters include \u201caquatic biota and wildlife sustained by high quality aquatic habitat,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3-04(A)(l), water character, flows, level, and bed and channel characteristics \u201cexhibiting good aesthetic value,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3-04(A)(2), and \u201c[b]oating, fishing, and other recreational uses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-04(A)(6). Criteria that must be met for such uses include the following: \u201cNo change from the reference condition that would prevent the full support of aquatic biota, wildlife, or aquatic habitat uses. Biological integrity is maintained and all expected functional groups are present in a high quality habitat. All life-cycle functions, including overwintering and reproductive requirements are maintained and protected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-04(B)(4). In addition, the Standards require \u201cno change from reference conditions that would have an undue adverse effect on the composition of the aquatic biota, the physical or chemical nature of the substrate or the species composition or propagation of fishes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-04(B)(4)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\u00b6 5. With this regulatory framework in mind, we turn to consideration of the certification on appeal. Applicant\u2019s project consists of an existing hydroelectric facility located on the Clyde River, a river that meanders for some thirty miles in a northwesterly direction through northern Vermont to empty into Lake Memphremagog in the City of Newport. The Clyde has been harnessed for waterpower since the early nineteenth century, and contains numerous historic mill sites and dams. The hydroelectric facility at issue in this case was originally licensed in 1963, and consists of four separate dams, although the instant appeal is solely concerned with the dam known as Newport 1,2,3 in the Town of Derby and the related powerhouse located downstream in the City of Newport. The Newport 1,2,3 dam was originally constructed in 1918, but has since been modified and repaired on several occasions, most recently in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">\u00b6 6. The Newport 1,2,3 facility bypasses approximately 1800 feet of the river in order to channel water from the dam to the powerhouse, at which point the water is discharged back into the river at the tailrace. A key issue during the certification process before the Agency and Board concerned the minimum stream flow necessary to comply with water quality standards by restoring and maintaining fish habitat in the bypass reach. Studies had indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>salmon, which had been periodically stocked in the Clyde River since the 1860\u2019s, and other cold water fish had historically returned from colder and deeper waters in Quebec to spawn in the Clyde and other Vermont streams and rivers. At the time of the relieensure application, however, the number of fish returning to spawn in the Clyde had decreased dramatically.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\u00b6 7. Since the project\u2019s inception, the bypass had been largely dry, generally receiving very small amounts of water from leakage over the dam for a measured flow of about 2.0 cubic feet per second (cfs). To restore fish habitat in the bypass, applicant proposed to maintain a minimal flow of 5 cfs in the bypass channel. However, based on stream flow studies of the Newport 1,2,3 bypass and the Agency\u2019s general guidelines for minimum stream flows at hydroelectric projects, the Agency concluded that applicant\u2019s proposal for 5 cfs would not provide adequate habitat for cold water fish. Instead, the Agency determined that a minimum flow of 30 cfs was necessary and sufficient to support aquatic habitat and comply with water quality standards. The Agency also approved applicant\u2019s proposal to construct a pipeline and trap-and-truck operation to facilitate the passage of fish upstream and downstream of the Newport 1,2,3 facility, where potential spawning and nursery habitat was much greater than within the bypass reach itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\u00b6 8. On appeal, the Board concurred in the Agency\u2019s finding that 30 cfs would meet water quality standards, finding that it represented a significant improvement over existing and past conditions in the bypass channel. The Board acknowledged, however, that the provision of 30 cfs would not support <em>all </em>life stages of salmonid (i.e., trout and salmon) in the bypass; specifically it would not support spawning and incubation habitat. Nevertheless, the Board found that this deficiency did not violate the Standards because it did not represent a change from the River\u2019s \u201creference condition,\u201d defined in \u00a7 101(B)(39) of the Standards as \u201cthe range of chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of waters minimally affected by human influences.\u201d To determine the range of chemical, physical, and biological characteristics that one might expect in a river like the Clyde in its natural state, the Board looked at studies of three northern Vermont rivers sharing characteristics similar to the ' Clyde, as well as those physical features of the Clyde itself that might have had an impact on its historical use for aquatic habitat, particularly the potential obstruction to migrating salmonids posed by a steep bedrock cascade within the bypass reach known as Arnolds Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\u00b6 9. Based on this evidence, the Board was not persuaded that salmonids ever had, or ever could, utilize significant portions of the bypass for spawning purposes even with significantly increased stream flow. Furthermore, based on hydrological studies, the Board found that segments of the river both upstream and downstream from the bypass provided more extensive and superior spawning habitat, and that applicant\u2019s proposal to facilitate passage of fish from the bypass to these areas through a pipeline and a trap-and-truck operation would provide the best means of achieving a self-sustaining population of migra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tory salmonids in the river.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These conditions were sufficient, the Board concluded, to maintain high quality aquatic habitat consistent with the range of biological characteristics that would be expected of the Clyde in its natural state. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the certificate issued by the Agency, as amended, complied with the Standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\u00b6 10. Appellants\u2019 principal claim on appeal is that the Board\u2019s approval of the 30 cfs flow for the 1800-foot bypass reach between the Newport Dam and the hydroelectric powerhouse violates the Standards by failing to provide a high quality habitat for fish and other aquatic life. In addressing this claim, it is important to bear in mind the limited nature of this Court\u2019s review of the certification process. We assess the Board\u2019s decision solely to determine whether it acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or contrary to law. <em>Town of Groton v. Agency of Natural Res., </em>172 Vt. 578, 579, 772 A.2d 1103, 1105 (2001) (mem.); <em>In re Town of Sherburne, </em>154 Vt. at 604, 581 A.2d at 278. As we have explained, this requires us to determine whether \u201cthe decision makes sense to a reasonable person,\u201d the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, and the ruling is consistent with governing statutes and prior Board policy. <em>In re Town of Sherburne, </em>154 Vt. at 605, 581 A.2d at 279. Where the Board\u2019s findings are supported they may not be disturbed, even if the record contains conflicting evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 606-07, 581 A.2d at 279-80. Furthermore, we accord substantial deference to the Board\u2019s expertise in the area of water quality control, and to the Board\u2019s construction of its own regulations and enabling legislation. See <em>id. </em>at 607, 581 A.2d at 280 (reviewing court will more readily defer to administrative body deciding technical matters); <em>In re Killington, Ltd., </em>159 Vt. 206, 210, 616 A.2d 241, 244 (1992) (absent compelling indication of error, we will sustain agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rules and enabling legislation).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">\u00b6 11. Assessed in light of these standards, the Board\u2019s decision readily withstands review. Appellants assert that the provision of a 30 cfs flow in the bypass reach is tantamount to.a habitat \u201cwrite-off\u201d or \u201csacrifice zone,\u201d and there was some evidence to support the claim. The Board expressly considered and rejected the argument, however, finding that a 30 cfs flow was adequate to support fish and other aquatic biota in the bypass, and there is substantial record evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding. For example, Mary Nealon, an expert aquatic biologist, testified specifically that the 30 cfs flow was \u201cnot a habitat write-off,\u201d but rather would support trout, nonreereational fish, and a variety of macroinvertebrates, including flies considered to be sensitive to inadequate oxygen levels and pollution, such as may flies, stone flies, and cattis flies. As the Board\u2019s finding was well within its area of expertise, and was adequately supported in the record, it must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>\u00b6 12. Appellants also contend the Board erred in approving applicant\u2019s trap-and-truck proposal to allow fish to spawn in areas upstream of the bypass. They assert that the Board should have adopted their alternative proposal to increase flows into the bypass, encourage fish to spawn there, and determine whether \u2014 over time \u2014 fish could successfully ascend Arnolds Falls and a proposed fish ladder over the dam to reach spawning areas in the upper reaches of the river. Again, however, the Board expressly considered both proposals and found that the trap-and-truck operation was preferable, citing evidence that the bypass provided relatively little viable spawning habitat, that the ascent of Arnolds Falls would pose a substantial risk of death or injury to migrating fish, and that the trap-and-truck operation could be accomplished with relatively less risk. The Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, and therefore must be upheld. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">\u00b6 13. Appellants also claim that the Board violated the Standards by applying different criteria to the bypass reach from the rest of the river. The claim is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, as the Board noted, the Standards contain a specific \u201cHydrology Policy\u201d for existing dams, which states that the rules are intended to provide a \u201ca means for determining conditions which preserve, <em>to the extent practicable, </em>the natural flow regime of waters.\u201d Vermont Water Quality Standards \u00a7 1-02(E)(1) (emphasis added). To this end, the Standards provide hydrology criteria authorizing the Agency to adopt standards and constraints relating to streamflow protection, and the Board found that the 30 cfs flow for the bypass was consistent with the Agency\u2019s Streamflow Procedure for hydroelectric bypasses and the Standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">\u00b6 14. Second, as the Board also noted, the Standards require the maintenance of high quality aquatic habitat to the level of the \u201creference condition,\u201d defined as \u201cthe range of chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of waters minimally affected by human influences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 l-101B(b)(39). Based on comparative and historical hydrologic studies of the Clyde and other comparable rivers, the Board found that this requirement necessitated the restoration of habitat conditions to support <em>all </em>life cycle functions of migrating salmonid, including spawning and growth. It also found, as noted, that this could best be accomplished by facilitating access to large areas amenable to salmonid spawning upstream and downstream from the bypass reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\u00b6 15. The Board\u2019s decision demonstrates that it applied a uniform standard to the Clyde River to achieve the goal of restoring and maintaining a high quality aquatic habitat to the level of the <em>range </em>of characteristics one would expect to see in a river of this kind in its natural state. It accomplished this goal by identifying areas of the river suitable for the full range of salmonid life-cycle functions, including spawning and growth, and approving methods designed to support these functions. We find nothing in the Standards, the statutory scheme, or the evidence requiring that the Board impose a stream flow sufficient to support a full life-cycle salmonid fishery in every part of the river, including the bypass reach, where the Board found, and the evidence disclosed, that it was questionable whether the bypass had ever accommodated such a fishery, where the evidence supported a finding that the 30 cfs flow is consistent with Agency procedures and will support high quality aquatic habitat, including migratory salmonids, and where other areas of the river will provide high quality spawning and nursery habitat. In short, the means that the Board chose to accomplish the objective of restoring a high quality aquatic habitat to the Clyde River \u2014 the particular con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>figuration of minimal stream flows within, above, and below the bypass reach and the choice of specific migratory aids \u2014 was well within the Board\u2019s discretion and expertise. Accordingly, we discern no basis to disturb its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\u00b6 16. Appellants\u2019 remaining claims concerning the Public Trust Doctrine and the Common Benefits Clause are predicated largely on their argument that the Board\u2019s decision violates provisions of the Water Quality Standards. As we have rejected this argument, the predicate claims must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-5\"> In <em>PUD No. 1, </em>the United States Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a state\u2019s authority under the Clean Water Act to impose minimum stream flow requirements within segments of a river to be used for a proposed hydroelectric facility, and further noted that there was no dispute that the discharge of water from a hydroelectric powerhouse into a river after it has been used to generate electricity is a \u201cdischarge\u201d within the meaning of the Act. 511 U.S. at 711-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\"> Although the parties disputed whether salmon were originally stocked or were indigenous to the Clyde, the Board assumed that they were entitled to protection under the Standards and the Act regardless of origin, and we discern no basis to disturb that assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> Based on analyses of the Clyde, the Board found in this regard that \u201cthe Newport 1,2,3 bypass may contain some usable habitat for salmonid spawning and nursery, but it is fragmented and isolated.
