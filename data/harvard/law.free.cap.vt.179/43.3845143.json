After a traffic stop that resulted in processing for driving while under the influence, the arresting officer served defendant Anderson with a Notice of Intention to Suspend and/or Disqualify Driver\u2019s License for Privilege to Operate, pursuant to 28 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205. At the preliminary hearing, Anderson moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. He based his motion on the fact that the results of his breath test, as indicated on the suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>sion form, produced a reading of an alcohol concentration of 0.077, which is not \u201cequal to or more than .08%,\u201d as required on the form. The court agreed and dismissed the civil suspension case. The State appeals and argues that the court erred in not allowing the matter to go to a final hearing, at which it would be allowed to introduce expert evidence relating Anderson\u2019s blood alcohol level back to the time he was operating a vehicle. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b6 2. The State argues that, when the evidentiary test is below the legal limit, the State should be allowed to prove at the final healing that the operator\u2019s BAC at the time of operation would have been greater than 0.08 by using the officer\u2019s affidavit and an affidavit of the State\u2019s chemist. This approach confuses the State\u2019s burden of proof at a civil suspension hearing with the statutory basis for commencing a civil suspension proceeding and fails to acknowledge the premise of the civil suspension procedure. The civil suspension procedure is designed to serve the remedial purpose of protecting public safety by quickly removing potentially dangerous drivers from the roads through purely administrative means. To that end, a law enforcement officer is authorized to issue a notice of intention to suspend, which itself serves as a temporary operator\u2019s license until the date of the suspension unless, within seven days, the operator contests the suspension and seeks a hearing in the district court. 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(d)(2), (3). In this case, the officer lacked the statutory prerequisite to issuance of a notice of intention to suspend \u2014 a breath test reading of 0.08 BAC or more. Thus, the court was correct in determining that the officer\u2019s affidavit was \u201cfacially insufficient to support the commencement of civil suspension proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b6 3. A review of the relevant statutes is in order. A criminal DUI is defined as follows: \u201cA person shall not operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual physical control of any vehicle on a highway [] when the person\u2019s alcohol concentration is 0.08 or more;... or when the person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1201(a)(1), (2). Recognizing that criminal cases can be protracted and slow to resolve, in the 1989 session, the Legislature created the civil suspension system to facilitate a speedy and summary procedure to get drunk drivers off the roads through license suspension. <em>State v. Stearns, </em>159 Vt. 266, 271, 617 A.2d 140, 142-43 (1992). \u201cThe summary suspension scheme serves the rational remedial purpose of protecting public safety by quickly removing potentially dangerous drivers from the roads.\u201d <em>State v. Strong, </em>158 Vt. 56, 61, 605 A.2d 510, 513 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u00b6 4. If an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a vehicle \u201cin violation of section 1201,\u201d the officer shall request that the person submit to a breath or blood test to determine the person\u2019s alcohol concentration. 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1202(a)(3). Consent to taking such tests to determine blood alcohol content is implied pursuant to \u00a7 1202(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b6 5. Under the civil suspension process, a law enforcement officer who requests an evidentiary test can issue a notice of intention to suspend, on behalf of the commissioner of motor vehicles, if the test result indicates that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration \u201cwas 0.08 or more at the time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control of a vehicle in violation of section 1201.\u201d 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(c). The affidavit of the officer must accompany the notice, and it shall be sufficient if it avers that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person was operating in violation of \u00a7 1201, and, after being informed of his or her rights under \u00a7 1202(d), the person submitted to a test whose results \u201cindicated that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more, or the person refused to submit to an evidentiary test.\u201d \u00a7 1205(b). Thus begins the civil suspension process.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b6 6. Pursuant to \u00a7 1205(a), upon affidavit of a law enforcement officer that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that a person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a vehicle in violation of \u00a7 1201, and the person submitted to a test and \u201cthe test results indicated that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control, the commissioner shall suspend the person\u2019s operating license ... for a period of 90 days and until the person complies with section 1209a of [Title 23].\u201d Section 1205(a) governs the actions of the commissioner, not the law enforcement officer. For his part, the officer issues a notice of intention to suspend. The commissioner suspends after any challenge to the civil suspension is finally resolved \u2014 after it has been determined or conceded that the operator\u2019s BAC was 0.08 or more at the time of operation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See also <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u00a7 1206(a) (governing suspensions after criminal conviction or final determination of an appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b6 7. The Legislature was aware of this important distinction and required that the process commence only upon an officer\u2019s affidavit stating that \u201c[t]he officer obtained an evidentiary test (noting the time and date the test was taken) and the test indicated that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more____\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(b)(5). To be clear, \u201calcohol concentration\u201d means the number of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, and the breath test indicates the person\u2019s alcohol concentration. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1200(1)(B), (3). Obviously, the test result indicates only the person\u2019s alcohol concentration at the time of the test. It does not, standing alone, establish the alcohol concentration at the time of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\u00b6 8. However, the Legislature also created a statutory presumption to support an allegation that the person\u2019s BAC was 0.08 or more at the time of operation. Section 1205(n) provides that, \u201c[i]n a proceeding under this section, if there was at any time within two hours of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control of a vehicle an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control.\u201d Thus, if a test taken one and one-half hours after an officer has stopped an operator results in a BAC of 0.08, the law will presume, and the officer may presume, that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more when he or she was operating the vehicle. In this case, the presumption does not operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u00b6 9. When the intended civil suspension is contested, a hearing is scheduled. The issues to be decided at the final civil suspension hearing are set forth in \u00a7 1205(h). At the final hearing, as pertains to this case, the court must determine whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person was violating 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1201, whether the person\u2019s rights were adequately explained, and whether a test was properly taken and indicated a BAC of 0.08 or higher \u201cat the time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control of a vehicle in violation of section 1201.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(h)(1), (2), (4). It is only after the final hearing that the commissioner suspends a license on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>grounds that, at the time of operation, the person\u2019s BAC was 0.08 or more at the time of operation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b6 10. At the hearing, the State can rely on the officer\u2019s affidavit to prove the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving while under the influence, that the officer explained the person\u2019s rights, and that a test taken by a properly trained officer indicated a BAC level of 0.08 or more. The State can then rely on the affidavit of a chemist who works for the Department of Health, certifying that the test complied with Health Department regulations on breath-testing methods and was an accurate and valid indication of the alcohol concentration in the defendant\u2019s system at the time of the test. Thus, if a test result produces a reading of 0.08 or more, and there is no question of relating the test result back to the time of operation, the summary suspension hearing is indeed summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b6 11. The confusion in this case stems from the Legislature\u2019s specification of a test result \u201cat the time of operation\u201d in \u00a7 1205(a) and (h)(4). As explained above, those sections address the elements to be proven at contested final hearings before the court and the ultimate authority of the commissioner to suspend a license, not the initial basis for a notice of intention to suspend. The necessary prerequisite of a civil suspension notice is an affidavit from the processing officer stating that he requested a breath test and \u201cthe test indicated that <em>the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(b)(5) (emphasis added). The officer\u2019s affidavit necessarily can attest only to the result generated by the test taken during the processing of the operator. Thus, as the trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">[t]here is nothing in the statute from which it might be inferred that the Legislature intended to imbue law enforcement officers with the expertise of chemists, allowing them to issue civil suspension notices upon their own speculation that a DataMaster result lower than .08% would likely be extrapolated reliably t\u00f3 a breath alcohol concentration above the legal limit at the time of operation. Rather, presumably in the interests of creating a straightforward and streamlined proceeding, the Legislature provided that a notice of suspension must be supported by an affidavit indicating that \u201c[t]he officer obtained an evidentiary test (noting the time and date the test was taken) and <em>the test indicated that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or </em>more____\u201d (emphasis added), 23 V.S.A.\u00a7 1205(c)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00b6 12. In this case, the officer had no basis to issue a notice of intent to suspend defendant\u2019s license because the blood alcohol test did not produce a result equal to or greater than 0.08.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor could the officer rely on the statutory presumption contained in \u00a7 1205(n) to support a notice to suspend.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b6 13. The Legislature, in crafting this procedure to summarily suspend a person\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle, intended the bright line to be a test result of 0.08. The State can still criminally prosecute an operator for drunk driving if the test result is less, assuming there is other evidence to either relate a test result back to the time of operation or to indicate actions and behavior that support a finding of intoxication. But the ability to commence a summary license suspension based solely on an officer\u2019s affidavit does not exist unless the test result is 0.08 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b6 14. The dissent suggests that the district court\u2019s ruling \u201cimposes an additional element of the offense for civil suspension purposes \u2014 that is, that a test result must show that the operator had an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater <em>when the test was administered.\u201d </em>Post, \u00b6 29 (emphasis in original). First, that <em>is </em>exactly what a test result shows. The dissent confuses the elements necessary to support a civil suspension as delineated in subsection (a)'(specifying, as noted above, when the commissioner shall suspend a license) with the legal sufficiency of the officer\u2019s notice of intention to suspend and its supporting affidavit found in subsection (b). These are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b6 15. The dissent argues that the Legislature could have expected a trained officer to be able to identify \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that a person was operating with an alcohol concentration over 0.08, citing to \u00a7 1205(a). This is wrong. That section clearly requires a law enforcement officer to have reasonable grounds to believe that a person was operating in violation of \u00a7 1201(a), which governs both operation with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or driving while under the influence. 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1201(a)(1), (2). But, this case does not involve a crime, it involves a summary civil suspension, which needs as its genesis a breath test result of 0.08. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b6 16. The dissent also suggests that the rebuttable presumption found in \u00a7 1205(n) shows that the Legislature understood that in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>cases there would be no such test and \u201cthe State would have to bear the greater burden of relating back the test result.\u201d Post, \u00b6 40. This is incorrect. If there is no test because the defendant refused, then suspension is automatic. The State\u2019s burden is lessened. For a civil suspension to proceed there must be either a refusal or a test result indicating a BAC of 0.08 or more at the time of operation. That BAC can be shown by the rebuttable presumption or through relation back evidence. But first there must be a test result of at least 0.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b6 17. Understanding that subsections (a) and (h) address the elements to be proved for a summary suspension to take place and thus explain the difference between an officer\u2019s affidavit that merely relates what the test result showed and the ultimate question of whether the operator was violating \u00a7 1201, \u00a7 1205(c) requires further explanation. It authorizes a law enforcement officer to serve notice of intention to suspend on a person who submits to a test, \u201cthe results of which indicate that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more <em>at the time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control of a vehicle </em>in violation of section 1201.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(c) (emphasis added). At first blush, this section appears to assume the test will provide relation-back evidence. Again, it cannot. However, the statutory presumption, in conjunction with a test result of 0.08 or more, permits an inference that an operator\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b6 18. When the Legislature created the summary suspension procedure, it permitted a suspension to occur without any court involvement, unless the operator contested the issue and requested a hearing. To create a threshold for suspension, it added a section affording law enforcement and the courts a presumption that, if a test result taken within two hours of operation produced a result of 0.08 or more, one could presume an alcohol concentration at the time of operation of 0.08 or more. In this case, there is no test result of 0.08 or more that would permit use of the statutory presumption. The officer had no statutory authorization to initiate a civil suspension case. The trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\"> This authority of the commissioner mimics the authority given the commissioner prior to the enactment of the civil suspension process, when \u201c[u]pon a finding by the court that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant was ... operating, attempt ing to operate, or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway [while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or other drugs, or both], the court shall forward the report of the summary hearing to the commissioner of motor vehicles, who shall suspend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the person\u2019s operator\u2019s license ... for a period of one year.\u201d 1981, No. 103, \u00a7 6.

On its face, the majority decision appears to be a plausible interpretation of the statutory scheme as applied to the circumstances of this case. It is particularly plausible that the Legislature would have enacted a bright line standard so that the license suspension procedure could operate in a predictable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>summary fashion. The majority decision states good reasons why the scheme should work as it has described. In essence, the majority describes the statutory scheme that the Legislature could have, and perhaps should have, created.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b6 20. We are not the Legislature, however. As desirable as the statutory scheme described by the majority may be, it is not the scheme that the Legislature actually enacted. The majority tries to deconstruct the statute to make the pieces fit, but they do not, and I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b6 21. Both the majority and I agree that to suspend an operator\u2019s license under the statute the State must show that the operator had a BAC of 0.08 or above <em>at the time of operation. </em>But the majority adds an additional element to the State\u2019s burden of proof \u2014 that defendant\u2019s BAC was 0.08 or more at the time the evidentiary test was taken. This additional element is not contained in the statutory scheme. Further, to the extent that there are inconsistencies in the statutory scheme, the legislative history unequivocally demonstrates that the provision the majority relies upon in support of its holding was not intended to prevent the State from initiating civil suspensions in cases where the evidentiary test result indicates a BAC below 0.08 at the time the test was administered. Nor does the majority\u2019s holding further the Legislature\u2019s policy of quickly getting drunk drivers off the roads, as the majority suggests; if anything, the holding makes it more difficult for law enforcement officers to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b6 22. It is important to state the facts of this case to get a better understanding of the scope of the majority\u2019s holding. At 10:38 p.m. on the evening of October 25, 2003, a state trooper pulled defendant over for failing to stop completely and signal before turning onto a highway. The officer\u2019s affidavit indicates that, upon approaching defendant\u2019s truck, the officer detected an odor of alcohol emanating from the vehicle. The affidavit also indicates that the officer observed that defendant had watery eyes and that he was unsteady on his feet. After defendant had difficulty executing field sobriety tests, the officer administered a roadside alco-sensor test, which indicated a BAC of .093 at 11:03 p.m. Forty minutes later, at 11:43 p.m., defendant submitted an evidentiary breath sample indicating a BAC of 0.077. The officer issued defendant a notice of intention to suspend his license and wrote \u201c.077\u201d in the form to indicate the evidentiary test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b6 23. At the preliminary hearing, defendant noted that the 0.077 figure was inconsistent with the language of the notice form. The State responded that it could establish at the final hearing that defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>BAC was 0.08 or greater at the time of operation by relating back the test result. The district court dismissed the civil suspension, ruling that the trooper\u2019s affidavit in this case was facially insufficient to support commencement of a civil suspension proceeding because it did not state that a test result indicating a BAC of 0.08 or more had been obtained, as required by 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(b)(5). According to the court, \u201cthe statutory scheme for civil suspension plainly contemplates that the <em>initiation </em>of the summary procedures requires a DataMaster test result that supports the conclusion that the operator was above .08%, as evidenced by the arresting officer\u2019s affidavit.\u201d The majority affirms this ruling, also relying on the language of \u00a7 1205(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b6 24. This is a case of statutory construction. The summary suspension procedure was created in 1989, see 1989, No. 68, with virtually all the pieces contained in the current law. The one additional piece is 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(b), added in 1991, the subsection on which the majority partially relies. As enacted in 1989, the statute contained not even a hint that the State must produce a test result indicating a BAC of 0.08 (then 0.10) or above at the time the test was administered. To the contrary, as discussed in more detail below, all statutory references to the time at which the BAC was to be measured were to the time the person was \u201coperating, attempting to operate or ... in actual physical control.\u201d 1989, No. 68, \u00a7 5 (amending 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(a)). As it does today, the statute contained a presumption that allowed the State to relate back a test result to the time of operation. See <em>id. </em>(adding 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(m)). As the majority opinion states, it was intended in 1989 to be \u201ca speedy and summary procedure to get drunk drivers off the roads through license suspension.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>\u00b6 3; see <em>State v. Strong, </em>158 Vt. 56, 58, 605 A.2d 510, 511-12 (1992) (explaining summary procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b6 25. The majority necessarily believes one of two possibilities about the original 1989 law: (1) without saying so anywhere, the law required that the officer obtain a test result of 0.10 BAC (changed now to 0.08 BAC) or higher to proceed with a summary civil suspension; or (2) the officer could proceed with a test result under 0.10 as long as the officer could relate it back to show that the operator had a BAC above 0.10 at time of operation, attempted operation or actual physical control. I cannot tell which of these positions the majority holds, largely because it cites numerous subsections that existed in the 1989 law to support its position that a test result of 0.08 BAC is <em>now </em>required.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b6 26. If the majority believes the former \u2014 that a test result of 0.10 BAC was required in 1989 \u2014 it is judicially legislating this result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>without any support in the statutory language. Thus, I believe that the only real possibility is the latter \u2014 that the 1989 law did not require that the officer produce a test result at or above 0.10 BAC. That requirement had to come from a later amendment. Consequently, the real issue in this case is whether, in 1991, the Legislature intended \u00a7 1205(b)(5) to preclude the State from initiating civil suspension proceedings in situations when the evidentiary test indicates a BAC below the statutory maximum. See <em>Okemo Mountain, Inc. v. Town of Ludlow, </em>171 Vt. 201, 210, 762 A.2d 1219, 1227 (2000) (primary objective in construing statute is to effectuate intent of Legislature). My reading of the statutory scheme and the legislative history underlying \u00a7 1205(b)(5) leads me to the inevitable conclusion that the Legislature did not intend such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b6 27. In explaining my position, I first examine the statutory scheme. The operative statement of the violation, both for criminal prosecution and civil suspension, is contained in 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1201(a)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">(a) A person shall not operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual physical control of any vehicle on a highway:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">(1) when the person\u2019s alcohol concentration is 0.08 or more</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Nine additional sections or subsections, either directly or indirectly by cross-reference, contain the language specifying that the BAC is measured at the time of operation, attempted operation or actual physical control.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For purposes of this case, the important applications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>of the DUI statute are the provisions in the civil suspension section, contained in \u00a7 1205. Specifically, subsection (a) provides that upon affidavit of an officer that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that a person had an alcohol concentration of 0.08 at time of operation, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles must suspend that person\u2019s operator\u2019s license. 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(a). Subsection (c) <em>requires </em>the officer to notify the operator of the suspension when the circumstances described in (a) are present. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(c). Subsection (h) describes the court review, limiting the issues related to the test result to whether \u201cthe test results indicated that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time of operating ... in violation of section 1201.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(h)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b6 28. Here, however, the district court\u2019s decision, accepted by the majority, was based on another subsection \u2014 \u00a7 1205(b)(5), which was added in 1991.1991, No. 55, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsection 1205(b), entitled \u201cForm of officer\u2019s affidavit,\u201d provides, in relevant part, that an officer\u2019s affidavit in support of a suspension under \u00a7 1205(a)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">shall be in a standardized form for use throughout the state and shall be sufficient if it contains the following statements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">(5) The officer obtained an evidentiary test (noting the time and date the test was taken) and the test indicated that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more, or the person refused to submit to an evidentiary test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b6 29. The parties\u2019 dispute centers around the meaning of \u00a7 1205(b)(5). The district court effectively ruled that the plain language of \u00a7 1205(b)(5) imposes an additional element of the offense for civil suspension purposes \u2014 that is, that a test result must show that the operator had an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater <em>when the test </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>was administered.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As discussed above, the addition of a new offense element is discordant with the many other statements of the offense elements in the subchapter on drunken driving. More importantly, it is in conflict with \u00a7 1205(h), which limits the issues in the court proceeding. Under the district court\u2019s construction, \u00a7 1205(b)(5) adds an element to the case the State must prove, and yet \u00a7 1205(h) prevents that element from being shown because it is not among the permissible issues that can be raised at a final civil suspension hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b6 30.1 recognize that we have rules for resolving internal inconsistencies in statutes, but the first such rule is that we must deal with an apparent inconsistency by harmonizing the statutory sections to avoid the inconsistency. See <em>Gallipo v. City of Rutland, </em>173 Vt. 223, 235, 789 A.2d 942, 951 (2001). This harmonizing process begins with a close examination of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plain meaning of \u00a7 1205(b)(5) is to add an additional element to the offense. I find the district court\u2019s conclusion unpersuasive in two respects. First, the subsection deals with only the content of the officer\u2019s affidavit, specifying that it must be on a standard form, and stating that \u201cit shall be sufficient\u201d if it contains certain \u201cstatements.\u201d 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(b). The subsection does not provide that the affidavit is insufficient if it does not contain those statements. Indeed, the required content of the affidavit is specified in subsection (a), not subsection (b), and subsection (a) requires a minimum alcohol concentration of 0.08 at the time of operation, not at the time of testing. The district court held that \u201cthe Legislature provided that a notice of suspension must be supported by an affidavit indicating that \u2018[t]he officer obtained an evidentiary test (noting the time and date the test was taken) and <em>the test indicated that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or </em>mare____\u2019 (emphasis added), 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(c)(5).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As discussed above, the \u201cmust be supported\u201d language does not appear in the statute. Rather, the statute describes what content of the affidavit is \u201csufficient\u201d without specifying what content is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u00b6 31. Second, the words of \u00a7 1205(b)(5) do not explicitly state that a BAC of 0.08 is required at the time of testing. The language is-silent on the timing of the BAC measurement. While I agree that in isolation the more logical interpretation of the wording is that the BAC indicated by the test result alone must be above the minimum of 0.08, the failure to state that explicitly introduces an ambiguity, especially because all of the other sections in the statutory scheme do state explicitly the point in time for which the required alcohol concentration must be found. Thus, it is possible that the Legislature used the words of \u00a7 1205(b)(5) as a shorthand for the longer statement that the BAC determination is made at the time of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b6 32. For these two reasons, I conclude that \u00a7 1205(b)(5) does not have a plain meaning, and is ambiguous. While the -ambiguity can be resolved from the language alone, we have in this case another statutory construction tool \u2014 legislative history \u2014 to harmonize the statutes. See <em>Green Mtn. Power Corp. v. Sprint Communications, </em>172 Vt. 416, 420, 779 A.2d 687, 691 (2001) (recognizing that when statutory language is ambiguous, \u201clegislative history may be used to determine the intent of the Legislature\u201d). Here, the legislative history greatly undercuts the district court\u2019s and the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Indeed, the legislative history makes it plain that the Legislature did not intend to add as an element of the offense that the operator must have an alcohol concentration.above 0.08 at the time the test was administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b6 33. The 1989 law had no subsection on the form of the officer\u2019s affidavit; the requirements were generally set out in \u00a7 1205(a) without the concept of a statewide, standardized form. In 1991, the Legislature added subsection (b) on the form of the officer\u2019s affidavit. 1991, No. 55, \u00a7 6 (adding 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(b), among other amendments). The addition of \u00a7 1205(b) was not part of the original bill introduced in 1991. Rather, the language was drafted by Gary Kessler of the State\u2019s Attorneys and Sheriffs Department and inserted into the bill by the Senate Judiciary Committee. At a March 7, 1991 hearing before the Committee, Kessler testified that he drafted the provision to respond to police complaints about the amount of paperwork involved in processing civil suspensions. He explained that the provision was intended to standardize and streamline police paperwork by shortening the length of the required affidavit. He emphasized that he arrived at the criteria set forth in the provision by incorporating the issues allowed at the final hearing under \u00a7 1205(h). When members of the Committee asked Kessler if then Defender General Bud Allen had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>approved the provision, Kessler left the committee room to find Allen and later reported back that Allen was content -with the language as long as the new provision preserved the issues contained in \u00a7 1205(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b6 34. The provision drafted by Kessler was not changed and later became \u00a7 1205(b). At no time did the Committee discuss whether the new provision would add an additional element to the State\u2019s burden of proof or the officer\u2019s power to initiate a civil suspension, and certainly there is no hint that such a result was intended. Rather, the apparent intent behind the amendment was to lighten the State\u2019s burden, <em>not to increase it </em>as the majority holds. In any case, nothing in the Committee\u2019s discussion suggests that it \u201cintended the bright line to be a test result of 0.08.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>\u00b6 13. Indeed, the content of the Committee\u2019s discussion is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b6 35.1 conclude from the legislative history that the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1205(b)(5) is incorrect. There was clearly no intent to expand the issues to be considered in the civil suspension proceeding as specified by \u00a7 1205(h) \u2014 whether the person had a BAC of \u201c0.08 or more at the time of operation].\u201d The BAC at the time of test administration is not an issue before the court in a suspension proceeding under \u00a7 1205(h). Rather, it is likely that the drafter chose the language of \u00a7 1205(b)(5) as. a shorthand for the requirement in all the other statutory sections, and specifically that of \u00a7 1205(h)(4). Thus, \u00a7 1205(b)(5) must be construed to refer to the BAC at the time of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b6 36.1 cannot agree with the majority\u2019s distinction between elements the State must prove at the civil suspension hearing and those that must be present when the law enforcement operator prepares an affidavit. The statute sets out one integrated proceeding that begins with the officer\u2019s affidavit and concludes with review by the district court if requested.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The distinction advanced by the majority would make sense if the State could initiate a civil suspension proceeding without an affidavit, or despite a flawed affidavit, and prove the final hearing issues as specified in 23 Y.S.A. \u00a7 1205(h). Obviously, the majority does not believe that such bifurcation of the process is possible; it would affirm the termination of the process in this case with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>no opportunity for the State to reach the final hearing. Thus, the majority is advocating a distinction without a difference \u2014 irrespective of how the issue arises, the majority would hold that no suspension could ever occur without a showing that the operator had a BAC above 0.08 at the time the test was administered, obviously an element of the offense beyond those specified in \u00a7 1205(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\">\u00b6 37. The real conflict in the majority\u2019s attempt to parse through the statutory language to explain inconsistency with its construction comes when it reaches \u00a7 1205(c). The subsection not only authorizes, but <em>requires, </em>the officer to submit a notice of suspension to an operator whose test shows a BAC of 0.08 or above at time of operation. The language reads: \u201cOn behalf of the commissioner of motor vehicles, a law enforcement officer ... directing the administration of an evidentiary test shall serve notice of intention to suspend... on a person who submits to a test the results of which indicate that the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control of a vehicle in violation of \u00a7 1201 of this title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1205(c). If the majority\u2019s distinction were correct, and the Legislature had intended to require a test result with a 0.08 BAC or above, it would have said so in this subsection. Instead, just as in other sections, it specifies that the time for the measurement of the BAC is \u201cthe time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control,\u201d <em>id., </em>and says nothing about a requirement that there be a test result above 0.08 BAC. The majority suggests that the legislative language can be explained by the presence of the evidentiary presumption in \u00a7 1205(n) that relates back a test result of 0.08 BAC or greater, a presumption that existed in 1989 before the majority\u2019s new requirement. It is far easier and better explained by a plain meaning interpretation that does not import nonexistent requirements into the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b6 38. Based on the facts described in the outset of this dissent, the officer in this case followed the command of the statute; he could not do otherwise. The majority provides no answer to the conflicted position in which it has placed the officer, other than to ignore the language of the statute and his duty under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b6 39. Defendant and the district court have raised additional reasons for requiring a test result over 0.08, but they are not persuasive. The trial court reasoned that the Legislature did not intend \u201cto imbue law enforcement officers with the expertise of chemists, allowing them to issue civil suspension notices upon their own speculation that a DataMaster result lower than .08% would likely be extrapolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>reliably to a breath alcohol concentration above the legal limit at the time of operation.\u201d I note that the statutory standard is that \u201cthe officer had reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the person was operating with a BAC over 0.08 and not that the officer know it with certainty. 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(a). I believe that the Legislature could have expected a trained officer to meet that standard without a test result above 0.08 in some instances. In saying that, I agree that those instances will be relatively rare, but this case demonstrates those rare circumstances because the officer had (1) physical signs of intoxication, including defendant\u2019s inability to complete field dexterity tests; (2) a contemporaneous roadside alco-sensor test result above the legal limit; (3) an evidentiary test result submitted more than an hour after operation and yet only 0.003 under the legal limit; and (4) information about the person\u2019s eating and drinking history immediately before the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b6 40. Finally, I do not agree with defendant that the rebuttable presumption set forth in \u00a7 1205(n) demonstrates that the Legislature intended to limit civil suspensions to instances in which the test result was 0.08 or more. That statute provides that a showing that a person\u2019s BAC was 0.08 or higher within two hours after operation creates a rebuttable presumption that the person\u2019s BAC at time of operation was above 0.08. The purpose of the statute is to place the burden of producing relation-back evidence on the party best able to meet it \u2014 the defendant. <em>State v. Pluta, </em>157 Vt. 451, 455, 600 A.2d 291, 293 (1991). In this case, of course, the presumption is not applicable because the basic fact \u2014 a test result of 0.08 or more \u2014 is not present. See V.R.E. 301(c)(1). Defendant\u2019s argument is that the Legislature showed by this subsection that there would always be a test result above 0.08 and that the presumption would serve to relate it back. In fact, the statute shows the opposite. Its statement of what will happen if there is a timely test suggests strongly that the Legislature understood that in some cases there would be no such test, in which case the State would have to bear the greater burden of relating back the test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b6 41. In sum, notwithstanding significant evidence that defendant was alcohol impaired with a BAC above 0.08 at time of operation, the majority has affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the State\u2019s civil suspension complaint based on an added element of the offense never contemplated by the Legislature. I would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the matter for a final civil suspension hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> See 23 V.SA. \u00a7 1202(a)(3) (evidentiary test is required of person when officer has reasonable grounds to believe that person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control, in violation of \u00a7 1201); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1203\u00ae (when officer has reason to believe person violated \u00a7 1201, officer may conduct preliminary breath alcohol screening test); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1205(a) (Commissioner of Department of Motor Vehicles must suspend driver\u2019s license of person when law enforcement officer submits affidavit stating that officer had reasonable grounds to believe that person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control, in violation of \u00a7 1201 and (1) person refused to submit to test, or (2) person submitted to test indicating \u201cthat the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time of operati[on]\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1205(b)(3) (officer\u2019s affidavit is sufficient if it states that officer had reasonable grounds to believe person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control, in violation of \u00a7 1201); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1205(c) (officer gives notice of intent to suspend when test results indicate person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at time of operating, attempting to operate, or actual physical control); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1205(h)(1) (issues at final civil suspension hearing include whether officer had reasonable grounds to believe person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control, in violation of \u00a7 1201(h)(1); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1205(h)(4) (issues also include whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>test results show alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at time of operation, attempted operation, or actual physical control, in violation of \u00a7 1201); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1205\u00ae (after hearing, license shall remain suspended if court finds that officer had reasonable grounds to believe that person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control, in violation of \u00a7 1201 and (1) person refused to submit to test, or (2) person submitted to test indicating \u201cthat the person\u2019s alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time [of] operation] \u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1205(n) (if alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more within two hours of operation, attempted operation, or actual physical control, there is rebuttable presumption that it was above 0.08 at time of operation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\"> When the language of current \u00a7 1205(b) was added it caused relettering of subsequent subsections through subsection (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\"> Although not directly in issue, the district court\u2019s ruling would not prevent criminal prosecution of the operator because the ruling is limited to the subsection applicable only to civil suspension, 23 V.S.A \u00a7 1205(b)(5).
