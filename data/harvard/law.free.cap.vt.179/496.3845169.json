Each of these four cases is an appeal from an Environmental Board ruling either affirming a district environmental commission coordinator\u2019s jurisdictional opinion that declined to impose Act 250 jurisdiction or reversing a jurisdictional opinion that Act 250 applied. In all four cases, appellees are landowners who obtained Board rulings obviating the need for them to obtain Act 250 permits for activities on their lands, and appellants are adjoining landowners who appealed those Board rulings to this Court. Appellees then moved to dismiss, arguing in each case that appellants were precluded from appealing a Board ruling to this Court by 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6085(c)(1). Appellants argue in opposition that \u00a7 6085(c)(l)\u2019s list of persons allowed to appeal to this Court applies only in the context of an Act 250 permit appeal. We consolidated the cases solely for the purpose of deciding the motions to dismiss. As explained below, the motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u00b6 2. Preliminarily, it is undisputed that the substantial amendments to Act 250 passed by the Legislature in 2004 do not apply to any of the cases. The effective date of those amendments is January 31,2005.2003, No. 115 (Adj. Sess.), \u00a7 119(e). Because the proceedings before the Board in all four cases commenced prior to January 31, 2005, the version of Act 250 in effect prior to the 2004 amendments governs these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">\u00b6 3. Act 250 incorporates the Vermont Administrative Procedure Act (VAPA): \u201cThe provisions of chapter 25 of Title 3 shall apply unless otherwise specifically stated.\u201d 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6002. Thus, absent a specific provision elsewhere in Act 250 to the contrary, \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in any contested case may appeal that decision to the supreme court.\u201d 3 V.S.A. \u00a7 815(a). In the instant cases, there is no dispute that appellants are aggrieved by a final decision of the Board and have exhausted their administrative remedies. In addition, each of these appeals is a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the VAPA, which requires each agency to \u201cprovide for the filing and prompt disposition of petitions for declaratory rulings as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the applicability of any statutory provision\u201d and states that \u201c[rjulings disposing of petitions have the same status as agency decisions or orders in contested cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 808. As a result, the instant motions turn on whether a limitation on appellate standing in appeals of the kind at issue here is \u201cotherwise specifically stated,\u201d 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6002, in Act 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b6 4. No provision of Act 250 addresses appeals of rulings on jurisdictional opinions beyond the Board level. Under 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6007(c), \u201cany person ... may request a jurisdictional opinion from the district coordinator concerning the applicability of\u201d Act 250 to \u201can activity which might or might not constitute development.\u201d The statute authorizes persons \u201cwho may be affected by the outcome of the opinion, or by parties that would be entitled to notice under section 6084\u201d to appeal a jurisdictional opinion to the Board. <em>Id. </em>Significantly, \u00a7 6007(c)\u2019s statement that an appeal to the Board \u201cshall be by means of a petition for declaratory ruling\u201d which \u201cshall be treated as a contested case\u201d dovetails with the \u201ccontested case\u201d language of \u00a7\u00a7 808 and 815(a) of the VAPA. This is no mere coincidence \u2014 rather, it indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to subject jurisdictional opinions under \u00a7 6007(c) to the VAPA. See <em>Payea v. Howard Bank, </em>164 Vt. 106, 107, 663 A.2d 937, 938 (1995) (\u201cWhen construing a statute, we presume that language is inserted advisedly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b6 5. In an attempt to find a limitation to appellate standing elsewhere in Act 250, appellees point to \u00a7 6085(c)(1), which allows \u201conly the applicant, the landowner if the applicant is not the landowner, a state agency, the regional and municipal planning commissions and the municipalities required to receive notice\u201d to appeal Board decisions to this Court. The organization of Act 250, however, indicates that \u00a7 6085(c)(1) applies only to appeals of Board decisions granting or denying permits. Section 6085 is part of subchapter 4 of Act 250, entitled \u201cPermits,\u201d and sets forth procedures for hearings on permit applications. Indeed, the fact that \u00a7 6085(c)(1) explicitly grants standing to the \u201capplicant\u201d indicates that the Legislature envisioned it as applying to appeals from permit proceedings, not to appeals from other proceedings that fall within the Board\u2019s purview. Compare 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6083(a)(1) (describing information to be supplied by \u201capplicant\u201d in permit application), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6084(a) (describing notice requirements to be fulfilled by \u201capplicant\u201d), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6086 (referring repeatedly to criteria \u201capplicant\u201d must satisfy to obtain permit), and <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6088 (allocating burden of proof among \u201capplicant\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>and \u201cany party opposing the applicant\u201d), with <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6007(c) (referring to person who has asked for jurisdictional opinion as \u201crequestor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b6 6. This conclusion is buttressed by \u00a7 6089, the section of the \u201cPermits\u201d subchapter governing appeals. It provides that \u201c[a]n appeal from a decision of the board under subsection (a) of this section shall be to the supreme court by a party as set forth in section 6085(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6089(b). Subsection (a), in turn, states that \u201c[a]n appeal from the district commission shall be to the board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6089(a). By contrast, jurisdictional opinions are issued by the district coordinators and not the district commissions, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6007(c), and thus do not fall within \u00a7 6089(a). It follows that appeals from Board rulings on jurisdictional opinions are not \u201cdecision[s] of the board under subsection (a)\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 6089(b), a conclusion solidified by the placement of \u00a7 6089 within the \u201cPermits\u201d subchapter. Accordingly, \u00a7 6089 applies the limitations of \u00a7 6085(c) only to permit appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b6 7. Appellees point out that we have consistently read \u00a7 6085(c) as barring adjoining landowners from appealing Board decisions to this Court. See, e.g., <em>In re Cabot Creamery Coop., </em>164 Vt. 26, 28, 663 A.2d 940, 941 (1995) (\u201cPermissive parties, such as adjoining landowners, are not among the enumerated parties [in \u00a7 6085(c)] and therefore are affirmatively prohibited from appealing to this Court.\u201d). Appellees\u2019 reliance on these cases, however, overlooks the fact that these cases all involved attempts by parties not enumerated by \u00a7 6085(c) to participate in appeals of Board decisions granting or denying permits. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 27, 663 A.2d at 940 (noting that petitioner was appealing a Board decision that affirmed a permit subject to certain conditions). Thus, the precedents cited by the appellees are compatible with the conclusion that \u00a7 6085(c) does not apply to the instant appeals because they are not permit appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b6 8. Moreover, this Court recently entertained an appeal, filed by neighboring landowners, of a Board declaratory ruling reversing-a jurisdictional opinion. <em>In re Audet, </em>2004 VT 30, 176 Vt. 617, 850 A.2d 1000 (mem.). There, Audet\u2019s neighbors requested and obtained a jurisdictional opinion that Audet needed an Act 250 permit to use a parcel of his land for his business. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 4. Audet appealed to the Board and eventually obtained a ruling reversing the jurisdictional opinion and determining that Act 250 did not apply. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 5. This Court heard the neighbors\u2019 appeal and affirmed, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 10, without discussing the neighbors\u2019 standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u00b6 9. We now make explicit that which was left implicit by <em>In re Audet: </em>Section 6085(c)\u2019s limitation on appellate standing applies only to Board decisions granting or denying Act 250 permits. With respect to appeals of Board decisions affirming or reversing jurisdictional opinions in proceedings commenced prior to the effective date of the 2004 amendments to Act 250, we hold that the VAPA governs appellate standing because, under 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 6002, no limitation of appellate standing is \u201cotherwise specifically stated\u201d in Act 250. Finally, as described above, appellants meet 3 V.S.A. \u00a7 815(a)\u2019s \u25a0requirements for standing to appeal to this Court. Accordingly, the motions to dismiss these appeals are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\n<em>The motions to dismiss in the above-captioned appeals are denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
