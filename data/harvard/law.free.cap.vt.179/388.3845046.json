Defendant Kenneth Squiers appeals from his jury conviction for committing a lewd act with a child under the age of sixteen in violation of 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 2602. On appeal, defendant claims the trial court erred by: (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal when the evidence was insufficient to prove that he committed or attempted to commit a lewd or lascivious act; and (2) denying his motions for a mistrial and a new trial based on a juror\u2019s misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b6 2. We first address defendant\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to convict him of the charged offense. In reviewing a denial of a V.R.Cr.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence presented by the State in the light most favorable to the prosecution, excluding any modifying evidence, and determine whether the State\u2019s evidence sufficiently and fairly supports a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>State v. Grega, </em>168 Vt. 363, 380, 721 A.2d 445, 457 (1998). Given this standard, the facts are summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b6 3. The complainant is defendant\u2019s granddaughter, B.P., who was fourteen years old at the time of the alleged misconduct. B.P., her mother, stepfather, and younger sister moved in with defendant after they were evicted from their apartment. After living there for a few weeks, B.P. was getting ready to leave for school when her grandfather asked her for a hug. B.P.\u2019s mother and sister were waiting in the car, and defendant and B.P. were alone in the house. B.P. thought nothing improper of defendant\u2019s request because he was her grandfather. When defendant hugged B.P., he squeezed her very tightly, pressing his chest firmly against hers. During this contact, defendant commented: \u201c[Tjhese feel firm, am I ever going to be able to touch them or see them?\u201d Defendant then moved his hand up and B.P., believing defendant was going to touch her breasts, turned away and left before he could do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b6 4. Some weeks later, defendant entered B.P.\u2019s bedroom while she was using her computer and asked her to look up some information on the internet. As she was typing, defendant reached over, touched her on the middle of her thigh and moved his hand up her leg until she pushed his hand off and told him \u201cnot to do that.\u201d At the time she pushed his hand off her leg, his hand was within two inches of her \u201cvaginal area.\u201d Defendant replied that he \u201cshould behave himself\u201d and \u201che knew that he shouldn\u2019t being doing that type of stuff\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>her. She told him to get out of her room, and he left, but came back minutes later, declaring \u201cI need to be around you, I need to touch you, you wind me up like a clock.\u201d B.P. felt uncomfortable and went to her mother\u2019s bedroom. She did not tell her mother about her grandfather\u2019s actions because she did not want her family to be homeless again.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b6 5. Two days later, B.P. was in the kitchen washing dishes. Defendant came up behind her and began rubbing her shoulders, neck, and ears, and sniffing her hair. She told him to leave her alone and he left. B.P. was again in the kitchen doing dishes, a week or so later, when defendant came up behind her, put his hand on her shoulder, and whispered in her ear, \u201cwhen are we going to be able to make love?\u201d B.P. swore at defendant and told him he needed to leave her alone. He turned around, chuckling, and told her, as he was walking away, that he didn\u2019t think he should have to do anything he didn\u2019t want to do because it was his house. B.P. was scared and ran, screaming and crying, into her mother\u2019s room and told her everything that had happened. They moved out the next day, and the foregoing events were reported to the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (now named the Department of Children and Families).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b6 6. Following an investigation, defendant was charged and convicted of violating 13 V.S.A. \u00a72602, which prohibits lewd or lascivious conduct with a child. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">A person who shall wilfully and lewdly commit any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child under the age of sixteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions or sexual desires of such person or of such child, shall be imprisoned for the first offense, not less than one year nor more than five years, or fined not more than $3,000.00, or both____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\"><em>Id. </em>The trial court instructed the jury to consider, for the element of a \u201clewd act,\u201d only two incidents alleged: (1) defendant hugging B.P., \u201cpressing her breasts against him\u201d; and (2) defendant touching B.P.\u2019s leg and \u201cmoving his hand up her thigh.\u201d The court further instructed the jury that any other acts and comments made by defendant could be used only to determine defendant\u2019s intent and the lack of a mistake or accident. Additionally, the court instructed the jury that \u201clewd\u201d or \u201clewdly\u201d means \u201cbehavior or intent which is lustful or indecent, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>which offends the common morality of the community as well as its sense of decency and propriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b6 7. Defendant argues that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because the actual acts \u201cupon the body\u201d of the child were not in and of themselves lewd. Defendant submits that any lewdness was in his comments, and not in his touching. Defendant claims his hug, however tight, was nothing more than a hug, which always involves breast-to-breast contact, and so cannot be criminally actionable, notwithstanding his simultaneous comments: \u201c[T]hese feel firm, am I ever going to be able to touch them or see them?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b6 8. Defendant \u00e1lso argues that his touching of B.P.\u2019s thigh cannot be considered lewd because there was \u201cno touching, rubbing, fondling or kissing of any private, sexual part of the body.\u201d Defendant also claims that the \u201cmere sliding\u201d of his hand up BJP.\u2019s thigh cannot be considered criminal because it is only conjectural whether defendant would have touched her vagina.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b6 9. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the statutory meaning of a \u201clewd act\u201d upon a child is limited to contact with a so-called \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201csexual\u201d part of the child\u2019s body. Our overriding objective in statutory interpretation is to effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>169 Vt. 15, 17, 725 A.2d 920, 922 (1999). In doing so, we first look to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statutory language. <em>Id. </em>The plain language of the statute refers to a lewd act \u201cupon or with the body, or <em>any part or member thereof, </em>of a child.\u201d 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 2602 (emphasis supplied). If the Legislature intended to limit the definition of a lewd act to contact with or between particular body parts, it could have done so, as demonstrated by the specific language used in other statutes that prohibit misconduct of a sexual nature. See 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3251(1) (defining \u201csexual act\u201d for purposes of sexual assault statute as \u201cconduct between persons consisting of contact between the penis and the vulva, the penis and the anus, the mouth and the penis, the mouth and the vulva, or any intrusion, however slight, by any part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>person\u2019s body or any object into the genital or anal opening of another\u201d); 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 2605(a)(4) &amp; (b) (prohibiting the viewing or recording of the \u201cintimate areas\u201d of another person where he or she has a reasonable expectation of privacy and defining \u201cintimate areas\u201d as \u201cthe naked or undergarment-clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or female breast of a person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b6 10. We conclude that the purpose of \u00a7 2602 is to protect children from sexual exploitation by any form of physical contact initiated for that purpose. While evidence that a defendant touched a child\u2019s genital area might present a more obvious case, we decline to hold that the sexual use of children prohibited by \u00a7 2602 is limited to contact with any particular body part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, the actual lewd \u201cact upon or with\u201d the body of a child cannot be viewed in isolation from the context in which the touching occurs and, in particular, the intent of the perpetrator. See <em>People v. Martinez, </em>903 P.2d 1037, 1038 (Cal. 1995) (\u201cWhether a particular touching is \u2018lewd\u2019 and criminal... cannot be determined separate and apart from the actor\u2019s intent.\u201d). We agree with the California Supreme Court\u2019s construction of that state\u2019s nearly identical statutory language that \u201ca lewd or lascivious act can ... involve \u2018any part\u2019 of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1042 (quoting Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 288(a)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b6 11. Accordingly, we conclude that the determination of whether an act is \u201clewd\u201d under \u00a7 2602 depends on the nature and quality of the contact, judged by community standards of morality and decency in light of all the surrounding circumstances, accompanied by the requisite, specific lewd intent on the part of the defendant. Cf. <em>In re P.M., </em>156 Vt. 303, 308, 592 A.2d 862, 864 (1991) (noting this Court\u2019s deference to common-sense community standards when considering, under the facts of the particular case, whether conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>is lewd or lascivious under \u00a7 2602); <em>State v. Purvis, </em>146 Vt. 441, 443, 505 A.2d 1205, 1207 (1985) (holding criminal intent under statute prohibiting lewd and lascivious conduct implicated where, in deference to the \u201ccommon sense of the community,\u201d factors including the defendant\u2019s \u201cintentional public exposure of himself, with a view to excite unchaste feelings and passions ... calculated to outrage the feelings of the person, to whom he thus exposed himself,\u201d as opposed to mere nudity, made his conduct punishable) (internal quotations omitted). As the California Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Martinez, </em>the fact finder has a critical role in examining the manner of the touching to conclude whether a lewd act occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">[T]he trier of fact looks to all the circumstances, including the charged act, to determine whether it was performed with the required specific intent. Other relevant factors can include the defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements, other acts of lewd conduct admitted or charged in the case, the relationship of the parties, and any coercion, bribery, or deceit used to obtain the victim\u2019s cooperation or avoid detection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><em>Martinez, </em>903 P.2d at 1043 (internal quotations and citations omitted); cf. <em>State v. Roy, </em>140 Vt. 219, 230, 436 A.2d 1090, 1095 (1981) (\u201c[T]he specific intent requirement in [\u00a72602] alleviates any problem with vagueness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b6 12. In denying the motion for judgment of acquittal, the district court stated that \u201c[a]lthough the alleged acts could have been innocent contact, the jury had the additional evidence of the defendant\u2019s verbal remarks concerning his intent and state of mind as to the acts and other evidence of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d The court concluded that the \u201ctotal evidence was sufficient to support the guilty verdict in that [the jury] could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendant\u2019s] actions were of a lewd and lascivious nature and not casual family contact.\u201d We agree. Ordinarily a hug is just a hug, and a touch on the leg is just a touch on the leg. Here, however, the additional evidence of defendant\u2019s accompanying comments reveal that his intent when pressing against his granddaughter\u2019s breasts and running his hand up her leg near her groin was expressly lewd, as opposed to innocent or accidental. Defendant\u2019s comments while pressing B.P.\u2019s breasts very tightly against his own chest (stating that B.P.\u2019s breasts felt firm and inquiring whether he would be able to touch or see them), and while running his hand up her leg within two inches of her vagina (admitting that he knew it was improper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>but that he had to touch her because she \u201c[wound] him up like a clock\u201d), provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that these physical contacts were not displays of grandfatherly affection. Rather, the jury had more than sufficient evidence to conclude that the contacts with B.P.\u2019s body, feeling her breasts, and feeling up her thigh just short of the child\u2019s vagina, were made intentionally and for his express lascivious purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b6 13. Viewing the totality of the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this contact was patently offensive, lewd, and with the intent of appealing to defendant\u2019s sexual desires, all as charged and as prohibited by statute. Defendant\u2019s contemporaneous and subsequent comments linked his acts upon the body of his granddaughter with his explicit sexual desire toward B.P. In light of all the evidence presented, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b6 14. We now turn to defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his motions for a mistrial and a new trial based on a juror\u2019s misconduct in sharing personal legal research with jurors during their deliberations. Defendant claims that the juror\u2019s actions created the capacity to influence and taint the jury such that defendant was entitled to a new trial. Defendant further claims that the court improperly inserted itself into the jury\u2019s deliberative process when it delivered a curative instruction, thus compounding the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u00b6 15. The record reveals the following facts relevant to this issue. Defendant\u2019s jury trial lasted only one day, with the State resting its case just prior to the noon hour. Before breaking for lunch, the court instructed the jury not to discuss the case with anyone or try to learn about it during the break. When the jury returned from lunch, the defense rested without presenting any additional evidence, counsel delivered closing arguments, and the court instructed the jury without reference to any particular statutory citation. Nevertheless, during deliberations, the court received a note from the jury that stated: \u201cUnder T 13 2601 and 2602 it specifies that speech is not enough to display/prove intent? Does this apply in this case?\u201d The court shared the question with the attorneys who shared concerns that the jury received external information about the law. The attorneys expressed additional concern that the jurors may have learned of the penalty provisions in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u00b6 16. Following this discussion, the court sent a note to the jury-directing them to follow only the instructions given by the court, and inquiring about the source of the information in the jury\u2019s note. In response, one juror, Mr. Corcoran, was identified as the source of the question. In the presence of counsel and on the record, the court questioned Mr. Corcoran, who explained that he went to the public library during the lunch break and read 13 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 and 2602, which prompted him to tell the other jurors during deliberations that he had read \u201cthat speech or regular speaking of one\u2019s free will\u201d was not enough to convict on a charge of a lewd and lascivious act. Mr. Corcoran said he raised the issue -with the other jurors because of defense counsel\u2019s comments about speech in closing argument, but that the other jurors referred him back to the court\u2019s instructions, commenting that those were the instructions to be followed, while another suggested posing the question to the court. In response to the court\u2019s further questions, Mr. Corcoran stated he had learned of the penalties imposed by both statutory provisions, but had not shared that information with the other jurors. The court then asked Mr. Corcoran if he could put aside any impressions he had from reading the statutes and deliberate with the jury solely on the jury instructions given by the court. Mr. Corcoran responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b6 17. After asking Mr. Corcoran to wait outside the courtroom away from the other jurors, the court asked counsel whether they would be willing to proceed with an eleven-person jury if the court removed Mr. Corcoran. Defense counsel responded that his client would not agree to an eleven-person jury and would move for a mistrial in the event the court did not remove Mr. Corcoran from the jury. The state\u2019s attorney said she would also request a mistrial if Mr. Corcoran were not removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b6 18. The court stated it was inclined to go forward, concluding that what happened was not so gross an error that it could not be cured and emphasizing that the juror\u2019s independent research did not involve investigation of facts, but research about the law. The court called Mr. Corcoran back and inquired again if he understood that he needed \u201cto ignore and not consider in any way anything [he] ... interpreted or learned from reading either statute,\u201d and the court could not agree that his interpretation was correct. The court asked Mr. Corcoran if he would have any difficulty with that requirement and he replied \u201c[n]o.\u201d The court asked if Mr. Corcoran could disregard any memory or information about penalties and whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>could promise the court he would not relay any such information to the other jurors. Mr. Corcoran responded affirmatively to both propositions and remained on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b6 19. The court then brought in the rest of the jury and instructed them that the parties have the right to have the case decided solely on the evidence presented in court and the legal instructions given by the court. The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">[Apparently there was some information that came up from outside of those sources, especially about possible legal interpretation or legal instruction. You need to understand that you cannot consider any of that information that came up no matter how sort of briefly it came up or how limited it came up, that cannot be a part of your deliberations. It is solely the jury instructions given to you by the Court that control how you apply the law to the facts that came in through testimony. I need to even further comment that it is even possible that that information that came up was not correctly interpreted or recalled, okay, but I don\u2019t even want to get into whether it was or wasn\u2019t, but you need to understand that\u2019s how important it is, so you have to ignore it because of that issue, okay. It is not from the Court, it hasn\u2019t been reviewed by the attorneys and so it cannot be relied on in any way, so I need an affirmation from each of you that you can basically sort of restart your deliberations without relying on any of that information that had come up, that you will use the judicial instructions given to you by the Court that each of you have a copy of and that you can do that and fairly apply that law to the facts for both the State and Mr. Squiers and if you cannot please let me know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The court then asked each juror two questions: whether the juror could go forward on those requirements; and whether the juror had any concerns or feelings that he or she could not do so. All jurors responded that they could proceed and could put aside any extraneous information. The jury then resumed deliberations and returned with a guilty verdict. Defendant seeks a new trial on the basis that the jury was tainted by extraneous influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\u00b6 20. \u201c[DJefendant is entitled to a fair trial free of the suspicious taint of extraneous influences.\u201d <em>State v. McKeen, </em>165 Vt. 469, 472, 685 A.2d 1090, 1093 (1996). The trial judge is in the best position to determine whether a verdict was influenced by extraneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>influences because of the relationship the judge develops with the jury during the course of a trial, and because the determination \u201cis a fact-driven exercise that will depend upon the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 685 A.2d at 1092 (internal quotations omitted). For these reasons, we accord every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s determination, and we will uphold the decision absent a showing of abuse or withholding of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 685 A.2d at 1093. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b6 21. Not every irregularity in the course of a trial will result in an invalidation of a jury\u2019s verdict. To ensure that a defendant is protected from extraneous influences, we have adopted a two-part inquiry. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA defendant alleging either extraneous influences or juror misconduct must first demonstrate that an irregularity occurred and it had the capacity to affect the jury\u2019s result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the defendant so demonstrates, the State then bears the burden to show \u201cthat the irregularity did not in fact prejudice the jurors against defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 685 A.2d at 1092. Citing <em>McKeen </em>as the appropriate standard, the trial court found no basis for a new trial. The trial court reasoned that the only extraneous information shared with the jury was one juror\u2019s interpretation of the law on intent, the court reaffirmed its instructions on that issue, and the panel confirmed, one by one, that they could and would follow only those instructions. The court also observed: \u201c[I]t was clear to the court that the rest of the panel disagreed with the one juror\u2019s interpretation of the legal instructions and that is why the written questions came to the court in the first place.\u201d The court also found that, given the nature of the allegations in this case, merely learning of the possible penalty would not prejudice Mr. Corcoran against the defendant. Instead, the court noted, it was more likely that the information could prejudice the State because a juror might think the maximum penalty too harsh for the acts alleged. The court found it entirely speculative that a juror would think the penalty too light and \u201ccasually convict\u201d in violation of the juror\u2019s oath. Further, the court found that the focus of Mr. Corcoran\u2019s extraneous research was on the law of intent, not the possible penalty for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b6 22. Although the court did not explicitly state its conclusions as to each part of the two-part test for invalidation of a jury verdict, it is apparent from the court\u2019s reasoning that it found the extraneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>information did not have the capacity to affect the jury\u2019s result because the information concerned only a legal, rather than factual, issue that was duly brought to the attention of the court, and the court reiterated its instructions and obtained an affirmation from all jurors that they would apply only the law given to them in the court\u2019s instructions. We agree that on the record presented here the court effectively cured any potential influence that Mr. Corcoran\u2019s independent research and opinion of the law may have had on the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b6 23. Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s curative instructions resulted in the court improperly \u201cinterjecting itself into the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d Defendant claims the court directly commented on the \u201cvalidity\u201d of the extraneous information \u2014 as opposed to simply mandating that it be completely ignored \u2014 creating the potential of prejudicing the other jurors against anything Mr. Corcoran contributed during the deliberations. Defendant also argues that these additional comments might have caused the jury to disregard defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, since Mr. Corcoran said he made the inquiry based on defense counsel\u2019s comments about speech. We find this argument unpersuasive. The court expressly stated that it was not commenting on whether the information was correct. The court\u2019s comment that it was <em>possible </em>that the information relayed may not have been correctly interpreted or recalled was simply an explanation of the importance of the jury following only the court\u2019s instructions. We recognize that the court\u2019s legal instructions on the elements of the charge may have conflicted with defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury that the alleged acts were insufficient to establish the offense and that the jury should not consider defendant\u2019s comments. If the jury chose to disregard any or all of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument because it was inconsistent with the court\u2019s legal instructions, it was within the jury\u2019s province to do so. We find no reason to believe, however, that the jury was potentially prejudiced against defendant by the court\u2019s statement that extraneous information about the law cannot be relied upon because the court has not established its accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> The court instructed the jury that if they found defendant not guilty of the charged offense, they could consider whether defendant was guilty of the lesser-included offense of attempting to wilfully and lewdly commit a lewd act with the body of a child. Because the jury convicted defendant of the charged offense, our consideration of the sufficiency of the evidence relates only to a completed violation of \u00a7 2602.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> Nor do we deem a contact per se \u201clewd\u201d because it involves contact with a \u201cprivate\u201d part of a child\u2019s body. Such contact may occur in a variety of legitimate contexts by parents, physicians, or other caretakers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 288(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Any person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act... upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child who is under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that person or the child, is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, six, or eight years.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
