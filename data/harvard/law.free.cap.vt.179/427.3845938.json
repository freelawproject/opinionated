This litigation is about the protection of a view, in particular, the view from the living room windows of the home of defendants John and Sandra Dooley (\u201cHomeowners\u201d). Homeowners\u2019 lot slopes steeply from west to east. The street level of the residence, facing west on East Terrace Street, becomes the second-floor level of the residence. Homeowners\u2019 living room windows, located on this second-floor level, frame a view toward the east. Looking east from these windows, across the land owned by plaintiffs Cupola Golf Course, Inc. and John Larkin (\u201cDevelopers\u201d), one can see Interstate 89, shopping malls, and on the horizon, a panoramic view of the mountains centering on the Mt. Mansfield \u201cprofile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">\u00b6 2. Homeowners acquired this premises through a series of conveyances beginning with a deed from Roland and Evangeline DesLauriers to Borys and Frida Surawicz in 1956. Homeowners\u2019 deed contains the following restrictive covenant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>No building higher than one story shall be erected on any land of Grantor lying easterly of the land herein conveyed and lying in Green Mountain Park.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b6 3. Homeowners\u2019 property is part of the Green Mountain Park Subdivision. The Subdivision was created by the DesLauriers from a parcel of land acquired by the DesLauriers from Fred C. Fisk in 1952. From 1952 until 1966, the DesLauriers sold lots in the Subdivision. All of these lots, including Homeowners\u2019 lot, were subject to general Subdivision-wide protective covenants. These general covenants imposed, among other things, a two-story height restriction on all lots in the Subdivision. These covenants were recorded in book 22, page 444 of the South Burlington land records, and are referenced in Homeowners\u2019 chain of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b6 4. The DesLauriers sold approximately twenty-seven acres of land to Cupola Golf Course, Inc., one of the developers in this case. Approximately ten acres of the land acquired by Cupola Golf Course, Inc. was later sold to John Larkin, the other developer in this case. Developers\u2019 land is part of the Green Mountain Park Subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b6 5. In 1978, Homeowners and other property owners within the Subdivision brought a petition for declaratory judgment against Cupola Golf Course, Inc., seeking to enforce the general Subdivision covenants as recorded in the South Burlington land records. After a ten year \u201clanguish,\u201d a declaratory judgment order was issued in 1989. This judgment specifically extinguished the general Subdivision-wide protective covenants. <em>Bingham v. Cupola Golf Course, Inc. </em>(C275-78CnC). Among the general covenants the court declared unenforceable was the two-story height restriction on all lots in the Subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b6 6. Five years later, Developers brought an action seeking declaratory judgment against Homeowners to resolve the issue relating to the particular covenant in Homeowners\u2019 chain of title. Developers argued that the declaratory judgment in the <em>Bingham </em>case precluded enforcement of Homeowners\u2019 covenant because the order contained language that \u201call (other) claims and counterclaims are dismissed with prejudice.\u201d Specifically, Developers argued that this order operated to make Homeowners\u2019 particular covenant inoperative and void as a matter of res judicata. Among other claims, Homeowners argued that the issues raised did not yet reach the appropriate level of \u201ccase or controversy\u201d required by declaratory judgment law. The trial court denied these and other preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>motions to set aside the covenant and proceeded to a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b6 7. After taking evidence and conducting a site visit to view Homeowners\u2019 property, the trial court made findings and issued a declaratory judgment determining that the particular covenant in the original Surawicz deed, carried forward in the deed to Homeowners, is effective. The court determined that the term \u201ceasterly\u201d in the specific covenant means due east. The court also determined that \u201cno higher than one story\u201d meant that any structure on the burdened land could be no more than one story, and that the one-story structure could be no greater than twenty-six feet in height. The declaratory judgment states that the covenant \u201cimpacts a strip of Developers\u2019 property east of Homeowners\u2019 property, as wide as Homeowners lot (approximately 100') and heading due east.\u201d The judgment states that \u201c[wjithin this strip, no building will be built higher than 26 feet, and greater than one story, using the measurement standards set forth in the South Burlington Ordinance referenced in footnote 4.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b6 8. Developers argue that Homeowners\u2019 covenant was extinguished by the declaratory judgment issued in <em>Bingham </em>in 1989. As noted above, the <em>Bingham </em>court rendered null and void the general Subdivision covenants. Developers\u2019 contention focuses upon the following provision in the order: \u201cExcept as set forth above, all claims and counterclaims are dismissed with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b6 9. Based upon this language, Developers moved for summary judgment dismissing Homeowners\u2019 claim, arguing that the particular covenant contained in Homeowners\u2019 deed was extinguished by the 1989 declaratory judgment order, and that this claim is barred by res judicata. Developers raised further summary judgment issues, claiming that the covenant was voided by the Marketable Record Title Act, 27 V.S.A. \u00a7 601 et seq., as well as a change of circumstances, statute of limitations, waiver, laches and estoppel. The trial court denied Developers\u2019 motions on each of these bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b6 10. Res judicata is a valuable doctrine of preclusion, founded upon the judicial economy and fairness of litigating and disposing of all issues involved in a legal dispute where the parties, subject matter and causes of action are identical or substantially identical. See <em>Lamb v. Geovjian, </em>165 Vt. 375, 379-80, 683 A.2d 731, 734-35 (1996). However, in this matter we are dealing with a declaratory judgment proceeding, a special remedy with special concerns. The function of a judgment in such proceedings is to adjudicate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>define specific rights and liabilities of parties. A \u201cdeclaratory action determines only what it actually decides and does not have a claim preclusive effect on other contentions that might have been advanced.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 38 emt. c (1982). Where, as here, the specific covenant was never presented to the trial court or decided upon, the judgment has no preclusive effect. Accordingly, the trial court correctly denied summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b6 11. The issue raised under the Marketable Record Title Act similarly fails because the existence of the special covenant was made known to the Developers within the forty-year span over which the statute operates. See 27 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 601-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b6 12. The issues of waiver and estoppel raised by Developers are negated by the lack of showing of a duty to raise the issue and a lack of a concomitant right of the Developers to rely on the claimed failure to raise the issue. See <em>Mann v. Levin, </em>2004 VT 100, \u00b6 27, 177 Vt. 261, 861 A.2d 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b6 13. Developers failed to present sufficient evidence to support their .contention that changes in the area and zoning compel denial of the covenant. The trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue is supportable. See <em>id. </em>\u00b6 17 (citing V.R.C.P. 52(a)(2) for the proposition that this Court will uphold a trial court\u2019s factual findings unless, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and excluding the effect of modifying evidence, there is no reasonable or credible evidence to support them).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b6 14. Turning to the declaratory judgment proceeding itself, the first prerequisite is that there be a real case or controversy. This requirement is jurisdictional. See <em>Town of Cavendish v. Vermont Public Power Supply Auth., </em>141 Vt. 144, 147, 446 A.2d 792, 794 (1982). Looking at the extended period of legal activity surrounding the properties involved in this case, this issue seems to have a simple answer. However, the judiciary is not empowered to render advisory opinions. Courts are not permitted to dispose of the merely hypothetical. An action for declaratory relief must be based upon an \u201cactual controversy,\u201d the claimed result of which is \u201cnot based upon fear or anticipation,\u201d but is \u201creasonably to be expected.\u201d <em>Robtoy v. City of St. Albans, </em>132 Vt. 503, 504, 321 A.2d 45, 46-47 (1974); see also <em>Town of Cavendish, </em>141 Vt. at 147, 446 A.2d at 794. Thus, to avoid the probability of an advisory opinion, there must be a \u201ccase or controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u00b6 15. In this case, the trial court found that the dispute over the particular covenant has not been resolved, and that the determination of the meaning of the restrictive covenant is not premature. The court found that Developers have taken actions that manifest their intent to develop the land affected by the covenant. Developers have initiated the lengthy permit process. Although Developers have not yet put into place a formal development plan, the court noted that the pleadings sufficiently set forth Developers\u2019 proposal, and an alternative plan if the court found the covenant to be effective. The court further found that Homeowners would pursue whatever legitimate recourse they have to limit development. This is underscored by the efforts made by Homeowners to inform South Burlington Development Review Board that a decision on any plan of Developers should await a determination of the meaning of the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b6 16. This, in conjunction with the history of the previous litigation, sufficiently satisfies the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement for jurisdictional purposes. As the trial court pointed out, it would be inequitable to perpetuate the uncertainties of the parties any further. The issues in this phase of the case have \u201clanguished\u201d since 1994 and cry out for resolution and finality. Accordingly, the court\u2019s finding that this case is an actual controversy was certainly within the scope of the statutory purposes of 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 4722.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b6 17. As noted above, the particular covenant in Homeowners\u2019 deed stated that \u201c[n]o building higher than one story shall be erected on any land of Grantor lying easterly of the land herein conveyed and lying in Green Mountain Park.\u201d Developers argued that the court should construe the term \u201ceasterly\u201d-as imposing a burden on a strip of land the width of Homeowers\u2019 property, approximately 100 feet, extending straight out to the east from the eastern edge of Homeowners\u2019 property. Conversely, Homeowners argued that the term \u201ceasterly\u201d encompasses a cone-shaped burdened area stretching from their house northeast to Mount Sterling and southeast to Bolton Mountain. Homeowners argued that this more expansive definition is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the covenant, which they argue was to protect a panoramic view of this mountain range.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b6 18. After a merits hearing and a site visit of Homeowners\u2019 property, the trial court found that the language of the covenant is ambiguous because the covenant is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation. This Court agrees that the references to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201ceasterly\u201d direction and a height limit of \u201chigher than one story\u201d are sufficiently nonspecific to support resort to the intention of the original parties and the circumstances of the grant. See <em>Creed v. Clogston, </em>2004 VT 34, \u00b6 13, 176 Vt. 436, 852 A.2d 577. Thus, the trial court did not err in determining that the covenant was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b6 19. Some of the original parties to the covenant are deceased; others have no clear recollection of the transactions. The trial court therefore looked to the surrounding circumstances at the time the instrument was executed to determine the intention of the parties, the subject matter and purpose of the covenant. See <em>McDonough v. W.W. Snow Constr. Co., </em>131 Vt. 436, 441, 306 A.2d 119, 122 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b6 20. Developers argue that the covenant does not mention \u201cview\u201d even though the impact of all these proceedings seeks its protection. We agree with the trial court that protection of a \u201cview\u201d was implicit here. To preserve an open area above and across neighboring land is characteristic of a covenant related to a view. The term \u201ceasterly\u201d is a very generalized description of direction. This description becomes more specific and meaningful when, as the court noted, almost due east, on the horizon, is the \u201cprofile\u201d of Mt. Mansfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b6 21. The deed does not specify the exact location of the covenant and its impact on Developers\u2019 land. There are no referenced monuments or markers. The trial court sought to determine the span of the covenant and its impact upon Developers\u2019 land. With the aid of testimony and a visit to the property, the trial court determined that the covenant burdened a 100-foot corridor of land to the east of Homeowners\u2019 property, the boundaries of which would be determined in relation to the 1956 magnetic east bearing. The trial court found that there was no evidence that the original parties intended the covenant to protect a view extending from Mount Sterling to Bolton Mountain. Rather, the trial court found that the purpose of the covenant was to protect a view of Mt. Mansfield, the closest and most prominent mountain in the view, as well as its central focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b6 22. Homeowners seek a wider swath over Developers\u2019 land, but this construction would overlap with the Subdivision covenants that existed at the time of the original grant, covenants that were mentioned in the very same deed setting out this covenant. As the trial court found, it certainly is improbable that the parties granting this special covenant had any intent to supersede the Subdivision covenants, or to impose an alternative one-story restriction on all lots east of Homeowners\u2019 lot, regardless of their location in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Homeowners\u2019 property. This determination is supported by reasonable and credible evidence, as well as sound logic. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\">\u00b6 23. This Court also finds no error in the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cone story\u201d requirement to prohibit buildings higher than twenty-six feet or greater than one-story. The trial court correctly found that the pertinent question is what the parties would have considered one-story to mean in 1956. The court properly weighed the evidence in light of this standard. In any event, it is our understanding that the parties do not challenge the height definition if the Court affirms the trial court\u2019s ruling that the covenant is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
