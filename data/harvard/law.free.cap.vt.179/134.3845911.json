The Town of Warren appeals a decision by the state appraiser reducing the listed value of taxpayer William Barrett\u2019s condominium from its fair market value of $36,000 to $24,000 to reflect a deduction for \u201cintangible assets\u201d worth $12,000. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-21\">\u00b6 2. Taxpayer owns a condominium in the Bridges Condominium Complex (Bridges), a group of 100 units whose owners are members of the Bridges Owners\u2019 Association, Inc. The town listers entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>condominium in the Warren grand list for 2002 at a value of $36,000. This value was based on a town-wide reappraisal, adjusted to reflect the unit\u2019s condition and recent sales of comparable units at the Bridges. Taxpayer appealed to the Warren Board of Listers, requesting that the listed value be reduced by $12,877.23 to reflect his share of the Association\u2019s intangible assets, which he argued should not be subject to taxation as real property. The Board denied the appeal. Taxpayer then appealed to the Warren Board of Civil Authority (BCA) on substantially the same grounds. 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 4404. The BCA denied taxpayer\u2019s appeal, finding that the listers properly relied on comparable sales in establishing an estimated fair market value for his property. Taxpayer then appealed to the state appraiser pursuant to 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 4461(a). The state appraiser conducted a de novo proceeding to determine the correct value of the property. 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 4467.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b6 3. The state appraiser lowered the listed value from the property\u2019s fair market value of $36,000 to an \u201cassessment value\u201d of $24,000. The appraiser\u2019s decision to list taxpayer\u2019s condominium unit at less than fair market value was based on a finding that ownership of the property included an \u201cintangible asset of $12,000 for the subject property.\u201d The appraiser concluded that this amount represented the value of taxpayer\u2019s .88% interest in the assets of the Association, which had a total value of approximately $1,446,880 as of September 30, 2001, including over $1,000,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b6 4. The Town of Warren contends that the state appraiser erred in setting the \u201cassessment value\u201d of taxpayer\u2019s property substantially lower than its fair market value to reflect a deduction for taxpayer\u2019s equity in the Association. Taxpayer argues that his equity in the Association is an intangible asset and therefore not subject to property tax, though he concedes that it contributes to the fair market value of his property. We reverse because the Town has met its burden of production, while taxpayer has failed to met his burden of persuasion. The Town complied with the plain language of 32 Y.S.A. \u00a7 3481 by listing the value of taxpayer\u2019s property at its fair market value. Taxpayer provided no evidence that the valuation was arbitrary or unlawful, and his proposed valuation method has no legal support. The statute does not recognize adjusting the fair market value by the amount of a taxpayer\u2019s interest in a condominium owners association. The state appraiser\u2019s use of a nonstatutory deduction from fair market value violates the statute\u2019s plain language. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b6 5. This Court reviews decisions by the state appraiser to ensure that they are supported by findings rationally drawn from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>evidence and are based on a correct interpretation of the law. <em>Allen v. Town of West Windsor, </em>2004 VT 51, \u00b6 4, 177 Vt. 1, 852 A.2d 627. We will not disturb a fair market value determination unless an error of law exists. <em>Kachadorian v. Town of Woodstock, </em>149 Vt. 446, 448-49, 545 A.2d 509, 511 (1988). Absent compelling indication of error, interpretations of statutory provisions by the agency responsible for their administration will be sustained on. appeal. <em>In re Vt. Health Serv. Corp., </em>144 Vt. 617, 622-23, 482 A.2d 294, 297 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b6 6. The property taxation statute requires the listed value of real property to be equal to its appraisal value, which in turn must reflect its estimated fair market value. 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 3481(1)-(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In accord with the plain language of \u00a7 3481, we have held that \u201c[t]he touchstone for property tax valuations is fair market value____\u201d <em>Sondergeld v. Town of Hubbardton, </em>150 Vt. 565, 567, 556 A.2d 64, 66 (1988); see also <em>Royal Parke Carp. v. Town of Essex, </em>145 Vt. 376, 378, 488 A.2d 766, 767-68 (1985) (\u201c[Section 3481] makes fair market value the standard for appraisal.\u201d). Fair market value is \u201cthe price which the property will bring in the market when offered for sale and purchased by another.\u201d 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 3481(1). There are several methods of estimating fair market value, one of which is sales of comparable properties \u201cbetween a willing buyer and seller at arms length.\u201d <em>Barrett/Canfield, LLC v. City of Rutland, </em>171 Vt. 196, 199, 762 A.2d 823, 825 (2000), We have characterized the use of such sales as \u201cthe most persuasive method of appraising residential property in Vermont,\u201d <em>Sondergeld, </em>150 Vt. at 567, 556 A.2d at 66, although other methods are also acceptable. See <em>Lake Morey Inn Golf Resort v. Town of Fairlee, </em>167 Vt. 245, 250, 704 A.2d 785, 788 (1997) (combination of market data approach and cost approach held consistent with statutory requirements for determining fail' market value); <em>Town of Barnet v. Cent. Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., </em>131 Vt. 578, 580-81, 313 A.2d 392, 393 (1973) (appraisers may use approaches including reproduction cost, earning power, construction cost less depreciation, \u201cor the like\u201d to determine fair market value). The fair market value, arrived at by any of these methods, takes into account all the elements of the property\u2019s availability, \u201cits use, potential or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>prospective, and all other elements ... which combine to give property a market value.\u201d <em>Town of Barnet v. New England Power Co., </em>130 Vt. 407, 411, 296 A.2d 228, 231 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b6 7. The Town had the initial burden of production with respect to fair market value. <em>Sondergeld, </em>150 Vt. at 567, 556 A.2d at 66. The Town met this burden by producing evidence of fair market value based on the average record sales prices of the Bridges. This is an acceptable valuation method that taxpayer does not dispute. See <em>id. </em>(concluding that town met burden of production by producing evidence of fair market value). Here, the Town and taxpayer agreed that the fair market value of the property is $36,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b6 8. Because the Town met its burden of production, taxpayer retained the burden of persuasion as to contested issues. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 556 A.2d at 66. \u201cThe burden of proof is not met by simply impugning the Board\u2019s methods or questioning its understanding of assessment theory or technique.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201c[t]o prevail a taxpayer must show an arbitrary or unlawful valuation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Taxpayer argues that the Town may not tax his interest in the Association because it :is intangible personalty, and that he is entitled to a dollar-for-dollar reduction of his share of association fees from the $36,000. Taxpayer relies on the Association\u2019s balance sheets to support his argument. The balance sheets, however, prove only what his share was at the time the balance sheet was prepared. The sheets do not provide any support for his main argument that his interest in the Association has influenced the fair market value to the extent of $12,000. Taxpayer\u2019s speculation \u201cmay or may not state a generally true principle in Vermont, but it is no substitute for evidence in a specific case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b6 9. Nor does taxpayer show an arbitrary or unlawful valuation. In fact, his theory of valuation has no support in the law. The intangible personalty taxpayer refers to, as the leading case in California put it, \u201ccannot be separately taxed as property [but] may be <em>reflected </em>in the valuation of taxable property.\u201d <em>Roehm v. Orange County, </em>196 P.2d 550, 554 (Cal. 1948) (emphasis added); see also <em>Mola Dev. Corp. v. Orange County, </em>95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 546, 557 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing <em>Roehm </em>with approval); <em>American Sheds, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles, </em>78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 58, 62-63 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing <em>Roehm </em>and stating that \u201cintangibles associated with the realty, such as zoning, permits, and licenses, are not real property and may not be taxed as such. However, insofar as such intangibles affect the real property\u2019s value... they may properly contribute to an assessment of fair market value.\u201d). This is all that has happened here. Were we to adopt taxpayer\u2019s position, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>require the Town to sever the value of an interest in the Association from the value of \u201cthe real-estate component\u201d of a condominium unit, it would be difficult to assign a valuation method that could reliably discern the membership\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b6 10. The difficulty of taxpayer\u2019s approach is evident in the state appraiser\u2019s decision. The appraiser valued taxpayer\u2019s ownership interest in the Association by simply calculating his .88% share of the Association\u2019s total equity, failing to account for the fact that the Association membership imposes liabilities on taxpayer and any successor in interest, such as the obligation to pay monthly fees. Taxpayer considers these fees excessive and concedes that they probably <em>detract from </em>the fair market value of the unit. Nothing indicates that the appraiser\u2019s valuation method arrives at an accurate value for the interest in question. Even were the method accurate, such an adjustment is not recognized by \u00a7 3481.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b6 11. All of the elements, tangible and intangible, that combine to give real property fair market value are subject to property tax. 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 3481(1). For example, long-term leases appurtenant to real estate are subject to property tax, insofar as they affect the fair market value of real property. <em>City &amp; County of Denver v. Bd. of Assessment Appeals, </em>848 P.2d 355, 362 (Colo. 1993); see also <em>Ry. Exp. Agency, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>358 U.S. 434, 442 (1959) (\u201cNo one denies the right of the State, when assessing tangible property, to ... give effect to the intangible factors which influence real values.\u201d). The key inquiry is whether those intangible factors are so \u201cintimately intertwined\u201d with the real property that the property would not function without them. See <em>In re Town of Plymouth, </em>479 A.2d 1388, 1390 (N.H. 1984) (holding that ski passes, furnishings, and prepaid cleaning charges, not appurtenant to the condominium, \u201care not specialized intrinsic features which make the condominium in question function as a condominium\u201d); see also <em>Appleby v. Nolte, </em>682 So. 2d 1140, 1141-42 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996) (holding that country club memberships, held by some residents and some nonresidents, and which were not prerequisites of residence, were not subject to property tax because they were personal property).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b6 12. Taxpayer\u2019s membership in the Association, as he concedes, would necessarily be conveyed to any purchaser of his condominium unit. The membership is a prerequisite of ownership at the Bridges, and is necessary to make the condominium function as a condominium. In all of these respects it is \u201cintimately intertwined\u201d with ownership of a unit. In fact, it is more than that; it is a quality of ownership of a unit in this complex, unique to owners of such units. Funds are drawn from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the Association accounts for \u201ccommon expenses\u201d necessary to maintain the condominium common areas. Those funds are not accessible for personal or individually-determined uses according to the Association\u2019s governing documents, which incorporate by reference the Vermont Condominium Ownership Act. 27 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1301-1329. Accordingly, the interest in the Association is transferable only along with ownership of a unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b6 13. Taxpayer\u2019s interest in the Association is therefore substantially different from the country club memberships in <em>Appleby </em>and the ski passes and furnishings in <em>Town of Plymouth. </em>The disputed property in those cases was not appurtenant to real property, nor did it constitute \u201cintrinsic features which make the condominium in question function as a condominium.\u201d <em>Town of Plymouth, </em>479 A.2d at 1390. The Association membership, in contrast, is an intrinsic feature of the condominium unit that permits the condominium complex to function as a whole. For example, the entire complex is benefited by regular upkeep of the common areas, and a cash reserve is necessary to discharge such obligations. The ownership interest in the Association positively influences the price a buyer is willing to pay for a unit in the Bridges. Therefore, the value of that interest may properly be taken into account when determining the real property\u2019s fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b6 14. There are limited situations in which the state appraiser may, consistent with the statute, disregard a sale and turn to other evidence of fair market value. These situations arise when \u201csome evidence undermines the bona fide nature of the sale\u201d by showing that either the buyer or seller was compelled to participate, or that the sale was not at arms length. <em>Barrett/Canfield, </em>171 Vt. at 199, 762 A.2d at 825; see also <em>Beach Props., Inc. v. Town of Ferrisburg, </em>161 Vt. 368, 375-76, 640 A.2d 50, 54 (1994) (sale between family members does not reflect fair market value); <em>Vt. Nat'l Bank v. Leninski, </em>166 Vt. 577, 579, 687 A.2d 890, 892 (1996) (mem.) (price paid at auction following foreclosure does not reliably indicate fair market value). Taxpayer has produced no evidence to indicate that the sales relied upon by the listers and the BCA were not bona fide. To the contrary, they were precisely the sort of arms-length sales by which \u201ca market value is perforce established for appraisal purposes.\u201d <em>Royal Parke, </em>145 Vt. at 379, 488 A.2d at 768. Indeed, both the appraiser and taxpayer concede that those sales established the fair market value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b6 15. Because the Town has met its burden of production and taxpayer has failed to show an arbitrary or unlawful, valuation, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>reverse the state appraiser\u2019s decision setting taxpayer\u2019s property in the Warren Grand List at less than its fair market value because it is contrary to the plain language of 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 3481 and \u00a7 4467.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"> 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 3481(2) requires that the listed value of property be equal to 100% of its appraisal value, but we have acknowledged that precise equivalence is not necessary so long as all properties in a given town are listed at the same percentage of appraisal value. Allen, 2004 VT 51, \u00b6 2. Section 3481(1) also permits a \u201cuse value appraisal\u201d and, therefore, a listed value below fair market value for properties enrolled in the current use program, 32 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3751-3763, which taxpayer\u2019s condominium is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"APi\">Dooley, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b6 16. dissenting. The majority has reversed an overly simplistic decision of the state appraiser that is unfair to the Town and substituted an overly simplistic decision that is unfair to taxpayer. The right answer lies between the two extremes and ensures that all the real property at the Bridges, whether owned by the condominium owners or the Bridges Owners Association, Inc., is taxed once and at fair market value, and that no personal property, however owned, is taxed at all. The majority\u2019s decision causes double taxation and ensures that personal property of significant value will be taxed as real property, increasing the amount collected by the Town above what the law allows. Because of that unfair result, I dissent from the majority opinion and result. Although I would reverse the appraiser\u2019s decision, I would remand for a proper determination of listed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b6 17. We must start with the acknowledgment that this is an unusual case. The Bridges includes 100 condominium units. If taxpayer\u2019s unit is of average value at $36,000, the whole complex is worth around $3.6 million dollars. According to its balance sheet, the Association is worth almost $2 million. None of that value includes the common areas or facilities, which are owned in common by the unit owners. According to the majority decision, the value of the Association is reflected in the assessed valuation of all the units. Under that theory, a unit owner\u2019s interest in the Association could be more valuable than his interest in the unit and common areas and facilities. Because of these unusual facts, I do not believe that it could ever be considered a fair approximation of reality that the value of an owner\u2019s interest in the Association is somehow buried in his unit values. In slang terms we are dealing with a large tail wagging a smaller dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b6 18. The central thesis of the majority\u2019s decision is its statement in \u00b6 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">The Town complied with the plain language of 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 3481 by listing the value of taxpayer\u2019s property at its fair market value. Taxpayer provided no evidence that the valuation was arbitrary or unlawful, and his proposed valuation method has no legal support. The statute does not recognize adjusting the fair market value by the amount of a taxpayer\u2019s interest in a condominium owners association. The state ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>praiser\u2019s use of a nonstatutory deduction from fair market value violates the statute\u2019s plain language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">By this statement, the majority accepts the Town\u2019s argument that this is a dispute about the value of property. In fact, the statement is wrong; this is a dispute about what property the Town can value and tax. When the correct issue is addressed, the answer is different and more complex than the majority acknowledges.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b6 19. Although the specific facts of this case are sketchy, the key facts are reasonably clear. Taxpayer owns a condominium unit, along with an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities. 27 V.S.A. \u00a7 1306(a); <em>Fox v. Kings Grant Maintenance Ass\u2019n, </em>770 A.2d 707, 713 (N.J. 2001) (\u201c[Wjhen an individual purchases a condominium unit, he or she simultaneously acquires a proportionate undivided interest in the community\u2019s common elements.\u201d). Both the unit and the interest in the common areas and facilities are real property. 27 V.S.A. \u00a7 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b6 20. In addition, taxpayer owns an interest in the Association, the incorporated condominium association. Exactly how this interest is manifested \u2014 for example, by a share of stock or a membership certificate \u2014 is not shown by the record. Although neither the record nor the law so states, I think the majority is correct that taxpayer\u2019s \u201cmembership in the Association ... would necessarily be conveyed to any purchaser of his condominium unit\u201d and \u201cmembership is a prerequisite of ownership at the Bridges.\u201d The Association manages the 100 condominiums in the complex. Some of the units are owned by the Association, and it conducts a condominium rental business on behalf of itself and unit owners. It receives income from annual assessments on unit owners and from its rental business. At the time of the property tax valuation by the Town, the Association had a \u201cmembership equity\u201d of approximately $2,000,000, of which most of the assets were cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b6 21. Two types of property are central to this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first type of property is the unit owner\u2019s interest in his unit and the common area and facilities, which is by law real property. 27 V.S.A. \u00a7 1304. The second type of property is the unit owner\u2019s interest in the condominium association. That ownership interest, however it is physically repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>sented, is not real property, but is instead personal property. See <em>Magoon v. Bd. of Civil Authority of Johnson, </em>140 Vt. 612, 614, 442 A.2d 1276, 1276-77 (1982) (\u201cReal estate within the meaning of the tax law is land with its fixtures and accessories measurable and capable of description by metes and bounds.\u201d). Indeed, if we look at the assets of the condominium association, most of those assets are personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b6 22. The two types of property are significant. As a general rule, under the Vermont property tax system real property is taxable and personal property is not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Knollwood Bldg. Condos. v. Town of Rutland, </em>166 Vt. 529, 536, 699 A.2d 31, 36 (1997). Thus, a condominium unit and its associated common areas and facilities are taxable, while a share of stock or a membership certificate is not. Indeed, apart from its status as personal property, another strong reason exists as to why the physical manifestation of corporate ownership is not taxable. The assets of the corporation, to the extent those assets are taxable, are taxable to the corporation. Thus, a corporation will pay real property taxes on -real property it owns. To also tax the stock owner on that same property would result in double property taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b6 23. The state appraiser\u2019s decision was that the value of taxpayer\u2019s real property interest plus his interest in the Association was $36,000. He derived this figure from recent sales of units at The Bridges \u2014 sales that necessarily included interests in the Association. He held, however, that over $12,000 of the total fair market value represented the interest in the Association, an item of personal property. See J. Eckert, Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration 138 (1990) (\u201c[T]he value of the personal property must be estimated and subtracted from the sale price to determine the price paid for the real property alone.\u201d); see also <em>In re Town of Plymouth, </em>479 A.2d 1388, 1390 (N.H. 1984) (deducting value of ski passes, furnishings and prepaid cleaning charges from real property value of condominium); <em>People ex rel. Hotel Paramount Corp. v. Chambers, </em>83 N.E.2d 839, 840 (N.Y. 1949) (excluding comparative sale where sale price included not only real property, but \u201cworth of such additional elements as management, good will, hotel furniture and furnishings, inventory of food and beverages and the usual hotel services\u201d). Thus, the appraiser reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that taxpayer\u2019s taxable portion \u2014 the value of the unit and common area and facilities alone \u2014 was $24,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b6 24. Thus, I return to my point about the misconstrued issue in this case; this case is not about whether property was assessed at less than fair market value. While one can criticize the state appraiser\u2019s decision, the fault in the assessment is not that the state appraiser assessed taxable real property at less than fair market value or that he violated 32 V.S.A. \u00a7 3481(1), as the majority finds in \u00b6\u00b6 3 through 6 of its opinion and thereafter. The state appraiser decided that some of the property in issue is nontaxable. The proper questions on appeal, therefore, are whether he is right that some of the property is nontaxable and, if so, whether he has found the correct amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b6 25. The majority answers that all the property is taxable and it is all real property \u2014 that is, that the only property to be valued is the unit and the common areas and facilities associated with the unit. In the majority\u2019s view, the interest in the Association is accounted for \u201cwhen determining the real property\u2019s fair market value.\u201d The majority bases this determination on its conclusion that the real property and the interest in the Association are intertwined. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, because the two must be sold together with one combined value, and because it is up to the state appraiser and this Court to determine how to allocate that value, we have the power to allocate all value to the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b6 26. We also have the obligation to reach a fair result. As I said above, in this unusual case, the majority\u2019s result is very unfair to taxpayer. The majority\u2019s position could be that all of the assets of the Association are taxable to the unit owners as real property. The result is a conversion of at least $1.4 million in personal property into real property so it can be taxed to all the unit owners. According to its balance sheet, the Association also holds real property assets of at least $300,000. The Association will pay the Town property taxes on these assets. The unit owners will also indirectly pay property taxes on these assets because the value of their condominium units will be inflated by the value of the Association\u2019s assets. Under the majority\u2019s result the Town receives a large property tax windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b6 27. The majority has four reasons why it imposes this unfair result: (1) \u00a7 3481 requires it; (2) Association funds are not available to unit owners; (3) taxpayer\u2019s interest in the Association cannot be valued; and (4) taxpayer failed to meet his burden of persuasion after the Town met its burden of production. Because the majority has reiterated that the appraiser\u2019s decision violates \u00a7 3481, I will reiterate that it does not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Section 3481(1), a definition section, simply states that appraised value is equal to fair market value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the property to be appraised were only the condominium unit and its associated common areas and facilities, the majority would be correct. But the property to be valued here is the condominium unit, the associated common areas and facilities, <em>and the unit\u2019s interest in the Association. </em>The majority states that the Association interest is \u201cintimately intertwined\u201d with the ownership of the unit without acknowledging that this reality is a two-edged sword. <em>Ante, </em>\u00b6 12. The majority concentrates on this close relationship to value the two interests together, but the edge the majority ignores is that one interest is an item of personal property, the value of which must be accounted for. Nothing in \u00a7 3481 tells us to assign a value of zero to the interest in the Association and all the value to the real property. The majority has done that for its own reasons unconnected to \u00a7 3481.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b6 28. Second,' the majority\u2019s position that the Association\u2019s funds are not available to the unit owners is wrong as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is important to understand that the Association\u2019s funds come from two sources. One source is the business activities of the Association in renting units, including units it owns. Nothing in the law prevents a corporation from distributing profits to its shareholders; that is the purpose of the corporation. Even if the Association\u2019s only purpose were to maintain the common areas and facilities, as the majority appears to believe, its availability position would be wrong. Nothing in the statute or the condominium declaration in this case prohibits the Association from distributing assessment funds back to its members. Indeed, the condominium law authorizes that \u201c[a]nnually\u201d common profits be distributed among the unit owners, 27 V.S.A. \u00a7 1310, and broadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>defines \u201ccommon profits\u201d to include all \u201cincome, rents, profits and revenues,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1302(8). Certainly the assessments the Association receives from the unit owners are \u201cincome\u201d and \u201crevenues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b6 29. Third, the majority\u2019s conclusion that taxpayer\u2019s interest in the Association cannot be valued does not comport with our decisions in other areas of the law. See <em>ante, </em>\u00b6 10.1 agree that the valuation is more complex than the state appraiser realized, but this does not mean that valuation is impossible. We have recognized the difficulty of valuing closely held corporations, which resemble the Association in that interests are not freely bought and sold on the open market. <em>Goodrich v. Goodrich, </em>158 Vt. 587, 590, 613 A.2d 203, 205 (1992) (recognizing that valuation of close corporations is difficult and depends on the facts of the case). This difficulty does not mean impossibility, however, and courts have devised ways of ascertaining the value of these entities. See, e.g., <em>Van Schaack v. Van Schaack Holdings, Ltd., </em>856 P.2d 15, 23 (Colo. Ct. App. 1992) (considering market value, net asset value, and reasonable future use to determine plaintiff\u2019s interest in a close corporation); <em>Greek Peak Inc. v. Armstrong, </em>697 N.Y.S.2d 375, 377 (App. Div. 1999) (including a discount for unmarketability in valuing shares of close corporations).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b6 30. The state appraiser\u2019s valuation is overly simplistic because it ignores the fact that taxpayer cannot sell the interest in the Association apart from the condominium unit and cannot immediately access even taxpayer\u2019s share of the liquid assets. The appraiser must consider these factors in reaching avalu\u00e9 for the Association interest. Moreover, the appraiser\u2019s focus on \u201cintangible\u201d property understates the extent to which the Association\u2019s assets affect the unit owner\u2019s value. On remand, I would give taxpayer and the Town the opportunity to offer evidence going to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b6 31. Finally, the majority states an alternative ground for rejecting the appraiser\u2019s decision \u2014 that taxpayer failed to provide \u201cany support for his main argument that his interest in the Association has influenced the fair market value to the extent of $12,000.\u201d I question whether this is a true alternative holding, because the rest of the opinion makes clear that no evidence taxpayer could provide could meet his burden of persuasion where, as a matter of law, the interest in the Association is taxed through the value of the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b6 32. Even if this were a true alternative holding, I would disagree with it. As the majority recognizes, our cases require the Town to initially produce evidence of fair market value. <em>Sondergeld v. Town of Hubbardton, </em>150 Vt. 565, 567, 556 A.2d 64, 66 (1988). The Town failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>to meet this burden because the value of all the comparables it put forward as evidence covered both taxable real property and untaxable personal property. Thus, the value of taxpayer\u2019s property that it presented included both taxable and untaxable property. By refusing to recognize, acknowledge, and deal with this situation, the Town never offered any evidence of the fair market value of the real property only.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b6 83. I have a similar view of the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]axpayer provided no evidence that the valuation was arbitrary or unlawful.\u201d By statute, taxpayer, as owner of the property, may testify to the value of his property. See 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1604. He testified that the combined value of the condominium and the interest in the Association was affected by the value of his interest in the Association, such that the value of the real property alone was less than its sale value, because the sale would include the interest in the Association. Taxpayer offered proof that the valuation was arbitrary or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b6 34. Although I would remand for a new hearing because we should be announcing a new standard for cases like this, I do not agree that the appraiser lacks evidence to make a decision on this record. The state appraiser is an administrative agency. We held in <em>Breault v. Town of Jericho, </em>155 Vt. 565, 567-68, 586 A.2d 1153, 1155 (1991), that the appraiser could make an adjustment to fair market value for \u201ceconomic obsolescence\u201d of the property as long as the adjustment was within the range of the evidence, and even though there was no specific evidence supporting the extent of the adjustment. Based on <em>Breault, </em>we upheld similar adjustments for vacancy rates and administrative expenses to a valuation based on income capitalization in <em>Woolen Mill Assocs. v. City of Winooski, </em>162 Vt. 461, 464, 648 A.2d 860, 863 (1994). As in <em>Breault, </em>the range of the evidence is between no adjustment, as claimed by the Town, and a large adjustment, as claimed by taxpayer. The appraiser has the discretion to choose between the extremes considering the factors discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b6 35.1 am sure that for the vast majority of condominium developments in this state, the issues in this tax appeal are irrelevant. In those cases, the condominium association will only manage the common areas and facilities and will roughly spend its assessment income on an annual basis. It will not own real property, and its value will be small in comparison to the value of the common areas and facilities and the units. The majority has constructed a rule for those cases and applied it to this very different case, where the facts and circumstances require a different result. The majority\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach produces an unjust result in this case, and I cannot join it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00b6 36.1 am authorized to state that Chief Justice Allen (Ret.) joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> In somewhat of a misdirection, taxpayer set up two types of property \u2014 tangible and intangible \u25a0\u2014 and argues about the Town\u2019s treatment of the latter. Whatever is the intended distinction, it is not one contained in property law. Indeed, as reflected in the state appraiser and majority decisions, the property types set up by taxpayer lead to more confusion than clarity in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> By local option, a town can impose a tax on certain business personal property. See 32 V.S A. \u00a7 3849. The testimony of the representative of the Town was that the Town taxes only real property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-5\"> In the concluding paragraph and in numerous places before that paragraph, the majority states that the appraiser\u2019s decision is contrary to the \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 3481. It even adds in the concluding paragraph that the decision is contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 4467. The substance of the former section is to require assessment at fair market value, a point about which there is no disagreement. How you get from that language to the conclusion in this case is the exact point of disagreement. Labeling this a \u201cplain language\u201d case is unhelpful, avoiding the issues before us rather than confronting them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> The majority opinion says that this, requirement of unavailability can be found in \u201cthe Association\u2019s governing documents,\u201d which incorporate the condominium law. The only \u201cgoverning document\u201d in the record is the declaration of the Bridges condominium and it contains no mention of the subject. Other than 27 V.S.A. \u00a7 1310, which is discussed in the text and authorizes distributions to the membership, the condominium act does not discuss the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
