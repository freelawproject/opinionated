Plaintiff Paul Christman appeals a superior court order granting defendants summary judgment on his claim of medical battery. Plaintiff claims (1) that material facts are disputed, and therefore summary judgment was inappropriate; and (2) that defendant periodontist performed a surgical procedure for which plaintiff did not consent and therefore defendant committed a battery. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b6 2. Plaintiff consulted defendant Gordon Davis, a periodontist,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to treat his gum recession and root exposure. Defendant discussed procedures to obtain root coverage including a tissue graft, and plaintiff consented to this procedure. A tissue graft involves making vertical incisions around the exposed root; the incision is made to free gingival tissue and then donor tissue from the palate is grafted onto the root. After administering a local anaesthetic, defendant began the procedure and determined that instead he would perform a flap procedure. This procedure follows the same preliminary step as the graft, but after incision, the periodontist applies a protein, Emdogain, to the gum to help it adhere to the tooth, and no graft is made. After surgery, plaintiff was surprised that he did not receive a graft. He was upset to learn later that the procedure did not achieve full results and that he would need to undergo a tissue graft.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b6 3. Plaintiff sued defendants for dental malpractice, lack of informed consent, and battery. Plaintiff eventually dismissed the malpractice and lack of informed consent claims, and proceeded solely on the battery claim. Defendants filed for summary judgment, arguing that common-law medical battery was preempted by Vermont\u2019s informed consent statute, 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1909, and plaintiff was not battered because the flap procedure was within the bounds of plaintiff\u2019s consent. In opposition to defendants\u2019 motion, plaintiff argued that the informed consent statute did not preempt a common-law claim based on battery, and defendant\u2019s failure to notify plaintiff in advance of the flap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>procedure, and obtain plaintiff\u2019s specific authorization to conduct this particular procedure, constituted a battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b6 4. The trial court ruled that the common-law battery claim was not preempted by statute because the statute was intended to define medical torts based on negligence, and battery is an intentional tort. See <em>Wilson v. Smith, </em>144 Vt. 358, 361, 477 A.2d 964, 965 (1984) (holding that intent is an element of civil battery). The court concluded, however, that defendant performed surgery on an area of the body to which plaintiff consented, and choosing to perform a less-invasive procedure did not constitute battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b6 5. On review of summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the trial court and will affirm the grant of the motion if there are no issues of material fact and the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. V.R.C.P. 56(c)(3); <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Bank of Vt., </em>166 Vt. 221, 224, 692 A.2d 1212, 1214 (1997). \u201c[T]he party opposing summary judgment is entitled to the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences.\u201d <em>Carr v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>168 Vt. 465, 476, 724 A.2d 454, 461 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b6 6. Plaintiff bases his remaining claim in battery, which is an intentional act that results in harmful contact with another. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 13 (1965) [hereinafter Restatement]; <em>Kent v. Katz, </em>146 F. Supp. 2d 450, 463 (D. Vt. 2001). In a medical context, a health care provider commits battery if the provider performs a procedure for which the patient has not given consent. <em>Duncan v. Scottsdale Med. Imaging, Ltd., </em>70 P.3d 435, 438-39, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11 (Ariz. 2003). Generally, consent to particular conduct, or \u201csubstantially the same conduct,\u201d bars recovery for a harmful invasion. Restatement \u00a7 892A(2)(b); <em>Godwin v. Danbury Eye Physicians &amp; Surgeons, P.C., </em>757 A.2d 516, 520 (Conn. 2000) (quoting Restatement \u00a7 892A(2)(b)). Plaintiff argues that he did not give consent to perform a flap procedure and therefore defendant committed battery. Defendant responds that plaintiff\u2019s claim is preempted by statute, and further that defendant acted within the scope of plaintiff\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b6 7. At the outset, it is important to distinguish between cases involving no consent and those involving a lack of informed consent. Generally, battery occurs only when a physician performs an operation for which there was no consent. If the patient does provide consent for the procedure employed, but receives inadequate disclosures of the alternatives and foreseeable risks and benefits of the alternatives, liability must be based on lack of informed consent, and a claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>medical malpractice in failing to provide the necessary disclosures. See <em>Duncan, </em>70 P.3d at 439 (describing parameters of battery and informed consent); 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1909(a)(1)-(2) (defining lack of informed consent). This difference, however, can be \u201cslippery.\u201d D. Dobbs, The Law of Torts \u00a7 103, at 243 (2001). The California Supreme Court explained the requirements of each claim well in <em>Cobbs v. Grant:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">The battery theory should be reserved for those circumstances when a doctor performs an operation to which the patient has not consented. When the patient gives permission to perform one type of treatment and the doctor performs another, the requisite element of deliberate intent to deviate from the consent given is present. However, when the patient consents to certain treatment and the doctor performs that treatment but an undisclosed inherent complication with a low probability occurs, no intentional deviation from the consent given appears; rather, the doctor in obtaining consent may have failed to meet his due care duty to disclose pertinent information. In that situation the action should be pleaded in negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">502 P.2d 1, 8 (Cal. 1972). This distinction is important for our resolution of both defendant\u2019s preemption argument and plaintiff\u2019s argument opposing summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b6 8. Defendant argues that we should not reach plaintiff\u2019s appeal issue that summary judgment was improper on the facts of this case because Vermont\u2019s informed consent statute; 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1909, preempts plaintiff\u2019s battery claim. The Legislature has enacted in Title 12, the title on court procedure, two statutes governing medical malpractice actions. The first, 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1908, defines \u201cmalpractice\u201d as \u201cprofessional medical negligence,\u201d and requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant failed to exercise the degree of care of a reasonably skilled professional under the same circumstances and that this failure caused injury that would not have otherwise occurred. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1908(1)-(3). The second, \u00a7 1909, is entitled \u201cLimitation of medical malpractice action based on lack of informed consent.\u201d It defines informed consent, outlines defenses to the claim, and also places an affirmative burden on the plaintiff to establish this claim through expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1909. Defendant argues that \u201cby asserting an informed consent claim in the guise of a battery claim\u201d plaintiff has attempted \u201cto avoid the clear and unambiguous intent of the Legislature to replace the common law with a statutory framework.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u00b6 9. The main difficulty with defendant\u2019s argument is that the statutes regulate medical malpractice actions and they are defined in \u00a7 1908 as actions involving \u201cnegligence.\u201d Plaintiff complains of an intentional tort, and not of negligence. Moreover, as we have explained the difference above, plaintiff\u2019s claim is based on lack of consent and not lack of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b6 10. In construing a statute, we presume the Legislature intended the plain, ordinary meaning of the terms. <em>Swett v. Haig\u2019s, Inc., </em>164 Vt. 1, 5, 663 A.2d 930, 932 (1995). Further, we do not find a change in common-law rules unless the intent to do so is \u201cexpressed in clear and unambiguous language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If anything, the wording of \u00a7\u00a7 1908 and 1909 clearly and expressly states the Legislature had no intent to change the availability or elements of a claim for common-law battery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b6 11. That intent is reinforced by our analysis in the one decision that discusses the doctrine of informed consent in medical malpractice actions, <em>Begin v. Richmond, </em>150 Vt. 517, 555 A.2d 363 (1988). We explained in <em>Begin </em>that the informed consent doctrine was intended to expand \u201cthe existing ways of showing medical malpractice in order to get around the often insurmountable obstacle of producing expert testimony to show the defendant was negligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 555 A.2d at 366. The statute in turn was intended to \u201cfreeze\u201d the development of the doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 555 A.2d at 367. We held, however, that the effect of the statute was not to eliminate a traditional theory of liability. <em>Id. </em>Defendant in this case asks us to find in \u00a7 1909 a legislative intent to eliminate the use of the tort of battery in cases involving medical care, exactly the opposite of the intent we found in <em>Begin. </em>We rejected defendant\u2019s theory in <em>Begin </em>and see no reason to depart from that holding here. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 555 A.2d at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b6 12. Defendant urges us to follow <em>Lugenbuhl v. Dowling, </em>701 So. 2d 447, 452-53 (La. 1997), in holding that a state implied-consent statute is intended to preempt liability on a theory of battery and require that all consent-related claims be brought as medical malpractice claims. The holding of <em>Lugenbuhl </em>is based, however, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>language of the Louisiana statute, which is quite different from the language in our statute. <em>Id. </em>at 450. Other courts have reached the same conclusion that we have with comparable statutes that use similar language. See <em>Blier v. Greene, </em>587 S.E.2d 190, 193 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003) (stating that nonconsensual assault and battery \u201ccannot be construed as medical or professional malpractice\u201d); <em>Bundrick v. Stewart, 114 P.8d </em>1204, 1208, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15 (Wash. Ct. App. 2005) (holding that medical malpractice statute did not preempt common-law battery claim). In any event, we are required to construe our statute according to our established techniques, and that construction clearly shows the statute did not preempt plaintiff\u2019s battery claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b6 13. Having determined that plaintiff\u2019s battery claim is not preempted by statute, we consider whether defendants are entitled to summary judgment in this case, as the superior court held. In analyzing this question, we note the parties substantially disagreed as to what disclosures defendant made to plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s theory is, as he expressed in his affidavit, that defendant \u201cdid not discuss with me any other or different procedure\u201d than the tissue graft procedure and plaintiff consented only to the tissue graft procedure. Defendant disputes this recitation of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b6 14. Based on defendant\u2019s statement -of undisputed facts and plaintiff\u2019s response to the statement, the parties are in agreement on certain key factual issues. In defendant\u2019s first statement of undisputed material facts, defendant stated that \u201c[t]he coronally repositioned flap is a less invasive procedure,\u201d and plaintiff did not dispute that statement. In fact, plaintiff stated in his affidavit that he would not have consented to the flap procedure \u201cbecause I was more interested in the likelihood of a successful outcome than I was in the degree of invasiveness of the procedure.\u201d In his second statement of undisputed material facts, defendant stated \u201c[a] periodontist must perform the steps of a flap procedure in order to determine whether there is sufficient tissue of adequate quality to perform the graft.\u201d Although plaintiff answered that the statement \u201cdoes not concern the treatment to which Plaintiff gave his consent,\u201d he added that he didn\u2019t dispute the defendant\u2019s statement \u201c[a]s a matter of general periodontics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b6 15.-Based on the undisputed facts in the record, plaintiff\u2019s claim is that defendant did less than he promised \u2014 that is, defendant did not go further and do the tissue graft \u2014 and that was why the procedure was unsuccessful. We agree with the trial court that plaintiff does not have a battery claim and conclude that summary judgment was properly granted for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u00b6 16. The central issue is whether plaintiff consented to the procedure that was performed so that he cannot prove an essential element of battery. Effective consent must be \u201cto the particular conduct, or to substantially the same conduct.\u201d Restatement \u00a7892A(2)(b). Consequently, \u201c[w]here a doctor obtains consent of the patient to perform one type of treatment and subsequently performs a substantially different treatment for which consent was not obtained, there is a clear case of battery.\u201d <em>Cobbs, </em>502 P.2d at 7; see <em>Perin v. Hayne, </em>210 N.W.2d 609, 618 (Iowa 1973) (accepting <em>Cobbs </em>analysis and noting that battery occurs when there is a \u201csubstantial difference\u201d between the surgery for which plaintiff granted consent and that performed). In determining whether plaintiff gave adequate consent, we must focus on the \u201cconduct or procedure to be performed, not its consequences.\u201d <em>Godwin, 757 </em>A.2d at 520. Consistent with our above discussion differentiating claims based on lack of consent from those based on lack of informed consent, consent is valid to bar a battery claim even if it was induced by a lack of necessary disclosure of information. See Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 103, at 242 (\u201cIf the surgeon\u2019s fault is that he failed to provide information that should have been provided, the plaintiff\u2019s consent holds good to bar the battery claim.\u201d). As stated, where a plaintiff consents after inadequate necessary disclosures, the claim should be one of medical malpractice under the lack-of-informedconsent line of cases. See <em>Duncan, </em>70 P.3d at 439, \u00b6 13 (adopting <em>Cobbs </em>and reasoning that cases \u201cinvolving the doctor\u2019s obligation to provide information\u201d must be brought as malpractice claims, not battery claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b6 17. In essence, this is a case in which the medical professional did a less-extensive operation than that to which the patient consented, taking steps the professional would have taken in the more extensive operation. Under the elements of battery described above, courts have dismissed medical battery claims where a surgeon chooses to perform a less-extensive operation than that discussed with the patient. See <em>Conte v. Girard Orthopaedic Surgeons Med. Group, Inc., </em>132 Cal. Rptr. 2d 855, 860-61 (Ct. App. 2003) (concluding that where doctor decided during surgery not to repair patient\u2019s shoulder, no battery occurred because he did less than he was authorized to do); <em>Moser v. Stallings, </em>387 N.W.2d 599, 602 (Iowa 1986) (affirming directed verdict for defendant on medical battery where plaintiff alleged that doctor failed to perform a chin implant during plastic surgery). In doing so, one court explained: \u201cWe see no policy reason to extend the law of battery to these circumstances where the treatment was within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>bounds of [the patient\u2019s] consent____If doctors were subject to liability for battery in such situations, it would deter them from freely exercising their medical judgment.\u201d <em>Conte, </em>132 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 860-61. We agree with the rationale of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b6 18. In holding that plaintiff has no battery claim, we are not determining whether plaintiff would have had a remedy if he could have appropriately proven the allegations in his complaint. Although we have held that defendant acted within plaintiff\u2019s consent such that plaintiff has no battery claim, we recognize that plaintiff claimed that his consent was induced by defendant\u2019s representation that he would perform the tissue graft procedure and that defendant performed the flap procedure \u201cwithout even discussing it\u201d with him. To the extent plaintiff had an actionable claim, it fell within the lack-of-informed-consent line of cases. Because plaintiff dismissed that claim we do not, however, address its merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b6 19. Finally, we address plaintiff\u2019s claims that disputed issues of material fact and procedural deficiencies prevent us from affirming the summary judgment decision. As we state above, we agree that material issues of disputed fact would prevent summary judgment on whether defendant disclosed the flap procedure as an alternative to the tissue graft procedure. We believe, however, that no disputed issues of material fact exist as to whether plaintiff\u2019s consent covered the flap procedure in light of plaintiff\u2019s concession that the elements of the flap procedure were necessary to the tissue graft procedure plaintiff sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b6 20. Plaintiff argues that we nonetheless cannot affirm the summary judgment for defendant because defendant never claimed that he acted within the scope of plaintiff\u2019s consent when he presented his summary judgment motion below. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is accurate to a point. Defendant did not raise the scope of plaintiff\u2019s consent in his motion or memorandum, but submitted facts that supported a consent argument. As a result, plaintiff responded to those facts and stated in his memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The extent of the consent Defendant Davis secured from Plaintiff is a disputed issue of fact, see accompanying affidavit, and Defendants\u2019 argument based on what they contend Plaintiff consented to cannot be given any consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Apparently, plaintiff viewed the basis of defendant\u2019s motion as defendant\u2019s reliance upon plaintiff\u2019s consent for the procedure. The trial court found the issue was adequately joined and grounded its decision on plaintiff\u2019s consent for defendant\u2019s action. In his brief to this Court, plaintiff did not argue that the superior court improperly went beyond the scope of the motion with its decision. Instead, plaintiff raised that argument for the first time in his reply brief in response to defendant\u2019s argument that the record supported the superior court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b6 21. We conclude that the issue of the scope of plaintiff\u2019s consent was properly before the superior court even if placed there by plaintiff. In any event, we need not consider an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief. See <em>Robertson v. Mylan Labs., Inc., </em>2004 VT 15, \u00b6 1 n.2, 176 Vt. 356, 848 A.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> Although the complaint is somewhat vague, it appears to allege that defendant Davis practices dentistry as part of Associates in Periodontics, PLC, which is also named as a defendant. The complaint states that defendant Associates \u201cis liable for all the acts and omissions of Defendant Davis,\u201d apparently on a theory of vicarious liability because no independent acts of Associates are alleged. When we refer in the text to \u201cdefendant,\u201d the reference is to Dr. Davis. Where the reference is plural, it includes defendant Associates in Periodontics, PLC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> Although of lesser importance, we view it as significant that these sections appear in chapter 81, entitled \u201cConduct of Trial,\u201d of Title 12, entitled \u201cCourt Procedure.\u201d This indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide rules on burdens of proof and evidentiary requirements for existing claims, rather than to wholly displace substantive common-law theories of medical tort. See <em>Greenmoss Builders, Inc. v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., </em>149 Vt. 365, 369-70, 543 A.2d 1320, 1323-24 (1988) (considering whole statute, subject matter, and effects and consequences in its interpretation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> Plaintiff\u2019s claim for lack of informed consent would be based on the same transaction as the battery claim. <em>Faulkner v. Caledonia County Fair Ass\u2019n, </em>2004 VT 123, \u00b6 13, 178 Vt. 51, 869 A.2d 103 (noting that \u2018\u201cwhere one act causes a number of harms to, or invades a number of different interests of the same person, there is still but one transaction\u2019\u201d) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24 cmt. c (1982)). Thus, plaintiff would be barred by claim preclusion from bringing a future claim for lack of informed consent arising out of this incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
