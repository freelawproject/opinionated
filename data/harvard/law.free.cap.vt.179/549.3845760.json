Lakeisha Jackson and Brenda Edwards appeal from a family court order that awarded Thomas Hendricks legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities for Elijah Hendricks. Appellants contend that: (1) the Vermont family court lacks jurisdiction over this matter because the Florida courts are a more appropriate forum; and (2) even if it has jurisdiction, the family court has no authority to terminate Brenda Edwards\u2019 guardianship of the child, which was instituted by order of the Connecticut probate court. We reject these arguments and affirm the family court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">\u00b6 2. The family court made the following findings. Lakeisha Jackson gave birth to Elijah in February 1997. During the first year of the child\u2019s life, Jackson lived with her mother, Brenda Edwards, in Connecticut. In February 1998, Jackson decided to enlist in the Navy, and the Connecticut probate court awarded Edwards legal guardianship of Elijah with Jackson\u2019s agreement. At that time, the Connecticut court stated that it had made no determination regarding the rights of Thomas Hendricks \u2014 who claimed to be Elijah\u2019s father and opposed the guardianship \u2014 because Hendricks had not established paternity. In July 1999, however, guardian and mother sought an order in the Vermont family court obligating Hendricks, a resident of Vermont, to pay child support to guardian. As part of those proceedings, mother and guardian acknowledged Hendricks\u2019 paternity, and the court issued orders establishing Hendricks\u2019 parentage and requiring him to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">\u00b6 3. In August 2002, guardian moved to Florida and left Elijah with mother, who was stationed in Virginia. In November of that year, the Navy reassigned mother to Florida, and Elijah lived with her in Florida for the next month. In December, mother learned that she was scheduled for sea duty, and guardian was unable to care for Elijah as she settled into a new home and job. Given these circumstances, guardian and mother decided to ask father to take.care of Eljjah for the remainder of the school year. Father picked up Elijah on December 31, 2002, and took him to his home in Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u00b6 4. On January 9, 2003, father filed a motion in the Vermont family court seeking sole legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities for Elijah. In his supporting affidavit, father acknowledged that Elijah had been with him for only a few days, and he recounted the boy\u2019s recent movement from Virginia to Florida. He went on to state that mother was shipping out with the Navy and said that she agreed Elijah should live with him. Father advised the court that he needed a custody order to enroll Elijah in school, but he made no mention of Edwards\u2019 role as Elijah\u2019s legal guardian. He simultaneously moved the court to modify the existing child support order. On January 22, the court awarded father temporary legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities, and scheduled a case manager\u2019s conference for March 11. At the conference, the case manager issued an entry stating: \u201cPlaintiff shall file objection within 30 days of service of this order if she requests hearing. If no objection filed, order shall become final.\u201d On May 27, the order became final. At some point after mother learned of father\u2019s intentions, she contacted the Florida courts and was told she needed to pursue a remedy in Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b6 5. On August 1, guardian filed a motion to modify or reconsider the order awarding father legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities. She argued that the Vermont family court did not have jurisdiction to determine Elijah\u2019s custody because he had not lived in the state for six months prior to father\u2019s motion. She also claimed that father was refusing to allow mother to have contact with Elijah, and expressed concerns about father\u2019s ability to care for the child. Appellants did not ask the court to award mother parental rights and responsibilities, but instead sought to reestablish Edwards\u2019 guardianship of Elijah. The court scheduled evidentiary hearings for December 3, 2003 and February 4, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u00b6 6. After the hearings, the court found that mother and guardian had not received written notice of father\u2019s motions until May 24, 2003 \u2014 just three days before the custody order became final. The court noted that mother participated by telephone in the case manager\u2019s conference of March 11, but found that mother was not aware that father was in the process of seeking sole legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities. On May 20, guardian participated by telephone in a second case manager\u2019s conference, during which she learned of father\u2019s intentions for the first time. Guardian and mother then received written notice on May 24. Given the lack of notice, and father\u2019s failure to identify guardian upon filing his motion, the court decided to treat its order granting father custody as temporary, and treated guardian\u2019s later motions as objections to that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u00b6 7. The court then concluded that it had jurisdiction to modify parental rights and responsibilities under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 1032(a)(4), and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (1994 &amp; Supp. 2005). The court recognized that Vermont was not Elijah\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d at the time father filed his motion, but it found that, due to mother\u2019s recent relocations, Elijah did not have a home state as defined in the UCCJA. See 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 1031(5) (defining child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d as the one in which the child, immediately preceding the relevant time period, lived with his parents, a parent, or a person acting as a parent, for at least six consecutive months). Given these circumstances, the court found that it was in Elijah\u2019s best interest for it to assume jurisdiction pursuant to 15 V.S.A \u00a7 1032(a)(4). It further found that its assumption of jurisdiction was consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>with \u00a7 1738A(c) of the PKPA. The court then made findings of fact and reviewed Elijah\u2019s circumstances relative to the factors that the Legislature has established for custody determinations, see 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b), and awarded father legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\u00b6 8. Appellants argue that the Vermont court lacked jurisdiction to terminate the Connecticut order that appointed Brenda Edwards as Elijah\u2019s legal guardian. They maintain that only a Connecticut probate court has that authority. According to appellants, even if this Court concludes that the Vermont court did have jurisdiction to terminate the guardianship order, then Florida, rather than Vermont, was the more appropriate forum for any custody determination because the child\u2019s mother and guardian resided there. Appellants maintain that there is insufficient evidence to support the family court\u2019s finding that Florida had declined jurisdiction over the case. As discussed below, we find these arguments without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u00b6 9. As this case involves the Vermont family court\u2019s modification of an existing child custody decree \u2014 the Connecticut order that awarded legal guardianship of Elijah to Edwards \u2014 we turn first to the PKPA<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> See <em>Matthews v. Riley, </em>162 Vt. 401, 404, 649 A.2d 231, 235 (1994) (\u201cJurisdiction over interstate enforcement and modification of child custody decrees is governed by the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A\u201d). With certain exceptions, a state must enforce the custody orders of other states when they are made consistently with the requirements of the PKPA 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a). A state may modify such orders if \u201c(1) it has jurisdiction to make such a child custody determination; and (2) the court of the other State no longer has jurisdiction, or it has declined to exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f)(l)~(2). The UCCJA similarly provides that the Vermont family court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>may modify the order of another state when \u201c(1) it appears ... that the court which rendered the decree does not now have jurisdiction under jurisdictional prerequisites substantially in accordance with [the UCCJA] or has declined to assume jurisdiction to modify the decree; and (2) the court of this state has jurisdiction.\u201d 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 1042(a)(l)-(2). Thus, to determine if the Vermont family court had the authority to modify the Connecticut guardianship order, we must first examine if the Vermont family court had jurisdiction over this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b6 10. Under the UCCJA, the Vermont family court has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree if: (1) Vermont is the child\u2019s home state; (2) it is in the child\u2019s best interests for Vermont to assume jurisdiction because the child and his parents, or the child and one of the contestants, have a significant connection to the state and there is substantial evidence available in this state concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or (3) if the child is physically present in the state and he or she has been abandoned or is in need of emergency assistance due to neglect or abuse. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1032(a)(l)-(3). The Vermont family court also has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">it appears that no other state would have jurisdiction under prerequisites substantially in accordance with subdivisions (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, or another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that [Vermont] is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child, and it is in the best interest of the child that this court assume jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1032(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\u00b6 11. In this ease, the family court found that Elijah did not have a home state under 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 1031(5) at the time that father filed his motion. The court also found that Florida had apparently relinquished any claim of jurisdiction over the case. Appellants contend that the evidence does not support this latter finding. We need not resolve this dispute to decide this case because it is apparent from the record that Florida was not the child\u2019s home state. At the time that father filed his motion, Elijah and his mother had spent just over a month in Florida. Prior to that time, Elijah had resided in Virginia for three months, and, before that, he had lived in Connecticut for five years. No Florida court had exercised jurisdiction over any part of Elijah\u2019s case, and Elijah was not present in Florida. Moreover, as the family court found, no party asserted that Connecticut should have taken jurisdiction of this case, and, indeed, no party resided in Connecticut at the time of the filing. Thus, although the family court erred in finding that Florida could have exercised jurisdiction, the Vermont court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was nonetheless appropriate under 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 1032(a)(4) because no other state had jurisdiction over Elijah, and it was in the child\u2019s best interests for Vermont to assume jurisdiction. See 1 A Haralambie, Handling Child Custody, Abuse and Adoption Cases \u00a7 2.06, at 22 (2d ed. 1993) (\u201cThe most typical circumstances under which a state exercises this type of jurisdiction is where the parties have moved frequently and have recently moved to different states.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\u00b6 12. Accordingly, the Vermont family court also had jurisdiction to modify the Connecticut custody order, which we assume arguendo was issued in compliance with the requirements of the PKPA. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f) (authorizing court to modify custody order made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>court of another state). Under the PKPA, Connecticut no longer had jurisdiction over this matter. Connecticut was not the child\u2019s home state, none of the parties resided there, and nothing in the record suggested that, at the time of the filing, the parties had a \u201csignificant connection\u201d to that state or that substantial evidence was available in that state concerning Elijah\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1738A(c), (f)(2). We reject appellants\u2019 assertion that Connecticut maintains \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d by virtue of the guardianship order. To establish \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d under the PKPA based on the issuance of a custody order, a state must meet the jurisdictional criteria described in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c), and the child or one of the contestants must reside in the state. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(d). As discussed above, none of these criteria is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">\u00b6 13. We addressed an analogous situation in <em>In re Cifarelli, </em>158 Vt. 249, 611 A.2d 394 (1992). In that case, a child, who had been living in Vermont, was placed in temporary state custody after her parents died. The child\u2019s maternal grandmother obtained a guardianship appointment from a Vermont probate court, and returned with the child to her home in Bermuda, where she commenced adoption proceedings. During this time, the child\u2019s paternal grandmother also filed a guardianship petition in Vermont probate court. The maternal grandmother moved to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Vermont probate court concluded that the UCCJA did not apply, and it issued several orders relating to custody and visitation. On appeal, the paternal grandmother conceded that the UCCJA applied and that Bermuda was a \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of the Act, but she asserted that Vermont had continuing jurisdiction by virtue of the guardianship order. We rejected this argument. We reasoned that although the probate court had jurisdiction to issue the initial guardianship petition under 14 V.S.A. \u00a7 2645(1) and under the UCCJA, 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 1032(a)(3), the emergency guardianship order ceased to have any effect once its purpose was accomplished. <em>In re Cifarelli, </em>158 Vt. at 252, 611 A.2d at 396. At that point, we stated, \u201c[\u00bfjurisdiction to determine future custody and visitation issues was no longer in any Vermont court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u00b6 14. As we explained in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">The UCCJA is intended to eliminate the adverse consequences of multi-jurisdictional disputes over custody and visitation of children. The Act seeks to avoid shifting jurisdiction over children from state to state by requiring that the custody decree be \u201crendered in that state which can best decide the case in the interest of the child.\u201d The Act achieves this goal by encouraging courts to communicate with one another and by limiting custody jurisdiction to a child\u2019s home state or, if no home state exists, to the state with the strongest contacts with the child and the child\u2019s family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 253, 611 A.2d at 396-97 (citation omitted). We concluded that Vermont could not retain continuing jurisdiction under the UCCJA because Vermont was not the child\u2019s \u201chome state,\u201d and, in fact, the child had no home state. <em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 611 A.2d at 397. No other UCCJA factors supported continuing Vermont jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 254-55, 611 A.2d at 397-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">\u00b6 15. Significantly, the paternal grandmother argued that Vermont Rule of Probate Procedure 3(d), which provides that \u201ca probate proceeding involving a guardianship shall ... continue until the guardianship is closed,\u201d as well as other sources that outlined basic jurisdictional principles, mandated that Vermont as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>sume jurisdiction over the custody determination. We rejected this argument, finding that it disregarded the UCCJA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">which requires, regardless of jurisdictional rules to the contrary, that the interests of a child involved in a multi-jurisdictional custody dispute are to be addressed in the forum with the strongest ties to the child either by virtue of home state jurisdiction, or if no home state exists, according to the other UCCJA factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 255-56, 611 A.2d at 398. We similarly rejected the argument that Vermont retained jurisdiction because it was the state in which the guardianship petitions had been originally filed. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 611 A.2d at 398 (citing <em>Kioukis v. Kioukis, </em>440 A.2d 894, 897-98 (Conn. 1981) (\u201cThe first state\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction ... does not continue indefinitely. At some point the child\u2019s connections with the first state become too tenuous to satisfy the demands of [the UCCJA].\u201d)). As we explained, given the ample evidence that existed in Bermuda concerning the child\u2019s best interests, Vermont case law could not be interpreted \u201cto justify a blind application of the principle that continuing jurisdiction exists merely because Vermont was the state that was the \u2018first in time.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 611 A.2d at 398-99 (citing <em>L.F. </em>v. <em>G.W.F., </em>443 A.2d 751, 754 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1982) (\u201c[0]ur common sense is offended by the concept that simply because a case is originally started in this State, all subsequent proceedings between the parties involving the original subject matter should be regarded as commenced here.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u00b6 16. We are presented with the same situation here, albeit reversed. Connecticut does not retain jurisdiction forever over all matters concerning these parties. Its connection to the child has become too attenuated, and it is not in the child\u2019s best interests for that state to assume jurisdiction of this case. See <em>Columb v. Columb, </em>161 Vt. 103, 112, 633 A.2d 689, 694 (1993) (recognizing that if child moves from place to place, proper forum to determine custody will change as moves are made, and the fact that the Vermont court did not have jurisdiction at one time should not foreclose that court from taking it when circumstances change; \u201c[i]ndeed, failure to take jurisdiction will undermine the statutory purpose to adjudicate a custody dispute in the court best suited to do so.\u201d); see also Commissioner\u2019s Note, Unif. Child Custody Jurisdiction Act \u00a7 14, 9 U.L.A. 580 (1999) (explaining that the fact that court had previously considered a case may be one factor favoring its continued jurisdiction but if all the persons involved have moved away or contact with the state has otherwise become slight, modification jurisdiction shifts elsewhere). Under the PKPA, and consistent with the purposes of that Act and the UCCJA Vermont had jurisdiction to modify the Connecticut order.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u00b6 17. Having established that the family court had jurisdiction, we turn to its discretionary decision to modify the voluntary guardianship order and grant father custody of Elijah. Although the pre-existing order was a guardianship order, the family court, rather than the probate court, had jurisdiction over this matter. See 4 V.S.A. \u00a7 454(7) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and dispose of ... [a]ll uniform child custody proceedings filed pursuant to chapter 19 of Title 15.\u201d). In <em>Boisvert v. Harrington, </em>173 Vt. 285, 288, 796 A.2d 1102, 1105 (2002), we acknowledged that no specific statute provides guidance for termination of a guardianship created under 14 V.SA. \u00a7 2654(4). We concluded, however, that such a termination requires a find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ing, after a hearing, that the circumstances which precipitated the transfer of custody no longer pertain. <em>Boisvert, </em>173 Vt. at 289, 796 A.2d at 1106. As with all custody determinations, the termination of a guardianship order must be in a child\u2019s best interests, and the law presumes that those interests are best served by parental custody. <em>Id. </em>at 291, 796 A.2d at 1107. The same considerations must apply when the family court determines whether to terminate a guardianship order instituted in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u00b6 18. In this case, the family court made extensive findings regarding Elijah\u2019s best interests relative to the factors identified in 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b). While it recognized that both father and guardian could provide a safe and supportive home, the court found that Elijah had developed strong relationships in Vermont, and it further acknowledged the presumption in favor of parental custody. Given these findings, the court awarded father legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities, but granted mother and guardian liberal visitation rights. The family court has broad discretion in determining a child\u2019s best interests and rendering a custody determination, <em>Payrits v. Payrits, </em>171 Vt. 50, 52-53, 757 A.2d 469, 472 (2000), and we find no abuse of discretion here. We therefore affirm the family court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> We consider the Connecticut guardianship order to be a \u201ccustody determination\u201d within the meaning of the PKPA. The PKPA defines a \u201ccustody determination\u201d as \u201ca judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the custody of a child, and includes permanent and temporary orders, and initial orders and modifications,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(b)(3), and a \u201cmodification\u201d as \u201ca custody or visitation determination which modifies, replaces, supersedes, or otherwise is made subsequent to, a prior custody or visitation determination concerning the same child, whether made by the same court or not,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1738A(b)(5).
