Defendant Pamela Putvain appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to expunge her record after successful completion of a deferred sentence. Defendant claims that since she fulfilled the terms of probation and of the deferred sentence agreement, her record should be expunged upon discharge under 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7041(b). She argues that the district court erred in denying her motion and in requiring an additional two-year \u201cgood behavior\u201d period under 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5538 before allowing expungement. The State concurs with defendant\u2019s position on appeal. Because the district court erred in interpreting \u00a7 7041(b) to require a two-year waiting period before expungement, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">\u00b6 2. Defendant pled guilty to domestic assault on April 6,2004, in exchange for a seven-month deferred sentence. Defendant fulfilled the terms of her deferred sentence agreement, and the district court granted her petition for discharge from probation on November 11, 2004. On November 19, 2004, defendant filed a motion to expunge her record under 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7041(b).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion, finding that \u201csection 7041 requires a 2 year \u2018good behavior\u2019 period before the probationer can receive an expungement, since it adopts the requirements of an application and wait found in 33 V.S.A. \u00a75538.\u201d Defendant filed a petition for reconsideration of her request to expunge on January 25, 2005. The district court denied the petition on January 31, 2005, but shortened the waiting period. Defendant appeals from this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">\u00b6 3. A deferred sentence is \u201cnot a sentence at all, but rather a postponement of sentence that offers the defendant an opportunity to have an adjudication of guilt expunged.\u201d <em>State v. Pierce, </em>163 Vt. 192, 196, 657 A.2d 192, 195 (1995). The deferred sentence statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-14\">Upon fulfillment of the terms of probation and of the deferred sentence agreement, the court shall strike the adjudication of guilt and discharge the respondent. Upon discharge the record of the criminal proceedings shall be expunged <em>as if an application pursuant to section 5538 of Title S3 had been granted </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7041(b) (emphasis added). The issue is whether expungement is automatic upon defendant\u2019s discharge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>whether the eligibility requirements of 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5538(a) for the sealing of records of a juvenile offender must be met before the record can be expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\u00b6 4. When interpreting a statute our goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>State v. Baron, </em>2004 VT 20, \u00b6 6, 176 Vt. 314, 848 A.2d 275. We first look at the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute. <em>Id. </em>The language of \u00a7 7041(b) states that the record shall be expunged \u201cas if an application pursuant to section 5538 of Title 33 had been granted.\u201d Section 5538 addresses sealing the records of juvenile offenders. Section 5538(a) lists the criteria for granting an application to seal the records, including that the court must find that \u201c[t]wo years have elapsed since the final discharge of the person.\u201d 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5538(a)(1). The later subsections of \u00a7 5538, particularly subsections (c) and (d), describe how the expungement is implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\u00b6 5. The meaning of \u00a7 7041(b) is plain in that it incorporates the implementation provisions of 33 V.S.A. \u00a7 5538, but not the eligibility provisions. The eligibility standards are contained entirely within \u00a7 7041(b) and include no waiting period.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\u00b6 6. In its denial of defendant\u2019s motion, the district court explained that as a matter of public policy, first-time juvenile offenders should not have to wait two years for expungement while deferred-sentence probationers, often not first-time offenders, obtain automatic ex-pungement of their convictions. Whatever its merits, the policy choice has clearly been made to the contrary by the Legislature as reflected in the wording of the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-16\"> Effective July 1, 2005, 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7041(b) was amended so that the relevant language of \u00a7 7041(b) now falls under \u00a7 7041(d), in nearly identical form. 2005, No. 63, \u00a7 9. We will refer to the statute in effect at the time of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
